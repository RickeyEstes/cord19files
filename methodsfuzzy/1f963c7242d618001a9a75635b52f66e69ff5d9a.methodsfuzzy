a-Lactalbumin (a-LA) is one of the major milk proteins present in almost all mammalian milks. It interacts with b-1,4-UDP-galactosyl transferase (UDPgal) to modify substrate specificity of this enzyme, virtually creating a unique binding site for glucose and leading to the synthesis of lactose (Vilotte, 2002) . The preharvest methodologies of reducing lactose involve either the introduction of b-galactosidase enzyme into milk via mammary gland-specific expression or the removal of a-LA and gene ''knockout'' methodologies. Although these successful approaches provide valuable tools to address milk physiology, they reduce the overall sugar content of the milk, resulting in highly viscous milk. Studies on mice have revealed that reduction of lactose via a-LA deletion was inappropriate because it impaired milk volume regulation. The milk of such mice was highly viscous with very high protein (88%) and fat (60%), no a-LA and no lactose (Karatzas and Turner, 1997) . Knocking out the UDP-gal gene in mice also produced milk with no lactose but very high viscosity (Vilotte, 2002) . An alternative to produce low-lactose milk is overexpression of b-galactosidase in milk. However, the monosachharides produced within the formed milk increases the osmotic pressure within the alveolar lumen, thereby drawing more water and resulting in further dilution of other milk components (Bremel et al., 1989) . Jost et al. (1999) explained an in vivo technique for low-lactose milk production. They generated transgenic mice that selectively produced a biologically active b-galactosidase in their milk. In these transgenic mice, the lactose content of the milk is at least halved, even though the b-galactosidase expression levels were relatively low. The authors claim that it is likely that at least twofold greater levels of lactose reduction could be achieved. In contrast to the previous studies by Bremel et al. (1989) and Karatzas and Turner (1997) , these experiments led to reduction in the lactose content while retaining most of the monosaccharide content of the milk. b-galactosidase synthesis in the mammary gland caused a significant decrease in milk lactose (50-85%) without obvious changes in fat and protein concentrations. It thus helped to maintain a balanced nutrient supply as reflected in the similar growth curve reared on transgenic or control milk. It is likely that transgenic low-lactose milk production could offer a more balanced approach to managing lactose intolerance than postharvest or lactose-replacement products. It is also technically feasible to produce transgenic livestock carrying this transgene and probably similar or better expression levels could be achieved. However, more detailed analysis on several aspects such as the effect of splitting the lactose into glucose and galactose on the osmotic balance in the milk in the gut after ingestion and also the economic viability of the technology need to be investigated (Whitelaw, 1999) .
