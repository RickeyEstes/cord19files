Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  Protein production and purification Human RSV L protein (strain A2) with an N-terminal dual StrepTag and RSV P protein (strain A2) with a C-terminal 6x His-tag were coexpressed in Sf9 insect cells using pFASTbac Dual transfer vector (Life Technologies). The Sf9 cells expressing the L-P polymerase complex were lysed by two passes through a microfluidizer in Strep Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), pH 8.0) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and 1 U/mL Benzonase (EMD Millipore). After clarification by high-speed centrifugation, the cell lysate was loaded onto a Strep-Tactin column (QIAGEN), and the bound protein was eluted using 10 mM desthiobiotin in Strep Buffer A. The eluted L-P complex was pooled and diluted with an equal volume of heparin buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.0), and was further purified using a heparin column (GE Healthcare). The L-P complex was eluted from the heparin column using a NaCl gradient to a final concentration of 500 mM. The protein was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter, then loaded on to a size-exclusion column (Superpose 6 Increase 10/300, GE healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.0. The fractions near the maximum height of the peak were combined, flash-frozen, and stored at Ã€80 C.
