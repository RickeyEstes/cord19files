A host of new methods have been developed that enhance the utility of animal models, providing information that was previously unavailable. Two of these will be noted briefly: systems biology and imaging. The host response consists of a series of antiviral and immune programs. These orchestrated molecular events, captured through transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, can provide heat maps that capture large groups of data to elucidate the host response to infection. Influenza provides an example; a comparative cross-species transcriptomic analysis found that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus elicits differential expression of proinflammatory genes in the lung following infection of nonhuman primates, mice, and pigs (Go et al., 2012) . When these inflammatory responses in the lung are overly exuberant, they may endanger the host, as shown in a comparison of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infections (H5N1 and 1918 strains) with influenza viruses of lower virulence (Tisoncik et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2014) . Bioimaging is undergoing a renaissance through a panoply of new methods. For instance, it is possible to introduce a fluorescent genetic label into a virus that permits its visualization during infection of a living animal (Golding and Zaitseva, 2014) . Repeated imaging of a single animal during the course of infection provides a dynamic view of virus replication and dissemination. Counterpart studies of T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages capture the movements and interaction of cells that participate in the innate and adaptive immune responses . Furthermore, new methods for visualizing living or fixed tissues can be used to construct three-dimensional views of tissues whose architecture is preserved.
