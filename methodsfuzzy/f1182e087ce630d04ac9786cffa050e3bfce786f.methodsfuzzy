Sample size (n) was calculated using the program EPI-INFO (Dean et al., 1990) , according to the next formula: where z--1.96; P is population; p is estimated prevalence; D is precision level; N is sample for a infinite population. The sample size to detect diseased animals was calculated with the same formula using a precision level to detect at least one positive serum, with a 95% confidence level. The relationship between both animal and farm prevalences and the sow-herd strata and quarters of the year were calculated using the Z 2 analysis with Yates correction. The confidence intervals for the prevalences were calculated according to the formula (Larson, 1988) : where x is prevalence; z= 1.96; p is limit of probability; n is sample size.
