Two key steps are the backbone of the IRES elements search system (IRSS): 1) RNA folding and 2) comparison. RNAL fold program [35] is the first step and functions to predict the RNA secondary structure by minimum free energy method. The second step is RNA secondary structure comparison which matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [36] . In our designed IRSS, primary RNA sequences inputted into search flowchart (see Figure 1 ) with individual length parameter (L) is transferred as raw RNA sequences into RNAL fold input format by "UTR2SQ.pl" [see Additional file 2] and the "utr_dp.pl" program [see Additional file 3]. The utr_dp.pl is the major control batch program to link each stage of IRSS. The output data of RNAL fold is then transformed into RNA Align format by B2RA.pl program [see Additional file 4]. The results of RNA Align software will be displayed as two files: Aligned structure and Alignment score files. Two statistical programs, DIST.R and sort.R [see Additional file 5 and Additional file 6], analyze those alignment scores and calculate the score distribution [37] . For RNA view, B2CT.pl [see Additional file 7] changes the predicted RNA secondary structure into "connect file format" (*.ct) which will read by RnaViz [38] to display in screen and print. The essential prerequisite step of this analysis is the calculation of secondary structure's stability by folding sub-sequences of length, L. The length of sequence (L) fragments is assigned for window sizes, which the window slides along the target sequences. The length size is a varied factor in IRES predic-tion. In this study, the L parameter of RNAL fold program was set as L = 400, 250 or 100. All three length parameters input into our IRSS can predict all possible RNA secondary structures. The algorithms of RNA Align software consider all RNA structures that can be cataloged as basematch, base-mismatch, base-deletion, arc-match, arcbreaking, arc-altering and arc-removed [36] . Each RNA alignment is measured through the similarities between two RNA structure sequences as the 'edit distance', which aims on the calculation of transforming/editing one sequence into the other. Nucleotide insertion, deletion and substitution are three transforming types of edit distance. The score of the alignment between RNA structures is dependent to the summation of costs that were computed by 'edit distance' [36] . The known IRES elements were selected as standard structures for our IRSS. In "RNA family database of alignments and common motifs" (Rfam, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/ Software/Rfam/) [34, 39] , the known RNA structures including IRES are qualified in our system. There are twelve IRES models built upon consensus sequences in Rfam database. Those models are based on the similar consensus secondary sequences that are predicted by PFOLD program [40] . Moreover, those IRES consensus secondary sequences are the major templates for RNA alignment software such as RNAL fold program. In IRSS, if RNAL fold program predicted IRES elements that cannot match IRES models of Rfam or fetch at least two homolog IRESs from related species, those input data will be discarded.
