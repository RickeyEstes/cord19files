The power calculation was based upon length of stay, which had previously been observed to be 3.2 days on the study wards. Rapid pathogen identification has been associated with a reduction of mean hospital length of stay, in one study from 11.9 days to 9.3 days (approx. 20%) (p = 0.1) [17] . For a 20% reduction in length of stay (LOS) in the intervention arm, sample size calculations indicated that sample sizes of 1131 cases in each arm were required to achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 0.6 between the null hypothesis that both group means are 3.2 days (76.8 h, based upon data collected from the study wards) and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 2.6 days (62.4 h) with known group standard deviations of 5.2 and 5.2 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. The primary outcome was analysed with a linear regression model (after log-transformation of length of stay data) according to a pre-specified analysis plan with an individual patient taken as the unit of analysis. Secondary outcomes were analysed using linear regression models for continuous outcome data, logistic regression for binary outcomes, and negative binomial regression for count outcome data. For all these patient-related outcomes we adjusted for multiple pre-specified potential confounders (age, sex, Charlson score, EWS, WCC, CRP). Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to test for differences between the arms in categorical antibiotic prescribing decisions with p-values calculated by 10,000 Monte Carlo replicates (to avoid problems associated with small cell counts associated with the usual asymptotic p-values). A t-test was used to compare the time to test between the two arms. A planned subgroup analysis was performed as above for primary and secondary outcomes excluding patients who had infection proven elsewhere after enrolment as it is plausible that a respiratory pathogen POC result would not alter LOS or antibiotic use when the patient had another infective diagnosis made. Analysis was conducted in R [18] . Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data using the package mice [19] .
