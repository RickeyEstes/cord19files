SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli [27] . Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained in 10% acetic acid before being dried. For the quantification of the proteolytic activity of the proteins, gels were scanned and analyzed by densitometry using the Tina 2.0 program. Care was taken not to overload the gels and the linearity in the signal detection was checked in gels containing known amounts of Pro39 or Trx34. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay [28] using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
