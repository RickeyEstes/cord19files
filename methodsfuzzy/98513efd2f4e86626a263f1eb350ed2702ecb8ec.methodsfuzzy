Virus propagation. Patient material had been subjected to passage in Vero cells four times in the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Subsequently, in the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, LLC-MK2 cells were inoculated with HCoV-EMC/2012 in minimal essential medium (MEM-Eagle) with Earle's salts (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 2% serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. Vero cells were inoculated with virus in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 1% serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. After inoculation, the cultures were incubated at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator and checked daily for cytopathic changes. Three days after inoculation, supernatant from Vero cells was collected and used for virus genome characterization. Arbitrarily primed PCR and virus genome sequencing. To characterize the viral genome, we used a random amplification deep-sequencing approach as the first step. Virus-containing supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm to remove cellular debris. This supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size centrifugal filter unit (Millipore, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to minimize bacterial contamination. Omnicleave endonuclease (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) was used to remove any free DNA and RNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, viral RNA was extracted from the purified, infected cell culture supernatant using a High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands). To remove contaminating mammalian rRNA, a Ribo-Zero RZH110424 rRNA removal kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed using circular permuted primers (46) that were extended with random hexamer sequences, namely, CCCACCACCAGAGAGAAAN(6), ACCAGAGAGAAACCCAC CN(6), GAGAAACCCACCACCAGAN(6), GGAGGCAAGCGAACGCA AN(6), AAGCGAACGCAAGGAGGCN(6), and ACGCAAGGAGGCAA GCGAN (6) . Per reaction, reverse transcription mixtures contained 6 l RNA, 1 l primer (20 pmol), 0.5 l (20 U) RNase inhibitor (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands), 1 l (10 mM each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Roche), and 5 l water. After a 5 min incubation at 65°C for optimal primer hybridization to the template, 4 l (10ϫ) first-strand buffer, 1 l (200 U/l) SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands), 1 l (0.1 M) dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 l (20 U) RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added to the mixture in a 20-l volume. To obtain cDNA, the reverse transcription mixture was sequentially incubated at 25°C for 5 min and at 42°C for 1 h. After 3 min at 95°C and 2 min on ice, 1 l Klenow DNA polymerase (5 U) (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA) was added and the mixture was sequentially incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 37°C for 1 h, and 75°C for 20 min to obtain double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA was purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To amplify the purified cDNA, a PCR with the individual circular permuted primers without the random hexamer was performed. The PCR mixture contained 2 l primer (40 pmol), 2 l purified cDNA, 1.25 l (10 mM each) deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Roche), 5 l (10ϫ) PfuUltra II Rxn buffer, and 1 l (2.5 U) PfuUltra II DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Water was added to reach a final volume of 50 l. The PCR mixture was incubated at 95°C for 2 min and then for 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Fragments were purified using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Amplified fragments were sequenced using a 454/Roche GS Junior sequencing platform. A fragment library was created according to the manufacturer's protocol without DNA fragmentation (GS FLX Titanium rapid library preparation; Roche), selecting for fragments larger than 100 bp. The emulsion-based PCR (emPCR) (amplification method Lib-L) and GS Junior sequencing run were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche). The sequence reads were trimmed at 30 nt from the 3= and 5= ends to remove all primer sequences. Sequence reads were assembled into contigs using CLC Genomics 5.5.1 software (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Using this deep-sequencing approach, approximately 90% of the virus genome sequence was obtained. As a second step, specific primers were designed to amplify overlapping fragments of approximately 800 bp by RT-PCR. These PCR products were purified from agarose gels and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands) and a 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems), according to the instructions of the manufacturers. The genomic 5=-and 3=-terminal sequences were determined using a FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands). Virus classification. Newly identified members of the family Coronaviridae are generally assigned by the ICTV to a subfamily and genus on the basis of rooted phylogeny and calculation of pairwise evolutionary distances for seven replicase polyprotein domains (1): the ADP-ribose 1Љ-phosphatase (ADRP) in nsp3, the coronavirus 3C-like (3 CL) protease (3CLpro, or "main protease") in nsp5, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in nsp12, the helicase (Hel) in nsp13, the exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14, the nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for U (NendoU) in nsp15, and the ribose-2=-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) in nsp16. Amino acid sequence alignments were generated for each of these domains using ClustalW within the BioEdit (version 7.0.5.3) (47) program and concatenated, after which the sequence identity of HCoV-EMC/2012 with closely related strains was calculated. For this purpose, the full genomes of 9 strains, derived from 3 species, belonging to Betacoronavirus lineage C were available. To support virus classification, protein-based phylogenetic trees were generated. Multiple amino acid alignments, including sequences of HCoV-EMC/2012 and one representative of each of the 20 recognized species of the subfamily Coronavirinae, were produced for the following proteins, using the Viralis platform (48) followed by manual correction: ADRP, the N-terminal part of PLP2, TM1, Y domain, nsp4 to nsp16, and the C-terminal part of the spike (S) protein (S2), envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. From each protein alignment, the most informative blocks (49) were extracted using the BAGG program (50) , and only these strongly conserved alignment regions were used for further analyses. Two concatenated alignments were used. The first included replicase pp1ab protein regions (4,110 aa positions, gap content of 0.9%), and the second included regions in the C-terminal domain of the S protein (S2) and the E, M, and N proteins (1,127 aa positions, gap content of 3.9%). ProtTest version 3.2 (51) was used to select the best-fitting model of protein evolution. For both datasets, the LG model with rate heterogeneity (4 categories) ranked top among 112 models tested, with a relative weight of 0.98 under the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and 0.74 under the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) for the first data set and 0.97/0.75 (BIC/AICc) for the second data set. Hence, this model was applied for maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstruction using PhyML version 3.0 (52). Phylogenetic reconstruction. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using the ClustalW software running within the BioEdit (version 7.0.5.3) (47) program and MAFFT version 6 (53). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees with 100 bootstrap replicates were estimated under the general time-reversible model (GTR) ϩ I ϩ ⌫4 and the transversion model (TVM) ϩ I ϩ ⌫4 (determined by ModelTest [54] ), using PhyML 3.0 software (52) . For both the 332-nt ORF1ab alignment that included isolate VM314/2008 and the alignment of the complete ORF1ab, the GTR ϩ I ϩ ⌫4 model ranked top among 65 models tested, with relative weights of 0.8185 and 1.000 under AIC, respectively. Nucleotide sequence accession number. The final HCoV-EMC/2012 consensus sequence was submitted to GenBank under accession number JX869059.
