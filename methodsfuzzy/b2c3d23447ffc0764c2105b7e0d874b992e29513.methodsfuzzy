The sequence data of 1 1 polioviruses, 6 coxsackieviruses, and 5 human rhinoviruses were obtained from the GenBank and EMBL databases. Except for PV2W (poliovirus type 2, strain W-2) (Pevear et al., 1990) CA21 (coxsackievirus A21) (Hughes et al., 1989 ) CA9 (coxsackievirus A9) (Chang et a/., 1989) and CVB3 (coxsackievirus B3) (Klump et al., 1990) , the other 18 sequences are the same as those reported in a previous paper (Le and Zuker, 1990) . The multiple alignment of 22 sequences was performed using Zuker's multiple alignment program, MAL (Le and Zuker, 1990) . MAL was written in Fortran 77 and could run under IRIS/UNIX or VAXiVMS. The pseudoknot structures in these sequences were predicted using the RNAKNOT program (Chen et a/., 1992) . RNAKNOT was written in Fortran 77 on a CRAY-YMP/8128 (UNICOS) system. The method for predicting pseudoknots or tertiary structures in a given RNA sequence can be summarized as follows: (1) Construct a list (List A) of nonoverlapped regions that are thermodynamically and statistically significant in the given sequence . (2) Create a list (List B) of nonoverlapped regions that are thermodynamically significant by comparing only their stability scores for each segment in the sequence. Each item in List B is nonoverlapped with the regions in List A. (3) Search and build a list of all possible pseudoknots that satisfy steric constraints and would not overlap with regions in List A and List B from both the 5' and 3' sides of the hairpin loop structure under consideration for each item in List A. (4) Eliminate less stable pseudoknots from the list mentioned in the step 3. (5) Evaluate the statistical significance of these computed potential pseudoknots using three scores z, n,, and Q. In the evaluation, the z score is defined as z = (nobs -rmean)/SD for each tertiary interaction pattern in the sequence, where nobs is the number of times the pattern occurs in the real sequence, rmean is the average number of times the occurrence of the pattern in a set of scrambled sequences whose composition and length are identical to the actual sequence, and SD is the standard deviation. The scores n, and n2 are defined as the numbers of randomized sequences that have a pseudoknot thermodynamically more stable than the real sequence. n, and n2 differ in that the free energy contributed by a pseudoknot is calculated using different simulation rules. Thus, a large value of z and/or a small value of n, or n2 might be an indication of nonrandomness of the occurrence of the pseudoknot folded in the sequence. It provides supporting evidence for the existence of the pseudoknot in RNA molecules.
