The Record Board of Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital approved this study and the use of the case files. All patients gave informed consent. Total RNA from the examining sputum, urine, feces, and whole blood was extracted (QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit 52304; QIAGEN; Valencia, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The RNA was dissolved in 40 L of diethyl pirocarbonate-treated water containing 1 U of deoxyribonuclease I (Promega; Madison, WI). Nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was primarily used to ensure specificity. The size of the PCR product is 131 base-pairs
