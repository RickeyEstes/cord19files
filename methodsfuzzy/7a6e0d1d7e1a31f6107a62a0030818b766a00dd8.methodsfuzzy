Data obtained from the surveillance system were reported weekly by the staff of the sentinel hospitals and laboratories. The mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated for continuous variables, and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the differences of age, sex, season, influenza virus type/subtype, and influenza positive rate between all the sampled ILI and SARI cases. The weekly number of positive influenza by subtype and the percentage of specimens tested positively were plotted to describe seasonality and circulation of influenza types/subtypes among SARI and ILI cases. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter were defined from week 11 to 21, 22 to 38, 39 to 48, and 49 to 10 of the next year, respectively [22] . Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to analyze the trend change of influenza virus positivity with the increase of age. Spearman correlation was applied to analyze the linear relationship of the influenza virus positive rate, weekly percentage of influenza virus subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients. ILI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total outpatient visits that were due to ILI and SARI percentage was calculated as the percentage of total admissions that were due to SARI. To compare ILI percentage and SARI percentage of which can better reflect the activity of influenza virus among outpatients and inpatients, Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the linear relationship between weekly ILI influenza-positive rate and ILI percentage, as well as weekly SARI percentage and SARI influenza-positive rate. A two-sided p-values were considered as statistically significant if it was found less than 0.05. All the statistics were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
