Construction of recombinant vectors. The pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ expression vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The nucleocapsid gene (GenBank Accession #AY274119) was amplified by RT-PCR from the SARS-CoV RNA of patient serum samples. Primers for the amplification are 5 0 -GTACGAATTCATGTCTGATAATGGACC CCAATC-3 0 and 5 0 -GTACGGATCCGTGGTCATCATGAGTGT TTATG-3 0 . The amplified product was then purified with MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified product was subsequently digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and then ligated with pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ digested with the same restriction enzymes. The final expression vector for SARS-CoV N is designated as pcDNA-N in this report. The gene for SARS-CoV membrane was amplified with the following primers: 5 0 -GTACGAATTCATGGCAGACAACGGTA-3 0 and GTACGGATCCTTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCA. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ in EcoRI and BamHI sites as mentioned above. The final expression vector for SARS-CoV M is designated as pcDNA-M in this report. Cell culture. The African green monkey kidney cell line Vero cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The Huh7 cell line was chosen for the current study due to its high transfection efficiency [13] , while Vero cells were selected because they are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [4] . All cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C. Cell transfection. As much as 1 Â 10 7 cells were used for transfection using Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, cells were first washed with serum-free DMEM. Thirty micrograms of plasmid DNA (pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ , pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ vector with nucleocapsid gene (pcDNA 3:1ðÀÞ + N) or mock transfection) and 240 ll of enhancer were mixed with 4.5 ml of EC buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. For dose-response experiments, the empty vector (pcDNA 3À1 ) was added to hold each individual transfection with the same amount of DNA (30 lg). After addition of 375 ll of the Effectene reagent, the transfection mixture was again incubated for 10 min, followed by dropwise addition to the cell culture. The transfection efficiency is routinely monitored by co-transfecting the cells with pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) In addition, the experiments triplicated for each transfection were repeated at least 3-5 times with SD (Standard Deviation) being less than 10% (see Figure legends for details). Western blotting. Protein samples were fractionated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to PVDF membrane using semi-dry protein transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris base, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.2% Tween 20. Following the blocking the membrane was probed with chicken IgY antibody against the N protein sequence PKKDKKKKTDEAQPLPQRQK (custom antibody from Sigmagenosystem, The Woodland, TX). Goat anti-chicken HRP-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) was added. The results were finally revealed by using Pierce Biotechonlogy SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Rockford, IL). Nuclear extraction. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for nuclear extraction using the TransFactor extraction kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 150 mm 2 flasks of transfected Huh7 cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the provided lysis buffer on ice for approximately 15 min. Lysed cells were then scraped from flasks, transferred to centrifuge tubes and repeatedly disrupted by aspiration through a narrow-gauge needle. The cell sample was then centrifuged and the cytosolic supernatant fraction was removed. Pelleted nuclei fractions were then resuspended in an extraction buffer and again subjected to disruption by needle aspiration. After centrifugation, the nuclear extract supernatant fraction was collected and stored in small aliquots at )20°C. TransFactor analysis. To analyze the inflammation-related transcription factors associated with SARS-CoV N, the in vitro Trans-Factor Inflammation Profiling Kit was used (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) (Fig. 1A) . The provided positive-control nuclear extracts were used along with the prepared nuclear extracts according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Briefly, the provided 96-well TransFactor plate was blocked with a blocking buffer supplied by the manufacturer for 15 min, then removed and replaced with 50 ll of nuclear extract and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were then washed three times with blocking buffer, incubated with provided primary antibodies, and washed three times. Bound primary antibodies were detected through incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and the addition of TMB substrate. Absorbance measurements were detected at 655 nm on a standard microplate reader. PathDetect reporting system. The AP-1 and NF-jB signal transduction pathways were assayed in vivo using the PathDetect AP-1 cis-reporting system (Fig. 1B) pcDNA-N. Appropriate controls for transfection efficiency were also transfected as recommended by the manufacturer. After 48 h, the reporter luciferase was extracted by cell lysis and quantitated on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI).
