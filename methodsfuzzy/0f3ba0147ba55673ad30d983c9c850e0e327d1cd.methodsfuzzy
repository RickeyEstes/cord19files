For routine surveillance, a case of invasive bacterial disease is defined as isolation of H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, GAS, GBS, S. pneumoniae, or MRSA from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood, joint, pleural, or cerebrospinal fluid) in a resident of the surveillance area. Additionally, cases include ill persons from whom GAS is isolated from a wound or other tissue in the presence of necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Cases of GBS in a mother are also included if GBS has been isolated from the placenta or amniotic fluid in the event of fetal death. The ABCs approach to surveillance is distinctive; it is active, laboratory based, and population based. The goal is to detect 100% of laboratory-confirmed cases by actively contacting all clinical laboratories that routinely process specimens from residents of the surveillance area. Audits are performed regularly to ensure case capture. Efforts at most sites to make ABCs pathogens reportable to state public health agencies have facilitated participation of almost all laboratories (≈600) that serve the surveillance population. Because the population under surveillance is well-defined, US Census data are used to calculate disease incidence rates within the ABCs population. Because of the large population base, CDC uses ABCs data to estimate the national disease burden after adjusting for race and age distribution in the United States. Medical records review is used to collect demographics, clinical course, outcome, infection type, underlying conditions, and vaccination history for each case-patient. For most patients, an isolate from the first positive culture is collected. Since 1995, with the exception of MRSA (for which a convenience sample of 100 isolates has been collected since 2005), ≈85% of isolates have been collected from eligible patients. Isolates undergo serologic or molecular typing and standardized antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing at CDC or other reference laboratories. A collection of ≈80,000 S. pneumoniae, GAS, GBS, N. meningitides, and H. influenzae isolates is accessible to ABCs partners and external researchers by request (http://www.cdc.gov/abcs/pathogens/isolatebank/index. html). ABCs MRSA isolates are deposited at the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a repository sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/ dmid/narsa/Pages/default.aspx). The ABCs infrastructure is also used to conduct surveillance for other bacterial diseases and provides a foundation for epidemiologic investigations. Examples include special surveillance for pertussis and legionellosis, casecontrol studies to assess vaccine effectiveness, and cohort studies to assess the uptake and effectiveness of other public health interventions.
