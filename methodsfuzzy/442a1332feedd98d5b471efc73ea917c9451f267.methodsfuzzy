Standard solution, in the 5-200 g mL −1 range for glycyrrhizin and in the 2.5-100 g mL −1 range for ␣-and ␤glycyrrhetic acid, were prepared and injected into the CE system (internal standard was maintained at the concentration of 20 g mL −1 ). The analyte peak area values were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of the analytes (expressed as g mL −1 ) and the calibration curves constructed by means of the least-square method. This methodology was applied to the analysis of standard working solutions in the 2.5-100 g mL −1 concentration range for ␣GA and ␤GA, and 5-200 g mL −1 for G, prepared as described in Section 2. A standard calibration curve was established by plotting the area of the analytes against the an- alyte concentrations. The regression equations of ␣GA, ␤GA and G (obtained by means of the least square method) were y = −0.39 + 0.40x, y = −0.13 + 0.49x, and y = 0.25 + 0.23x, respectively, where y is the area of analyte peak, and x is the concentration expressed as g mL −1 ; the linear correlation coefficients were 0.9987 for ␣GA, 0.9992 ␤GA and 0.9987 for G. Precision expressed by the RSD values ranged from 1.0 to 2.1% for repeatability and from 2.5 to 4.5% for intermediate precision. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1 g mL −1 for ␣GA and ␤GA and 2.5 g mL −1 for G, while the limit of quantification (LOQ) was of 2.5 g mL −1 for ␣GA and ␤GA and 5 g mL −1 for G. Detection and quantification limits were calculated according to the USP guidelines [37] .
