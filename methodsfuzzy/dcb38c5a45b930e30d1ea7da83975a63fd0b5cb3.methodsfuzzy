Protein expression, purification and crystallization DNA encoding amino acid residues 250-399 of the human DC-SIGNR, which includes the last repeat (R8) and the CRD, referred as DC-SIGNR R8, was inserted into the pET 22b vector (Figure 1(a) ). The expression of the full-length extracellular domain of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR has been described. 21 Proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and reconstituted in vitro. Refolded DC-SIGNR R8 was loaded onto a Source 15Q column (Amersham) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 column (Amersham). The peak fractions were then concentrated to 10 mg/ml and characterized using SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Initial crystallization screening trials were carried out by microbatch experiments using an automated crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments Oryx 6). 32, 33 Repeated attempts to crystallize the entire ectodomain of either DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR did not yield any diffraction-quality crystals. In contrast, rod-like crystals of the DC-SIGNR R8 construct appeared in many conditions within six hours of setup. Optimization of crystal growth conditions was performed by fine-screening of pH and precipitant concentration. Crystals used for X-ray data collection were grown by the hanging-drop, vapordiffusion method in a well solution of 100 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000.
