Cell lines. P. alecto-derived PaBr (brain), PaLu (lung), and PaKi (kidney) immortalized cell lines (37) were grown at 37°C and 5% CO 2 and passaged in DMEM/F-12 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS. Human A549 lung adenocarcinoma and HEK293 cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO 2 and passaged in DMEM media (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (GIBCO #11140076). Viruses. YFV-Venus (derived from YF17D-5C25Venus2AUbi) stocks were generated by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA into STAT1 -/fibroblasts as previously described (12). Trimmed fastq files were mapped to Pteropus alecto (black flying fox) assembly ASM32557v1 (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Pteropus_alecto) using TopHat (38). Duplicates were marked using picard-tools (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Reference annotation based transcript assembly was done using cufflinks (39), and read counts were generated using .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint featureCounts (40). Pairwise differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR (41), and longitudinal analysis was performed using time course (26) after data transformation by voom (42). Differentially-expressed unannotated genes were manually annotated using a nucleotide BLAST (43) search for homologous genes (indicated with an asterisk). Heatmaps. Heatmaps were constructed using GENE-E and Morpheus, both available at https://software.broadinstitute.org. Nanostring analysis. Total RNA was isolated from IFN-treated samples as described above. 100 ng of total RNA in 5 µL was used as input in each reaction for NanoString assay.

CRISPR guide oligos were designed using CRISPRdirect (45). Proper assembly was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Lentiviral pseudoparticles. Lentiviral pseudoparticles were made as described in (46), with some modifications. Briefly, 2x10 6 HEK293T cells were seeded on a poly-lysine coated 10 cm plate. The following day, media was changed to 7.5 mL DMEM with 3%FBS and 1x NEAA. Cells were co-transfected with 5 µg lentiCRIPSRv2, 2.5 µg pCMV-VSVg and 3.5 µg pGag-pol. 4h post-transfection, media was changed to 7.5 mL fresh DMEM with 3% FBS and 1x NEAA. PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and subsequently used in TOPO cloning reactions using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/167999 doi: bioRxiv preprint Several colonies were selected for each cell background and colony PCR was used to amplify the CRISPR-targeted region. Samples were then analyzed using Sanger sequencing. rRNA degradation assay. 3x10 5 PaKi cells were seeded on 6-well plates. The following day, universal IFN (100 U/mL) was added to the media. After 24h, cells were transfected with 100 ng/mL poly(I:C) in Optimem using Lipofectamine 3000. After 4h, RNA was harvested using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNA integrity was measured on a Total RNA Nano chip using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
