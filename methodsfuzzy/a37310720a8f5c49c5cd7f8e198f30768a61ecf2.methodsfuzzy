Real-time quantitative RT-PCR. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Taqman) was designed in the putative nsp11 region in the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome forward primer (SARS-FP: 5 0 -CACCCGCGAAGAAGCTATTC-3 0 ), MGB probe (SARS-TP: FAM 5 0 -TGCGTGGATTGGCTT-3 0 NFQ-MGB), and reverse primer (SARS-RP: 5 0 -TTGCATGACAGC CCTCTACATC-3 0 ). A 25 ll RT-PCR was carried out using 5 ll of extracted RNA or standard cRNA, 12.5 ll TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix containing ROX as a passive reference (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 900 nM forward and reverse primers, and 150 nM MGB probe. Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 48°C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95°C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C). During amplification, the ABI PRISM sequence detector monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysing fluorescence emissions. The reporter dye (FAM) signal was measured against the internal reference dye (ROX) signal to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence fluctuations occurring from well to well. The threshold cycle represented the refraction cycle number at which a positive amplification was measured, and was set at 10 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3-5. Construction of cRNA standards. The TaqMan SARS-CoV forward primer was modified with a T7-promoter sequence at the 5 0 -end (SARS-FPT7 5 0 -TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCACCCGC GAAGAAGCTATTC-3 0 ). PCR products amplified with the modified primer pairs were quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Two hundred nanograms of PCR product was used for in vitro transcription (MEGAshortscript T7 kit, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) performed at 37°C for an overnight period in a 20 ll reaction mix containing 2 ll reaction buffer, 2 ll of each NTP, and 2 ll enzyme mix. The cDNAs were removed by digesting with 2 U of RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37°C. The cRNAs were precipitated by adding 3 ll of 3 M NaOAc and 60 ll of 96% EtOH and a subsequent incubation at À20°C for 30 min. After 15 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, supernatant was removed and 500 ll of 70% EtOH was added. After another 5 min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, supernatant was removed and the pellet was dissolved in 200 ll RNase free H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich NV, Bornem, Belgium) and stored at À80°C. Quantification of cRNAs was performed spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. The measurements of cRNA concentration were performed in duplicate and then converted to the molecule number [23] . Antiviral assay. Antiviral activity and cytotoxicity measurements were based on the viability of cells that had been infected or not infected with 100 CCID 50 (50% cell culture infective doses) of the SARS-CoV in the presence of various concentrations of the test compounds. Three days after infection, the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method, in which the reduction of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) dye (CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution kit, Promega, The Netherlands) by cellular dehydrogenases to an insoluble coloured formazan was measured in a spectrophotometer (Multiskan EX, Thermo Labsystems, Belgium) at 492 nm [24, 25] . The selectivity index was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC 50 or 50% cytotoxic concentration) to the concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect to 50% of the control value (IC 50 or 50% inhibitory concentration). Interferon b is used as a positive control. Time-of-addition assay. Subconfluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates were infected with 100 CCID 50 SARS-CoV. After 20 min of adsorption, cell monolayers were washed five times with MEM. Chloroquine was added at a concentration 12-fold above the IC 50 (8.8 lM) in triplicate, at the time of infection or at different time points thereafter. Eight hours after infection (a time at which the first viral cycle has been completed), cell supernatants were collected, viral RNA was extracted, and the antiviral activity was determined by using the quantitative RT-PCR described above. Virus yield assay. After incubation of the virus-infected Vero E6 cells with different concentrations of the test compounds, under the appropriate conditions, supernatants containing free viruses were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR. Virus titers were determined on day 1 and day 3 postinfection.
