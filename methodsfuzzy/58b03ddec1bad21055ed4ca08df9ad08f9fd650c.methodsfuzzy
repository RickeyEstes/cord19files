Ten small intestine samples were collected from dead piglets from two commercial pig farms in Korea. The piglets died following acute watery diarrhea. The macroscopic features of the intestines were typical of PEDV infections, including yellowish contents and distended appearance. To detect PEDV genome, M gene-targeted RT-PCR was performed using total RNA from mucosal scrapings. Three of ten samples were positive in the PEDV specific RT-PCR. To investigate the origin of the reemerging Korean PEDV strain, complete genome sequences of the three reemerging Korean PEDV strains were determined using Sanger sequencing. For Sanger sequencing, 18 primer pairs were designed for the highly conserved sites of the PEDV genome using Primer3
