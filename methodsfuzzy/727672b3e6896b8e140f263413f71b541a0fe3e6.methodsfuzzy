Statistical analysis (v 2 ) was performed to compare; (a) the proportion of PCV2 positive pigs (by virus isolation and/or PCR) within the case group with the proportion of PCV2 positive control pigs in the 3 control groups, (b) the proportion of cases with high PCV2 DNA loads in mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes (> 10 5 copies/ll) with the proportion of control pigs within the three control groups with high PCV2 DNA loads, and (c) the proportion of PRRSV infected pigs (rt-PCR and/or ELISA antibodies positive) within the case group with the proportion of PRRSV positive control pigs within the three control groups. Fisher exact test was performed to compare the proportion of co-infections of PRRSV-EU and -US in case herds with that of the PMWS-free control herds.
