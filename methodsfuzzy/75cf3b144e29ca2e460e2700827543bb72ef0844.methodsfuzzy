The H7N9 virus dataset for cases of human infections is used for this analysis. The dataset is summarized by county in China to analyze spatial clustering, and by date of illness onset at the county level to analyze its space-time clustering. Hot Spot Analysis tool of the ESRI ® Geographic Information System (GIS) software ArcMap™ 10.1 was used in this study. This tool allows us to identify where and when the H7N9 virus clusters. It calculates a Getis-OrdGi* statistic [16] for each feature in the GIS analysis according to the properties of its neighbor features. This produces a GizScore and a p-value for each feature which is then used to evaluate local clustering of H7N9 cases. A neighborhood in the analysis is defined by the spatial and temporal distance between features as features are probably correlated to each other according to their spatial and temporal relationships. For example, a H7N9 case probably has a strong correlation with another case if there is a relatively short gap in both space and time between the two cases. This would imply that both cases were most likely caused by the same original source. Where spatial and temporal differences are significant, we may conclude that there is no correlation between these cases. Therefore, it is necessary to define a threshold for spatial and temporal distances where features show the strongest statistically significant correlation. The Spatial Autocorrelation tool and the Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation tool in ArcMap™ 10.1 that analyze the spatial distribution of datasets on a global scale were used for this purpose. The threshold spatial distance was defined by analyzing the spatial clustering of H7N9 cases, ignoring all temporal properties, using the Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation tool of ArcMap™. By investigating the statistically significant level of spatial clustering of H7N9 cases at the county level and by defining neighborhoods as ranging from 10 to 590 km at 20 km intervals, a peak significance level of clustering was found that may indicate the threshold distance where spatial clustering is most prominent. A spatial distance of 10 km ensures the closest features to be neighbors while a spatial distance beyond 590 km does not create additional statistically significant clustering. The analysis was subsequently expanded to a space-time analysis to help define a threshold temporal distance for the clustering of H7N9 cases. The space-time clustering of H7N9 is summarized by date of illness onset at the county level and by generating a threshold distance using the Spatial Autocorrelation analysis tool by varying temporal distance from three to 319 days. A peak of statistical significance of space-time clustering may indicate the threshold temporal distance where clustering is most prominent. In this case, time was defined according to the day the symptoms were observed and not the day the cases were reported. The Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation and the Spatial Autocorrelation tools calculate a Moran's I Index value and produce a z-score and a p-value to test the null hypothesis that the attribute being analyzed is randomly distributed among the features [16] . These tools test whether the dataset is clustered in a statistically significant manner across the whole study area, making them different from the Hot Spot Analysis tool [16] . With the threshold spatial and temporal distance defined, a Weights Matrix File was created using the "Generate Spatial Weights Matrix" tool of ArcMap™ to log weights that measure the strength of correlation between features by their spatial and temporal relationship. The generated Weights Matrix File was used to define the parameter "Conceptualization of Spatial Relationships" in the Hot Spot Analysis. The Space-Time scan statistic was also used to explore the spatial-temporal clusters of H7N9 cases. Specifically, a space-time permutation scan statistic model [17] in SatScan [18] (V9.1) was applied. In this model, only case data and location information related to the cases were needed. A cylinder was used to define a potential spatial-temporal cluster, which centered at the county with different spatial radius used to search clusters in spatial and a time period of 1-28 days as the height of the cylinder for temporal cluster. The percentage of cases observed within a cylinder was compared to what would have been expected if the cases were randomly distributed in space and time. The statistical significance of each cluster was calculated based on generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) and Monte Carlo hypothesis testing [17] . In this paper, the simulation was set to 999 times. The p-value of 0.05 means that the GLR in this cylinder is higher than 5% of the GLR calculated during those 999 simulations. The maximum cluster size was set to 10% of the population at risk.
