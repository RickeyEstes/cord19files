E. coli transformations were performed using the method of Hanahan (36) . Yeast transformations were performed by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (87) with the modifications of Eible (23) . To create the Aochl strain, SHY101, a XhoI-HindIII ochl::LEU2-containing fragment from plasmid pSHll3 (described above) was integrated into diploid strain SHY100 (a/a, ura3-52/ura3-52, ade2-1OllADE2, leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112, TRP1/trplA1) by one-step gene replacement (82) . After sporulation, temperature-sensitive Leu รท haploid segregants were isolated that contained a complete deletion of the OCH10RF. Deletion of OCH1 was confirmed by PCR (84) using oligonucleotide primers flanking the deletion. SHY102 was created from SEY6210 by one-step gene replacement of KEX2 with the BamHI fragment containing the kex2A2::HlS3-s allele from plasmid pKX::HIS3-s, kindly provided by R. Fuller (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). Deletion of KEX2 was confirmed by a decrease in mating efficiency of the null strain. SHY103 was created from SEY6210 by one-step gene replacement of PEP4 with the BamHI fragment containing the pep4A:.'LEU2 allele from plasmid pTS17 (kindly provided by T. Stevens). The deletion of PEP4 was confirmed by the inability of the cells to proteolytically process carboxypeptidase Y to its mature form (27, 47) . Invertase activity was determined by the method of Goldstein and Lampen (29) with the modifications for measurement of periplasmic activity presented in Johnson et al. (44) .
