The patient group consisted of 20 subjects with allergic rhinitis showed persistent GC-resistance, resulting in a required surgical removal after the GC treatments for over 6 months. As normal control, nasal tissues were obtained from 10 subjects underwent maxillofacial surgery. They had not been exposed to GC treatment. We have performed immunohistochemical analysis to detect GR-", GR-$ and NF0-B proteins in nasal tissues. Results and Conclusion: Compared to normal subjects, whereas the number of GR-"-positive inflammatory cells was decreased, the number of GR-$positive cells was significantly increased in nasal tissues from patient group. The number of NF-0B-positive cells was at a similar level both patients and normal control. In conclusion, our data suggests that increased over expression of the GR-$ relative to GR-" is associated with GC-resistance.

Background: The aim of the study is to assess the diagnostic potential of two in vitro methods for IgE diagnosis and to compare them with the skin-prick test (SPT) as a gold standard. Methods: 131 patients with positive case history and SPT to grass pollen, house dust mite, moulds, bee and wasp venom suffering of bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis /hay fever and 10 clinically health controls were studied. The in vitro quantity of serum allergen-specific IgE (UniCap, Pharmacia) and the percentage of allergen-specific basophil's degranulation (FasImmune, BD) were evaluated. The correlation and the percent of coincidence of the results from the three methods were analysed (Statistica 5.5). Results: Significant statistical correlation between the resuls from the three methods in patients sensitized to grass pollen and house dust mite were found. Strong positive correlation (Spearman, pG0.05) between the SPT and the quantity of specific IgE-R=0.67 and R=0.61, between the in vivo test and FasImmune -R=0.66 and R=0.62 and between the both in vitro methods -R=0.67 and R=0.53 were determined. Data from patients, allergic to insect's venom, showed a high percent of coincidence between the three methods -from 70% to 90%. Respectively a cincidence of 60% between the SPT and the quantity of specific IgE in the group sensitized to moulds was established. Conclusion: The results from the invitro methods represent positive correlation and coincidence with SPT, especially for the allergens of grass pollen, house dust mite, bee and wasp venom. Their application ensures more preceise diagnosis of patients and contributes to the complex assessment of IgE mediated allergy. This randomized, open-label, single dose crossover trial studied the pharmacokinetics of DL 5mg administered as a 5mg tablet or 10 ml of 0.5 mg/ ml syrup in 24 healthy adult male Chinese subjects. After providing written informed consent and undergoing screening, subjects were admitted to a clinic for baseline assessments. Subjects were randomized to receive one of the two DL formulations in a fasting state. Blood tests for pharmacokinetics were taken over 5 days (subjects remained in the clinic for the first 24 hours), and after a 14 day washout period the subjects were crossed over to the other DL formulation and underwent identical pharmacokinetic analyses. The main pharmacokinetic variables for the two formulations were the log-transformed AUC(I) and the Cmax for DL and 3-OH-DL. Biochemical and hematological tests, ECG data and vital signs were also assessed during the study and adverse event (AE) reports were collected. Results: DL was safe and well tolerated when administered in the tablet or syrup formulations; no AEs were reported. The Tmax, T1/2, Cmax, and AUC(I) values for DL and 3-OH-DL were similar for both formulations. There were no statistically significant differences between the tablet and syrup DL formulations on the basis of log-transformed Cmax and AUC(I) values for DL and 3-OH-DL (P90.05). The 90% CIs of AUC, and Cmax were 91.61Y103.97% and 86.04Y99.92% respectively for DL, and 94.22Y101.71% and 88.01Y101.35% respectively for 3-OH-DL. The relative bioavailbility of the DL syrup was 99.4% for DL and 98.79% for 3-OH-DL, which met the criteria for bioequivalence of the two formulations. Conclusion: Both syrup and tablet formulations of DL 5mg were safe and well tolerated. When administered as a syrup formulation DL was bioequivalent to the tablet form of DL in healthy Chinese subjects. We present the case of a 46 years old woman, nurse as profession , with cough and dysnea for a period of nine years. No wheezing, fever nor constitutional syndrome were referred. Skin prick tests with common aero-allergens and latex, spirometry and bronchodilatation test were performed. Total IgE, complement study, proteins electrophoresis, immunoglobulins determination, cellular immunity study, HIV, X-ray study and thoracic CT-scan, mantoux, zielh and sputum culture were done. Results: Positive skin prick test for pollens and dog and cat epithelia were obtained. The patient had normal spirometry values and a negative bronchodilatation test. All the laboratory tests were in normal levels. Determination of total IgE was 483 KU/l. The chest X-ray showed cavities in both lungs with interstitial infiltrates. The CT-scan confirmed these findings. Mantoux, Zielh with 50 BAAR/field and MAV culture were positive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was excluded by CRP. Cellular immunity, complement, proteins electrophoresis and immunoglobulins determination were in normal range. HIV test was negative. Conclusion: We present the case of a patient with rhinoconjuntivitis due to pollens hypersensitivity and persistent cough with pulmonary infection for Mycobacteium Avium associated. The Mycobacterium Avium was not described as human pathogen until 1950, when many series described pulmonary infections for MAV. This mycobacterium mainly attacks immunosuppressed patients. This infection is less frequent in patients with normal immunity. Our patient did not have immunosuppression nor risk factors. At the present time she is being treated with antibiotics (ethambutol and claritromicin) and she is in good general condition with no need of hospitalisations. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited phagocytic disorder caused by mutations in NADPH oxidase subunits. Patients with CGD have life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Childrens Medical Center at Tehran University is the referral center for immunodeficiency in Iran. During two years of study forty five families with clinically diagnosed CGD were referred to this center. Neutrophil functional assays performed for affected children and their mothers; no activity or residual activity was detected in affected neutrophils. PMN (Poly Morpho Nuclear) oxidative burst revealed mosaic pattern in 12 mothers. Western blot analysis revealed gp91phenotype in all their sons. Mutation screening in CYBB gene using SSCP analysis followed by sequencing, showed 9 different mutations including one novel mutation. Western immunoblot subtyping of patients whose mother showed no mosaic pattern by DHR123 revealed 24 patients with p47 null expression, 7 and 2 patients with p22 and p67 defect, respectively. %GT screening in Ncf1 gene for p47-patients, revealed 8 patients with this mutation. Mutation analysis for the rest of Ncf1 gene for these patients is understudy. CYBA mutation analysis revealed 6 different mutations including three novel mutations in p22-patients. Overall, the number of autosomal recessive patients with CGD in Iran is high and it seems consanguineous marriages is one of its causative factors. All appropriate papers and information were presented to volunteers. Motivation, understanding of vaccine properties and trial procedure, risk behavior, ability to perform the trial protocol were estimated. Volunteers enrolled in trials after confidential medical investigation and informed consent undersigning. Results: 65 persons of 298 enquiries were screened as potential volunteers. The main reasons for participation: help to HIV-infected people (65%) including persons in nearest surround (wife, husband, friend, child) (41%); contribution in development of HIV/AIDS vaccine (35%); possibility of immune protection against HIV (18%), free insurance and/or medical care (4%) . 20% (13 of 65) of persons refused to participate in trials. Reasons of refusal: doubts in vaccine safety and fear to receive HIV-infection (61%), fear of side effects (30%), fear of vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity (15%), impossibility to perform the trial protocol (7%), low compensation (2%), unexplained (15%). 30 persons not refused to participate in clinical trials, but decided to do it in future (clinical trials phase II). Reasons: planned pregnancy or temporal impossibility to perform the trial protocol. 17 volunteers (14 men, 1 woman, age 22Y31) were enrolled in trials. 2 of them leaved trials after 1st vaccination (unexplained reason), 9 successfully passed the trials protocol and 6 are at final step of trials. Conclusion: The first cohort for the clinical trials of preventive HIV/AIDS vaccines was created in Russia and partially enrolled in clinical trials of VICHREPOL vaccine. Cohort is stable (88%), expandable and may be included into international multicenter trials. During an open-label extension phase of a randomized, double blind, controlled phase III study (FAST-2) patients with cutaneous and/or abdominal attacks of hereditary angioedema were treated with Icatibant. Within 6 hours after the onset of a moderate/severe attack they received a single injection of 30 mg Icatibant subcutaneously. Symptoms were assessed by patient (VAS, symptom score) and by physician (symptom score global assessment, clinical global impression). Results: 6 angioedema attacks in 2 patients with HAE were treated with Icatibant. The affected sites were twice the extremities and once the genitalia in Patient #1. Patient #2 experienced two abdominal attacks, while another attack affected the gastrointestinal tract and one extremity. Clinical symptoms of all attacks improved quickly. Time to first improvement of symptom was 10Y23 minutes. The duration of complete resolution of symptoms was shorter in abdominal attacks compared to attacks involving the subcutaneous tissues (180Y240 min versus 480Y720 min). Drug related adverse events and relapses were not experienced. Local skin reactions at the injection site were tolerable and resolved within 4 hours. Conclusion: IcatibantYwhich differs from earlier drugs concerning both the mode of action and the method of administration as wellYhas been found effective and safe in the treatment of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. The possibility of subcutaneous administration of Icatibant may improve the daily life of patients suffering from HAE. In the present cases repeated use of Icatibant did not result in reduced efficacy. The potential of Icatibant for the treatment of other bradykinin mediated angioedema has to be tested in further studies. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) is a genetic immunodeficiency disease characterized by life-threatening infection results from the mutations in the leukocyte integrin, CD18 molecule with severe and moderate phenotype. We report a case of severe LAD occurred in a 1 month old girl and a case of moderate LAD which was presented with aggressive periodontitis. Case 1: Clinical features include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, omphalitis, severe bullose and /ulcerative skin eruption which mimic picture of staphylocolal scaled skin syndrom in neonatal period and persistent leukocytosis. The immunological workup showed pathological values of CD11b, CD18 (2.3%, 0.3% respectively). The patient is waiting for BMT now. Case 2: A 4/5 year old boy with aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition which pathologic examination showed actinomycosis ginigivits and normal separation of umbilical cord. He had CD11b __ 4/6% and CD18 __ 3/ 7% in peripheral blood flow-cytometery compatible with moderate phenotype of LAD1. He is receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusion: Although LDA is a rare form of congenital immuno -deficiency, severe LDA1 should be considered when delayed wound healing and recurrent bacterial skin infections are present in a newborn and moderate LAD1 in aggressive periodontitis with normal wound healing. The clinical records of all children who were prescribed Epipen or Epipen junior between November 2003 and October 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. 39 patients were included of which 23 were seen in allergy clinic and 16 were seen in general paediatric clinics. There ages ranged between 6 months to 17 years (median of 7 years). Results: The common allergens were Nuts/seeds (79%) followed by egg (23%), milk (18%) and fish (8%). 15 children had positive skin prick tests and 18 had positive RAST (total 33/39 had positive tests). Information on treatment with Epipen was provided to 22/23(95%) children seen in allergy clinic compared to 10/16 (62%) children seen in general clinics. Practical instruction of Epipen administration was provided to 21/23(91%) compared to A matched patients-sibling study comparing patients with allergic asthma with their healthy siblings without any symptoms of allergic diseases. Allergic in patients and their siblings was determined by skin prick tests. We assumed that children having up to one positive skin prick test were considered to be allergic. Intake of paracetamole was assessed by standardized interviewer Yadministered, questionnaire. 22 pairs of allergy asthma patients`vs. non-allergic siblings were compared to determine the risk factors for allergic and asthma. While 12 pairs of allergic asthma patients vs. allergic siblings were compared to determine the risk factors for asthma. However, 35 pair of allergic asthma patients vs. non-asthmatic sibling ( with and without allergy) were compared to determine the risk factors for asthma, also 15 allergic siblings were compared with 19 non-allergic siblings (with asthma ) to determine the risk factors of Allergy. Results: Intake of paracetamole during pregnancy was associated with allergic asthma (P = 0,04). Intake of paracetamole between birth and ten months of age and between four to seven moths of age, was also found to be associated with non-allergic asthma (p = 0.004 and p = 0.03) respectively. Usage of paracetamole during pregnancy and during early months of life may play a role in the development of allergic and non Yallergic in children. Conclusion: Intake of paracetamole during pregnancy and during first month of life is associated with an increase risk of childhood asthma. In the open-label extension phase of a phase III, double blind, randomized multicenter trial (FAST-2) which compared Icatibant versus tranexamic acid, patients with abdominal or cutaneous attacks were treated with Icatibant 30 mg sc. Symptom score by patient, documentation of time for the onset of symptom relief measured by a visual analog scale and time to complete resolution of symptoms were the main assessments. Results: The patient treated in our hospital was a 22 year old, otherwise healthy male with known HAE since the age of 6 month. He has been having frequent attacks about twice per month which usually were treated with tranexamic acid. The patient experienced in total 11 attacks (7 abdominal, 2 cutaneous and 2 laryngeal) with an average duration of 4 days during the last 6 months. The patient came to the clinic with a severe cutaneous edema of his genitals. He received one single injection of 30 mg Icatibant sc. The onset of symptom relief was reached rapidly after approximately 10 minutes. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred within 5 hours, so the patient could leave the hospital. Icatibant was well tolerated, only mild injection site reactions such as pruritus were observed. No systemic adverse events were observed. Conclusion: In the present case Icatibant provided fast and complete resolution of severe cutaneous HAE symptoms and was well tolerated. The treatment course of the HAE attack in our case complies with the results of the double blind phase of the FAST-2 trial. The time to first improvement was 0.8 hours for Icatibant vs. 7.9 hours for tranexamic acid (p G 0.001). The primary endpoint (median time to onset of symptom relief) was met with 2.0 hours for Icatibant compared with 12.0 hours for tranexamic acid (p G 0,001). The end of attack (almost complete symptom relief) was reached after 10 hours during treatment with Icatibant compared to 51 hours for tranexamic acid (p G 0.001). The proposed approach includes a strategy for performing an epidemiological study, selection of target population, identification of the sample size. All key steps in performing the cross-sectional and case-control studies are listed. Suggestions for improving the quality of the obtained data are given. The study includes 16 patients, with acute heroin and mixed with other psychoactive drugs intoxications at average age, 21,5 T 5.04 years (12 men and 4 woman), hospitalized in the Clinic of Toxicology, MHATEM BN.I.Pirogov^, Sofia. We have used clinical, clinicolaboratory, immunological, chimicotoxicological, instrumental methods. Results: Results from the study shows that in severity intoxications with heroin and other psychoactive drugs we observed spectrum of complications in pulmonary system -pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary edema, and ARDS. Death is registered in 3 persons. It was found some changes of the immune reactivity: statistically significant lower mean levels of IgG, IgA, IgM and tendency to lower mean levels of complement components -C3 and C4 in the studied patients in comparison with the values in healthy people. The changes were more demonstrative in the group with pulmonary complications compared to the group without pulmonary complications. We observed that the CD4 lymphocytes are significantly less in the studied patients and is determined lower level of CD56 bearing lymphocytes -natural killer /NK/ cells, compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: The acute heroin and mixed with other psychoactive drugs intoxications leads to complications in pulmonary system, and changes of some parameters of cell mediated and humoral immunity.

National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico, Allergy and Immunology, Mexico City, Mexico. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that affects median sized muscular arteries, characterized by multi organ involvement. Presenting GI manifestations include: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, acute abdomen and, rarely, GI bleeding in the form of hematemesis, melena and occult bleeding. A 14 year old boy presented five years ago with hemetochezia, 5 to 7 episodes per day. he presented severe anemia and he was hospitalized to investigate mieloproliferative disease or systemic lupus erythematosus He was treated with IVIG and methylprednisolone with clinical and hematic biometry improvement. A colonoscopy showed suggestive data of CUCI with diffuse inflammation, pseudopolyps, adhered fibrin to mucosa, inflammatory lesions involving descendent colon and sigmoides, estenotic parts of the colon and bleeding. Hystologic examination described ulcer and inflammatory infiltrate with polimorphonuclears, limphocytes, plasmatic cells in lamina propia and submucosa, mild fibrosis and eosinophils. He received treatment with methylprednisolone, mesalazine, omeprazole, and azathioprine and he was referred. Physical examination revealed severe emation 45.4 kg, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bilateral pulmonar hipoventilation with bilateral crackles. The diagnosis of severe desnutrition, CUCI, and communitary pneumoniae were made, and treatment with cefuroxime and claritromicine was started. He presented fever, rectorragia with hemodinamic compromise that required transfusion of packed red blood cells, and platelets, and involvement of liver, kidney, gut and persistent fever, pancytopenia and elevated ferritin. He required orotraqueal intubation because ventilatory compromise, in the neurology area, he had hypotonic proximal extremities, hiporreflexia, and generalized seizures, which were controlled with phenytoin. The laboratory findings revealed negative, antinuclear antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and anti hepatitis C virus were negative. Central nervous computed tomography showed isquemic temporal areas. Magnetic resonance and angiography revealed microaneurysm in both renal arteries, and vasculitis in central nervous system, hepatic and intestinal arteries. These symptoms and laboratory findings were compatible with diagnostic criteria for childhood classic polyarteritis nodosa, treatment of IVIG and various methylprednisolone pulses let to clinical improvement. Background: According to Evidence Based Medicine, conclusions from meta-analyses and RCT represent the most solid evidence source to assess the efficacy of an intervention. Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is currently considered as the only allergen-oriented biological response modifier, and it is regarded as an essential part of the therapeutic approach for allergic diseases. Objective: To provide a descriptive review of all available randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials (RCT BD PC) published which evaluated the efficacy of SIT in the treatment of respiratory allergy. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: A comprehensive search of the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases up to April 30th, 2007 was carried out. The search strategy retrieved citations containing the subject heading specific immunotherapy limited to RCT DB PC combined with asthma, allergic rhinitis or both. Variables recorded were the study design, journal impact factor, patient's and immunotherapy characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes and online full-text papers' availability. Results: Two hundred ninety-six articles were identified and reviewed; 179 (61%) were RCT DB placebo-controlled. Of them, 116 evaluated efficacy of subcutaneous IT (SCIT) and 63 sublingual IT (SLIT). Twenty-six percent of studies (n= 46) had a minimum duration of 24 months (21% vs. 30% for SCIT and SLIT, respectively). Characteristics of studies are described in Table. (+ Median-Interquartilic rank; # Number of studies found; * Months; ** Mean; @ At least one immunological mechanism studied) Conclusion: One hundred seventy-nine Ib evidence-level studies on efficacy of SIT in the treatment of respiratory allergy were identified in two electronic databases. Both selection and search bias must be ruled out. The prevalence of food allergy in 14 to 15 year old Singaporean children was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire which was distributed to students of randomly selected schools. Students who responded positively to these food allergies were administered an extended questionnaire to determine presence of convincing food allergy. A portion of those with convincing allergy symptoms were recalled for skin prick testing (SPT) as well as underwent a graded food challenge for those who consented. Results: From a cohort of 8072 students, 6765 (83.78%) responded. The crude prevalence of self-reported allergy to peanuts was 0.90% and treenuts 0.63%. However, using the criteria for convincing food allergy, the prevalence fell to 0.33% for peanuts and 0.20% for tree-nuts. A proportion of subjects with convincing allergy symptoms agreed to skin prick testing, which showed low frequency of skin test positivity peanut 4.17% (1/24) and tree-nuts 13.3% (2/15). Finally, all food challenges (5 for peanuts and 2 for tree-nuts) carried out on 7 subjects with either a convincing history plus negative SPT or convincing history plus positive SPT, resulted in a negative outcome. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the prevalence of peanut and tree-nut allergy in Singapore adolescents is low. Evaluation based on questionnaire survey alone overestimated the prevalence of peanut and tree-nut allergy in our population.
