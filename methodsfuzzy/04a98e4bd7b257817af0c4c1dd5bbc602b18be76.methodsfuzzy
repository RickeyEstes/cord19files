We studied 165 samples of adenoid and tonsil tissue. The resection of adenoids was done to relieve upper respiratory tract obstruction. There were 80 adenoid samples. They were divided in two groups: one group with 32 children from 12 to 24 months of age (mean, 18 months) and the second group with 48 children from 25 months to 15 years old. Tonsils were obtained from 85 patients, from 3 to 13 years old (mean, 5.6 years). They underwent surgery (tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy) due to recurrent tonsillitis (42 patients) or hyperplasia with upper airway obstruction (43 patients). The removed adenoids and tonsils were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections 5 Am thick were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis and others submitted to the in situ hybridization (ISH). The ISH was carried out with the EBER probes from Novocastra, which consists of a mixture of oligonucleotides EBER (EBER 1 and EBER 2, of 30 base length). The EBER probe was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The detection of the hybridization products was achieved by using the Novocastra universal detection system. The positive control of the reaction was a previously tested EBV-positive nasopharynx carcinoma. The slides were analyzed on a standard optical microscope, by only one observer. The intensity of positiveness to EBV was classified as mild, moderate, and strong. We have compared the results obtained from adenoid tissue from children under 24 months of age and older than 25 months, both EBV positive, and tonsillar tissue and adenoid tissue, both EBV positive.
