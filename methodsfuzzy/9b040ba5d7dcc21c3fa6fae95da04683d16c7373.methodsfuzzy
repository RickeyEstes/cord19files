For the evaluation of the analytical performance of mariPOC, NAATs were used as reference techniques. 2.4. Viral strain titration by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay Viral strains, obtained from clinical isolates, were propagated in appropriate cell lines: Flu A (H1N1)pdm09 and B in MDCK-SIAT1; RSV and ADV in Hep-2, PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3 and hMPV in LLC-MK2 cells. After incubation at 37°C during 10 days or when cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, cell monolayers were harvested, aliquoted, and preserved in liquid nitrogen for further use. TCID 50 assay was performed for each virus as described (Hsiung, 1994) . The appearance of CPE was examined daily for 10 days postinfection, and TCID 50 was calculated using the Spearman-Kärber method (Hamilton et al., 1977) .
