The study was conducted at Teagasc, Grange Beef Research Centre (Longitude 6°40' W; Latitude 53°30' N; Elevation 92 m asl) over a period of 8 consecutive years (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) , each year comprising a summer grazing period (April to October/November) and the subsequent indoor winter feeding period. The soil type was a moderately well drained Brown Earth of medium to high base content and of clay loam texture (Gardiner, 1962) . Meteorological data were obtained at the recording station at Grange Research Centre. The instruments and standards used by Irish weather stations were described by Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald (2004) . Grass production was measured annually in a separate plot experiment as described by O'Riordan (1997) involving a cutting regime to a 4 cm stubble height on a 4-week cycle using an annual fertiliser N input of 300 kg ha − 1 .
