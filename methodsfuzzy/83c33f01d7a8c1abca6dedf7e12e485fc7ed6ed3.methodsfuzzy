2.1. C. phellodendri Extraction. C. phellodendri, bark of Phellodendron chinensis Schneid. (Rutaceae), were collected in Sichuan Province, China, and were authenticated by Professor Dr. Ding-Rong Wan of our university. A voucher specimen (SCUN201310010) is deposited at the Herbarium of College of Pharmacy, South-Central University for Nationalities, China. Air-dried C. phellodendri (1 Kg) was milled into powder and immersed into 70% ethanol (5 L) for 24 h. The components in the mixture were extracted by hot reflux and were centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to remove ethanol and get residues, which were immersed in a 2% HCl solution (1000 mL). The yellow precipitates (mainly berberine) were removed and the supernatants were consecutively extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butyl alcohol. The n-butyl alcohol extract was further evaporated under reduced pressure, and the extraction yield was 1.5% of the raw material dry weight. The dried n-butyl alcohol extract of C. phellodendri (NBAECP) was dissolved in 3% DMSO for the experiments.
