Male CBA mice, 7-8 weeks old and obtained from OLAC, U.K., were infected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the right ear with 6 Ã— 10 6 plague forming units (pfu) of HSV-1 Kruegger. They were sacrificed when they showed clinical signs of viral encephalitis. The brain was immediately removed, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Miles Scientific, U.S.A.) and horizontal cryostat sections 15 /zm thick were made. For histological examination, sections were fixed in calcium formalin and absolute alcohol before being stained with solochrome cyanin, washed with 4% ammonium ferric sulphate and counter-stained with eosin. For immunofluorescence examination, sections were fixed in cold acetone (-20 o C) for 10 rain. All the antibodies used in this study have been previously described or were purchased. The mouse monoclonal anti-GC antibody (Ranscht et al., 1982) was a gift from Dr. M.C. Raft and was used as ascites fluid diluted 1:50. The respective anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 (anti-L3T4) rat monoclonal antibodies, YTS 169.4 (Cobbold et al., 1984) and GK 1.5 (Dialynas et al., 1983 ) were a gift from Dr. F.Y. Liew and used as ammonium sulphate precipitate diluted 1:10. The F4/80 rat monoclonal antibody specific for mature mouse macrophages (Austyn and Gordon, 1981 ) was a gift from Dr. S. Gordon via Dr. P. Kaye and was used as hybridoma culture supernatant diluted 1:1. The rabbit anti-HSV and anti-GFAP sera were both obtained from Dako and used at 1:100 and 1:200 respectively. The binding of the mouse monoclonal anti-GC was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (G anti-MIg-Rd, Cappel, diluted 1:50); rat monoclonal antibodies were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin (G anti-Ratlg-FITC, Cappel, diluted 1:100) for YTS 169.4 and GK 1.5; and biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin and avidin-conjugated rhodamine (biotin-G anti-RatIg and Av-Rh, Sigma, diluted 1:50 and 1:100 respectively) for F4/80. The binding of the polyclonal rabbit anti-HSV and rabbit anti-GFAP antibodies was detected with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobufin and avidin-coupled Texas red (D anti-Rig-biotin and Av-Tx red, Amersham, diluted 1:50 and 1:100 respectively) and mouse anti-HSV immunoglobulin with G anti-MIg-Rd, Cappel, diluted at 1:50. Cryostat sections were double-labelled as described by Raft et al. (1979) . Sections were exposed to the primary and secondary antibodies sequentially in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% normal serum. Three 10 rain washes were performed between each incubation. All incubations were for 1 h at room temperature. After the last wash, sections were mounted in glycerol and sealed with nail varnish before they were examined in a Zeiss Universal incidence fluorescence microscope equipped with phase-contrast, fluorescein, and rhodamine optics and photographed using Kodak TMX 5052 or Ektachrome colour-slide film rates 400 ASA.
