Tissue culture-derived laboratory virus stocks propagated in Vero African green monkey kidney cells at the NMRC were used as positive controls. The following DENV strains were used to cover all 4 serotypes: DENV1, WP74; DENV2, 16803; DENV3, CH53489; and DENV4, 341750. RNA extraction for these DENV stocks as well as clinical serum samples was performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted in 60 μL of nuclease-free water. Samples were characterized as positive or negative for DENV using a qRT-PCR assay, modified from one previously described (McAvin et al., 2005) . Briefly, the sequences of the qRT-PCR primers used were as follows: DENV forward: 5′-GGTTAGAGGAGACCCCTC-3′, DENV reverse: 5′-CAGAGATCCTGCTGTCTC-3′, probe: 5′FAM-CAGCATATTGA CGCTGGGA-TAMRA3′. We utilized the TaqMan® EZ RT-PCR core reagents kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a final volume of 25 μL, with the following reaction concentrations: 0.7 μmol/L forward primer, 0.7 μmol/L reverse primer, 0.27 μmol/L probe, 0.2 mmol/L dNTP, 4 mmol/L Mn(OAc) 2 , 1X ABI Buffer, 2.5 U rTth Polymerase, and 0.25 U AmpErase. The reaction was held at 50°C for 2 minutes and 60°C for 30 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 seconds and polymerization at 61°C for 45 seconds. To quantify RNA copies, the DENV 3′UTR was cloned into the PCR_Script AMP vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), and the transcript was transcribed in vitro using the Riboprobe T7 Transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer, and the RNA copy number was calculated. This RNA standard with known copy numbers was serially diluted and run alongside all qRT-PCR reactions to enable quantification of RNA copies in the reaction.
