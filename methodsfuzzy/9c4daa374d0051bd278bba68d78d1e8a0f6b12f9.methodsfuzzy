All cases that fulfilled the CDC case definition of SARS and had been admitted to the medical wards or intensive care unit (ICU) at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in year 2003 were included in the study (Lee et al., 2003b) . A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed (by serology, RT-PCR or post-mortem) SARS cases were then retrospectively evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV IgG response and clinical disease severity. Serum samples were first collected at presentation/admission and convalescentphase sera were collected either beyond 2 weeks of illness or >10-14 days apart from the acute-phase sera. All serum samples were dated from the day of fever onset. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG was detected by IFA using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells; and IgG titres were quantified at two-fold serial dilutions starting from 1:40 (Chan et al., 2004a) . Routine respiratory specimens collected at presentation, and repeated fecal specimens collected upon discharge at ≥21 days of illness were tested for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR (non-quantitative), according to WHO recommendations (Chan et al., 2004b; WHO, 2004) . All serological and RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV were performed in a BSL-2 containment facility according to CDC recommendations (CDC, 2005) . The clinical characteristics and disease progression, investigation methods and details of treatment of this cohort of patients have been described elsewhere (Chan et al., 2004b; Gomersall et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2003a Lee et al., ,b, 2004 Sung et al., 2004) . SARS patients who required supplemental oxygen therapy during their course of illness or admitted to ICU as a result of severe respiratory failure were regarded to have more severe disease. Supplemental oxygen was prescribed to maintain patient's oxygen saturation >95% when necessary; and severe respiratory failure was defined by failure to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation of >90% despite receiving supplemental oxygen at 50%, and/or a respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute (Gomersall et al., 2004) . High-dose corticosteroid 'rescue' therapy was given to patients when clinical and radiological progression was noted according to a standard protocol (Sung et al., 2004) . Age of 65 years was also used as a cut-off in the comparison between groups since epidemiological data had implicated advanced age as a poor prognostic factor (thus more severe disease) (WHO, 2004) . The cut-off value for lymphocyte counts in the comparison groups was determined based on earlier studies (Wong et al., 2003) . A retrospective analysis was conducted. Firstly, clinical and laboratory variables of patients who seroconverted "early" (<median interval) were compared to those cases documented to remain sero-negative during the same time interval using χ 2 -test. Variables with p < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then entered into a model for logistic regression analysis. We excluded patients who had their first serum samples collected on day 0-3 (since IgG was only first detected on day 4 in our cohort), and those who had their first sera collected beyond day 15 (the median interval to serocon-vert) from fever onset. Median time of serum collections between all comparative patient groups was not significantly different. Secondly, median anti-SARS-CoV IgG levels in convalescent-phase sera collected within 30 days were compared among patients with different disease severities and laboratory profiles using Mann-Whitney U-test. Variables with p < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then entered into a nonparametric regression model for analysis. Only the latest serum sample collected from each patient was included in the analysis. Median time of collecting these samples was not significantly different between all comparative patient groups. Thirdly, spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between IgG titres and LDH levels or lymphocyte counts within 30 days. SPSS for Windows (Release 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons.
