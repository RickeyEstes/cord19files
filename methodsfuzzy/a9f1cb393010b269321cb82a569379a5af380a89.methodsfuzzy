We got the phylogenetic trees of beta globin and ND5 protein sequences by applying the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). e phylogenetic tree based on Tables 8 and 9 of our method is presented in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively. Figure 6 proves the utility of our similarity/dissimilarity analysis for beta globin protein sequences. Figure 7 shows our analysis of similarity/dissimilarity of ND5. It is mentioned that our algorithm cannot measure the degree of similarity very well for pigmy chimpanzee with human. is appears of course in Figure 7 . e P. chimp branch should be close to C. chimp. Despite this error, the tree shows that human, common chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla belong to the same cluster. To check the effect of this error on our algorithm, the results of our algorithm are compared to sequence homology. A correlation and significance analysis is also provided. e results of our algorithm are compared to the sequence homology by two methods. First, we use the Smith Waterman algorithm to calculate the number of identical residues in each pair of protein sequences [15] . e results of the PID% of nine beta globin sequences are illustrated as a similarity/dissimilarity matrix in Table 10 . e larger PID% represents the more similar protein sequences. A correlation and significance analysis is provided to compare our approach in Table 8 with PID% in Table 10 . e correlation of the two sets of data is sufficiently strong when the correlation coefficient (r) is greater than 0.7. e negative sign of (r) indicates that when the first data set increases, the second data set decreases. We then assess statistical significance for correlation coefficient values greater than 0.7 to ensure that they likely do not occur by chance. Our sample set is composed of nine protein sequences. erefore, we use 7 degrees of freedom. A t-value of 2.385 or greater indicates that a less than 0.05 chance of the results occurred by coincidence. e results for correlation coefficients and t-values for our approach are illustrated in Table 11 . Second, ClustalW is a widely used system for aligning any number of homologous nucleotides or protein sequences [33] . e ClustalW program's distance matrix of nine ND5 protein sequences is illustrated in Table 12 . Correlation and significance analyses are also provided to compare our approach in Table 9 with ClustalW results in Table 12 . e results of the correlation and significance analyses of our approach and other approaches [15, 33] are illustrated in Table 13 . Our sample set of ND5 is also composed of nine protein sequences. erefore, we use 7 degrees of freedom and a t-value of 2.385 or greater. Despite the unusual result for pigmy chimpanzee that appeared in Table 11 : e correlation and significance analysis between our similarity analysis results of beta globin protein sequences in Table 8 and PID% similarity matrix in Table 10 . Tables 9 and 7 in [33] and Table 3 in [15] and ClustalW similarity matrix in Table 12 . Correlation coeff. (r) of our approach t-value of our approach Correlation coeff.

(r) of [15] (Table 3) t-value of [15] ( Table 9 , the correlation coefficient of pigmy chimpanzee in our similarity matrix and clustalW matrix is 0.8811. is value likely does not occur by chance, as the t-value equals 4.928, as illustrated in Table 13 . e comparison between our results and both PID% and ClustalW and other approaches' results indicate the utility of our approach.
