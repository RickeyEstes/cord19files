Viruses and cell culture. BHK-21 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. In virus infections, BHK-21 cells were washed with DMEM containing no serum (SFM) and overlaid with wild-type (WT) TMEV or mutant derivatives at the multiplicities of infection (MOIs) stated below. After a 1-h adsorption period, virus was removed, and cells were overlaid with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for various times. The GDVII strain of TMEV generated from the full-length infectious clone pSK-GDVII was used (a kind gift from the Robert Fujinami lab, University of Utah). The sequence of this clone is identical to GenBank accession no. NC_001366.1 except for three nucleotide differences: G2241A (serine to isoleucine in VP2), A2390G (synonymous change in VP3), and G4437A (lysine to glutamine in 2B). Nucleotide coordinates herein are given with respect to NC_001366.1 (20) . Recombinant viruses and plasmids. QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) was performed on a template containing the fulllength viral insert to create the full-length recombinant TMEV shift site mutant (SS), stop codon mutant (SCM), and StopGo mutant (LVWT). All constructs were verified by sequencing of the complete virus genome. V5 and HA-tagged virus variants were created as follows. First, two unique restriction sites (a BsiWI site starting at nt 4166 and a SalI site starting at nt 4536) were introduced (using synonymous changes) into a subclone by site-directed mutagenesis, and the fragment was cloned back into the full-length clone. Two PCR products were then generated using primers overlapping these restriction sites at one end and primers spanning the TMEV sequence and part of the V5 or HA sequence at the other. These fragments fused the first codon following the StopGo junction with the 5= terminus of the tag coding region and the 3= terminus of this region with the rest of the 2B/2B* sequence. Different variants were produced to allow the generation of tagged WT, SS, LVWT, and StopGo and shift site mutant (LVSS) clones. The fragments were joined by overlap extension PCR and subcloned back into the modified full-length clone containing the extra restriction sites. The V5 tag, including a glycine-serine linker, was GKPIPNPLLGLDSTGSGSGS, while the HA tag was YPYDVPDYA. Dual-luciferase frameshift reporter plasmids were prepared by introducing annealed oligonucleotide pairs into XhoI/BglII-digested pIDluc. Plasmid pIDluc is a derivative of the pDluc vector with the mengovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (DQ294633, nt 256 to 770) inserted downstream of the T7 promoter of pDluc such that the second codon of the Renilla luciferase gene is fused to the first seven codons of the mengovirus polyprotein ORF, allowing cap-independent translation. In vitro transcription and generation of recombinant virus. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion) for 3 h at 37°C as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis, and RNA was transfected into BHK-21 cells using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Once cytopathic effect was observed, cells were subjected to three rounds of freeze-thawing, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 rpm to pellet cell debris. Virus-containing supernatant was titrated and stored at Ϫ80°C. Plaque assays. BHK-21 cells at ϳ70 to 80% confluence in 6-well plates were infected with 10-fold dilutions of virus for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were overlaid with DMEM supplemented with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; ϳ0.35% each of low-and high-viscosity CMC) and 2% FBS and incu- 2B coding sequences. Frameshift translation would yield a 14-aa transframe protein termed 2B*, whose N terminus would be encoded in the polyprotein frame (blue) and whose C terminus would be encoded in the Ϫ1 frame (pink). bated at 37°C for 48 h. After incubation, cells were fixed using formal saline and stained using 0.1% toluidine blue. One-step growth curves. BHK-21 cells were infected with WT, SS, SCM or LVWT TMEV at an MOI of 10 and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with 2% DMEM. Virus was harvested at time points indicated below, and the titers were determined using a plaque assay. Competition assays. BHK-21 cells in six-well plates were infected with either WT and SS or WT and SCM at an MOI of 0.1. After adsorption, cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with 2% DMEM (2 ml) and incubated for 24 h, after which virus was harvested (passage 1) and 250 l was used to reinfect fresh BHK-21 cells. This was repeated five times. RNA was extracted from virus harvested at each passage using TRIzol-LS (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1,500 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 1 h at 42°C. The cDNA generated was used as the template for PCR amplification of a region encompassing the frameshift site using specifically designed primers. PCR products were purified using the Promega PCR purification kit and subsequently sequenced. Metabolic labeling. BHK-21 cells at 90 to 100% confluence in 24-well plates were infected with WT, SS, SCM, or LVWT TMEV at an MOI of 10. After 60 min adsorption at 37°C, virus inocula were removed by aspiration and replaced with 2% DMEM, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 6 h. Cells were subsequently washed once with methionine-free DMEM and incubated in 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM for 1 h. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine (200 Ci/ml) at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were scraped into 0.4 ml ice-cold PBS and spun at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 70 l Laemmli's sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (6 to 15%). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to phosphorimaging. Frameshifting efficiencies were estimated from band intensities quantified using the software ImageQuant TL, as described in Results. Antibodies. The antibody (Ab) against TMEV protein VP1 (mouse monoclonal) has been described previously (21) . Rat monoclonal antitubulin Ab, mouse monoclonal anti-HA Ab, and agarose-conjugated V5 and HA antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation of tagged viral proteins were from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 Ab was from Life Technologies, and IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting were from Li-Cor. Immunoblotting. BHK-21 cells were infected with TMEV WT or mutants thereof at an MOI of 10. Infected cells were lysed directly in Laemmli's sample buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on gels as indicated in the figure legends and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These were blocked for 30 to 60 min with 5% powdered milk (Marvel) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and probed at 4°C overnight with primary antibody. Membranes were washed in PBST prior to incubation in the dark with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST. Blots were scanned using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) . Mass spectrometry. Infected BHK-21 cells from a 25-cm 2 flask were washed in cold PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 8], 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40 substitute, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors and Benzonase (Merck) on ice for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 ϫ g at 4°C for 10 min. Cell lysates were incubated with 50 l of protein A Sepharose in RIPA buffer and 0.5 l of an irrelevant goat antibody for 1 h at 4°C with gentle mixing. Lysates were centrifuged through SigmaPrep columns at 8,200 ϫ g at 4°C for 1 min, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with 200 l of anti-V5 conjugated agarose beads (Abcam) on an end-over-end mixer at 4°C. Beads were washed three times in a high-salt wash (0.5 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.5]) before resuspension in Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 7 min to remove protein from the beads. Proteins were separated by elec-trophoresis on a 12% bis-Tris urea gel run in morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (Invitrogen) at 30 to 40 mA for optimal resolution. The gel was washed and stained using colloidal Coomassie blue, and bands were excised for mass spectrometry. Coomassie blue-stained products were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Peptides were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an Agilent 1200 series nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies) connected to a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon). Fragment MS/MS spectra were searched with the Mascot 2.3 search engine (Matrix Science) against a protein sequence database composed of expected viral target sequences and common contaminant proteins such as trypsin and keratins. Search parameters included a 5-ppm precursor mass tolerance and 0.6-Da MS/MS mass tolerance, three missed trypsin cleavages, and trypsin cleavage before proline plus a number of variable modifications, such as oxidation (M), oxidation (HW), phospho (ST), and phospho (Y). For the figures, spectra were autoannotated with xiSPEC (http://spectrumviewer .org). Dual-luciferase assays. BHK-21 cells were transfected in triplicate with the relevant plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in a 24-well plate. Transfected cells were incubated at 37°C for 18 h prior to infection with WT TMEV at an MOI of 10. Luciferase activities were determined using the dual-luciferase Stop & Glo reporter assay system (Promega) at 7 h postinfection (p.i.). Transfected cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 100 l of 1ϫ passive lysis buffer, and light emission was measured following injection of 50 l of either Renilla or firefly luciferase substrate. Firefly luciferase activity was calculated relative to the activity of Renilla luciferase, and frameshifting efficiencies were determined by comparing the ratio of firefly to Renilla enzymatic activities in parallel cell cultures transfected with either the test construct or an inframe control (IFC), as described previously (24) .
