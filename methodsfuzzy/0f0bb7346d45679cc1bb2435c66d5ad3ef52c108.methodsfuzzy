Isolation of neutrophils. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Second Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, China), and informed consent was obtained. Peripheral blood was collected from four 20-30-year-old female healthy volunteers between August and December 2015, who had been referred to The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and who provided informed, written consent. The blood was transferred into heparin lithium-containing tubes (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). The samples were processed within 1 h of collection. Whole blood was incubated with 3% dextran T-500 in the dark at room temperature for 20 min for sedimentation of red blood cells (RBCs). Following sedimentation, the white blood cell-enriched upper phase was layered over a Ficoll-Paque solution (GE Healthcare Life Science, Uppsala, Sweden). Centrifugation was performed at 427 x g at room temperature for 20 min without breaks, resulting in four distinct layers. The first three layers were discarded, and the remaining layer containing granulocytes and remnant RBCs was diluted in ACK lysis buffer (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were then washed with PBS, and the freshly isolated neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The purity of the isolated neutrophils was >90% based on Wright's staining and differential counts. Flow cytometry. The isolated neutrophils were diluted to 1x10 6 cells/ml with RPMI 1640 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The cells were then incubated with either vehicle (0.01% DMSO) or increasing concentrations of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis (100, 250 and 500 µg/ml) at 37˚C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. The specific method to obtain n-butanol extract from F. isatidis was described in previous study (22) . The cells were then stimulated with 0.5 µg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 4 h at 37˚C. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 50 µl FACS buffer. The cells were then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the following antibodies (the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer) for 30 min at 4˚C in the dark: FITC-conjugated anti-human CD181 (CXCR1; cat. no 11-1819-42), PE-conjugated anti-human CD182 (CXCR2; cat. no 12-1829-42) and APC-conjugated anti-human CD11b (cat no. 17-0118-42) or FITC-conjugated anti-human L-selectin (CD62L; cat. no 11-0629-42), PE-conjugated anti-human TLR4 (cat no. 12-9917-41) and APC conjugated anti-human TLR2 (cat no. 17-9922-42) (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies of the same isotype were used as negative controls. The cells were analyzed using a FACS calibur system (BD Biosciences). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for 10,000 cells in each sample was determined using CellQuest software, version 5.2 (BD Biosciences). Chemotaxis assays. The isolated neutrophils were pretreated as described above for 2 h and then stimulated with LPS (0.5 µg/ml) for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 1x10 6 cells/ml. The chemotaxis assays were performed using Transwell inserts (24 wells, 5 µm pore size; Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA), where 10,000 cells in 100 µl were loaded in the upper inserts and 600 µl of IL-8 (100 ng/ml; eBioscience; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing RPMI 1640 was added to the lower wells. Following co-incubation for 2 h at 37˚C and a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere, the inserts were removed, and the migrated neutrophils in the lower wells were collected and quantified according to myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity using a myeloperoxidase assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). RT-qPCR analysis was performed using an M-MLV Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 1 µg RNA was used for the determination. qPCR was performed in a 10 µl reaction volume containing 2 µl cDNA target, 2.25 µl SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), 0.25 µl sense primers, 0.25 µl anti-sense primers and 5.25 µl ddH 2 O. An Eppendorf Mastercycler realplex detection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used for RT-qPCR analysis: The reaction consisted of the following conditions: 95˚C for 3 min, followed by 95˚C for 15 sec, 60˚C for 30 sec, and 70˚C for 30 sec (40 cycles). The primers of the genes were synthesized by Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and the sequences were as follows: Human CXCR1, The result of real-time PCR was expressed as the threshold cycle (CT). The CT represents the PCR cycle at which the reported fluorescence rises above a set baseline threshold when the DNA amplicon is replicating exponentially (12) . Results were normalized to β-actin as plotted as relative expression to the average of CON or DMSO, which were set as 100. Quantification of IL-8. The neutrophils were pretreated for 2 h with the extract as described above, and then stimulated with LPS (0.5 µg/ml) for 1 or 4 h. The supernatant and cells were collected, and the levels of IL-8 in the supernatant were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (cat no. 88-8086-88; eBioscience; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total quantity of IL-8 in the supernatant was normalized to that of total protein in the viable cell pellets. Statistical analysis. All the experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean. All the data were statistically analyzed using Student's t test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
