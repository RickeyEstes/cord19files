MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), stained with Gel-Code Blue stain reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and quantified by scanning densitometry using OneDscan system (BD Biosciences, Rockville, MD). Purified S proteins were tested for total protein concentration (BCA bicinchoninic acid protein assay, Pierce Biochemicals) and particle size by dynamic light scattering using ZETASizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, PA) using standard, manufacturer recommended methods.
