Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 mL of the virus transport medium (VTM) using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or multiplex PCR was performed as described previously [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] for HHVs, including HSV-1 and -2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), CMV, Epstein Barr virus (EBV), HHV-6 and -7. Adenoviruses (ADVs), IFV types A and B, PIV types 1-3, RSV, Picornaviruses (PIC, including enteroviruses and rhinoviruses) using multiple RT-PCR assays [26, 27] (Table S1 ); And for human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using RT-PCR or and HBoV using nested-PCR assays [27] [28] [29] (Table S1). A positive (virus stock or DNA) and negative control (VTM only) in each set PCR assay was included to survey the possibility of laboratory contamination. All the methods were reported previously and validation in our lab [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The amplicons of positive for PIC were gel-purified for DNA sequencing using a QIAquick Gel Extraction (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed with specific primers using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit (version 3.1) on an ABI PRISM 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Enteroviruses (EV) or rhinoviruses were identified based on sequence alignment of amplicons.
