Library, bacteria, and reagents. The Human Single Fold scFv libraries I + J (Tomlinson I + J), Escherichia coli TG1 and HB2151 were kindly provided by MRC Geneservice. The ELISA plates coated with purified SARS-CoV lysate, positive and negative sera were provided by Military Medical Science Academic and HuaDa Gene Company (Beijing, China). NBT/BCIP (Sigma), polyhistidine mouse antibody (Sigma), AP-labeled anti-mouse antibody (SABC), and anti-M13 (Pharmacia) were all purchased from distributors. Other commonly used reagents are all of analytic purification grade and made in China. Panning assay. The panning procedure was performed on a 96-well flexible assay plate coated with purified SARS-CoV lysate, which was blocked directly with MPBS (PBS containing 4% skimmed milk powder) at room temperature for 2 h. After removal of the blocking solution, the plate was washed three times with PBS. Then 200 ll of the primary library solution (10 13 phages in 4% MPBS) was added into each well of the plate. After standing at room temperature for 2 h, the unspecific binding phages were washed away with PBS containing 0.1% Tween for 10 times (20 times in the second panning and 30 times in the third panning). The remaining phages were eluted with 1 ml of 0.2 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.2), and the elution fraction was subsequently neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). In parallel, 10 ml of E. coli TG1 cultured in 2· TY (OD 600 = 0.4) was infected with the eluted scFv-phages at 37°C for 30 min without shaking. Then a small proportion of infected E. coli TG1 was titrated in 4-fold dilutions, starting with 1:10, to determine the scFv-phage titer. Each dilution was spotted 10 ll separately on TYE plates (including 100 lg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose), which were cultured at 37°C overnight to titer the eluted scFv-phage by calculating clones on TYE plates. Meanwhile, the rest of infected E. coli TG1 was all spread on TYE plates. The next day, bacteria on the plates were scrapped and added into 100 ml of 2· TY with 100 lg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose for amplification. After this procedure, the phages were rescued by helper phage M13K07 for the next round of selection. Three rounds of selections were performed. Preparation of scFv-phage. In the last selection round, individual clones were randomly picked out from the TYE plate to different wells (100 ll of 2· TY with 100 lg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose was added in advance) of a flexible ELISA plate. After culturing, a small inoculum (2 ll) from each well was transferred to a second ELISA plate containing 200 ll of 2· TY with 100 lg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose per well. The original ELISA plate was stored at 4°C temporarily. The transferred plate was shaken at 37°C for 2 h, and phages were rescued in E. coli TG1 by adding 10 9 helper phages to each well, the plate was shaken at 37°C for 1 h before spinning the plate at 1800g for 10 min. The supernatant was thrown away and the pellet was suspended in 200 ll of 2· TY containing 100 lg/ml ampicillin and 50 lg/ml kanamycin, and cultured at 30°C, 250 rpm overnight. The overnight culture was spun at 1800g for 10 min and 50 ll of the supernatant containing scFv-phage was used in monoclonal phage ELISA. Monoclonal scFv-phage ELISA. A 72-well flexible ELISA plate coated with SARS-CoV lysate was blocked and washed as described above. Then 50 ll scFv-phage supernatant was added into each well of the plate. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plate was washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween. Subsequently, 100 ll HRP-anti-M13 (1:5000 dilution in 4% MPBS) was added to each well. After incubation for an additional 1 h at 37°C, the wells were washed again, and 100 ll fresh substrate solution (100 lg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 30% hydrogen peroxide) was added to each well. Enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 50 ll of 2 N H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and evaluated by S/N (sample/negative). DNA sequencing. Two stronger positive clones (B5 and B9) in monoclonal phage ELISA were sequenced by Shanghai Casarray and Gene (Shanghai, China). Two sequencing primers were used: forward primer 5 0 -CGA CCC GCC ACC GCC GCT G-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -CTA TGC GGC CCC ATT CA-3 0 . Expression and Western-blot assay. The selected scFv-phage was inoculated into E. coli HB2151 to express a soluble scFv antibody. In briefly, E. coli HB2151 was grown in 2· TY media at 37°C until OD 600 = 0.4. Fifty microliters of the culture was infected with 1 ll scFv-phage from a single colony, incubated for 30 min at 37°C without shaking,and plated on TYE agar with 100 lg/ml ampicillin, a single colony was picked out from this plate, inoculated into 5 ml of 2· TY with 1% glucose and 100 lg/ml ampicillin, and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm). The next day, 50 ll of the overnight culture was transferred to another fresh 2· TY (0.1% glucose and 100 lg/ml ampicillin) and grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 37°C until OD 600 = 0.9. IPTG was added into the culture to 1 mM final concentration, and shaking was continued (200 rpm) at 30°C. One milliliter of the culture was aspirated after 0, 2, 4, and 6 h of adding IPTG. The obtained samples were disposed off by the traditional methods and then subjected to electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE. The whole bacteria protein was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane from the gel in 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, and 2% methanol at 65 V for 4 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% MPBS for 2 h before washing with PBS. Then, 5 ml of anti-His-tag mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution in 5% MPBS) was incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 2 h. Bound polyhistidine mouse antibody was detected with anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000). Bands were detected with the addition of BCIP/ NBT. Production and purification of SA59B scFv-antibody. In order to acquire large quantities of purified SA59B scFv-antibody, overnight activated E. coli HB2151 (infected by positive scFv-phage) culture was transferred to 300 ml of 2· TY (0.1% glucose and 100 lg/ml ampicillin) in a 1:100 mass ratio, and grown at 37°C, 250 rpm to an A 600 of 0.6. Expression of the scFv-antibody was induced by addition of IPTG at a 1 mM final concentration. After induction at 30°C for 6 h, the cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and 4000g for 10 min, and were washed with a suspension in 40 ml PBS, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 4°C and 10,000g for 10 min. The cells pelleted were stored at À20°C for further use. The cells were suspended in 40 ml PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged at 25,000g for 20 min. The supernatant fluid was applied to a column (1.0 by 10.0 cm) with His-bond Ni Affinity Resin in the presence of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 mM sodium chloride, and 250 mM imidazole. After extensive washing with about 100 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 mM sodium chloride, and 20 mM imidazole, bound protein was eluted with approximately 100 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 mM sodium chloride, and 250 mM imidazole followed by extensive dialysis against PBS, pH 7.4. Purity of all proteins was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie blue stain. Labeling of SA59B scFv-antibody with HRP. The purified SA59B scFv-antibody was labeled with HRP by the glutaraldehyde method. SA59B-HRP ELISA. ELISA was used to further measure HRPlabeled SA59B scFv-antibody (SA59B-HRP) response to SARS-CoV lysate. SA59B-HRP solution was titrated in 4-fold dilutions, starting with 1:10, to determine the antibody titer. A flexible ELISA plate coated with SARS-CoV lysate was prepared. As negative control, three wells were coated with control lysate. After three washes with PBS, the plates were blocked with 4% MPBS. The wells were emptied and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with SA59B-HRP conjugates at various concentrations. A commercially available SARS convalescent serum-HRP conjugate was used as a control. The wells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 100 ll substrate solution (see Monoclonal scFv-phage ELISA). Fifty microliters of 2 M sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Statistical assay. The Student t test was used for Statistical analysis. All data are shown as means ± SD. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.
