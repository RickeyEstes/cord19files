Animals, accommodation, handling and biosafety. Ferrets were acquired from a colony free of infection by influenza H1 and H3 subtypes. Two male ferrets aged 11-13 months, four female guinea pigs, five female BALB/c mice aged 12 wks, and five female BALB/c mice aged over 12 months were used in each of the AchPV1 and AchPV2 observational studies. Eight female ferrets and eight female guinea pigs were used for the AchPV2 time course study. The animal husbandry methods and experimental design were approved by the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory's Animal Ethics Committee (approvals AEC 1608 and AEC 1621) and were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Animals were housed at Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) in conventional caging systems to facilitate the expression and monitoring of natural behaviours, given complete premium dry food appropriate to the species, dietary treats, and provided with water ad libitum. Room temperature was maintained at 22 °C with 15 air changes per hour and humidity varied between 40 and 60%. Before any manipulation occurred, such as exposure to virus, collection of clinical samples or euthanasia, animals were immobilised with a mixture of ketamine HCl (Ketamil ® : 5 mg/kg in ferrets, 16 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 75 mg/kg in mice) and medetomidine (Domitor ® : 50 µg/kg in ferrets, 20 µg/kg in guinea pigs, 1 mg/kg in mice) by intramuscular or intraperitoneal (mice) injection. Where indicated, reversal was achieved with atipamazole (Antisedan ® ) administered by intramuscular (ferrets) or intraperitoneal (guinea pigs and mice) injection at 50% of the medetomidine volume. All animals were implanted subcutaneously with temperature-sensing microchips (Lifechip ® ). Staff wore powered air purifying respirators, coveralls, impervious gloves and boots while in animal rooms.
