While the insolubility of viral proteins has hindered studies using methods of classical protein chemistry, it is an advantage in permitting the fractionation of virus particles into subviral components on the basis of physical properties (usually sedimentation coefficient and buoyant density). In principle, a given viral polypeptide is associated with only one type of structural component. Thus separation of viral spikes, nucleocapsids, spikeless particles or isolated envelopes may yield isolated polypeptides, and in any event serves as a starting point for further subfractionation by other procedures. Viral polypeptides may be obtained directly from sodium dodecylsulfate-potyacrylamide gels, but biological activities are lost and removal of dodecylsulfate may present a problem. With some strains of influenza virus, it is possible to isolate the two surface components, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, after dodecylsulfate treatment at room temperature, and retain biological activity [52] . The neuraminidase of a dodecylsulfate-sensitive strain has been isolated by treatment with Nonidet P-40 and chromatography on DEAE-eellulose column [105] . Scheid and co-workers [54] described a procedure which separates each of the envelope polypeptides of the parainfluenza virus SV5 with full recovery of biological activity. Treatment with 2 o//o Triton X-100 in the presence of 0.5 M KC1 solubilizes the two viral glycoproteins as well as the non-glycosylated membrane protein. After dialysis against low ionic strength buffer, the non-glycosylated protein precipitates, leaving the glycoproteins in solution. The two glycoproteins can be separated by sedimentation on a sucrose gradient containing 1 M KCI and 1 ~,, Triton. A similar proceclure was used to separate the glycoproteins of NDV [77] and Triton treatment was also used to isolate the glycoprotein of VSV [86, 106] . Thus this procedure may be generally useful in the isolation of viral glycoproteins. Triton is readily removed from the protein preparation by butanol extraction, and full recovery of hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities was obtained with the SV5 and NDV glycoproteins. Separation of detergent-solubilized proteins of VSV in a two-phase polyethyleneglycol-dextran sulfate system was used by Bishop and Roy [26] to isolate the glycoprotein, membrane protein, and a ribonucleoprotein complex from VSV. When treatment of virions with the detergent Triton N-101 was followed by polyethyleneglycol-dextran sulfate extraction, only the glycoprotein was present in the polyethyleneglycol phase. After addition of 1 M NaC1 to the dextran phase and reextraction with polyethyleneglycol, all of the membrane protein was present in the new polyethyleneglycol phase. The remaining proteins, RNA, and viral RNA polymerase activity were recovered in the dextran phase. Polypeptides of several enveloped viruses have also been isolated by dissociation with guanidine HC1 followed by gel filtration in the presence of guanidine-HCl [45, 107] .
