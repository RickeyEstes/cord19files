Weanling mice inoculated with MHV1 in the above dose were killed oIn the 6th day (unless otherwise stated). The surfaces of the liver were examined both before and after they had been bled by severance of the aorta. The liver lesions were recorded in the following way: . 2 Coalescence of focal lesions to give generalised liver abnormality . 3 Liver bright yellow background with haemorrhagic areas . 4 Mouse dead with liver appearance as in the last group 5 W eanling Albany mice inoculated only with MHV l scored mostlv 1, with 0 and 2 scored quite often. About 1 in 20 scored 3 and none scored 4 or 5 during these experiments. In mice inoculated with an agent able to potentiate MHV 1, mice which scored 3, 4 or 5 were regarded as infected with the potentiating agent. Thus, when E. coccoides was used to potentiate MHV1 in Albanv mice, more than half were dead by the 6th day after the vTirus inoculation and the remainder scored 3 and 4. The method adopted for the indirect titration of agents which potentiate MHr 1 was intraperitoneal inoculation of decimal dilutions of the agent in SS broth into groups of mice in the usual doses. This was followed by the intraperitoneal inoculation of MHV71 in the usual dose. The age of mice used for inoculation of the potentiating agent was selected so that the potentiation would be maximal when they reached 20-28 days, the age at which MHV1 was inoculated. Weanling mice satisfied this condition for Friend agent and baby mice for Moloney agent. A group inoculated with MHVl without any potentiating agent was also included. As indicated above, any mice which scored more than 2 were regarded as infected with the potentiating agent and the ID50 was calculated from the proportion infected at each dilution bv the method of Reed and Muench (1938) . For direct titrations, groups of mice were inoculated with dilutions of leukaemia agent, as with indirect titrations. With Friend agent they were killed after 14 days and infected mice then showed obvious splenomegaly. For precision each spleen heavier than 0-2 g. was considered infected. This weight was rather more than double that of the average normal spleen which was 0 09 g. In fact, most infected spleens were much heavier than 0-2 g (mean about 0-9 g.). With Moloney agent, mice were examined daily. Any which developed easily palpable lymph nodes were killed and the diagnosis based on the gross lesions. To terminate an -experiment all survivors were killed and diagnosis of leukaemia was again based on lesions seen at autopsy. The ID50 was calculated, as in the indirect titration, -from the proportion of infected mice in each diltution.
