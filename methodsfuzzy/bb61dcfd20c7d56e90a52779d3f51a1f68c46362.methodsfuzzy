2.1. Animals. Eight-to ten-week-old wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 (Janvier, Le Genest-sur-isle, France) and littermate IL-33 knockout (KO) C57Bl/6 mice (matched for age and sex) were provided by Dr. Jean-Philippe Girard [21] . The mice used in the study were certified as MHV3-free by the manufacturer, and they were housed under HEPA-filtered air (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) in the local BSL3 animal facility. The study was conducted in compliance with the French laws and the institution's guidelines for animal welfare, and the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the French government (agreement of M. Samson number 3596). All efforts were made to minimize suffering and pain of the animals.
