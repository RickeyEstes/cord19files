Cell culture. Infections. Subconfluent monolayers (90% confluency) of A549 cells were infected with Sendai virus (SeV, Cantell strain, Charles River Laboratories) at 5-40 hemagglutinin units (HAU)/10 6 cells as indicated in serum free medium (SFM). At 2 h post-infection, the medium was supplemented with 10% HI-FBS and the infection pursued for the indicated time. Infection with RSV A2 (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc), amplified and purified as described in 37 , was performed at a MOI of 1-3 as indicated in medium containing 2% HI-FBS. Where indicated, A549 were pretreated with 5 μM MG132 (Calbiochem) or DMSO (vehicle, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h before infection. Pretreatment with 10 μM SB203580 and 10 μM SP600125 (Invivogen) or the corresponding vehicle DMSO was performed for 30 min prior to infection. Plasmid transfection. Plasmid transfection in A549 cells was achieved using the TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Briefly, a total of 3 μg of DNA was transfected per 35 mm plates of A549 cells at 70% confluency using a transfection reagent/DNA ratio of 1:2. Transfection was pursued for 24 h to 48 h before further treatment, as indicated.
