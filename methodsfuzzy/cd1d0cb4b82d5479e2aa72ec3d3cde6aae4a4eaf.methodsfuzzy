Animals. X-SCID rats were obtained from Kyoto University, Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan, on 2 June 2015 subsequent to a 3-month quarantine at Charles River, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). They were housed in numbers of 2 adults or fewer per static microisolator cage on sterilized hardwood chip bedding, fed irradiated Purina LabDiet rodent chow 5P76, and given water ad libitum. All rats were housed in a separate cubicle within the animal facility's repository. The breeding scheme of this colony was pair-timed mating with weaning at 28 days. All animal procedures conformed to NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh (protocol number 16048182). The University of Pittsburgh's Animal Care and Use Program (ACUP) (unit number 000496) is fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). Testing for rat infections. For rodent health surveillance and disease detection, quarterly diagnostic screening, including serology (multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay [MFIA]), PCR, and parasitology, were performed by Charles River, Inc., Research Animal Diagnostic Services (Wilmington, MA) ( Table 1) . At each bedding change, soiled bedding from each of the cages was added to the sentinel (Sprague-Dawley rat) cage, thus exposing the sentinels to diseases carried by colony animals. For lung sections, Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) staining was performed on 5-m-thick tissue sections for the detection of fungal elements. Histology and immunohistochemical staining. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5-m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for evaluation by light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed according to a previously published protocol (21) . Briefly, slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through sequential ethanol solutions. Following incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min, epitope retrieval was performed using 1 mM EDTA buffer, pH 8.0 (125°C for 3 min and 90°C for 15 s), in an antigen retrieval chamber (Decloaking Chamber; Biocare Medical). Sections were incubated with serum-free protein block buffer (Dako), followed by primary antibodies diluted in antibody buffer (1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 0.1% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline [ [42] ). Tissue sections were developed with mouse EnVision polymer (Dako) for 30 min at room temperature, reacted with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako), and counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako). Genomic DNA extraction from FFPE or fresh tissue. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of heart and parotid gland tissues using the QIamp DNA FFPE tissue kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For genomic DNA isolation from fresh tissues, harderian and parotid gland tissues were minced in 1 ml of PBS, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 6,000 ϫ g. The tissue pellets were incubated in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS) with proteinase K (Promega) added to a 0.5-mg/ml final concentration overnight at 56°C with gentle shaking. This tissue solution was extracted with an equal amount of phenol chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; Amresco) for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 ϫ g (Eppendorf 5424R). The aqueous layer was transferred into a new tube and mixed with 0.5 vol of 7.5 M ammonium acetate, 2 vol of 100% ethanol. After centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 ϫ g, the DNA pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, air dried, and subsequently dissolved in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Rolling circle amplification, PCR, and sequencing. FFPE tissue DNA was subjected to rolling circle amplification (RCA) using phi29 DNA polymerase (TempliPhi; GE Healthcare). Consensus PCR was carried out using 1/10 of the RCA template, consensus primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (NEB) supplemented with Thermopol buffer. The cycling conditions for HPyV T-Ag primers or VP1-1 primers were initial denaturation for 5 min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles each of 95°C for 30 s, 45°C for 1 min, and 68°C for 1 min and a final elongation at 68°C for 5 min. Nested PCR was performed with consensus VP1-2 primers, using 4 l of the first PCR product as the template, at 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles each of 95°C for 30 s, 53°C for 1 min, and 68°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 68°C for 5 min. PCR products were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, and DNA was purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) prior to sequencing (MCLAB). Based on the initial sequencing analysis, virus-specific contig primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) were synthesized (IDT) and used to amplify the entire genome with Q5 high-fidelity Taq polymerase (NEB). For genome-walking PCR, we used DNA isolated from fresh harderian and parotid gland tissues. The cycling conditions for overlapping contigs were 3 min at 98°C, followed by 35 cycles each of 98°C for 10 s, 60 to 66°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min and a final elongation at 72°C for 2 min. PCR samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel, extracted (Qiagen), and sequenced (MCLAB). Sequence analysis and genome assembly were done using ContigExpress and Vector NTI software (Invitrogen). Analysis of the predicted protein sequences for family domains was performed with Motif Scan on the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Phylogenetic analysis. Currently, known polyomavirus annotated maps and protein sequences are given at http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/Lco/PyVE.asp. The full-length VP1 and LT protein sequences were aligned by ClustalW, and the phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, implemented in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 7 (MEGA7) software package (43) . The phylogenetic trees were visualized using iTOL (http://itol.embl.de/) (44) . Accession number(s). The RatPyV2 genome has been deposited in GenBank under accession number KX574453.
