Small scale plasrnid DNA preparations were done using the alkali-SDS method essentially as described by Birnboim and Dnly (1979) . Large quantities of plasmids to be used for in vitro transcription were prepared by lysozyme-Triton lysis of the bacteria, followed by CsC1-EtBr banding (Kahn et al., 1979) . EtBr was removed by several extractions with isopropanol and, after fivefold dilution, the DNA was precipitated twice with ethanol and further purified over a Biorad A-50m column. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were used according to the suppliers instructions. Removal of the 3' sticky end from the Sac I site in pGEM2-alphaG (Zerial et al., 1986) with T4 DNA Polymerase was done at 15째C (2 h), dNTPs were added (end concentration 100 #M each), and the DNA was subsequently filled in at 15째C for 1 h. All ligations were done at 24째C for 4 h except for linker ligations (4째C, 16 h). All other molecular biological manipulations were done using slightly modified standard protocols (Maniatis et al., 1982) .
