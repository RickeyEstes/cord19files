Mice. Specific-pathogen-free C57BL/6 (B6) (C57BL/6NTac) and B6.SJL-Ptprca/BoyAiTac mice, which are C57BL/6 mice that express the congenic CD45.1 allele of the Ptprc (protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, receptor type c locus) gene, were purchased from Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY). Breeding pairs of the Stat4 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (13) on the B6 background were a gift from Mark H. Kaplan of Indiana University, B6 IfngR Ϫ/Ϫ mice (25) with control WT mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), and Ifnar Ϫ/Ϫ mice (24) on the B6 background were a gift from Murali-Krishna Kaja of the University of Washington. All mice except B6.SJL mice expressed the CD45.2 allele. Genetically mutated mice were bred and maintained in isolation facilities at Brown University through brother-sister mating. All mice used in experiments were 5 to 12 weeks old. Animals obtained from sources outside Brown University were housed in the animal care facility for at least 1 week before use. Handling of mice and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal care and use. Virus, infections and treatments. For LCMV infection experiments, mice were either uninfected (0 h after infection) or infected i.p. with 5 ϫ 10 4 PFU of LCMV Armstrong strain, clone E350 (7, 9, 17) . For IL-12 blocking experiments, animals were injected with either 750 g or 1 mg of anti-IL-12p40 (anti-IL-12/23, clone C17.8; BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) or control rat IgG2a (clone 2A3; BioXCell) antibodies 12 h prior to LCMV infection and 36 h prior to treatment with 20 g of LPS (from Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Samples from LPStreated mice were harvested 6 h after treatment (22) . (The levels of efficacy of treatment with either 750 g or 1 mg of anti-IL-12 were similar.) For IFNAR blocking experiments, animals were injected with 250 g of anti-IFNAR1 (clone MAR1-5A3; Leinco Technologies, St. Louis, MO) or control IgG antibodies 12 h prior to LCMV infection. For NK depletion experiments, animals were injected with 500 g of anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136; BioXCell) or control IgG2a antibodies at 36 or 12 h prior to LCMV infection. Sample preparation. PECs were extracted on the indicated days of infection. LCMV-infected and control uninfected (0) mice were anesthetized and bled retro-orbitally to collect serum samples. Mice were humanely sacrificed, by cervical dislocation after anesthetization, and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 5 ml of cold serum-free RPMI medium (Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Mice were gently agitated to increase PEC suspension in lavage medium. For analysis of surface marker expression or total STAT levels, PECs were resuspended in staining buffer containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and then prepared for flow cytometric analysis as described below. For examination of intracellular IFN-␥, PECs were resuspended in complete media containing 5 g/ml brefeldin A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), without additional stimulation, for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were then stained as described below. Peritoneal lavage fluids and serum samples were aliquoted and stored at Ϫ80°C for later use in cytokine and viral titer measurements. Adoptive transfers. Total donor PECs from uninfected mice (CD45.2) were isolated as described above and resuspended in 300 l of RPMI medium. These cells were injected i.p. into uninfected recipient mice (CD45.1). Recipient mice were rested for 1 h and either left uninfected or infected with LCMV as described above. Staining to identify donor and recipient cell populations was performed as described below using an anti-CD45.1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody. Flow cytometric analysis. Detection of surface markers, intracellular IFN-␥, and intracellular total STAT1 and STAT4 was done with minor modifications as previously described (9, 46) . Briefly, PECs were incubated with 2.4G2 antibody (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH) to block nonspecific binding to the Fc receptor. Cell surface staining was then performed with antibodies specific for the following: TCR-␤-FITC, TCR-␤peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP), NK1.1-phycoerythrin (PE) (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA), TCR-␦-FITC, and CD45.1-FITC (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For cell surface staining only, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. For intracellular staining of IFN-␥, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and then stained with IFN-␥-allophycocyanin (APC) (BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining of total STAT1 and STAT4, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm and then further fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold pure methanol. Subsequent staining was performed with combinations of STAT1-PE and STAT4-APC (custom prepared by BD Biosciences). The following isotype controls were included in each experiment: mouse IgG2a, mouse IgG2b, mouse IgG1, rat IgG1, rat IgG2a, rat IgG2b, and hamster IgG (BD Biosciences or eBioscience). Samples were acquired using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with the Cell-Quest Pro software package (BD Biosciences). Laser outputs were 15 mW at 488-and 635-nm wavelengths. At least 120,000 events were collected within a live-cell gate that was determined by forward and side scatter. Analysis of flow cytometric data was performed using FlowJo9 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). To ensure proper identification of the NK cell population in PECs, NK1.1-positive cells were costained with markers identifying TCR-␣/␤ and TCR-␥/␦ T cells. A lymphocyte gate was set to maximize inclusion of NK1.1 ϩ cells at different times after infection, and it was identified as an "extended lymphocyte gate." Using this scheme, Ͻ5% of the NK1.1 ϩ cells were TCR-␦ ϩ under naive conditions; after LCMV infection, the population was reduced to Ͻ2%, and the cells were not producing IFN-␥ (data not shown). NK1.1 ϩ cells that were TCR-␤ ϩ (NK T cells) represented approximately 30% of the total NK1.1 ϩ population at day 0. After LCMV infection, this population was again diminished to Ͻ5%, and the IFN-␥ produced by these cells represented only about 3% of the total IFN-␥ ϩ cells. Thus, all experiments defined NK cells to be NK1.1 ϩ TCR-␤ Ϫ . Cytokine measurements. IFN-␥ and IL-12p70 were measured in the peritoneal lavage fluid or the serum using the mouse inflammation kit cytometric bead assay (BD Biosciences). The limits of detection were 2.5 pg/ml for IFN-␥ and 10.7 pg/ml for IL-12p70. IFN-␣ and IFN-␤ were measured in the peritoneal lavage fluid or the serum using the VeriKine mouse IFN-␣ or mouse IFN-␤ ELISA kits, respectively (PBL Interferon-Source, Piscataway, NJ). The limits of detection for these assays were 12.5 pg/ml for IFN-␣ and 15.6 pg/ml for IFN-␤. The IL-12p40 ELISA, with a limit of detection of 100 pg/ml, was done as previously described (8) . LCMV plaque assay. LCMV titers were determined as previously described (7, 17) . Briefly, peritoneal lavage fluids were thawed from storage at Ϫ80°C and serially diluted. Samples were overlaid onto Vero cell monolayers and incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h. Plaques were allowed to form upon overlay of samples with a 50:50 mixture of agarose-medium 199 (Sigma) for 3 days and then visualized using neutral red staining (Sigma). Included in each assay were positive LCMV control samples and negative controls (uninfected animals). Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was determined using the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.
