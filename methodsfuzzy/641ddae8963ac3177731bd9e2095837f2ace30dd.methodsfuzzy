Indoor air motion is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations for conservation of momentum and by conservation of mass and have been solved using a variety of approximation and closure methods over the past 40 years. They are not provided here because they appear in numerous references [17] [18] [19] . For this study, CFD simulations were performed using the Fluent v.6.1.22 software (Fluent, Inc., Lebanon, NH), with mesh generation from the Gambit v.2.3.16 pre-processor. The Fluent software is designed to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations by a selected approximation model and then solve the set of equations for the designated boundary conditions using a finite volume method. A transient simulation was performed for studying the time evolution of nuclei transport. For these simulations, the realizable k$e method was employed because it has been proven to model separating flows with better accuracy than the standard k$e method but is not as time-consuming to run as a large eddy simulation [19] . The room geometry, modeled after the geometry used in Huang and Tsao [12] , is shown in Fig. 1 . The room is 5.5 m wide, 3.6 m deep, and 2.3 m high. The 2.2 m wide, 2.15 m deep, 2.3 m high bathroom within the AIIR was removed from the domain because it was assumed to be treated as a separate zone. The bed containing the patient was centered at x ¼ 4 m with the back of the bed against the bottom wall of the AIIR (when looking at Fig. 1 ). The bed/patient was 1 m wide, 1.9 m deep, and 0.7 m high. The patient's head was an ellipsoid with a 0.001225 m 2 strip across the front to represent the nose and mouth area. This area matched that simulated by Huang and Tsao [12] , although they used a cubic representation for the head. Last, the 1.62 m tall health care worker was centered at x ¼ 3.2 m, y ¼ 0.645 m. This height was selected based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 50th percentile female height for all ethnicities in the United States [3] . The body geometry of the health care worker approximated human geometry with an ellipsoidal head, rounded shoulders and torso, and straight legs. However, limbs were not modeled. The health care worker geometry is shown in Fig. 2 . Boundary conditions used for the airflow simulation are shown in Table 1 . An air exchange rate of 8.66 air changes per hour (ACH) was employed to match the optimized ventilation conditions found by Huang and Tsao [12] . Three types of boundaries were used in the simulation. Boundary conditions for velocity inlets into the room were established for air movement under the door crack, the ventilation inlet, and the patient's mouth. As performed in Huang and Tsao [12] , a grille-style inlet was used to produce unidirectional airflow into the room. Following Huang and Tsao [12] , no bathroom zone was represented, so a negatively pressurized door crack to the bathroom was not included in this simulation. If a door were located behind the health care worker, classical ventilation work on slot exhaust velocities [20] and more recent CFD work on this [21] (assuming that a bathroom would be negatively pressurized) can be consulted to estimate the impact. It would be expected that a door crack of area 0.012 m 2 would exert air movement in the direction of the wall within approximately 0.3 m of the crack at the floor. Given that the primary area of interest in the simulation is the breathing zone area around the health care worker and above the patient, all of which are at least 0.5 m above the zone of interest, the impact of a door crack leading to the bathroom would be expected to be negligible. Wall boundary designations meant that no-slip and no-flow conditions were established for those geometric entities. Thermal boundary conditions were also included to consider the effect of temperature gradients on air and contaminant motion. The AIIR walls, floor, and ceilings all had wall designations set to a temperature of 297.15 K except for the outer wall, which is set at 303.15 K. The bed, patient's body, health care worker's body, and health care worker's head were also designated as wall boundaries. The temperatures used in Huang and Tsao [12] were replicated for the ventilation units, patient head, and bed. For the health care worker, the body temperature was 307.75 K to reflect the insulation properties of clothing, and the head was set to 308.75 K for normal body temperature. Simulations were performed on three successively finer tetrahedral meshes with 36 Â 36 Â 16, 72 Â 72 Â 32, and 144 Â 144 Â 64 elements. The grid convergence index was used to determine the error resulting from mesh size [22] : where F s is a factor of safety, e is the relative L 2 error norm of the velocity magnitude, r is the mesh refinement ratio, and p is the order of the method. In this study, F s was designated to be 1.25 here because three meshes were examined, based on Roache's criteria, r was 2 because the mesh spacing was halved during each refinement, and p was 2 because a second-order solution method is employed [22] . Grid convergence testing at 88 locations within the vicinity of the patient (3.25pxp4.5, 0.325pyp0.55, and 0.9pzp1.35) yielded a relative GCI of 5.05 Â 10 À4 . Validation of the specific scenario modeled is not provided because no experimental velocity data exist for the case of the health care worker positioned alongside the patient. In fact, Huang and Tsao [12] did not actually validate their grid-independent simulation with their boundary conditions because they did not measure velocity in their experiments. To demonstrate the validity of the code while accounting for the lack of available velocity data for the AIIR, Huang and Tsao [12] simulated a different ventilated room where the air velocity was measured by Chung and Hsu [23] with comparable results. To instill the reader with confidence in the simulations presented here, a simple comparison is provided. Huang and Tsao [12] declared that, for all simulations, velocity was reduced to 0.09 m/s at 0.10 m from the patient's mouth. Fig. 3 shows velocity as a function of distance, d, from the mouth for this simulation. Near the mouth, velocity decreases logarithmically from the mouth as u ¼ À0.0333 ln(d)+0.0157. Velocity is estimated to be 0.092 m/s at a distance of 0.10 m from the mouth based on the modeled data. A comparison is also made for the concentration data. This is presented after the particle simulation description below.
