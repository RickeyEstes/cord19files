Design of the mock-virome. The mock-virome consists of known concentrations (ranging from there is no reason to expect a different behaviour than any other ssRNA virus in any step of our procedure. We believe that the morphological and physicochemical properties of all know bacteriophages are covered by the nine viruses selected. Porcine circovirus 2, feline panleukopenia virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus and bovine herpesvirus were kindly provided by Sebastiaan Theuns and Hans Nauwynck (University of Ghent). The mimivirus was provided by Didier Raoult (Université de la Méditerranée). Inge Hanssen from Scientia Terrae VZW provided the pepino mosaic virus. The BK polyomavirus was provided by Robert Snoeck and Dimitrios Topalis (KU Leuven). The LIMEstone virus was obtained from Rob Lavigne (KU Leuven). Timo Vesikari (University of Tampere) provided the WC3 rotavirus. Except for the LIMEstone virus (arrived at 4 °C) all virus stocks were frozen upon arrival and were then thawn for q(RT)PCR quantification. Preparation of the mock communities was done with their original cell culture media, followed by aliquotation and freezing again at − 80 °C before final use. For all the viruses, specific q(RT)-PCR assays and standards were either developed or retrieved from literature [40] [41] [42] (Table S1 ). Design of the bacterial mock-community. The bacterial mock-community consists of known concentrations of four different bacteria representative for the majority of bacterial phyla in the gut (Table S2) . Lactobacillus acidophilus (Firmicutes) and Bifidobacterium animalis are Gram-positive (Actinobacteria), whereas Escherichia coli (Proteobacteria) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bacteroidetes) are Gram-negative. For each member in our mock-community, a qPCR assay targeting a unique and specific region was developed or retrieved from literature 43 . In addition, to quantify the number of 16S rRNA copies of the Bacteroides genus an additional qPCR assay was used (Table S3 ). The number of 16S copies for the other bacterial species was not determined because the structure of ribosomes is highly conserved among bacterial species, and were therefore not expected to behave differently in our experiments. All bacterial strains were acquired from the Belgian Co-ordinated Collection of Micro-organisms (BCCM) in their growing medium with the following LGM accession numbers: 13550 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), 2092 (Escherichia coli), 18906 (Bifidobacterium animalis) and 11262 (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron). The bacterial mock-community was assembled from its original growing stocks and no buffers/medium were added and aliquots were made and preserved at − 80 °C to ensure one freeze-thaw cycle. Homogenisation. Mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were homogenised using a tissue homogeniser (MINILYS, Bertin technologies). A 200 μ L stock of mock-virome or bacterial mock-community were subjected to different homogenisation speeds (3000 rpm or 5000 rpm) with or without the presence of ceramic beads (Ø0.1 mm (CK01-2 ml, Precellys) or Ø2.8 mm (CK28-2 ml, Precellys)). All samples were homogenised for 1 min. After homogenisation, samples were treated for 2 hours at 37 °C with a cocktail of 1 μ l microccocal nuclease (NEB) and 2 μ l of benzonase (Millipore) and 7 μ l of homemade buffer (1M Tris, 100 mM CaCl 2 and 30 mM MgCl 2 , pH 8) and extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) without carrier RNA. Centrifugation. Samples were centrifuged using a bench top centrifuge (Heraeus pico 17, Thermoscientific). Two-hundred μ l of mock-virome or bacterial mock-community was centrifuged at 100 g or 17000 g for 3 min or 30 min. Subsequently, samples underwent nuclease treatment, nucleic acids extraction and qPCR assays as described above. Filtration. Aliquots of 1000 μ l containing mock-virome or bacterial mock-community were filtered through a 0.8-μ m centrifugal (PES) filter (VK01P042, Sartorius), a 0.8-μ m polycarbonate (PC) filter (ATTP14250, Millipore), a 0.45-μ m centrifugal filter (UFC40HV00, Millipore) or a 0.22-μ m centrifugal filter (UFC40GV00, Millipore). The 0.8-μ m PC filter was pre-wetted with nuclease-free water prior to filtration to enhance performance. After filtration, samples underwent a nuclease treatment, nucleic acids extraction and qPCR assays as described above. Chloroform treatment. Mock-virome or bacterial mock-community (150 μ l) were incubated with 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% (%v/v) of chloroform and incubated for 60 min in a ferris wheel at 10 rpm (model L23, Labinco BV). After the chloroform treatment, samples underwent a nuclease treatment, nucleic acids extraction and qPCR assays as described above. Random amplification. Random amplification of nucleic acids was performed using the Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit 2 (WTA2, Sigma Aldrich) according to manufacturer's instructions with the exception of the initial denaturation step which was performed at 95 °C instead of 70 °C in order to also denature double-stranded DNA or RNA to make it available for the amplification. In addition, the number of amplification cycles was varied between 7, 12, 17 and 22. WTA2 products were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and amplification efficiency was determined for every virus and bacteria using qPCR assays as described above. Illumina sequencing. Mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were pooled in 1:1 ratio to a total of 1.5 mL and homogenised for 1 min at 3000 rpm with a MINILYS homogeniser. Aliquots of the pooled sample were then centrifuged for 3 min at 17000 g, and/or filtered through 0.8 (PES/PC) μ m or 0.45-μm/0.22-μm filter. Samples underwent a nuclease treatment, nucleic acids, extraction and random amplification as previously described. qPCR assays were performed for the mock-virome and the bacterial mock communities' amplified WTA product. An NGS library preparation was performed using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacter's instructions except that 1) the tagmentation time was decreased to 4 min, 2) input DNA was increased to 1.2 ng/μ l and 3) reagents' quantities were halved to increase the average size of the DNA fragments. Fragment sizes were determined using a High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) and run in a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Libraries were quantified with the KAPA Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems) and sequencing was performed on a HiSeq ™ 2500 platform (Illumina) for 2 × 150 cycles. Each sample was attributed a total of 10 million paired end reads. The obtained sequence reads were subjected to a bioinformatics pipeline comprising deduplication (FastUniq) 44 , quality and adapter trimming (Trimmomatic) 45 , and subsequently mapped with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) 46 against reference genomes of all viruses, bacteria and 16S rRNA present in the mock-virome and bacterial mix. The number of mapped reads for each genome was obtained with Samtools 47 and the percentage of mapped reads was calculated as the number of mapped reads divided by the total number of reads after trimming. For every virus, the correlation between the qPCR results and the percentage of mapped reads was determined based on all viral enrichment conditions. Normalisation of the number of reads to the genome length allows for a proper comparison with qPCR results. Method validation: reproducibility. Mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were pooled in 1:1 ratio, and split into two aliquots. From both aliquots a part was kept for qPCR before treatment and underwent a nuclease treatment and nucleic acids extraction. The rest of the mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were treated as follows: homogenisation was performed for 1 min (3000 rpm), followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 17000 g, then filtration with the 0.8-μ m PES. Samples underwent a nuclease treatment, nucleic acids extraction and a random amplification was performed and qPCR assays were done as described above.
