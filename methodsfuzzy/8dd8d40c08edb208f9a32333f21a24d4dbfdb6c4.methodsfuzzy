Veterinarians routinely send samples to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MNVDL) to determine potential pathogenic agents contributing to disease and to promote the health of swine herds. The samples may represent clinical outbreaks of diarrhea or are for routine monitoring of enteric pathogens in swine herds. Upon arrival, ownership of the samples belongs to the MNVDL and client(s) confidentiality is retained by removing identifiers associated with client(s) information. Between January 2008 and November 2016, a total of 29,397 samples, including fresh intestines and fecal samples from of clinical cases were submitted from 41 US states and Mexico and tested for TGEV by real time RT-PCR under Standard Operation Procedures (available upon request) and various bacterial and viral enteric pathogens dependent on the veterinarian's request. Request may include beta-hemolytic Escherichia coli, non-beta-hemolytic Escherichia coli, rotavirus A, B, and C, PEDV, and PDCoV. Randomly selected historical positive TGEV samples from the MNVDL (n = 17) were saved from previous enteric studies, two TGEV samples from Ohio (Z and HB) were supplied from Dr. Linda Saif. Routine testing for PRCV does not occur since it is not considered a major swine pathogen. However, a PRCV isolate from MN was obtained from a nasal swab in 2016 during an attempted to isolate other viruses. All samples (n = 20) were selected for whole genome sequencing using next generation sequencing as previously described 36 . TGEV prevalence information was exported from the MNVDL database and analyzed at the case-level with R software 61 using the ggplot2 62 and maps 63 . To investigate the differences in TGEV strains and phylogenetic relationship with PRCV, our 20 sequences and available sequences from GenBank (Table S1 ) were aligned using ClustalW in Geneious v9.1.4 64 . Nucleotide and amino acid entropy analyses of the concatenation ORFs (ORF1a/b, S, ORF3a/3b, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF7) was performed using the MATLAB 65 to determine regions of diversity within the alignment. Entropy values higher than 0.7 in the nucleotide and amino acid alignments were identified as high variation positions 43 . Recombination analysis was performed using Recombination Detection Program (RDP) 66 v4 with RDP, BootScan, GEENECOV, SiScan and MAXCHI algorithms (Window size is 100 bp). Recombination event was represented using similarity plot, with Oklahoma147 as the query strain. The similarity plot was implemented in the SimPlot, v. 3.5.1 package 67 , using the two-parameter (Kimura) distance model with a sliding window of 1000 bp and step size of 30 bp. Whole genome (n = 40), the whole S gene (n = 56), and the partial S gene (first 1383 nt) (n = 70) (Table S1 ) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum likelihood algorithm, with a GTR nucleotide substitution model (bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates) by MEGA v6.06 68 . The S protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) of TGEV and PRCV were modeled using the open-source modeling server SWISS-MODEL 69 provided by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Predicted tertiary structure of the RBDs of TGEV and PRCV were modeled using PRCV RBD (PDB accession no. 5SZS) reported in the previous study. Spike monomer and trimer models were performed using human coronavirus NL63 model as a template to theatrically visualize the changes in the residues since TGEV and PRCV templates are lacking 70 . Illustrations were created using the Python-based molecular viewer PyMOL 71 .
