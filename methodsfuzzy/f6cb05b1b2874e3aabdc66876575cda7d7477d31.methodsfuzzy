Cell cultures: FO mouse myeloma cells (ATCC CRL-1646) and WEHI-164 murine sarcoma cells (ATCC CRL1751) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The hybridoma mAb 2-4 cell was developed in our laboratory [4] . FO cells and hybridoma mAb 2-4 cell producing the antibody to feline TNF-alpha were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. WEHI-164 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 µg/ml of polybrene. Cloning of variable regions of heavy chain and light chain of mAb 2-4 and constant regions of heavy chain and light chain of feline immunoglobulin: RNA isolation from cells and cDNA preparation were performed employing the method of [18] . The variable region genes of the mAb 2-4 (V H and V L ) were amplified by PCR from cDNA of hybridoma mAb 2-4 mRNA. The constant region gene of feline immunoglobulin heavy chain (C H ) was amplified from cDNA of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA. The constant region gene of feline immunoglobulin light chain (C L ) was artificially synthesized by Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) based on a published nucleotide sequence (Genbank AF198257.1) and inserted into the pMA-T plasmid. The primer sequences used for PCR are shown in Table 1 . V H , V L , C H and C L were individually cloned in pCR-blunt II-TOPO vectors using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Life Technologies). Construction and expression of chimeric mAb 2-4: The C H and C L genes and V H and V L fragments inserted in the pCR-bluntII-TOPO vectors were connected using a Bam HI linker to prepare chimeric H and L chains (Fig. S1 ), respectively. The chimeric H chain fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCDNA3.1 (+)/Neo expression vector. The chimeric L chain fragment was inserted into the HindIII/EcoRV site of the pCDNA3.1 (+)/Hygro expression vector. FO cells were co-transfected with the H-and L-chain expression vectors with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). The transfected FO cells were cultured in medium containing G418 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and hygromycyn B (Roche Diagnostics), to acquire a stably expressing cell line (FOCM24). FOCM24 cells were cloned twice employing the limiting dilution method. Purification of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4: Mouse mAb 2-4 was purified from the hybridoma mAb 2-4 culture supernatant with Protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) according to the product manual. Chimeric mAb 2-4 was purified from the FOCM24 culture supernatant with Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare). After purification, the buffer of mAbs was exchanged to PBS (pH 7.4) by Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (NMWL 30,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.). The concentrations of purified mAbs were assayed by the Bradford method. Western immunoblotting assay: Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were incubated without 2-mercaptoethanol at RT for 5 min (non-reducing condition). mAbs were incubated with 2-mercaptoethanol at 100°C for 10 min (reducing condition). mAbs were run using 15% sodium  dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and a transferred nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.88% NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 hr at 37°C. Following washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse IgG (H+L chain specific) (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL, U.S.A.) or horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-feline IgG (whole molecular) (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, U.S.A.) for 1 hr at 37°C and then visualized in the substrate for 10 min. Neutralization test of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 against feline TNF-alpha using WEHI-164 cells: Neutralization test was performed as described previously [4] . Briefly, WEHI-164 cells were suspended at 1 × 10 6 cells/ml in the dilution medium containing 1 µg/ml of Actinomycin D (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and pre-incubated at 37°C for 3 hr. Serially diluted mouse mAb 2-4, chimeric mAb 2-4 or anti feline APN mAb (mAb R-G-4, as a control for mAb 2-4) was mixed with 40 ng/ml recombinant fTNF-alpha (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A., 75% cytotoxic activity against WEHI-164 cells) or ascites of cats with FIP that were used as natural feline TNF-alpha samples (final concentration of 1:8, 80% cytotoxic activity against WEHI-164 cells). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Pre-incubated cells were seeded in a volume of 50 µl in the wells of a 96-well plate. Fifty microliters of the mixture was then added into each well. After incubation at 37°C for 24 hr, 10 µl of WST-8 solution (WST-8 cell proliferation assay kit; Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was added, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 1 hr. The absorbance of formazan produced was measured at 450 nm with a 96-well spectrophotometric plate reader, as described by the manufacturer. The percent neutralization was calculated by the following formula: Neutralization Repeated-dose test in cats: The mAb repeated-dose test was performed referring to the method reported by Umehashi et al. [22] . Purified mouse mAb 2-4, chimeric mAb 2-4 or PBS as a control was administered to 5 specific pathogen free (SPF) cats aged 2 months. After sedation with Medetomidine (Domitor, Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland), the SPF cats received low-(1 mg/kg) or high-dose (5 mg/kg) mAb injection into the cervical vein 5 times at 2-or 4-week intervals. Serum was collected immediately before administration. Blood pressure and pulse were measured at the forearm or root of the tail before mAb administration and 10 min after administration, using a fully automatic electronic sphygmomanometer (Pettrust, Aster Electric Co., Yokohama, Japan). The measurements were performed in triplicate. This animal experiment was performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of Kitasato University (the number of approval is 14-045). SPF cats were maintained in a temperature-controlled isolated facility. Changes in anti-mouse antibody in mouse mAb 2-4-or chimeric mAb 2-4-injected cat serum: Immulon 4HBX ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) were coated overnight at 4°C with purified mouse mAb 2-4 (500 ng/100 µl/well) diluted with carbonate buffer (0.05 M, pH 9.6). After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% Tween-20, the plates were blocked with a blocking buffer containing 0.5% skim milk in PBS at 37°C for 60 min. Each well of the plates then received 100 µl of 200-fold diluted serum collected from mAb treated cats. After 60 min incubation at 37°C, the plates were washed, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-feline IgG (whole molecular) was diluted to the optimal concentrations, and then, 100 µl of the dilution was added to each well of the plates. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the plates were washed, and each well received 100 µl of substrate solution and was incubated at 25°C for 10 min in the dark. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 buffer (pH 4.8) and adding 0.2 µl/ml of 30% H 2 O 2 . The reaction was stopped with 3 N H 2 SO 4 solution, and the optical density (OD) at 492 nm was determined. Changes in neutralization activity of mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 reacted with mouse mAb 2-4-or chimeric mAb 2-4-injected cat serum: Sera collected from the mAbtreated cats were diluted 10-fold with medium. The diluted sera were reacted for one hour with mouse mAb 2-4 or chimeric mAb 2-4 at the minimum concentration necessary for 80% or higher neutralization of 10 ng/ml recombinant fTNF-alpha. The reactant was then combined with recombinant fTNF-alpha (final concentration: 10 ng/ml). One hour later, the reactants were administered to WEHI-164 cells. The level of TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity was measured after 24 hr.
