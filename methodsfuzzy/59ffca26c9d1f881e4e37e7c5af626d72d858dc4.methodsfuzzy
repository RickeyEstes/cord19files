It is necessary to address the question of how we counted the number of time each tetra-nucleotide (for example 'GAGA' or any other tetra-nucleotide), appeared in a given genome. For this study, we adopted the convention of not counting overlapping words [24] . Take a sequence "UAU-GAGAGAUCCGAGA' as example. With second or higher overlapping words not counted, the tetra-nucleotide 'GAGA' is counted as occurring only twice, namely in position 4-7 and 13-16. Positions 6-9 are omitted because they overlap with 'GAGA' at position 4-7. However, when we counted tetra-nucleotide 'UGAG', position 3-6 would also be registered as position 4-6 already recorded when counting tetra-nucleotide 'GAGA'. In short, all frequency counting of tetra-nucleotide were started anew when we changed from counting the frequency of one tetra-nucleotide to another; this was to preserve the correlation of tetra-nucleotides which have overlapping subword (e.g: 'UAGA' and 'GACA'). A table showing the frequencies of tetra-nucleotides is shown in the additional file 2.
