JEV propagation, purification and titration. The JEV strain SA14 (isolated in Xi'an, China in the 1950's, and stored in a refrigerator in our laboratory ever since) was propagated in C6/36 cells (ATCC ® CRL-1660™; Institute for Microbial Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, China) cultured at 28˚C in a closed incubator in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT, USA), 1% lactoalbumin hydrolysate (LH) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). When CPE was apparent, the culture supernatants were harvested following centrifugation at 500 x g at 4˚C for 10 min. The supernatants were then received a serial centrifugation in 10,000 x g for 20 min, 45,000 x g for 10 min and 70,000 x g for 4 h at 4˚C (Optima L-100XP Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Viral particles were condensed in aliquots and preserved at -80˚C for use in subsequent experiments. The condensed JEV was titrated by plaque formation assay with a semi-solid overlay. BHK-21 cells (ATCC ® CCL-10™) were obtained from Ms. L. Jia (The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, Beijing, China). BHK-21 cells were used in JEV titration and JEV progeny determination in RNAi-treated Vero cells, while attempt to identify molecules capable of binding JEV by VOPBA using BHK-21 cells failed (unpublished data). Briefly, BHK-21 cells (1x10 5 cells/well) were grown to a confluent monolayer in a 6-well plate in culture medium [containing 60% RPMI-1640, 30% 0.5% LH, 10% FCS, 1% penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, 0.75% NaHCO 3 (1% in total) NaHCO 3 and 3% glutamine (1% in total)] and infected with 200 µl of 10-fold serially diluted JEV aliquots dissolved in virus dilution solution [containing 96% LH, 2% FCS, and 0.75% NaHCO 3 (2% in total)]. The cells absorbed the virus at 37˚C for 1 h with gentle circular tilting every 15 min. The fluids were then pipetted out, and the monolayers were washed 3 times with RPMI-1640 without serum and finally covered with a semi-solid overlay [containing 1% methyl cellulose, 1/10 volume 10X RPMI-1640, 25% distilled water, 10% FCS, 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), 0.75% NaHCO 3 (3% in total) and 3% glutamine (1% in total)]. Following incubation at 37˚C for 96 h, the overlay was withdrawn, and the cell monolayer was stained with a 1% crystal violet solution containing 0.2% formaldehyde. All plaque formation assay experiments were performed in triplicate, and the plaques were counted and calculated in PFU/ml. Cell membrane protein extraction. Vero cells (ATCC ® CCL-81™) were obtained from Ms. L. Jia (The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products). Vero cell membrane proteins were prepared as previously described (26) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FCS in an incubator (Hera Cell; Heraeus Holding GmbH, Hanau, Germany) with 5% CO 2 at 37˚C. Confluent cell monolayers were washed 3 times with PBS, treated with 1 mM EDTA in PBS (pH 7.2) for 3 min at 37˚C, and subsequently resuspended in ice cold Buffer M (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) on ice for 40 min with intermittent shaking, and lysed using 15-20 strokes and a Dounce homogeniser. The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 x g and 4˚C for 10 min. The membrane-bound proteins in the supernatant fraction were condensed through further centrifugation at 36,000 x g and 4˚C for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in Buffer M without β-mercaptoethanol. The concentrations of the membrane proteins were determined using a BCA kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
