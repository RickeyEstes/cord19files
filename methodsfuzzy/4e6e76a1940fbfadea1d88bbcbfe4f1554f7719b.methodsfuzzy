Recombinant protein expression. Core (D1) of JFH-1 was cloned into the pET28B(+ ) construct (Novagen), in-frame with a N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Recombinant protein was expressed in BL21[DE3] cells (F-ompT hsdSB(rB-mB-gal dcm (DE3)). Luria broth media (1% glucose) was inoculated with a 1:1000 dilution of starter culture and maintained at 37 °C until an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 was reached. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 100 mM isopropyl β -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and cultures were maintained at 20 °C for 6 hours whilst shaking, before being harvested by centrifugation. to an equilibrated Ni 2+ Sepharose resin column (GE Healthcare). Resin was washed (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.06% β -mercaptoethanol, 100 mM imidazole) and the protein was eluted into wash-based buffer with 500 mM imidazole. Protein was dialysed overnight into PBS and quantified by spectrometry. SDS-PAGE was conducted upon both bacterial lysates and eluted protein fractions according to previously described methods 55 using 12% gels. Silver staining was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions (SilverQuest kit, Invitrogen). Immunoblots were conducted with an in-house rabbit anti-core polyclonal sera (1:2000) , commercial anti-His monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) and HRP-labelled secondary antibodies. For protein identification, Coomassie stained bands were excised, reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. The recovered peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS and subsequent searching of the tandem MS data against the Uniprot sequence database. Recombinant D1 (1 mg) was immobilised via the His-tag to 12 mg of Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation and Pulldown magnetic beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturers protocol. Excess protein was removed with 3 washes of 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20. Bead immobilised protein was then washed 3 times with selection buffer (PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, 1× Roche complete protease inhibitor per 50 mL). A Biomek 2000 laboratory automation work station (Beckman Coulter) was used to perform 10 rounds of in vitro SELEX as described previously 29 , using a N35 2′ OH RNA library. This starting library was synthesised according to an experimentally and iteratively optimised protocol. It was purchased from AptaIT (Munich, Germany) who performed three rounds of synthesis, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and statistical analysis of NGS data from the library using the COMPAS software. In doing so the random region of the library has been optimised in respect of an equal distribution of nucleotide building blocks (25% of G, C, A & T, at each position), as well as in respect of a Gaussian distribution of motifs of length 4-8 nucleotides. An equal distribution of nucleotides increases the sequence space on the level of shorter motifs, which finally mediate binding to the target of interest. Consequently, the chance for a successful SELEX experiment increases with a homogeneous random region. Here the library was initially transcribed with a HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA transcription kit (New England Biolabs). Negative selections were carried out at each round of SELEX using bare His-Tag isolation and pulldown beads. The stringency of the aptamer-target interaction was raised by increasing the number of washes from 10 to 15 (slower off-rate) and by decreasing the amount of bead-immobilised protein by half (faster on-rate). Selections were carried out at 37 °C. Following the final round of SELEX, aptamers were analysed by NGS using a MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (Illumina). The SELEX library was prepared using the MiSeq reagent kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Raw sequencing reads were processed using in-house scripts to identify sequences that contained correct 5′ and 3′ primers. Processed sequences were used for packaging signal identification (see below).
