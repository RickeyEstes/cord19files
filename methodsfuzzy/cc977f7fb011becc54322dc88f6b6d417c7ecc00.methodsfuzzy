A test-negative case-control study was conducted between 1 December 2015 and 1 May 2016. The subjects were recruited from three participating sites: Centre of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania; the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Department of Geriatrics of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas. The study population consisted of 18 years and older individuals with underlying medical conditions, healthy ≥65 years old individuals and pregnant women living in the community, who were admitted to one of the participating sites due to SARI with no contraindication for influenza vaccination, that is, allergies to influenza vaccine and other adverse events to vaccinations in the past. Patients were eligible to be included in the study when they were hospitalised for at least 24 hours, but not longer than 48 hours, had a swab taken ≤7 days after self-reported disease onset, did not test positive and were not hospitalised for any influenza virus in the current season before the inclusion, and were suffering from SARI with at least one of the systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, headache and myalgia) or deterioration of general condition or deterioration of functional status, and at least one of the respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat and shortness of breath). Patients were not eligible to be included in the study when they were institutionalised, unwilling to participate, not able to communicate, not able and/or willing to give written informed consent (IC). Eligible patients were asked to provide one throat and one nose swab specimen for influenza testing by the multiplex RT-PCR. As data from shedding studies propose that influenza virus detection decreases after 7 days, recruitment was limited to patients who were swabbed not more than 7 days after onset of the symptoms. 18 Swabbing was done after the information on demographic and clinical characteristics was collected from the medical history and patient self-report.
