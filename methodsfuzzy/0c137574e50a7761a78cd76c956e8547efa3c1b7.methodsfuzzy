The most common method for preparing herbal medicine is to boil the herb in hot water and the liquid is then taken as the medicine. Most of the non-cellulosic polysaccharides are polar macromolecules that are readily soluble in water. Thus, the traditional polysaccharide extraction method is a water leaching extraction method, which is usually extracted by hot water leaching, and the polar macromolecular compound polysaccharide is dissolved in a polar solvent such as water to extract by using the principle of "similar compatibility." In addition, according to the structure and properties of polysaccharides, some auxiliary means are introduced. 20 On the basis of traditional water extraction, acid-base extraction method, enzymatic extraction method, microwave-assisted extraction method, ultrasonic assisted extraction method and ultrahigh-pressure extraction method have been developed. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Then the separation and purification process of the polysaccharide is generally carried out from the water extracted materials by removing the non-polysaccharide components first. Common methods for polysaccharide purification include precipitation, gel chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, macro porous resin column chromatography, ultrafiltration, and other methods alike. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Most of the polysaccharides obtained by the extraction, separation and purification techniques at this stage are still crude products because the quality of polysaccharides is difficult to control. First, the medicinal quality of herbal plants varies with the locations of cultivation, the parts of the herb collected, the season of the herb collected, and the herb processing method. Second, the extraction methods used vary from lab to lab. Third, unlike DNA, RNA, and proteins, the non-template synthesized polysaccharides are never pure compounds no matter how many procedures have been used for purification. The obtained polysaccharides are always associated with either narrow or wide molecular weight ranges. The biological activities of the polysaccharides purified by the same starting materials vary as well. Therefore, special attention has to be paid during the extraction, separation and purification of herb polysaccharides. [35] [36] [37] [38] The advantages and disadvantages of each method are shown in Table 1 . The structure of polysaccharides is more complex than that of proteins and DNAs. From a chemical point of view, the complexity of the polysaccharides undoubtedly brings great difficulties to its structural analysis. The structural classification of polysaccharides follows the suit of proteins and DNAs, i.e., the structure of polysaccharides can be divided into primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. 39 Like other biomolecules, the higher structure of the polysaccharide chain is based on its primary structure. The difference is that primary structure of the polysaccharide chain having much more "meaning" than the protein or DNAs. To determine the primary structure of a polysaccharide chain, the following problems have to be solved: (1) relative molecular mass; (2) monosaccharide compositions of the polysaccharide chain; (3) presence or absence of uronic acid and specific uronic acid type and ratio; (4) D-or L-configuration of each monosaccharide residue, pyran ring or furan ring form; (5) sequence of linkage between individual monosaccharide residues; the αor β-anomeric form of each glycosidic bond; (7) the substitution of a hydroxyl group on each monosaccharide residue; (8) the attachment of a polysaccharide chain to a non-polysaccharide moiety; (9) the backbone of the polysaccharide chain and the branch linkage site; and (10) a polysaccharide residue may be modified by a sulfate group, an acetyl group, a phosphate group, a methyl group, or the like. There are many analytical methods for polysaccharide structural characterization, 40, 41 not only instrumental analysis methods such as infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, etc., but also chemical methods such as partial acid hydrolysis, complete acid hydrolysis, periodic acid oxidation, Smith degradation, etc., as well as biological methods such as specific glycosidase digestion, immunological methods, etc. Polysaccharide extraction, separation and purification methods from traditional Chinese herbs are shown in Table 1 . 39 3.
