Prediction. The results of UPEC vaccine targets predicted by Vaxign were manually compared with results from our previous studies using microarray [34] , proteomics [35] , immunoproteomic analysis [36] . The predicted results based on DNA sequence analysis are compared with data from transcriptomic microarray data [34] , mass spectrometry proteomic studies [35, 51] , and antigenicity analysis [36] . Out of 85 predicted outer membrane proteins that are conserved among four UPEC strains, 23 proteins have been found upregulated in vivo or in urine at the mRNA and/or protein levels (Table 4 ). It was found that many proteins with upregulated gene expression belong to iron ion binding proteins and porin family. However, only one protein (FimD) from fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane protein family was shown to be upregulated in DNA microarray analysis (Table 4 ) [34] . Five out of 14 iron binding proteins (IroN, FepA, FhuA, Hma, and ChuA) discovered by Vaxign have been found to be upregulated in vivo or in urine (Table 4 ) [34] [35] [36] 51] . Since iron metabolism is critical for UPEC pathogenesis, these proteins are important vaccine targets. Five proteins from porin family have also been found upregulated in vivo or in urine, including NmpC, OmpC, LamB, OmpF, and FadL (Table 4 ). Limited study has been performed to investigate the roles of these porin proteins in induction of protective immunity against UPEC infection.
