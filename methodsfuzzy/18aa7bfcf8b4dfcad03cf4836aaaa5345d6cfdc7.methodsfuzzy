Plasmid DNA. The regulatable HDLacOLuc construct expresses firefly luciferase driven by the promoter from the human Huntington's Disease (HD) locus into which were embedded two synthetic lac operators. The HD promoter fragment was obtained by NcoI digestion of the qp25 construct (David Housman, HDF CHDI Reagent Resource Bank) containing the huntingtin promoter and exon 1 to yield an 800 bp product that was inserted into the NcoI site of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The two synthetic lac operators (ATTGTGAGCGCTCACAAT) were inserted at locations (-69 and -198) flanking the transcription start site, mimicking the spacing found in the lac operon of E. coli using splice overlap extension by PCR and a unique Blp1 site in the HD promoter. 34 The LacIR construct contains the lac repressor transgene that resembles a typical mammalian gene in terms of codon usage under the control of the human β-actin promoter 32, 33 (Supplementary Figure S1) . pGL4.74 expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of HSV-TK promoter (Promega, Southampton, UK). siRNA. siRNAs targeting the mammalianized version of the lac repressor were designed using the Dharmacon design software. Sequences siLac#1 (mRNA target sequence NNAGAAAGAAGUGGAGUUGAA), siLac#2 (mRNA target sequence NNGCCAAUAGCUGAAAGAGAA), and siLac#3 (mRNA target sequence NNGAAGACAGCUCAUGUUAUA) were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cramlington, UK). A chemically stabilized version of siLac#3 (siSTABLE-Lac#3) (converted to the 2′-hydroxyl version) together with a nontargeting siRNA control (D-001700-01-20; Thermo Scientific Dharmacon) were also synthesized. siRNA targeting GFP (siGFP) (mRNA target sequence CGGCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAU), luciferase (siLUC) (mRNA target sequence AACUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA), bacterial LacI (mRNA target sequence AAAUAUCUCACUC-GCAAUCAA), and siRNAs targeting Hepatitis B surface antigen (siHBsAg#1, mRNA target sequence AACAUCA-CAUCAGGAUUCCUA, siHBsAg#2, mRNA target sequence AAUCACUCACCAACCUCUUGU and siHBsAg#3, mRNA target sequence CUAUAUGGAUGAUGUGGUA) were synthesized by Qiagen (Crawley, UK). Cells. NIH/3T3 murine fibroblasts (CRL-1658) obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells were maintained in Ham's F12 media containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection assays. To test the efficacy of siRNA sequences targeting the lac repressor, 2 × 10 5 PC-3 cells were plated out in six-well plates. A 1.6 μg of pLacIR was transfected alone or in combination with various siRNAs (at a final concentration of 1 or 10 nmol/l) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 hours, serum containing media was added to give a final serum concentration of 10%. Cells were lysed after 48 hours and analyzed for LacIR protein expression by western blot. Assays to determine the efficacy of siSTABLE-Lac#3 were examined after 24 hours rather than 48 hours. To assess off-target effects of siLac#3 on luciferase expression, 4 × 10 4 PC-3 cells were plated into 24-well plates. A 0.4 μg of HDLacOLuc alone or with siLuc or siLac#3 (10 nmol/l final concentration) in complex with Lipofectamine was added to cells. Cells were lysed after 24 hours and luciferase expression measured using luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Southampton, UK) and a luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Harpenden, UK), readings normalized for protein content. To assess the efficacy of siRNA in the context of the reporter system, 4 × 10 4 NIH/3T3 or PC-3 cells were plated out in 48-well plates. A 200 ng HDLacOLuc and 10 ng GL4.74 were added to cells alone, or together with 20 ng LacIR using Lipofectamine. In addition, some cells received 10 nmol/l siRNA delivered within the same Lipofectamine complexes as the plasmid DNA. Cells were transfected in replicates of five and the experiment performed on at least three occasions. After 24 hours, appropriate cells received 5 mmol/l IPTG. After 48 hours, cells were lysed and luciferase expression analyzed. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase were measured using the dual glow reporter system (Promega, Southampton, UK). Readings were normalized for protein content and expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase expression divided by Renilla luciferase expression. Statistical analysis was performed using the Levene Statistic to confirm homogeneity of variances followed by an analysis of variance using Bonferonni correction with post hoc analysis. Western blotting. Transfected cells were lysed and total cellular protein extracted using M-PER solution (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay; 20 μg of total protein was loaded onto each well of a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and run at 170 V for 40 minutes. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 60 minutes. The blot was then washed three times with TBST and incubated with mouse anti-LacI clone 9A5 primary antibody (Millipore UK, Watford, UK) diluted 1 in 1,000 at room temperature for 2 hours. The blot was then washed three times with TBST and incubated with goat antimouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody (Dako, Ely, UK) diluted 1 in 5,000 at room temperature for 1 hour. The blot was washed and the bands visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) on a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA), and analyzed using Fluorchem 8000 software. Each blot was stripped and reprobed with sc-5286 anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1,000 as a protein loading control. Transgenic mouse production. HDLacOLuc transgenic mice were generated by isolating the transgenic construct from pHDLacOluc via BglII/BamHI digestion (Figure 1b) followed by PvuI digestion to leave a 2.7 kb isolated fragment which was purified and diluted to 5 ng/μl in microinjection buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH7.4, 0.1 mmol/l EDTA). LacIR transgenic mice were generated by isolating the transgenic construct from pLacIR via KpnI/SacI partial digestion (Figure 1b) to give a 7.5 kb fragment isolated and purified as described above. Three-week-old female B6CBAF1 mice were superovulated and mated. The resulting fertilized oocytes were collected from the oviduct of plugged female mice and cultured until two clear pronuclei were visible. The purified HDLacOLuc or LacIR transgenic constructs were microinjected into one of the pronuclei and injected embryos were cultivated overnight to the two-cell stage. Two-cell embryos were then reimplanted into the oviduct of pseudo pregnant CD1 foster mothers at 0.5 days after coitum. Between 18 and 19 days later, pups were born from the foster mothers. Ear biopsies from these pups were taken, DNA extracted and PCR performed to identify transgenic founder mice. Founder mice were mated with C57BL/6J mice and the resultant pups genotyped to confirm germline transmission of the transgenes. These F1 transgenics were mated with C57BL/6J mice to produce an F2 generation and establish the line. Double transgenics were established by mating HDLacOluc F2 transgenic mice with LacIR F2 transgenic mice. Offspring were genotyped to identify individuals carrying both transgenes. Genotyping by PCR. PCR primers (HDLacOluc forward 5′-TCCTATGATTATGTCCGGTTATGTAAA, HDLacOLuc reverse 5′-GACTGGCGACGTAATCCACGATCT, LacIR forward 5′-AACCAGGCCAGCCATGTTTCTGC, and LacIR reverse 5′-AACCAGATGCTCCACACCCAGTCTT) (Sigma Genosys, Welwyn Garden City, UK) were designed to amplify a 350 bp region of HDLacOluc and a 417 bp region of LacIR. Template DNA obtained from ear biopsies was amplified using the thermal cycling conditions; 94 °C for 15 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 60 seconds, 55 °C for 60 seconds, and 72 °C for 40 seconds and ending with a single completion stage of 72 °C for 5 minutes. The reaction conditions were generated in an Applied Biosystems 7000 Sequence Detection System. The standard amplification reaction contained QuantiTect Probe PCR mastermix (which includes HotStarTaqDNA Polymerase, Tris-HCl (pH8.7), KCl, (NH 4 ) SO 4 8 mmol/l MgCl 2 , dNTPs, and ROX passive reference dye) (Qiagen), to which was added 400 nmol/l forward primer and 400 nmol/l reverse primer. Two microlitres of template DNA from each sample was added. Positive controls were performed using 1-5 ng of plasmid (HDLacOLuc or LacIR) DNA, while negative controls were performed using water instead of template. As a further control, the integrity of the sample DNA was confirmed by PCR using murine Connexin 31 primers (forward primer 5′-CTGGACTCTGACATGTGCACATAC, reverse primer 5′-CTACATGCAGGATGACCAGCATAG). In vivo imaging. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl of sterile filtered 15 mg/ml D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, MO) in PBS. After 10 minutes, mice were imaged using the IVIS 100 system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Images were captured using Living Image 2.50.2 software. When required after whole body imaging mice were culled, dissected and the organs arranged and reimaged outside the carcass. Induction of luciferase with IPTG. Mice were imaged and then given either 10 mmol/l IPTG (Stratagene, Leicester, UK) in the drinking water or 100 mmol/l IPTG administered intraperitoneally and reimaged 24, 48, or 72 hours later.
