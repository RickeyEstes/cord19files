Recent studies have demonstrated that LAMP analysis is an effective tool in herbal medicine identification ( Table 1) . In the following, we will critically discuss the development and application of LAMP analysis methods for herbal medicine identification. Sasaki and Nagumo (2007) developed a LAMP-based method targeting trnK gene sequences to verify the identity of Curcuma longa and C. aromatica. They found that LAMP analysis is suitable for the identification of these two easily confused species (Sasaki and Nagumo, 2007) . This is the first report on the utilization of the LAMP approach in rapid discrimination of herbal plants, and this study sparked a new research line on possible identification for herbal medicine products. In the following year, the same research group (Sasaki et al., 2008) published a similar LAMP analysis method for the detection of Panax ginseng, the botanical source of ginseng (Ginseng Radix), and to distinguish P. ginseng from Panax japonicus. By using a set of six allele-specific primers (two outer primers, two inner primers, and two loop primers), which are designed based on the partial 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequence, amplifications can be observed from approximately 30 min onward at DNA concentrations of 0.5 ng to 10.0 ng. Notably, although only three nucleotide differences exist in the 18S rRNA gene sequences of P. ginseng and P. japonicus, LAMP is highly sensitive to detect P. ginseng using these small nucleotide differences. Similar method was also devoted to the identification of traditional Chinese medicine Cordyceps sinensis (dong chong xia cao) and its adulterants C. hawresii, C. ramosa, C. liangschanensis, C. militaris, and C. barnesi (Li K. et al., 2011) . In another study, LAMP can be combined with RAPD amplification to identify Catharanthus roseus (Chaudhary et al., 2012) . These studies demonstrated that LAMP facilitates not only identification but also screening with high specificity. In the past decade, DNA barcoding, a technique aiming at detecting species-specific differences in a short region of DNA, provides a powerful novel tool for herbal medicine identification. The short sequence of nucleotides (<1000 bp) used in this method can be easily obtained from an appropriate part of the chloroplast, mitochondrial, or nuclear genome and is commonly called "DNA barcode." In 2010, Lou et al. (2010) developed a DNA barcoding database for medicinal plants 1 . This Medicinal plants DNA barcode database accepts all nuclear ITS and plastid DNA regions results for medicinal plants (Lou et al., 2010) . More recently, Chen et al. (2014) established a universal, publically available DNA barcoding system based on the ITS2 and psbA-trnH barcodes for identifying medicinal plants. The database includes almost all crude herbal drugs listed in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Korean Pharmacopoeia, Indian Pharmacopeia, United States Pharmacopeia, and European Pharmacopoeia. It also contains barcoding information for their adulterants, substitutes and closely related species. In order to make full use of these database and make LAMP method more universally and publically accessible, Li et al. (2013) presented a LAMP method targeting the DNA barcode region internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to verify its ability in the identity of Hedyotis diffusa. Lai et al. (2015) evaluated the effectiveness of ITS2 DNA barcode in distinguishing Taraxacum formosanum from other adulterant plants using LAMP method. These studies suggested that DNA barcodes could be used to design species-specific primer for LAMP to distinguish medicinal species from their non-medicinal adulterants. Very recently, Zhao et al. (2016) developed a similar approach for the identification of Crocus sativus through LAMP analysis. The authors constructed multiple alignments of the ITS2 sequences between C. sativus and its adulterants and found this sequence is suitable to design C. sativus LAMP-specific primers. In particular, 10 fg of genomic DNA is identified as the limit for template accuracy of LAMP in C. sativus, indicating that LAMP is more sensitive than normal PCR, which typically requires a minimum template amount of 10 ng. The authors provided a practical SOP for utilizing the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication. In the near future, people can use the LAMP method combined with DNA barcodes to test their herbal materials according to this SOP. In markets, herbal products are commonly sold without packaging or labels, leading to a high risk of acquiring counterfeit, substituted, and/or adulterated products. Traditional herbal medicines that are adulterated and/or contaminated with toxic plant materials have caused a number of major epidemic events. For example, in the early 1990s, an epidemic of urothelial carcinomas related to AAs occurred in Belgium. A number of women were prescribed the Chinese herb Fangji (Stephania tetrandra) for weight loss, but the herb was incorrectly substituted with AAs containing Guangfangji (Aristolochia fangchi). Subsequently, the women developed renal interstitial fibrosis and upper tract urothelial carcinomas-aristolochic acid nephropathy (Vanherweghem et al., 1993) . In another case, a woman prescribed herbal preparations for the treatment Authentication of the herbal tea ingredient Hedyotis diffusa ITS of the rRNA gene Li et al., 2013 Screening toxic herb Gelsemium elegans trnL-trnF chloroplast regions Yu et al., 2014 Identification of the Herbal Tea Ingredient Taraxacum formosanum ITS2 of the rRNA gene Lai et al., 2015 Verification of the authenticity of Aristolochia manshuriensis ITS2 of the rRNA gene Wu et al., 2016 Authentication of the precious herb saffron ITS2 of the rRNA gene Zhao et al., 2016 of hypercholesterolemia suffered from hepatitis after using preparations containing germander (Teucrium chamaedrys). The main reason for this occurrence is the incorrect substitution of adulterants, such as germander (Teucrium chamaedrys) instead of skullcap (Scutellaria) (Lord et al., 1999) . Any case regarding herbal medicine safety, especially when reported by the media, significantly influences public opinion. Thus, the demand for the improvement of quality control for herbal medicine continues to increase. The screening of toxic adulterants and admixtures in herbal products is one of the more important applications of LAMP analysis. Yu et al. (2014) evaluated LAMP method targeting the plant DNA barcoding regions trnL-trnF to verify the identity of the toxic herb Gelsemium elegans. The aim was to distinguish Lonicera japonica from G. elegans, which could be mislabeled as an adulterant in commercial L. japonica products due to their similar appearance. The research began by sequencing standard regions of the plastid DNA (trnL-F and trhH-psbA) of these two species. Multiple alignment results found that trnL-trnF amplicons is suitable to design species-specific primers for the identification of G. elegans. Based on their study, the authors developed a LAMP kit that can be adapted for this toxic adulterant screening. In another study, Wu et al. (2016) developed a real time LAMP assay for the detection of Aristolochia manshuriensis which has been reported to be the most common toxic adulterant in Akebiae Caulis herbal products. The authors also highlighted the limit detection of LAMP. In their study, the identity of Aristolochia manshuriensis in processed commercial herbal products can be verified as low as 1%. These case studies and technical advancements clearly indicate that LAMP identification can be applied to a wide range of herbal materials from the field, commercial trade, hospital pharmacies, etc. If the result indicates that the species is different from the anticipated species, then the former may be an accidental or intentional substitute that may or may not be harmful. By determining that an item is not the correct species, the use of that sample (and presumably its entire batch) can be avoided, and a potential adverse reaction could be prevented. Similarly, LAMP technology may also assist the herbal pharmacovigilance sector in resolving the causes of adverse reactions. Such applications of this technology can help improve the safety of herbal medicines in general, especially when combined with authentication via morphological, chemical, and/or other molecular methods.
