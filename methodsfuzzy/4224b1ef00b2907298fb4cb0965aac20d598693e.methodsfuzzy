SKMH is an 817-bed teaching hospital in the city of Taipei, Taiwan. Between March 28 and June 30 2003, 82 patients who were suspected of having SARS were admitted to the isolation rooms. Fiftythree of these patients were subsequently excluded after other explanations for their fever and abnormal chest X-rays were found. The remaining 29 patients fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of 'probable SARS' infection. 10 Routine microbiological tests were performed to exclude other causative pathogens, and reversetranscriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) of oropharyngeal swabs were done for SARSassociated coronavirus in each case as described elsewhere. 11 Initial treatment included amoxicil-lin/clavulanic acid or ceftriaxone and clarithromycin to target common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia, according to current recommendations. 12, 13 Oral ribavirin (2.0 g followed by 1000 -1200 mg daily) or intravenous ribavirin (400 mg q8h) for severe cases was also administered. Corticosteroid therapy included intravenous hydrocortisone (100 mg four times daily) in mild cases, and methylprednisolone (2 -3 mg/kg/day) in moderate cases. Daily pulsed administration of 0.5 -1.0 g of methylprednisolone for two to three days was carried out for those patients with persistent high fever, radiological worsening, increasing shortness of breath, or oxygen desaturation. In severe cases, and depending on the attending physician's judgment, human immunoglobulin could be administered intravenously (1 gm/Kg/day for 2 days). We compared risk factors associated with complicated and uncomplicated diseases. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables. 14 Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Data are reported as means≈ù tandard deviation (SD) unless otherwise specified. All P values were 2-tailed; P , 0:05 was considered statistically significant. For the analysis, the SPSS software package, version 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for the analysis.
