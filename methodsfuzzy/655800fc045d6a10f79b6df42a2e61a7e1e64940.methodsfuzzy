All ferret cases reviewed in this article were presented to the private practices of both authors between 2005 and 2013. Cases were selected based on either consistent clinical findings (e.g., eyelid edema and respiratory signs) and positive PCR or consistent histopathology with identification of acid-fast bacilli on microscopic examination. PCR was performed on biopsy samples, conjunctival swabs, feces and rectal swabs, or blood. The PCR technique used was based on DNA extraction (digestion bands Bste II and Hae III) followed by qualitative PCR and the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The results were interpreted with the aid of the http://app.chuv.ch/pls/pranet/consultation_pkg. resultat_recherche website. Histopathology was performed on biopsy samples and systematic staining (Ziehl-Neelsen or Fite-Faraco) was used on the collected tissue samples. In suspected cases with consistent histopathology, but without demonstration of acid-fast bacilli, immunohistochemistry was used to exclude cases of systemic coronavirus, which can produce similar lesions. Several cases were excluded from this study by immunohistochemistry. Table 2 .
