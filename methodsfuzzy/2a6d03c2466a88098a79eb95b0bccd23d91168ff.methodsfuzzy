The study was carried out at Dhahran Health Center as a part of Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (JHAH), which serves a population of approximately 370,000 patients [16] . Dhahran Health Center is the main general hospital with a 380-bed capacity and five intensive care units (Cardiac, medical, surgical, pediatric, and neonatal) [16] . The hospital provides acute, general medicine and surgery, intensive care services, and management of hematological and solid organ malignancies [16] . A computerized database was generated for all prescribed antibiotics. Antibiotic data were collected for 2011 to have a baseline, and then retrospectively for 2013-2015. All data were collected for the first 6 months of 2011, 2013-2015. To minimize the drawback of using DDD, only adult patients (above 15 years of age) were included in the study. The data were transferred to an Excel spreadsheet. The World Health Organization 2013 Guidelines for Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) were utilized for the calculation of DDD. DDD for each antibiotic was calculated separately, the total number of grams administered for each antibiotic per year was divided by the WHO DDD in grams [10] . Thus, the DDD is an estimate of the number of days of antibiotic therapy. Data of day surgery was not included in calculating the bed days. Antibiotic usage was adjusted per 100 bed-days by dividing DDD by daily occupied beds and multiplied by 100. A direct measure of the number of days of therapy (DOTs) is a common method of antibiotic usage evaluation. DOT is simply the sum of the total number of days of all used antibiotics. Thus, when the same patient receives more than one antibiotic, more than one DOT was counted. The case mix index (CMI), an economic surrogate marker, was calculated by dividing total cost weights for all inpatient in specific period by the number of admission [17] , as provided by the hospital information department. CMI describes the average patients' morbidity of individual hospitals [17] .
