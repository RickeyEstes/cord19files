The FTD assay evaluated here includes 21 viral and bacterial targets multiplexed into six pools (Table 1 , with RSV A/B considered as two targets), though current commercially available versions of the FTD assay can detect up to 33 pathogens. The FTD assay can test up to 12 specimens per 8-hour run and includes internal positive and negative controls as well as an extraction control. The TAC assay evaluated was comprised of 21 uniplex PCR assays that are conducted simultaneously, in duplicate, on a single 384-well microfluidic card with eight ports. One of the ports is dedicated to a negative control and another can be dedicated to a positive control allowing for the testing of 6-7 clinical specimens per 2.5-hour run on a single card. Two internal positive control assays and four nucleic acid extraction control assays are included in the card (Kodani et al., 2011) . The FTD platform requires a nucleic acid elution volume of 60 μL divided between the six PCR pools (10 μL template nucleic acid per pool) while the TAC platform requires 20 μL per of 48 PCR reactions (20 μL template nucleic acid added to each port). Two sets of samples were used in our evaluation of the assays: a validation panel containing respiratory pathogens of known concentrations, and a set of clinical specimens that had not undergone any other diagnostic assessment (Fig. 1 ). Sensitivity was calculated for the assays using the validation panel. Concordance between methods was assessed by the Kappa statistic using results from both the validation panel samples and the clinical specimens. For targets with imperfect agreement, McNemar's χ 2 test was used to test for independence.
