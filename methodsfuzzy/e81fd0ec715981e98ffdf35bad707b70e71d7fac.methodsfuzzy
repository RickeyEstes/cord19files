Eight cross-bred dogs from the same litter, 5-monthold, of both sexes, were used in the experiments. All the dogs were monitored from birth and maintained in the kennel of the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Uberlândia. They were housed in individual roofed, concrete compartments, cleaned daily with detergent and 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. All the food and water bowls of the dogs were cleaned daily using filtered water as a rinse. Food (commercial dog chow) was provided twice daily, as well as mineral water which was also changed twice daily. Clinical and laboratory examinations were carried out prior to the experiment to observe the physical conditions of the animals. Fecal samples were collected to look for eggs and larvae of helminths and cysts of G. duodenalis. All the dogs were negative for G. duodenalis and three were positive for Toxocara canis. The animals were treated with anthelmintic drugs in two doses at 21-day intervals (5.0 mg Praziquantel, 14.4 mg Pyrantel and 15 mg/kg Febantel). Additional parasitological exams were performed at 7-day intervals to confirm that they remained free of parasites. All of the dogs were immunized against adenovirus, coronavirus, distemper, leptospirosis, parainphluenza and parvovirus (Quantum 1 Dog DA2PPP vLCv, Schering Plough, Omaha, USA), three doses being administered at monthly intervals. They were also vaccinated against rabies (Quantum 1 Dog R, Schering Plough, Omaha, NE, E.U.A). All the dogs completed vaccination before the experimental period was initiated. Dogs were divided at random into three groups (A, B and C), groups A and B with three animals and group C with two. Group A was inoculated orally with 3 mL of TYI-S-33 medium with 1.35 Â 10 6 Giardia trophozoites and group B 3mL of TYI-S-33 medium with 1.35 Â 10 3 Giardia cysts. Group C was inoculated 3 mL of TYI-S-33 medium without Giardia and provided a control for the experiment. The cysts were collected from the feces of naturally infected children attending day care institutions. These children presented symptoms of giardiaisis or chronic elimination of cysts. The cysts were isolated according to the technique of Roberts- Thomson et al. (1976) , with adaptations. Trophozoites were obtained from culture maintained in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with bovine serum (Diamond et al., 1978; Keister, 1983) in the Amebiasis Laboratory of Department of Parasitology of Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil and characterized as Portland 1 (ATCC 30888). After inoculation, feces of dogs were collected daily and examined by flotation in 33% zinc sulfate solution (Faust et al., 1938) to detect cysts and determine the prepatent period. Once cysts appeared in the feces, collections were performed at weekly intervals throughout the 165 days of the experimental period. The cysts were quantified by a technique adapted from that of Roberts-Thomson et al. (1976) . Clinical examinations were carried out on all the dogs, 2 days before inoculation (day 2), on the day of inoculation and thereafter at 7-day intervals at 08:00a.m.-12:00a.m. throughout the 165 days of the experimental period, the animals always being examined in the same sequence. This involved monitoring weight, rectal temperature, femoral pulse and heart rate, cardiac and pulmonary auscultation, and palpation of the lymph nodes and abdomen. The aspect, proportion and consistency of the feces were evaluated twice daily during the cleaning of the individual kennels. Samples of 5 mL of blood were obtained by atraumatic jugular venipuncture of each animal, using a sterile disposable syringe. Two milliliters of the sample in EDTA were used to carry out the complete hemogram by the conventional technique of Dace and Lewis (1984) . Red and white blood cell counts were processed in an automatic cell counter (CELM 1 CC 510). Hemoglobinometry was carried out by the cyanometahemoglobin method on a CELM 1 Hb 520 hemoglobinometer and the hematocrit calculated by the microhematocrit method. The hematimetric indices of mean globular volume (MGV), mean globular hemoglobin (MGH) and mean globular hemoglobin concentration (MGHC) were calculated according to Jain (1986) . The differential leukocyte count was carried out on blood films stained by May-Grunwald-Giemsa to establish the percentages of each cell type (relative values) and transform them into absolute numbers (Ferreira Neto et al., 1981) . The remaining 3 mL of without anticoagulant blood was centrifuged at 700 Â g during 15 min. The serum obtained was used for the biochemical tests, including total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, urea and creatinine, using the standard commercial kit (Labtest 1 Diagnóstica S/ A) and a COBAS 1 MIRA/PLUS automatic biochemical analyzer (Roche Diagnostic, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). Blood samples were obtained 2 days before inoculation, on the day of inoculation and at 15-day intervals during the 165 days of the experimental period. Comparisons between groups A, B and C were carried out based on the days post-inoculation (p.i.). Parameters were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U-test and Student's t-test. Results were considered to be statistically significant at p 0.05. The GraphPad Prism 1 Version 4.00 program (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for statistical calculations.
