Cell lines IPEC-J2 cells, which are porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells that were originally isolated from the middle jejunum of neonatal piglets, were purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), while HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). IPEC-J2 and HEK293T cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose, respectively, supplemented with HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37ËšC in a 5% CO 2 incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
