The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of RSV in nasal/throat swabs in community-based elderly individuals with moderate-to-severe ILI. Secondary objectives were to estimate the prevalence of other respiratory viruses in this population, and in subgroups defined by pneumonia occurrence, hospitalization status, and ISS score >2. Statistical analyses used SAS Version 9.1 or later. Prevalence was calculated as a proportion with its 2-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) [16] . Possible associations between prevalence and baseline characteristics/clinical symptoms were explored using logistic regression with significance level set at P < .05.
