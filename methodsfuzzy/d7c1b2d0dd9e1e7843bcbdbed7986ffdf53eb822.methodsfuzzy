Aprotinin, also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, is one of the most studied proteinase inhibitors. It has been isolated from bovine organs and tissues [1] [2] [3] , and aprotinin-like inhibitors have been found in several organisms [4, 5] . Although isolated in 1930 [6] and extensively studied since then, its precise biological function remains unknown [7] . One property of aprotinin is its antimicrobial activity. It inhibits the growth of several Gram-positive and -negative bacteria [8] and the replication of influenza viruses [9, 10] . Both antibacterial and antiviral activities have been attributed to the proteinase inhibitory function of aprotinin. We recently reported that the bactericidal and antiproteolytic activities of aprotinin are not related and suggested that the bactericidal potency of aprotinin is due instead to its cationic and hydrophobic properties [11] . The purpose of this study was to determine if the antimicrobial actions of aprotinin require the intact molecular conformation or whether discrete peptide sequences within the molecule can fulfil this function. Aprotinin was digested by the proteinase, clostripain, to yield 5 fragments, one of which had potent antiviral activity. We have completely characterized and synthetically produced this fragment. Its properties are discussed in this report. *Corresponding author. Fax: (41) (1) 365 1323.
