In addition, inflammation markers were also recorded, which included white blood cell count (WBC) (5-12 Â 10 9 /L), percentage of neutrophils (40%-75%), neutrophil count (2-7 Â 10 9 /L), percentage of monocytes (3%-10%), procalcitonin (PCT), Creactive protein (CRP), PA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Routine blood test was performed by Sysmex XN9000 (Hyogo, Japan), PCT was tested by Roche cobas8000 (Indianapolis, IN, USA) system (reference value is 0.021-0.500 ng/mL), CRP and PA were tested by BECKMAN COULTER AU5800 (Brea, CA, USA) (reference value are 0-10.0 and 170-420 mg/L, respectively), and ESR was analyzed by Alifax TEST1 (Padova, Italy) analyzer (reference range: male 21 mm/h, female 26 mm/ h). Indirect immunofluorescence approach was employed to detect the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against 9 common respiratory pathogens including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza type A virus, influenza type B virus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3. The detection was performed by using VIRCELL IFA (Granada, Spain) kit according to the manufacture's instruction. The fluorescence was observed by using fluorescence microscope EUROSTARIII PLUS (Lubeck, Germany).
