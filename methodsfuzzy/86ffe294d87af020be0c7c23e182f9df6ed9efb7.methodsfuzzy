Xia et al. [63] developed a strategy for human plasma proteome research. Pre-fractionation of human plasma proteins using on-line strong cation-exchange chromatography and reversed phase liquid chromatography (SCX-RPLC) was performed and followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS identification. A total of 1292 distinct proteins were successfully identified, among which some proteins known to be present in serum at <10 ng/mL were detected. Hood et al. [54] developed a MDLC strategy that did not involve depletion of the high-abundance serum proteins. This involved the use of tandem anion-and cation-exchange chromatography followed by tryptic digestion and RPLC-MS/MS, resulting in the identification of 4567 unique proteins. These proteins represent approximately 16% of all mouse proteins; and 16 of the 34 proteins involved in the ␤-catenim/Wnt signaling pathway could be identified. Zabrouskov et al. [64] utilized SEC and SAX to fractionate chloroplast proteins prior to Fourier transform mass spectrometry analysis of the intact proteins. Sharma et al. [65] investigated lysates from S. oneidensis using weak anion-exchange chromatography combined with on-line RPLC-FT-ICR mass spectrometer. A set of 715 intact proteins was detected using this protocol.
