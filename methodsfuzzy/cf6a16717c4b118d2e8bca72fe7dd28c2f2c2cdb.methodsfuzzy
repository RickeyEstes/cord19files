Reagents. Plasma-derived (native) HBenvAg (Sorin, Saluggia, Italy), containing all three (pre-S1, pre-S2, S) hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins, was purified from patients with chronic HBV infection as described (15) . This antigen preparation contains high levels of pre-S1, pre-S2, and S reactivity as shown by solid phase ELISA (15) . Recombinant (r) particles containing the entire surface protein ofHBV (pre-S1, pre-S2, S) expressed in yeast (16) were a gift from P. J. Kniskern (Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, PA). A deleted rHBenvAg form containing only the 12-52 sequence of the pre-S1 domain, the 133-145 sequence of the pre-S2 domain, and the entire S domain (S,L antigen [17] ), a recombinant protein displaying antigenic determinants en-A part of this work has appeared in abstract form (]. Cell. Biochera. 15 coded by pre-S2 and S regions (pre-S2, S), and a recombinant protein containing only the S region (S), all expressed in yeast (17) , were kindly donated by P. Hanser andJ. Petre (SmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium). Another r(pre-S2, S) protein expressed in CHO cells (18) was provided by P. Adamowicz (Pasteur Vaccines, Marnes-La Coquette, France). Purified native tetanus toxoid (TT) was obtained from Institut Merieux (Marcy-12Etoile, France). The synthetic peptide analogues of pre-S1, pre-S2, and S regions were purchased from American Peptide Company, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Soluble Tf was purchased from Calbiochem-Behring Corp. (San Diego, CA). OKTll (anti-CD2), OKT3 (anti-CD3), OKT4A (anti-CD4), OKT8 (anti-CDS), OKT1 (anti-CD5), OKT26a (anti-CD25), OKT10 (anti-CD38), and OKT9 (anti-CD71) mAbs were purchased from Ortho Pharmaceutical (Raritan, NJ). Anti-Leu-M5 (anti-CD18/LFA-1 fl chain) and anti-Leu-19 (anti-CD56) mAbs were purchased from Becton Dickinson & Co. (Mountain View, CA); anti-CD54 (anti-ICAM-1) mAb was from Immunotech (Marseille, France); anti-CD58 (anti-LFA-3; TS 2/9 clone) was obtained from T. A. Springer (19, 20) . The W6/32 mAb to monomorphic determinants of class I Ag was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (Malvern, PA). The Q5/13 mAb to framework determinants of HLA-DR was kindly provided by P. Giacomini (Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy). Anti-HLA-DQ and anti-HLA-DP were purchased from Becton Dickinson & Co. The purchased anti-MHC molecule mAbs were used after dialysis. Antigen-specific T Cell Clones. Antigen-specific T cell clones were derived from PBL of two HB vaccine (HEVAC-B; Pasteur Institut, Paris, France) recipients, whose HLA-DR typings were DR5 and DR2,3, respectively. Briefly, PBL were plated (10 s per well) in 96well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA) in the presence of 10 #g/ml HBenvAg, and 20 U/ml rib2 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were added after 5 d. After an additional 5-6 d, growing cultures were expanded with IL-2, and a 15-d cycle of restimulation with antigen plus autologous irradiated (i)PBL was used as APC. Cultures chosen for their capacity to proliferate in response to HBenvAg in the presence of autologous iAPC were cloned by limiting dilution at 0.3 cells per well with 1/~g/ml PHA (Wellcome, Dartford, UK), rib2, and allogeneic iAPC, as described (14, 15) . Table I shows antigen specificity and HLA restriction of the selected T clones. Random T clones, obtained by cloning autologous or aUogeneic PBL with PHA and HLA-incompatible feeder cells, or EBV-transformed B (EBV-B) cells were used as APC. Cytotoxicity Assay. S~Cr-labeled EBV-B cells or T clones (target cells) were pulsed at 37~ (4 h) with increasing concentrations of entire HBenvAg (native or recombinant) or synthetic peptides. In specific cytotoxicity inhibition experiments, S~Cr-labeled target cells were incubated with 2/~g/ml of various mAbs for 1 h at 37~ before or after pulsing with either antigen or peptide. In some experiments, labeled target cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Tf for 2 h at 37~ washed, and pulsed with HBenvAg or TT for another 2 h at 37~ Viability of target cells before and after incubations with mAbs or Tf was 100%. Target cells were washed, and cultured (5 x 103) for 4 h with antigen-specific T clones, at a 10:1 E/T ratio into 96-weU roundbottomed plates in triplicate. Plates were then centrifuged, cell-free supernatants were collected from each well, and SlCr release was evaluated in a gamma counter. Percent specific lysis is expressed as the mean of triplicate determinations and is calculated as follows: 100x (experimental release -spontaneous release)/(maximal release -spontaneous release). uSI-Tf uSI-HBenvAg, and Competitive Binding Assays. Purified human Tf (>99%) was conjugated with lzsI by the solid-phase lactoperoxidase system (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). The binding reactions were performed in 12 x 75-mm polypropylene tubes in RPMI 1640 containing 0.2% BSA (Fraction V; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Cell concentration was 5 x 106 cells/ml; labeled Tf, 500 ng/ml; and unlabeled Tf at different concentrations (0-500 #g/ml). In some experiments, unlabeled Tf was replaced by different molecular constructs of HBenvAg added at a final concentration ranging from 0 to 200 #g/ml. The cells were incubated for 120 min at 4~ and unbound ligand was removed by passaging cells through a density cushion, as described (21) . After incubation, 200-/zl aliquots of the cell suspension, layered over 150 #1 of a mixture of dibutyl phthalate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) up to a final density of 1.025 in 400-#1 plastic microfuge tubes, were centrifuged in a microfuge (Jouan Inc., Winchester, VA) (10,000g, 2 rain). The resulting supernatant and most of the phthalate oil cushion were aspirated. The tips of the vials containing the cell pellet were severed with a scalpel and transferred into plastic vials, and the radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. '~I-HBenvAg binding was performed under similar experimental conditions, except for labeled ligand concentration (1.25/~g/ml). After incubation, cells were processed for '~I-Tf binding assay.
