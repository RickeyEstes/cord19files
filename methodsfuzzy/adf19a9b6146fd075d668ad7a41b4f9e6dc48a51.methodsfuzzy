Expression construct design, protein expression, and purification Synthetic genes encoding the ectodomain portion of the TM subunit (TM E ) of syn1 (residues 342 to 435, GenBank accession number Q9UQF0) and of syn2 (residues 375 to 468, GenBank accession number P60508) were codon optimized for protein expression in bacteria and purchased from GeneArt. Cloning into the expression vector pET28-a vector (Novagen) was done using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs). The expression constructs contained the N-terminal six-histidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus cleavage site ENLYFQS (Fig. 1A) . The expression plasmids, syn1-TM E and syn2-TM E , were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 cells (New England Biolabs), which were used as the expression host. Cell cultures were grown in Miller lysogeny broth (LB) containing 50 mg/L kanamycin (Sigma) at 37 C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and 3 h later, the cells from 1 L of culture were collected by centrifugation at 4000Âg for 20 min (Beckman Coulter centrifuge, JLA 8.1 rotor). Cells were lysed by sonication (Bioblock Scientific Vibra Cell sonicator 75041) in 50 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.2 mM phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble fraction was removed by two rounds of centrifugation (3000Âg for 20 min [Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge] and 50,000Âg for 30 min [Beckman Coulter centrifuge, JA25.50 rotor]). The clarified lysate was filtered through a 0.22 mm filter (Millipore) before being loaded to 1 ml HisTrap Excel column (GE Healthcare). Protein purification was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eluted material was concentrated and further purified by SEC on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) using 10 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl as running buffer. Protein concentration was calculated using the extinction coefficient (calculated on ExPASy server [60] ) of 0.6 ml/mg and 0.7 ml/mg for syn1-and syn2-TM E , respectively.
