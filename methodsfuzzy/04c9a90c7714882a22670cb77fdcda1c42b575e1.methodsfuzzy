At 6 1 2 hr p.i., the me-Cells and viruses dium was removed, and cells were UV-irradiated for various intervals with a dose rate of 40 ergrs 01 rmm 02 Equine arteritis virus (Bucyrus strain) and SIN (HR strain) were grown in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-(the total dose was between 0 and 3600 ergrmm 02 ). of RNA synthesis after t sec of irradiation, N 0 that of the dose of 2400 ergrmm 02 at 4, 5, or 6 hr p.i., and metabolically labeled RNA was subsequently analyzed as de-unirradiated control, and K is a constant (Sauerbier and Hercules, 1978) . Curves were fitted using linear regres-scribed. sion analysis. Inhibition of protein synthesis In a separate experiment, the effect of UV irradiation at different time points in infection was investigated. EAV-Protein synthesis was inhibited by replacing the medium with medium containing 100 mg/ml of cyclohexi-infected BHK-21 cells were UV-irradiated with a single Spaan et al. (1988) , and Strauss et al. (1984) . such as the sg RNAs found in EAV-infected cells, are derived from the same precursor molecule. If so, the sensitivity of their synthesis to UV irradiation (UV target the well-characterized alphavirus SIN, using the same size) will for all sg RNAs be identical to the target size irradiation doses and the same BHK-21 cells used for of that precursor. Alternatively, when the transcription the EAV analysis. The length of the 49S SIN genomic of sg RNAs is fully independent from that of the ge-RNA (11.7 kb) is comparable to that of EAV (12.7 kb) (Fig. nome, a UV target size which is proportional to its physical size should be measured for each sg RNA. 1). The replication of SIN involves the synthesis of a EAV-infected BHK-21 cells were UV-irradiated at 6 1 2 hr single 4.1-kb sg RNA (26S) from a well-defined internal promoter on the genome-sized minus-strand template p.i., when RNA synthesis approaches its maximum (van RNA (Ou et al., 1982; Levis et al., 1990) . As shown in Fig. Berlo et al., 1982 , and data not shown). Subsequently, viral RNA synthesis was monitored by [ 3 H]uridine incor-2 and Table 1 , the relative physical and UV target sizes poration. In parallel, 3 H-labeled RNA was isolated from of the genomic and sg SIN transcripts were in good MHV-infected cells which were UV-irradiated at 6 hr p.i. agreement, as was previously shown by Brzeski and Ken-To determine the UV inactivation kinetics for individual nedy (1978) . In addition to this difference with the corona-RNA species, 3 H-labeled RNAs were separated in denaand arterivirus systems, SIN transcription in general was turing agarose gels. Representative fluorographs for both less sensitive to UV irradiation than EAV and MHV tranviruses are shown in Fig. 2A . For both EAV and MHV, scription. we restricted our analysis to the genomic RNA and three sg RNAs (2, 6, and 7). Bands were cut from four agarose UV irradiation has differential effects early and late in gels, derived from two independent experiments. In Fig. EAV infection 2B the average percentages of remaining RNA synthesis have been plotted against the UV dose. These graphs Yokomori et al. (1992) showed that during the early clearly show that for both viruses the sg RNA synthesis stages of MHV infection the UV target sizes of sg RNAs is not directly dependent on the synthesis of a genomeapproach that of the genomic RNA. This observation length precursor RNA. On the other hand, the UV target prompted us to compare the UV target sizes of the EAV sizes of the RNAs, which are reflected by the slopes of transcripts at three different time points in infection. In the curves, are not proportional to their physical sizes Fig. 3 the reduction in the synthesis of RNAs 1, 2, 6, and either (Table 1) . Compared to the genomic RNA, the syn-7 is compared after UV irradiation with a single dose thesis of sg RNAs of both EAV and MHV is more sensitive (2400 ergrmm 02 ) at 4, 5, or 6 hr p.i. and subsequent to UV irradiation than would be expected on the basis metabolic labeling for 1 hr. Quantitative analysis on the of their lengths. basis of two experiments showed that, similar to the situation in coronavirus-infected cells, UV sensitivities Sindbis virus UV transcription mapping during early and late transcription were different. Upon irradiation at 4 or 5 hr p.i. the relative decrease in the To investigate whether the discrepancy between relasynthesis of the genomic and sg RNAs was similar, tive physical sizes and UV target sizes of genomic and whereas after irradiation at 6 hr p.i. sg RNA synthesis sg RNAs is typical of arteri-and coronavirus transcription, a UV transcription mapping analysis was carried out for was less affected than that of RNA 1 (Fig. 3B) .
