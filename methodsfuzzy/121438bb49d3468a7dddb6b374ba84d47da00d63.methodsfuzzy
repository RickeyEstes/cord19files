Brains from two Galago demidoff (brain masses of 3.27 and 3.45 g), two Perodicticus potto (brain masses of 12.79 and 14.12 g) and two Lemur catta (brain masses of 24.11 and 26.72 g) were used in the present study. Permits were obtained from the relevant wildlife authority in the Democratic Republic of Congo for G. demidoff and P. potto, as well as from the Copenhagen Zoo for L. catta. All animals were handled according to the guidelines of the University of the Witwatersrand Animal Ethics Committee. Each animal was weighed, anaesthetized and subsequently euthanized with appropriate doses of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg sodium pentobarbital/kg). Upon cessation of respiration the animals were perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), approximately 1 l/kg of each solution, both solutions having a temperature of approximately 4 8C. The brains were then carefully removed from the skulls and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB at 4 8C. Each brain was then frozen in crushed dry ice and sectioned into 50 mm thick serial coronal sections on a freezing microtome. A one in six series of sections, cut at 50 mm thickness in the coronal plane, was made for Nissl substance, myelin, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (hypocretin/OxA) staining. Sections used for the Nissl series were mounted on 0.5% gelatine-coated glass slides, cleared in a solution of 1:1 chloroform and absolute alcohol, then stained in 1% cresyl violet to reveal cell bodies. Myelin sections were first stored in 5% formalin for two weeks at 4 8C then mounted on 1.5% packed core (A6c) of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons was surrounded by a shell of less densely packed (A6d) tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons. This combination of compact and diffuse divisions of the locus coeruleus complex is only found in primates and megachiropterans of all the mammalian species studied to date. This neural character, along with variances in a range of other neural characters, supports the phylogenetic grouping of primates with megachiropterans as a sister group. ß 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the immunohistochemical staining, each section was treated with endogenous peroxidase inhibitor (49.2% methanol:49.2% 0.1 M PB: 1.6% of 30% H 2 O 2 ) for 30 min and subsequently subjected to three 10 min 0.1 M PB rinses. Sections were then preincubated for 2 h, at room temperature, in blocking buffer (containing 3% normal goat serum for the TH, 5-HT and OxA sections or 3% normal rabbit serum for the ChAT sections, plus 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton-X in 0.1 M PB). This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. The sections were then placed in the primary antibody solution that contained the appropriate diluted primary antibody in blocking buffer for 48 h at 4 8C under gentle agitation. Anti-choline acetyltransferase (AB144P, Millipore, raised in goat) at a dilution of 1:3000 was used to reveal cholinergic neurons. Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (AB151, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500 revealed the catecholaminergic neurons. Serotonergic neurons were revealed using anti-serotonin (AB938, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500. Orexinergic neurons were revealed using anti-Orexin A (AB3704, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:3000. This incubation was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB and the sections were then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (1:1000 dilution of biotinylated antirabbit IgG, BA-1000, Vector Labs, for TH, 5-HT and OxA sections, or a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-goat IgG, BA-5000, Vector Labs, for ChAT sections, in a blocking buffer containing 3% NGS/NRS and 2% BSA in 0.1 M PB) for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB, after which sections were incubated for 1 h in avidin-biotin solution (at a dilution of 1:125, Vector Labs), followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. Sections were then placed in a solution of 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 0.1 M PB for 5 min, followed by the addition of 3 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide to each 1 ml of solution in which each section was immersed. Chromatic precipitation was visually monitored and verified under a low power stereomicroscope. Staining was continued until such time as the background stain was at a level that would assist architectural reconstruction without obscuring the immunopositive neurons. Development was arrested by placing sections in 0.1 M PB, followed by two more rinses in this solution. Sections were then mounted on 0.5% gelatine coated glass slides, dried overnight, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with Depex. To test for non-specific staining, the primary antibody or the secondary antibody was omitted in selected section, which resulted in no staining of the tissue. Sections were examined under a low power stereomicroscope and using a camera lucida, the architectonic borders of the sections were traced following the Nissl and myelin stained sections. Sections containing the immunopositive neurons were matched to the drawings and the neurons were marked. All drawings were then scanned and redrawn using the Canvas 8 drawing programme (Fig. 1) .
