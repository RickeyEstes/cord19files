Once protein crystals can be grown reproducibly in a high-quality crystal form suitable for SBDD, the next major bottleneck is finding the solution to the phase problem. If coordinates of a related homolog or domain are available, model-based phasing using the molecular replacement method is the preferred strategy because of its relative speed. 167 Modern molecular replacement software implementing improved search features such as likelihood-enhanced rotation and translation functions, 168, 169 improved procedures for constructing molecular replacement search models, 170 and a burgeoning PDB databank of 3D macromolecular structure data, 171, 172 are literally pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished with the method. When preexisting structural data is absent or insufficient for molecular replacement phasing, other methods must be employed. Historically, the most commonly used structure-solving technique was multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), which relies on the preparation of derivative crystals in which one or more types of heavy atoms are bound specifically and uniformly to the macromolecules within the crystal. The outcome of the MIR method is additionally contingent on the heavy-atom derivatives being truly isomorphous, i.e., bearing no (or at most, extremely limited) alterations in molecular structure and unit-cell dimensions. Successful phase determination by MIR is consequently rate-limited by the speed with which suitable heavy-atom derivatives can be obtained. The advancement of multiplewavelength anomalous dispersion phasing 114, 173 and the construction of tunable synchrotron x-ray beamlines worldwide have made multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion the method of choice for experimental phase determination, particularly for high-throughput (HT) SBDD applications. One of the big advantages multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing offers over MIR and related methods such as SIRAS and MIRAS (single or multiple-isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) is the reduction of systematic error since all data are measured on a single sample. The resulting phase angles are therefore more accurately determined and the resulting electron density maps are typically of higher quality than maps calculated with phases derived from isomorphous methods. Multiplewavelength anomalous dispersion phasing requires the presence of a suitable number of atoms having an x-ray absorption edge in the energy range easily accessible by tunable synchrotron sources (typically l ¼ 0.8-1.3 Å). Most multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing experiments are carried out using selenomethionine-substituted (SeMet) proteins, 174, 175 although sometimes SeMet multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing can be an inappropriate method for phase determination. 176 In such situations, multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing can be carried out with bound elements of atomic numbers B20-40 (or above B60), as they have synchrotronaccessible absorption edges. These elements can often be found as natural metal cofactors in proteins (such as transition metals) or can be diffused into protein crystals using conventional heavy-atom soaking methods. [177] [178] [179] [180] Prescreening for the degree of SeMet or heavy atom incorporation into the target protein can be rapidly carried out by mass spectrometry. 181 Alternatively, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments allow for a quick and simple assessment of heavy atom binding, optimal binding concentrations, and impact on protein stability. 182 Explorations of novel approaches for introducing anomalous scattering elements into protein crystals for the purpose of multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing has led to a robust collection of new phasing alternatives. For example, chemically modified ligands can be used as rational phasing tools, such as halogenated nucleotides for multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of nucleotide-binding proteins 183 or selenium-substituted saccharides for carbohydratebinding proteins. 184 Multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with krypton has been demonstrated as a feasible technique, 185 as has cryosoaking with halides 186, 187 or mono-and polyvalent cations. 188, 189 Several other unique procedures for producing derivatives have appeared over the years and continued exploration in this field will surely generate additional phasing alternatives. Moreover, modern developments in the area of utilizing soft x-rays (l ¼ 1.5-3.0 Å) for sulfur-based anomalous phasing -a technique pioneered more than 20 years ago by Hendrickson & Teeter for the structure determination of crambin 190 -may eventually circumvent the need for derivatization in most cases altogether.
