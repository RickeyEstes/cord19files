Sixty Patients (30 males and 30 females) admitted to the infectious disease unit of Auckland Hospital with gastroenteritis were studied. Gastroenteritis was defined as acute development of unusually frequent and loose stools with or without vomiting. The first stool passed after admission was collected in a sterile plastic container and processed on the day of collection or the day following overnight storage at 4Â°C. Eighteen control patients (11 males and seven females) with non-diarrhoeal diseases were studied. Clinical features were obtained on review of the patients' notes.
