Preparation of the bladder acellular matrix graft. The homologous BAMGs were freshly prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat bladders as previously described,' according to a method adapted from Meezan et a1.l' In brief, bladders from Sprague Dawley rats obtained from our institution's tissuesharing program were excised and placed in a 35-mm. Petri dish containing 50 ml. of 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline Requests for reprints: Klinik und Poliklmlk fiir Urologie, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Albert-Schweltzer-Strape 33, D-48129 Munster, Germany.

The bladders were inverted and the mucosa was scraped off with a pair of glass slides. The remaining lamina propria and detrusor muscle were treated with 50 ml. of 10 mM PBS-0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5 to 6 hours for partial cell lysis. Bladders were then washed with 40 ml. of PBS before treatment with With this, cell lysis was complete and all the intracellular components were released. The samples were then treated with 50 ml. of 4% sodium desoxycholate containing 0.1% sodium azide and stirred for 5 to 6 hours to solubilize the lipid bilayer cell membranes and intracellular membrane lipids. This was repeated once. The resultant BAMG was washed three times with 50 ml. PBS and stored in 10% neomycin sulfate at 4C until grafted. Surgical technique. Male (n = 16) and female (n = 15) Sprague Dawley rats (age 2.9 -t 0.19 months; weight 284.5 -t 14.7 grams) were anesthetized with pentobarbital, 40 mg./kg. intraperitoneally. Through a midline lower abdominal incision, the bladder was exposed and partial cystectomy (>50%) was performed. The full-bladder-size BAMG (approximately 9 x 6 mm. undistended) was grafted to the remaining host bladder with a continuous polyfdament-coated 8 -0 absorbable suture for both the anterior and posterior wall. To identify the matrix borders, 4 non-absorbable monofilament 7 -0 button sutures were placed-one each at the anterior, posterior, left and right sides, 3 to 4 mm. apart. Suture integrity was tested by instillation of saline through a urethral tube in the female rats and by puncturing the posterior host bladder wall in the male. When satisfactory closure was obtained, the abdominal wall and the skin were closed in two layers. No drainage was used and no drugs were administered. All animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions. Two animals were sacrificed at 2.5 months and two more at 8.5 months (urethane anesthesia 11.1 gm&. intrapentone-1717 d y ] followed by bilateral thoracotomy). All remaining rats were sacrificed 4 months postoperatively. Of these, 6 were saved for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation only. The remaining bladders were subjected to immediate tissue bath studies. The earlier (2.5-month) and later (8.5month) time points, although not central to the present in vitro study, were chosen to confirm observations in our previous investigation' in which characteristic histological changes were apparent at 2.5 months and neural regeneration continued beyond 4 months. Tissue bath experiments: Tissue preparation. The excised bladders were placed in a Petri dish with chilled Krebs solution and carefully dissected free from sparse adherent connective tissue. Full-thickness longitudinal bladder strips of uniform size (approximately 7 mm. long and 2 mm. wide) were obtained from both the regenerates and the host bladder wall. With the former, great care was taken to ensure that only regenerated bladder from within the area delineated by the marking sutures was used. The strips were mounted in the tissue bath to a glass tissue support hook on one side and an isometric force displacement transducer (Radnoti Glass Technology, Monrovia CAI on the other by means of two spring wire clips connected with 4 -0 braided silk. All preparations were sufficiently durable to withstand the grip of the wire clips during repeated or continuous contractions. Peak contraction values were related to the weight of each individual muscle strip. Tissue bath and recording and stimulating equipment. The 30-ml. double-chambered Quiet Bath (Radnoti Glass Technology) was used. Its working chamber was connected to a second chamber with 95% oxygen and 5% CO, infusion. The gas flow induced circulation of Krebs solution, which was warmed to 37C by an external heating circuit (circulating pump Thermomix BU, Braun Instruments, Burlingame CAI. Forces lower than 1 mNewton (0.1 gm.) without bubble artifacts could be measured in the working chamber. The transducer signals were fed into a thermal array recorder (Gould TA 4000, Gould Inc., Valley View OH). For tissue stimulation, vertical L-shaped, custom-made platinum iridium electrodes (15 mm. long, 0.18 mm. diameter) separated by 10 mm. were used with a Grass S44 stimulator (Grass Instrument Co., Quincy MA). The tissue was mounted parallel to the electrodes at a preload of 25 mNewton (2.5 gm.), resulting in a resting tension of about 8 mNewton (0.8 gm.) a t the end of a 60-minute equilibration period. A custom-made currentdistribution box supplied supramaximal current of 0.14 amperes (A) at 15 V, which was sequentially delivered to two of eight chambers. Electrical field stimulation. Based on preliminary lengthtension, frequency-response and current-response studies of normal rat detrusor smooth muscle, we used the following supramaximal stimulation parameters: bipolar, monophasic balance-charged rectangular pulses; 1-msec pulse duration; 1 to 80 pulses per second (pps) frequency; 10-second stimula-tion trains; 2-minute intervals between stimulations; 0.14 A amplitude at 15 V. To minimize artifacts related to tissue exhaustion or drug interference, each muscle strip was subjected to only one series of electrical field stimulations followed by administration of only one of the agonistdantagonists. To avoid pharmacologic interference with the reagents, bladders used in the tissue bath experiments were not used for histological or immunohistochemical evaluation. Staining. Some of the reserved specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 24 hours. After dehydration in graded ethanol solutions, the specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 pm.) and stained with trichrome for collagen and smooth muscle, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for nuclei, a-actin for smooth muscle, and the nonspecific neuronal protein gene product (PGP 9.5) for nerves. PGP 9.5 represents a major protein component of the neural cytoplasm and therefore labels more nerve fibers than other general nerve markers." Enzyme histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase (AChE was performed after pre-treating sections with 10-5M tetraisoproply pyrophosphoramide (Sigma) for 30 minutes to block the non-specific cholinesterase staining. The remainder of the AChE evaluation was carried out according to the method of El-Badawi and Schenk." Tissue for adrenergic staining was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after embedding in OCT. It was then cut in 10-pm. sections, mounted on SuperfrostTM slides and air-dried. Adrenergic staining was conducted with the modified glyoxylic acid monoamine histofluorescent technique described by de la Torre and S~r g e o n . '~ For NADPH-diaphorase staining, slides were incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature in M, 1 ml.; carbachol M, 1 ml.; valethamate bromide 2.6 X M, 1 ml. Newberyite (20 to 100%) and brushite (10 to 100%).
