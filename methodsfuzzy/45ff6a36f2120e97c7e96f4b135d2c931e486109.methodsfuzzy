As pointed out above, a fine and complete characterization of chitosan-NA polyplexes is greatly needed to better understand their mechanism of formation as well as the influence of their properties on transfection efficiency. Chitosan-NA particles have been characterized for their physico-chemical properties to various extents in many studies since their first use for delivery of NA was reported by Mumper et al. in 1995 [246] . An overview of the reported physico-chemical properties of chitosan-nucleotide particles and the influence of formulation parameters on these properties as well as the characterization techniques is given below. Particular differences between plasmid DNA and siRNA are discussed. Table 1 provides a list of techniques that have been used or that could be used to characterize chitosan-NA particles.
