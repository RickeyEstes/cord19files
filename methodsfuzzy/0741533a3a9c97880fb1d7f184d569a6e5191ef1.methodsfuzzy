Study participants. Prospective study including patients under 18 years of age who received allogenic HSCT at La Paz University Hospital (Madrid, Spain), from January 2017 to June 2018. Exclusion criteria included chronic lung disease prior to HSCT. HSCT was performed according to current centre protocols, using bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells as haematopoietic stem cell source. Acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) were defined and graded as previously reported 27, 28 . Age-and sex-matched controls were recruited among healthy patients undergoing elective surgery. Cases and controls were also matched according to procedure date (HSCT and elective surgery, respectively) ± 1 week. All research was performed in accordance to local regulations. Informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from the parents of all children. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at La Paz University Hospital. Study samples. Study samples were peripheral blood (PB) and NPAs that were collected prior to the conditioning regimen and after HSCT at days 15 and 30 for PB mononuclear cells and before the conditioning regimen and at days 0, 10, 20 and 30 after HSCT for NPAs. The following tests were performed in each sample type: • PB: total, T and NK cell counts. • NPAs: total T and NK cell counts, natural cytotoxicity receptors, viral detection. For NPA collection, 1 mL of 0.9% saline solution was instilled into each nostril and the nasopharynx was suctioned using a sterile catheter with a mucus trap. NPAs were not performed if the patient had active bleeding or his platelet count was below 20.000/mm3. NPA samples containing blood were considered not valid and discarded. Each specimen was sent to the Respiratory Virus and Influenza Unit at the National Microbiology Center (ISCIII, Madrid, Spain) for viral analysis and to the Translational Research in Paediatric Oncology, Hematopoietic Transplantation & Cell Therapy Unit at La Paz Hospital Research Institute (Madrid, Spain) for flow cytometry assays. NPAs were processed within 24 hours after collection. In the control group, NPAs were collected on the day of surgery. Viral detection by Rt-pcR. Upon reception of the samples, three aliquots were prepared and stored at −80 °C. Both the reception and the NPA sample processing areas are separated from those defined as working areas. Three independent RT-PCR assays were performed to detect sixteen respiratory viruses as previously published by our group [29] [30] [31] . Influenza A, B and C viruses were detected by using previously described primer sets only to amplify influenza viruses in a multiplex PCR assay 29 . A second multiplex PCR was used to detect parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, enteroviruses and HRV 30 . Presence of RSV A and B types, HMPV, HBoV and adenoviruses was established using a third multiplex RT-nested PCR−BRQ method 31 . Cell characterization by flow cytometry. For flow cytometry assays, NPA samples were filtered with a 70 µm cell strainer (Falcon), centrifuged at 1400 rpm (5 min) and suspended in 100 µl of PBS. Total sample volume was acquired using a Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The total cell count per sample was determined. T cell (CD45+, CD3+ CD56−) and Natural killer (NK) cell (CD45+, CD56+, CD3−) populations were identified using the following labelled antibodies: CD45-FITC/ APCCy7 (clone 2D1, BD Pharmingen), CD56-APC (clone NCAM16.2, BD Pharmingen) and CD3-PECy7 (clone UCHT1, Biolegend). Fluorescent cell viability dye 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen) was used to exclude dead cells. FlowJo v10.0.7 software (TreeStar) was used for data analysis. The expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), NKG2A and NKG2D receptors on NK cells subpopulation in NPA was evaluated with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: NKG2D CD314-PE (clone BAT221, MiltenyiBiotec); NKp46 CD335-FITC (clone 9E2, AbDSerotec); NKp44 CD-336-PE (clone 44, BD Pharmingen); NKp30 CD337-PE (clone REA823, MiltenyiBiotec); NKG2A-PE (clone 131411, R&D systems; T1, Biolegend).
