A dose of 10 5 50% TCID 50 of SARS-CoV (Urbani) was administered intranasally to a lightly anesthetized, 6-wk-old female BALB/c mouse in a total volume of 50 lL [30] . Two days after inoculation, the mouse was euthanized, and its lungs were removed and homogenized with an EX-Gen Omni GLH homogenizer (Omni International, http://www.omni-inc.com) as a 10% w/v suspension in Leibovitz's L15 Medium (Invitrogen, http:// www.invitrogen.com), supplemented with the following antibiotics: 0.4 mg/L piperacillin (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com), 0.1 mg/L gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 5 mg/L amphotericin B (Quality Biological, http://www.qualitybiological.com). The lung homogenate was clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 2,000 rpm (650g) for 5 min, and the supernatant was administered intranasally to three naïve mice. The process of intranasal inoculation of three female BALB/c mice with pooled, clarified supernatants of 10% lung homogenates collected 2 to 3 d.p.i. was repeated 14 times. Identification of lethal phenotype and biological cloning of a lethal virus. The supernatant from P15 lung homogenates was subjected to three rounds of terminal dilution on Vero cells. Then, 5-fold serial dilutions were added to cells in 96-well plates (one dilution/plate). Two to three days later, when cytopathic effect was evident in no more than nine wells per plate, supernatants from infected wells were collected, diluted, and transferred to fresh monolayers of Vero cells. After the third round of terminal dilution, 50 lL of five independent clones were screened for lethality in four 8-wk-old female BALB/c mice. Mortality associated with these five clones was between 50% and 100%. One of these five clones (MA15) that caused 100% lethality within 6 d was expanded by two more passages in Vero cells and used in further studies. Virus replication in the respiratory tract of mice. Young (6-to 8wk-old), female BALB/c mice were lightly anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 50 lL of serially diluted virus. For SARS-CoV (Urbani), a dose of 10 5 TCID 50 /mouse was administered unless noted otherwise. For lethal doses of MA15 virus, the dose administered was equal to10 5.6 TCID 50 /mouse; for sub-lethal doses, the dose administered was equal to 10 3.6 TCID 50 /mouse. At various time points p.i., mice were euthanized and tissues collected for analyses. For determination of viral titers, tissues were homogenized to a final 10%w/v suspension in Leibovitz's L15 Medium supplemented with antibiotics. Tissue homogenates were clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and virus titers were determined in Vero cells on 24-and 96-well plates as previously described [30] . Virus titers are expressed as TCID 50 /g of tissue with a lower limit of detection of 10 1.5 TCID 50 /g. Purification of vRNA. Tissues homogenates were clarified by lowspeed centrifugation; supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes (http://www.eppendorf.com) and further clarified by centrifugation at 16,000g for 3 min. vRNA was extracted from 600 lL of supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, http:// www1.qiagen.com) eluted in 50 lL of water, quantified by measurement of optical density at 280 nm on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, http://www.nanodrop.com), and stored at À80 8C. RT-PCR and sequence analysis. First-strand cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription from RNA purified from clarified cell supernatants of Vero cells infected with either SARS-CoV MA15, SARS-CoV (Urbani) (P0), or from the clarified supernatants of P15 lung homogenates using reagents from the Brilliant qRT-PCR Plus Core Reagent Kit (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com). In brief, 11 lL of vRNA was heat denatured at 95 8C for 2 min and quenched on ice before addition of 10X Core RT Buffer, 0.2 lg random primers, 0.08 lmol dNTP mixture, and 20U StrataScript reverse transcriptase for a 20-lL reaction mixture. Reverse transcription was performed with an initial incubation of 25 8C for 10 min, followed by a 30-min incubation at 45 8C and a 3-min denaturation at 95 8C. First-strand cDNAs were amplified in overlapping PCR products spanning the entire genome. Three microliters of each cDNA reaction were amplified by PCR using the Advantage-HF PCR Kit (BD Biosciences, http://www.bdbiosciences.com) or Herculase Enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as per manufacturers' protocols. Fifteen pairs of primers were used to generate the overlapping PCR products (Tables S1 and S2). Amplification products were visualized on agarose gels and purified by use of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). PCR products were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions, using 69 forward and 62 reverse primers (Table S3) . Automated sequencing was performed utilizing the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) as per manufacturer's instructions on an ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were assembled and analyzed with Vector NTI and Auto Assembler DNA Sequence Assembly Software (ABI Prism; Applied Biosystems). When a mutation was identified in comparison with the SARS-CoV (Urbani) published sequence, independent RT-PCR reactions were run and subsequent RT-PCR products were sequenced through the region containing the putative mutation to confirm the mutation. Detection of SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues or whole blood and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with an on-column DNase digestion (RNase-Free DNase Set; Qiagen), as per manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 0.8 g of tissue, cut into pieces no larger than 0.5 cm on any one side, was collected into 1 mL of RNAlater (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com) and stored at room temperature for 24 h and subsequently at 4 8C until processed. Any unused tissue remaining after one month was moved to À20 8C. Approximately one-half or 0.2-0.4 g of tissue was homogenized with a disposable probe (Omni International) in 900 lL of RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen), supplemented with 1% (v/v) b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). RLT suspensions were transferred to 1.8-mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4 8C for 3 min at 16,000g. RNA was purified further as per manufacturer's protocol. RNA from blood (;0.5 mL per sample) was purified using a QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's protocol with the additional DNase on-column digestion. RNAs were quantified and 100 ng were reverse transcribed and amplified as described above. In brief, total RNA was heat denatured at 95 8C for 2 min and quenched on ice before addition of 10X First Strand Buffer, 20U RNase Block, 0.3 lg random primers, 0.08 lmol dNTP mixture, 25U StrataScript reverse transcriptase, and water for a 20-lL reaction. Reverse transcription was performed with an initial incubation at 25 8C for 10 min, followed by a 30-min incubation at 45 8C and a 3-min denaturation at 95 8C. Three microliters from each RT reaction were subsequently used in a 50-lL PCR with SARS-CoVspecific primers for amplification of a 314-bp sequence of the nucleocapsid gene (SARS-CoV forward (59-ggtgacggcaaaatgaaagagc-39), SARS-CoV reverse (59-ggagaatttcccctactg-39)). b 2 microglobulin (b 2 M) primers were used in separate reactions as RNA quantity and PCR controls (b 2 M forward (59-atgggaagccgaacatactg-39), b 2 M reverse (59-cagtctcagtgggggtgaat-39)). PCR reactions were performed for a total of 35 cycles with 50 X Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com), 0.04 lmol dNTP mixture (Stratagene), and 10X cDNA PCR reaction buffer (Clontech) or Opti-Prime 10X Buffer 4 (Stratagene) supplemented with 0.02 lmol MgCl 2 (Quality Biological) for RNA amplification of b 2 M and SARS-CoV, respectively (Table S4) . Construction of SARS-CoV cDNA plasmids for reconstructing the mouse-adapted recombinant virus rMA15. Six codon changes (10384T.A, 10793A.C, 16177C.T, 12814A.G, 22797T.C, and 26428E.K) identified in MA15 compared with the published SARS-CoV (Urbani) sequence, were inserted into cDNA clones and used to construct and rescue infectious recombinant clones of SARS-CoV (Urbani) as described previously [31] . In brief, for each mutation two overlapping amplicons were generated by PCR, joined at primerintroduced BsmBI sites, and ligated into a cDNA of icSARS-CoV using two unique restriction sites that flanked the mutation of interest. PCR reactions were performed with Expand Long Taq (Roche Applied Sciences, http://www.roche-applied-science.com) in 30 cycles of 94 8C for 30 s, 55 8C for 30 s, and extensions at 68 8C for 1 min using the following primers on plasmids encoding portions of the icSARS-CoV genome: for the mutation at nucleotide position 10384, primer pairs 59-10124 (59-CATGT CATTT GCACA GCAG) and 39-10364C (59-ATTAG GTCTC ATGGC ACAC) and 59-10384T.A (59-AGACC TAATT ATACC ATTAA AG) and 39-11091C (59-CAAGC ACAAG AATGC GTGC) were used. A second PCR amplification using primers 59-10124 and 39-11091C produced a PCR product that was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BglII, Mfe1) and ligated into the icSARS-CoV cDNA plasmid. Similarly, the 10793 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 59-10124 and 39-10770C (59-CTTTC AAAGC AGCAC ACATA TC) and 59-10793A.C (59-GAAAG CGCTG CTGCA GAATG) and 39-11091C, followed by amplification with primers 59-10124 and 39-11091C. This PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BglII and Mfe1) and ligated into the icSARS-CoV cDNA plasmid. The 12814 mutation was similarly constructed using the primer pairs 59-M13R3 and 39-SARS D mu1(À) (59-NNNCG TCTCG TTCCA GTTCT GCGTA AATTG TACCT GTACC) and 59 SARS Dmu1(þ) (59-NNNCG TCTCT GGAAC CACCT TGTAG GTTTG) and 39 D1500(À) (59-CCCTG TAGAC GACAT CAGTAC). The two resulting amplicons were joined following digestion (with BsmBI) and purification (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen). The product DNA was digested with BamHI and AclI and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA. The 16177 mutation was constructed using primers 59-16004 (59-CATCCTAATCAGGAGTATGC) and 39-16157C (59-CACCTA-C A G C C T G C A A G A C ) a n d p r i m e r s 5 9-1 6 1 7 7 C .T (59-GCTGTAGGTGTTTGTGTATTG) and 39-18044C (CTTTATAT-CAACGCTGAGGTG). Primers 59-16004 and 39-18044C were used to amplify the appropriate fragment that was purified and digested with PflMI and BbvCI, and ligated into an icSARS-CoV cDNA. The 22797 mutation was constructed using primer pairs 59 #38 (59-AGAGG AACTG CTGTA ATGTC TC) and 39 SMAS MuS(À) (59-NNNCG TCTCT ATGAT TACCA GTTGA AGTAG CATC) and 59 SMAS SMuS(þ) (59-NNNCG TCTCA TCATAA TTATA AATAT AGGTA TCTTA GACAT GG) and 39 SARS E 4592(À) (59-CTAGC ACAAA TGCCA GCTCC). The two resulting amplicons were joined following digestion (with BsmBI) and purification and ligation. The full-length product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA utilizing restriction endonuclease sites AgeI and SalI. The 26428 mutation was constructed using primer sets 59 #44 (59-TGATCCTCTGCAACCTGAGC) and 39 SMAS MuM(À) (59-NNNCGTCTCACGGTAATAGTACCGTTGTCTGC) and 59 SMAS MuM(þ) (59-NNNCGTCTCTACCGTTGAGAAGCTTAAACAACTCC) and 39 SARS X5(À) (59-NNNNNTTAATTAATTAATTTGTTCGTT-TATTTAAAACAACA). Resulting amplicons were ligated following digestion with BsmBI. The mutation-containing product was digested and inserted into an icSARS-CoV cDNA at SwaI and NdeI restriction sites. In all cases, the final plasmids and the mutations in the plaquepurified viruses were verified by RT-PCR and sequencing. Assembly of full-length cDNAs and recovery of recombinant viruses. The full-length cDNAs of wild-type SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV recombinants were produced as previously described [31] . RNA transcripts from full-length cDNAs were added to 800 ll of the Vero E6 cell suspension (8.0 3 10 6 ) in an electroporation cuvette and four electrical pulses of 450 V at 50 lF were given with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad, http://www. bio-rad.com) similar to protocols previously described [32, 33] . The presence of full-length cDNAs and transcripts was verified by separation on agarose gels and visualization by UV light. The transfected Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 75-cm 2 flask and incubated at 37 8C for 2 d. Viruses were plaque purified in Vero E6 cells. In vitro growth of recombinant viruses. SARS-CoV (Urbani), icSARS-CoV (Urbani infectious clone), rMA15 (icSARS-CoV with all six mutations found in MA15), rMA15 ORF1ab (icSARS-CoV with the four mutations found in the replicase genes of MA15 ORF 1ab), and rMA15 SM (icSARS-CoV with the two mutations found in the structural genes of MA15 S and M) viruses were propagated on Vero E6 cells in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, kanamycin (0.25 lg/ml), and gentamicin (0.05 lg/ml) at 37 8C in a humidified CO 2 incubator. Cultures of Vero E6 cells were infected in duplicate at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. Cell monolayers were washed twice with 2 mL of PBS and overlaid with complete MEM. Supernatants were collected at various times p.i. and virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells in 60 mm 2 dishes. Plaques were visualized by neutral red staining and counted at 48 h. Northern blot analysis. Cultures of Vero E6 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV viruses at an MOI of 1 and incubated for 1 h at 37 8C. At 10.5 h.p.i., intracellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer, and 0.1 lg of total mRNA was treated with glyoxal and separated on agarose gels using NorthernMax-Gly according to the manufacturer's directions (Ambion). The RNA was transferred to BrightStar-Plus membrane (Ambion) for 3.5 h and then cross-linked to the membrane by UV light. The blot was prehybridized and probed with an N gene-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probe (59-CTTGACT GCCGCCT CTGCT b T b CCCT b CT b GC b -39), where biotinylated nucleotides are designated with a subscript b. Blots were hybridized overnight, and washed with low and high stringency buffers as recommended by the manufacturer. Filters were incubated with strepavidin-AP, washed, and then incubated with chemiluminescent substrate CDP-STAR (Ambion). The blots were overlaid with film and developed. Western blot analysis. Ten hours p.i. with SARS-CoV (Urbani), MA15 (the biologically derived clone), icSARS-CoV, rMA15, rMA15 OR-F1ab, or rMA15SM cells were washed once in PBS and lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholine, 1% nonidet-p-40, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Supernatants clarified of nuclei were added to an equal volume of 5 mM EDTA/0.9% SDS, resulting in a final SDS concentration of 0.5%, and samples were heat inactivated for 30 min at 90 8C prior to transfer to Biosafety Level 2. After transfer to Biosafety Level 2, samples were again heat inactivated for 30 min at 90 8C before use. Equivalent sample volumes were loaded onto 7.5% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). For detecting SARS-CoV antigens, blots were probed with polyclonal mouse antisera directed against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRPs) that expressed the SARS-CoV ORF 3a (VRP-ORF3a), S (VRP-S), or N (VRP-N) proteins diluted 1:200 for SARS-CoV ORF 3a and 1:500 for S and N antisera. Dilutions were done in 5% blotto in PBS/0.5% Tween 20 and developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham, http://www.amershambiosciences.com). In situ hybridization. Paraffin-embedded sections, 5-mm thick, were probed with 35 S UTP-labeled riboprobes complementary to the N gene of SARS-CoV (Urbani) or the Sindbis virus genome, as a negative control, using previously described methods [34] . In brief, following treatment to prevent nonspecific probe binding, the tissues were incubated overnight with either probe at 5 3 10 4 cpm/lL in hybridization buffer at 42 8C. The slides were then washed, dehydrated, and coated with NBT emulsion (Eastman Kodak, http:// www.kodak.com), and incubated at À80 8C for 5 d prior to development. Positive signal, as determined by silver grain deposition, was evaluated by light microscopy. Statistics. Log-transformed virus titers were compared in a Mann-Whitney U test, and statistical significance was assigned to differences with p-values ,0.05. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Lungs, liver, spleen, thymus, and brain were obtained from individual mice euthanized at various time points, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and processed for histopathologic and IHC examination as described [35, 36] . Tissue sections (3 lm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by using an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique with a hyperimmune rabbit anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein antibody at a dilution of 1/1000. Figure S1 . i. Lungs and sera were collected for viral titration. Virus titers are expressed as log 10 pfu/g lung (circles) or log 10 pfu/mL serum (squares) from individual mice; bars represent the geometric mean for the group. Limits of detection for viral titers from lung and sera are 250 pfu/mL and 50 pfu/mL, respectively. Found at doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.0030005.sg002 (35 KB PDF). Figure S3 . In Situ Hybridization of SARS-CoV RNA in Lungs of BALB/c Mice BALB/c mice were infected with SAR-CoV (Urbani), rMA15 SM , rMA15 ORF1ab , rMA15, or MA15 virus. Lungs were harvested on days 2 and 4 p.i., and in situ hybridization was performed as described in Materials and Methods. No specific signal was observed with a control riboprobe at any time point, while SARS-CoV-N specific signal was readily apparent within the lungs for all five viruses at day 2 p.i. In contrast, at day 4 p.i., abundant SARS-CoV-specific in situ signal was observed in lungs of mice infected with the lethal MA15 virus or the lethal recombinant rMA15, but not in lungs of mice infected with the non-lethal sub-clones or SARS-CoV (Urbani).
