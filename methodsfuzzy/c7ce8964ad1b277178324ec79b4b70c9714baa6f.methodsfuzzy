2.1. Viruses and their propagation in specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03I was isolated in 2003 from a teal in Guangdong Province, China (Liu et al., 2005) , and it was used for the preparation and identification of mAbs, as well as for N gene cloning and expression. To investigate the reactivity of the 2 mAbs, 25 heterogeneous IBV strains, i.e., 20 field strains and 5 vaccine strains, were used as representatives of different IBV types (Liu et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2012) . The backgrounds of the 25 heterogeneous IBV strains are shown in Table 1 . All IBV strains were propagated once in 9-11-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and the presence of viral particles in the allantoic fluids of inoculated eggs was confirmed using a negative contrast electron microscope (JEM-1200, EX) and by RT-PCR, as previously described . Newcastle disease virus (NDV) La Sota vaccine strain, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) (Tong et al., 2001) and subtype H9 avian influenza virus (AIV) (Yu et al., 2008) were used for evaluating the cross-reactivity with the 2 mAbs. All these virus strains were propagated once in 9-11-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and the presence of NDV and subtype H9 AIV viral particles in the allantoic fluids of inoculated eggs was confirmed by HI using specific antibodies, respectively (Majiyagbe and Hitchner, 1977) . The ILTV was confirmed by RT-PCR as previously described (Tong et al., 2001) . Fertile white Leghorn embryonated SPF chicken eggs were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China.
