In a precedent study the UV-Vis absorption spectra of TX-100 were studied using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (PG Instrument, T80) at different times of UV/TiO 2 process, under conditions of catalyst concentration of 5 mg/L, 25 â€¢ C and natural pH of 5.4. As it is presented in Fig. 3 , the absorption band relating to different molecular parts of this substrate, at max = 195 nm and 223 nm, is decreased with respect to time. These absorbance peaks are attributed to benzene ring [34] . In this study the absorbance decrease at 223 nm was measured to follow the elimination of TX-100. Absorbance at 195 nm may be accompanied with a number of interfering absorptions. It is notable that the maximum wavelength and the molar absorption coefficient of TX-100 were not much dependent on pH of solution within the range of 4-9. Using this method, the degradation efficiency (X) was obtained at any time, according to [7] : where C o and C are initial and appropriate concentrations of TX-100 at any time. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured in order to investigate the mineralization of the substrate, using a closed reflux digester reactor (HACH, DRB 200) and the corresponding spectrophotometer (HACH, DR 2800).
