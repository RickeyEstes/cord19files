Cell culture, viruses and infections RPE-1 cells, a human telomerase immortalised retinal pigment epithelial cell line, (kindly provided by Dr Andrew McAinsh University of Warwick, UK) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM/F12, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 200 mM glutamine, 10% newborn bovine serum (NCS; Gibco) and penicillin/streptomycin. The wildtype (w/t) parental strain was HSV-1 [17] . Routine plaque assays were performed in RPE cells in the presence of pooled neutralising human serum (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2% or clinical grade purified human immunoglobulin (IVIg, Carimune NF, Nanofiltered, human immune globulin, CSL Behring) at 2 mg/ml, having demonstrated complete neutralisation of extracellular virus at this dose (>6 log reduction in virus titre). High multiplicity infections were performed at multiplicities of infection stated in the experiments and for routine experiments usually at a moi of 10. In control experiments for genome uncoating, the inoculum was treated with 500 U/ml DNase I (Roche) for 1 hr at 4˚C, or 10 mg/ml IVIg for 0.5 hr at room temperature. Inhibitors were used at the following final concentrations; acycloguanosine (ACV, Thermo Scientific, 500 μM); phosphonoacetic acid (PAA, 400 μg/ml); actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 μg/ ml); MG132 (Calbiochem, 10 μM); Leptomycin B (Sigma-Aldrich, 20 nM); nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, 2 μM). Inhibitors were added to cells for 1 hr prior to infection.
