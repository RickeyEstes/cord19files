The study of aerosolized human pathogens requires the ability to produce them experimentally at the appropriate size, store them, and sample them for residual infectious content over a predetermined time period. 13 The equipment must also simulate naturally occurring environmental conditions and the duration of exposure to accurately assess aerosol survivability. 24 Various analytical methods and air samplers have been used to characterize airborne pathogens and overcome the challenges of collecting and analyzing them. Relevant studies have been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 13, 25, 26
