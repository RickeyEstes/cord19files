Cell culture PC12 cells (CRL-1721, passages ,10; obtained from ATCC) were grown in monolayers in collagen I-coated flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% horse serum (HS, Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL, Invitrogen), under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 and 95% air at 376C. The culture medium was changed every 3 days. PC12 cells were differentiated with 20 ng/mL nerve growth factor for 48 h, which was added to the culture medium containing 1% FBS and 1% HS. Cells were ready for treatment when they reached 80% confluence.
