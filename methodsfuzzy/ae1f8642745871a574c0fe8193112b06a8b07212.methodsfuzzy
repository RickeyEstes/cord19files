Please see SI Materials and Methods for information regarding cells, viruses, and glycans used in the study, and for detailed descriptions of production of fiber knobs, glycan microarray, ELISA, flow cytometry, virus binding and infection experiments, STD-NMR, crystallization, surface plasmon resonance, MD simulations, and statistical analysis. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. The neoglycolipid-based glycan microarrays contain several saccharides provided by collaborators whom we thank as well as members of the Glycosciences Laboratory for their collaboration in the establishment of the microarray system. We gratefully acknowledge support from the Swiss Light Source staff during X-ray data collection.
