Calves from six herds were included in the study. Convenience sampling was done from farms located in southern and south-western Finland and those participating in the Beef Cattle Development Project of the HKScan slaughterhouse. Inclusion criteria were having a compact calving season in the spring and providing means and facilities for weighing the calves. All herds were free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and were not subject to any vaccination protocol. Farms had typical Finnish beef calf herds where during the winter and spring the animals were kept in uninsulated, spacious, naturally ventilated free stall barns with sloped floors and straw bedding. Cows had free lying space but on one farm lying stalls were used. Cows had ad libitum feeding on silage. Dams and calves grazed starting from mid-May and the bull was kept within the herd to breed. Dams usually calve inside the barn, but some also on the pasture depending on the time of serving. The mean cow number on the farms was 58, ranging from 39 to 78 dams. On each farm, 5-8 calves born within 2-5 days were included, resulting in 37 calves from 6 farms. The calves were either Herefords (farms A, B and C; n=19) or Charolais (farms D, E and F; n=18) breed. 57% of the calves were heifers, 30% Herefords and 27% Charolais heifers. Calves were born in March and April 2009 and farm visits were scheduled to begin when the farm had as many as possible calves born within 3-4 days. The farms were visited at approximately two week intervals by the one or two veterinarians working in the research project, resulting in visits when the calves were 3.3 ± 1.1 days, 16.4 ± 1.4 days and 30.2 ± 1.2 days old. At each visit calves were weighed (or measured with weight tape on one farm), clinically examined, and blood samples, faecal samples and deep nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. Blood samples were obtained with minimal restraint of the calves to reduce stress, and the dams had visual access to blood sampling of the calves, from behind the fence. The clinical examination included auscultation of the heart and lungs, measuring the heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature, palpation of the umbilical stalk and palpation of the stifle, hock, carpal and fetlock joints, and visual assessment of faecal consistence. Heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature were recorded as measured and other findings from clinical examination were scored as in Table 1 . Scores of 2 for umbilicus, faeces or joints were considered to represent clinical diseases. Calves with increased intensity of respiratory sounds (score 2) were defined as suffering from respiratory tract disease, if they simultaneously had respiratory rates≥40/min and body temperatures≥39.5°C. The weaning weights at approximately 200 days of age were from the production records of Faba, a national cattle breeding cooperative organisation. The body condition score of the dams was evaluated on a 1-5 scale with 0.25 intervals (1=emaciated, 2=thin, 3=average, 4=heavy, 5=fat) on the first and third visit and the parity of the dam was recorded. 2.1. Collection and analysis of the blood, faecal and deep nasotracheal swab samples Blood samples were collected by venapuncture from the jugular vein into EDTA and plain serum tubes (BD Vacutainer, New Jersey, USA). The samples were analysed for complete blood count and total protein, albumin, Fb, Hp and SAA concentration. Globulin concentration was calculated as globulins = total protein -albumin. The complete blood count analysis was performed using an automatic system (Coulter-Counter Model T850, Coulter Electronics, Luton UK), as well as the total protein and albumin measurements (KONE Pro, version 5.4, Konelab, Finland) . Fibrinogen concentration was determined with the heat precipitation method (Millar et al., 1971) . For the haptoglobin measurements, a modified haptoglobin-haemoglobin binding method was used (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982) , where o-dianisidine was substituted by tetramethylbenzidine as a chromogen (Alsemgeest et al., 1994) . SAA measurements were performed by sandwich ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions (Phase SAA assay, Tridelta Development Ltd., Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland). Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using a 27 cm long sterile, guarded swab Dryswab™ (Medical Wire Equipment Ltd., Corsham, England) (DeRosa et al., 2000) . From the deep nasopharyngeal swabs, anaerobic and aerobic bacterial culturing was performed and Ureaplasma diversum, Mycoplasma bovis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) were examined as described by Autio et al. (2007) . Faecal samples were collected from the rectum into plastic bags and analysed for salmonella, Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., parasite egg counts and Eimeria spp. oocyst count. Salmonella culture was made according to ISO 6579:2002 and virulence factors for E. coli/ETEC (F5, F41, ST1) were detected with PCR described by Wieler and Bauerfeind (2003) . Presence of rotavirus and bovine coronavirus was detected using a commercial ELISA kit (Duo Digestive Kit, Bio-X, Jemelle, Belgium). Parasite egg count and Eimeria spp. oocyst count were performed using the conventional McMaster's method. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected using Ziehl Neelsen staining and Cryptosporidium spp. positive samples were examined with a restriction length polymorphism PCR for species identification (Feng et al., 2007) . Factors related to the serum proteins (albumin and globulins) and APP (Hp, SAA and Fb) concentrations during the neonatal period of beef calves were studied using random intercepts linear models. In those models protein concentrations were included as outcome variables and farm and calves as random factors. First order autoregressive covariance structure was included in the model to account for repeated sampling of calf (at average age 3, 16 and 30 days). Sampling times (at average 3, 16 and 30 days of age) were included as a categorical fixed factor and calf age at first sampling time as a covariate fixed variable in all models. The general equation of the linear mixed models for evaluating factors related to the protein concentrations was as follows: In which Y ijk is the outcome variable, μ is the intercept, β are the sizes of the effect of independent covariate variable X 1ijk (calf age at the first sampling time) and X 2i is a three level grouping variable (sampling time: at average age of 3, 16 and 30 days). Farm j is the random effect of farm, calf k is the random effect of calf with the first order autoregressive covariance structure by sampling time for repeated measures, and ε ijk is an error term. Firstly all calf (breed, gender) and dam (dam parity as 3-level factor: 1, 2-4, ≥5 and dam BCS as a 2-level factor: < 3 and ≥3) related factors and their interactions with sampling times were included in the models. A backward elimination procedure was used to establish the optimal models. Subsequently clinical disease related variables (respiratory disease: yes/no, diarrhoea: yes/no and umbilical disease: yes/ no) and respiratory or intestinal tract pathogen variables (Pasteurella multocida: yes/no, Trueperella pyogenes: yes/no, Fusobacterium spp. yes/no, U. diversum: yes/no and rotavirus: yes/no) and their interaction with sampling times were included and a backward elimination procedure was performed. The model assumptions were verified with scatter and normality plots of the standardized residuals. A logarithmic transformation of Fb and square root transformation for SAA were used in the models. Bonferroni coefficients for multiple comparisons were used to correct P values. For studying factors related to the daily weight gains, random intercept linear models were used. In first model early growth (from first sampling at approximately 3 days to last sampling at approximately 30 days of age) was used as an outcome variable and farm as a random factor. Protein concentrations from the first and second sampling times (at 3 and 16 days of age), breed and gender, dam parity (3 level variable), and BCS scores (2 level variable) were included initially as fixed factors and a backward elimination procedure was used for producing the final model. In a second similar model the long term growth (from first sampling at approximately 3 days to weighing at weaning at an average 200 days of age) was used as an outcome variable. The protein concentrations from all sampling times (at 3, 16 and 30 days of age) were used with all the same variables as in the early growth model and a backward elimination procedure was used for the final model. Biologically important interactions were tested in both models and the model assumptions were checked by assessing visually the scatter and normality plots of standardized residuals. Bonferroni coefficients for multiple comparisons were used to correct P values. Described models were fitted using the mixed procedure with SAS/ STAT 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software.
