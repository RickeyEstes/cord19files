HIV infection and RNA isolation. The U-937 monocytes (American Type Culture Collection) and promonocytic U1 latent cells (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institute of Health, Rockville, MD, catalog no. 165) were used to perform active and latent infection model, respectively. U1 is a subclone of U937 that has been chronically infected with HIV-1, and show minimal constitutive expression of virus. The U-937 monocytes were infected with 100 ng/ml HIV-1 Ba-L (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program catalog no. 510). After 5 days of infection, RNA were isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Limburg, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
