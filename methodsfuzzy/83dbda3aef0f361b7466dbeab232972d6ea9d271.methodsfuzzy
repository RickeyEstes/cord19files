Plasmids construction. The full-length SARS-CoV N gene and the truncated mutants N1 (1-225), N2 (1-293), N3 (210-422), N4 (175-422) and N5 (353-422) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the plasmid pGEMT-N containing the full-length N gene as a template (GenBank Accession No. AY365036). The PRC products were cloned into the vector pET-GST. This vector was used for expression of GST fusion proteins. The human B23.1 gene in pBluescriptII SK plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Stephan W. Morris (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA). The B23 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and then cloned into the vectors of pET-GST and pET-His. pET-His vector was used for expression of proteins with a 6His-tag at the C-terminus. All the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Indirect immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected with 2 lg of pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-N plasmid [10] for 6 h. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with ice cold 50% methanol-50% acetone at À20°C. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with anti-N antibody [4] and anti-B23 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), followed by incubation with FITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C, respectively. The final fluorescence images were visualized under laser confocal scanning microscope (Leica Laser Technik, Germany) with appropriate filters. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins. Recombinant 6His-tagged B23 protein, GST-fused SARS-CoV N protein and deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) cells after induction with 1 mM IPTG for 6 h in LB-medium at 37°C. The bacterial cells were spun down and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole, 1 mM NaF and 1 mM PMSF) and then sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 30 min. The recombinant proteins were purified by a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of cell lysates and GST pull-down assay. To prepare HeLa cell lysates, approximate 10 7 HeLa cells were harvested, washed with PBS buffer and sonicated in cellular lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT) with 1Â protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Equal amount of either GST or GST-fused proteins bound to glutathione-sepharose beads was mixed with 6His-tagged B23 protein or HeLa cell lysates. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the beads were washed five times with PBS. Proteins bound to the beads were removed by boiling in 4Â SDS sample buffer for 10 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation. At 24 h post-transfection with plasmid pcDNA3-N [10] , HeLa cells were washed twice with PBS buffer and then lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) with 1Â protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 min at 4°C. The anti-N antibody [4] was added to the supernatants precleared by protein A-agarose beads and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen complexes were then precipitated with protein A-agarose beads at 4°C for 4 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with RIPA buffer three times. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in 4Â SDS sample buffer for 10 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then detected by Western blot analysis. In vitro phosphorylation assay. For examination of the phosphorylation of B23 by CDK2 kinase, HeLa cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-CDK2 antibody (Neomarker). The antibodyantigen complexes were collected with protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitated cell lysates were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10 mM MgCl 2 ) and then incubated with the indicated substrate along with 1 mM ATP for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were then subsequently boiled for 10 min in 4Â SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then detected by Western blot assay using anti-phospho-B23 (Thr199) antibody (Cell signaling).
