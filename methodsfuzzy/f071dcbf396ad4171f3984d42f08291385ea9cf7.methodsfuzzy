Diagnosis of ZIKV in the laboratory is usually based on the serum analysis employing viral RNA or antibody-based detection assays (Al-Qahtani et al., 2016; Haug et al., 2016) . However, molecular technique-based assays are considered more reliable due to the cross-reactivity of IgM antibodies among the candidate flaviviruses during serological analysis (Haug et al., 2016) . Consistent efforts are being made regarding the development of various detection strategies for virus detection (Figures 1  and 2) . However, there is still a need to search for and improve upon more sensitive and reliable detection methods for the challenging virus candidate ZIKV for daily diagnoses. Developed and applied methods for the detection of ZIKV are listed in Table 1 . Molecular detection of viruses is a two-step process that includes virus detection in propagated cell culture and viral genome-based detection through molecular amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-or real-time PCR-based detection methods. In propagated cells, the detection of a virus is confirmed by its cytopathic effect in cell culture, and positive results are confirmed using tissue culture with an infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) in plaque assays (Hamza et al., 2011) . During the last several years, there has been FIGURE 1 | Developments in various pathogen detection strategies. a revolution in virus detection methods using real-time PCR based assays, which can be performed rapidly and produce specific, sensitive, and reproducible results for virus detection at a very low concentration (Sanchez et al., 2007) . All of these parameters are interconnected and depend mostly on the target sequences of primers and probes and provide absolute specificity and a balance between high sensitivity, broad reactivity, and reliability of quantification. (Seifi et al., 2012) . Polymerase chain reaction-based methods have numerous advantages compared with conventional assay methods, such as rapidity, quantitative measurement, low contamination rates, and easy standardization (Sanchez et al., 2007; Seifi et al., 2012) . Although a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay is available for the detection of Micronesian ZIKV strains in Africa and Asia, it does not cover the genetic diversity and geographic distribution of ZIKV (Hayes, 2009) . Current diagnostic techniques for ZIKV infection are time-consuming and are mainly based on specific detection of antibodies or isolation of viruses from animals or mosquitoes (Digoutte et al., 1992; Hayes, 2009; Faye et al., 2013) . However, standard PCR-based techniques such as real-time PCR and quantitative real-time PCR provide a rapid, specific, and sensitive method for early detection of ZIKV (Foy et al., 2014) . Faye et al. (2013) developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of ZIKV in mosquitoes in the field with high analytical sensitivity. It was found that the assay was able to detect 37 ZIKV isolates. These findings confirmed that the use of realtime reverse transcription PCR assays could be a useful tool for the detection of ZIKV in virus pandemic areas where viruses including DENV and CHIKV also occur (Faye et al., 2013) . Calvet et al. (2016) developed a real-time quantitative PCR assay for the detection of ZIKV in pregnant women using viral metagenomics and gene sequencing analysis. The real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the developed assay was able to detect ZIKV infection in amniotic fluid; however, the same assay showed negative results for the detection of ZIKV infection in urine and serum samples. Escadafal et al. (2014) tested the efficacy of a recombinant polymerase amplification assay for the detection of yellow fever virus using a nucleic acid detection method, which confirmed positive results. Detection of DENV was also confirmed using a recombinase polymerase amplification assay, supporting the suggestion that this assay could be a useful tool for the detection of ZIKV (Wahed et al., 2015) . Due to the rapid global increase in ZIKV and concern about the rapid increase of microcephaly cases in newborns, the development of specific and sensitive point-of-care-testing methods has become a major public health priority (Sikka et al., 2016) . Because ZIKV shares a common platform of clinical manifestation with DENV and CHIKV, a specific and sensitive one-step real-time PCR assay was tested for the presence of ZIKV in 88 Dengue and Chikungunya-negative sera samples collected from the patients representing with DENV-like illness in Singapore (Balm et al., 2012) . The assay displayed specific detection of ZIKV with a low detection limit (140 copies of viral RNA), suggesting that this assay could be useful for viral detection in a variety of environmental samples (Balm et al., 2012) . Recently, Waggoner et al. (2016) developed and evaluated a multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR assay for simultaneous detection of ZIKV. The developed assay improved the detection limit of ZIKV relative to the corresponding realtime reverse transcription PCR assay, and 31 samples were found to be positive for ZIKV (Waggoner et al., 2016) . The findings of this study suggested that improved sensitivity for ZIKV detection is needed, given the low viremia detected in clinical samples and the current lack of accurate alternative diagnostics, such as serology (Lanciotti et al., 2008; Musso et al., 2015) . Additionally, the developed assay identified 17 co-infections in ZIKV-positive patients, suggesting its potential for application as a multiplex diagnostic test for viral detection. Furthermore, Kilianski et al. (2016) developed an unamplified RNA/complementary DNA (cDNA)-hybrid nanopore sequencing assay for the detection of RNA viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Ebola, and ZIKV. The developed method was able to detect Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus within 3 hours of acquisition and achieved differentiation from other viral genomes, facilitating strain-level identification. Nanopore sequencing is a novel genomics technology, which has potential applications for routine biosurveillance, clinical diagnosis, and outbreak investigation of virus infections by rapid sequencing of unamplified RNA/cDNA hybrids. Kilianski et al. (2016) sequenced unamplified poly(A)-tailed viral RNA using a rapid cDNA library preparation coupled with realtime data analysis to determine its potential application for pathogen genomic characterization. This approach for pathogen identification and characterization differs from the previously used methods on the MinION platform (Hoenen et al., 2016) . Biased techniques, such as amplicon sequencing, have proven to be effective in complex sample backgrounds in which titers of the target pathogen might be low, but such approaches limit characterization to known pathogens and require additional viral genome amplification (Wang et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016) . The great potential of the use of a RNA/cDNA hybrid approach in field studies has been confirmed in western Africa (Hoenen et al., 2016; Quick et al., 2016) . Generally, high virus titers in clinical samples are necessary for virus detection before genome sequencing, hence utilizing an RNA/cDNA hybrid approach for genomic ZIKV characterization could be a feasible strategy, especially for genomic library preparation and for reducing the time required for strain-level identification (Faria et al., 2016) . Although PCR-based molecular techniques have aided in the easy detection of a variety of viruses, there are still several limitations to these methods. It has been noted that these methods are prone to miss detections, favoring false negative results and requiring proper quality control measures. However, precautions have been taken to overcome the problem of inhibition, including sample dilution analysis, the use of a small sample size, and adaptation of the PCR assay employing chemical reagents such as Tween (Al-Soud and Radstrom, 2001; Rutjes et al., 2005; Butot et al., 2007) . Another limitation of PCR-based methods is their inability to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viruses. Although several approaches have been used to overcome this limitation, the utilization of integrated systems based on the molecular detection of viruses after cell culture infection is considered one of the most efficient methodologies (Reynolds et al., 2001; Rodriguez et al., 2009) . Additionally, integrated cell culture-PCR assays allow rapid virus detection with selective enumeration of infectious viruses, though the long incubation period required to reveal a cytopathic effect is a major limitation.
