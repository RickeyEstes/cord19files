The approach with initial univariable screening followed by multivariable analysis is fairly common when dealing with large datasets (Dohoo et al., 1997) . Due to the limited sample size, we refrained from running a final model with all remaining variables, because this would have resulted in data being divided into too many groups with few observations. Of course, one weakness with this approach is that it was not possible to control for/investigate joint effects of the variables that were significant in the respective models. Some interactions or confounding factors may also have gone undetected. Another aspect to bear in mind is that when dealing with large datasets the possibility of finding associations by chance alone increases, which means that associations between potential risk factors and type of herd are not necessarily directly or indirectly causal (Dohoo et al., 1997) . This is also an inherent feature of the case-control study design, investigating associations rather than causality. Still, we believe that associations found were reasonable and can provide valuable input in the understanding of the multi-factorial background of calf mortality in large dairy herds.
