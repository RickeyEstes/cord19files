A comparison between the number of viral copies and the number of viral reads from sequencing was performed to determine if there was a quantitative relationship between input PRRSV RNA amounts and output PRRSV sequencing reads. Of note, the total raw reads varied greatly even though the same amount of total RNA was used for library preparation (Table 3) , which was mainly due to the variation of flow cell performance, such as available pores. In order to normalize the comparison, the ratio of PRRSV reads to total reads was calculated and compared to the input viral copies and a strong positive correlation (r 2 = 0.88) was observed. This preliminary result suggests that the knowledge of the number of viral copies in a sample can predict the approximate number of raw reads that will be obtained after sequencing allowing for more successful sequencing results and the number of reads obtained from sequencing can be used to estimate the number of viral copies present in a sample.
