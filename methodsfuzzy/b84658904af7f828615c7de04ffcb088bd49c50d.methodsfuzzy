Enzyme preparation. COX (7.0-9.0 nmol heme a/mg protein) was isolated from submitochondrial particles prepared by sonication of bovine heart mitochondria (19) as described by Yonetani (20) . COX concentration was determined by using two extinction coefficients: 16.5 mM-' cm-i for reduced heme a at A As05-630 nm (21) and 164 mM-' cm-i for reduced minus oxidized heme oa3 at 442 nm (22). Horse heart cytochrome c concentration was determined at 550 nm using 20.5 mM-i (reduced minus oxidized) as the extinction coefficient (23). Protein was determined as described by Lowry et al. (24) . Preparation of phospholipid vesicles. COX was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by cholate dialysis at 4"C, using the dialysis regime of DiBiase and Prochaska (25) . L-a-Phosphatidylcholine at 40 mg/ml final concentration was dispersed in 66 mM Nat cholate and 100 mM Hepes NaOH, pH 7.2, by sonication at O°C. COX was preincubated in 3 mg TX-lOO/mg COX at 0°C for 30 min [See Wilson and Prochaska (16) for full details] prior to the addition to the phospholipid mixture. The final concentration of heme aus in the phospholipid vesicles [COV (+TX)] was 2-3 PM. Ninety-six percent of COX in the phospholipid vesicles had the cytochrome c binding domain oriented toward the extravesicular medium as determined by the method of Nicholls et al. (26) using a Gilford 2600 spectrophotometer. In addition, 91% of the enzyme was incorporated into the phospholipid vesicles as determined by an ultracentrifugation assay (16) . Difference absorbance spectra of COV (+TX) in the presence of valinomycin or gramicidin. The effects of gramicidin or valinomycin on the visible absorbance spectrum of oxidized COX in COV (+TX) were determined on an SLM DW-2c spectrophotometer in the split-beam mode in 100 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM Hepes NaOH, pH 7.2. Equivalent amounts of COV (+TX) [0.61 PM heme oas] were added to each cuvette and a baseline spectrum taken. Either gramicidin or valinomycin in methanol (20 /IM for each) was then added to the sample cuvette with an equivalent volume of methanol added to the reference cuvette. After a lo-min incubation period at 2O"C, the difference spectrum was taken and then corrected for the baseline spectrum. Respiratory control assays. All electron transfer and respiratory control assays were performed in a thermostated cell at 25'C using an oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Model 17372). COV (+TX) (20-30 pmol heme aua) were assayed for electron transfer activity in 18 mM ascorbate, 40 PM cytochrome c, and 50 mM KH,PO,/K,HPO,, pH 7.4. RCR and RCRal of COV (+TX) were determined by the sequential addition of the ionophores to the assay mixture as described previously (16) . RCR is defined as the rate of electron transfer in the absence of any gradients across the phospholipid bilayer (in the presence of 5.6 PM valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential and 5.6 /IM CCCP to collapse any pH gradient) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the absence of the uncoupling ionophores. RCR.,,, is defined as the rate of electron transfer of the phospholipid vesicles in the presence of valinomycin (5.6 PM) and CCCP (5.6 PM) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the presence of valinomycin alone. Similarly, RCR,., is the rate of electron transfer in the phospholipid vesicles in the presence of gramicidin (0.1 FM) and CCCP (5.6 PM) divided by the rate of electron transfer in the presence of gramicidin alone. All electron transfer rates in COV (+TX) were corrected for the autooxidation of cytochrome c. The RCR is expected to have a higher value (210) due to complete uncoupling of all gradients across the phospholipid bilayer, whereas RCR.1 and RCR,., will have lower values (<5) due to the presence of a membrane potential dissipating ionophore during the initial part of the assay (see Ref. (16) for complete details) Proton trandocation assays. Proton translocating activity was assayed at 25°C using a Corning Model 12 pH meter equipped with a combination electrode and a recorder as described previously (27). Electron transfer in COV (+TX) was initiated by the addition of ferrocytochrome c. Reagents. Valinomycin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. or Calbiochem. Gramicidin, horse heart cytochrome c (Type III for electron transfer assays, Type VI for proton translocation assays), CCCP, TX-100, and L-a-phosphatidylcholine (Type II-S) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Gramicidin purity was assessed by its ultraviolet absorbance spectrum and also by thin layer chromatography on Kodak silica gel plates using chloroform/methanol (85/15, v/v) as the developing solvent (28). Cholic acid (Aldrich Chemical Co.) was recrystallized from ethanol. Hepes was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. or Calbiochem.
