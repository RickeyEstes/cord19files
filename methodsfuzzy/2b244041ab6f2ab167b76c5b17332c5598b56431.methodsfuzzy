The sequences for p7 ion channel, each consisting of 63 amino acids, were retrieved from UniProtKB. It was ensured that all the selected viral strains use homo sapiens as their host ( Table 1 ). The UniProtKB entries for 12 strains of HCV GT1 are P27958, P26664, Q00269, Q9WMX2, Q03463, P26662, Q913V3, O92972, P26663, P29846, Q81754 and Q913D4; for HCV GT2 (6 strains) are P26660, Q99IB8, P26661, Q9DHD6, Q68749 and Q9QAX1; for HCV GT3 (4 strains) are Q81495, Q81258, Q81487 and Q68801; for GT4 (7 strains) are O39929, M1VKT9, A2CJ00, Q1ZZ56, A0A023JCC8, A8S500 and A8S507; for GT5 (2 strains) are O39928 and O91936; and for HCV GT6 (5 strains) are Q5I2N3, O39927, O92529, O92530 and O92532.
