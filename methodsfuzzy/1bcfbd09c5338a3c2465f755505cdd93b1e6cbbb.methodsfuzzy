The concentration of ribavirin was analysed by the Agilent-1260 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatographic column was a reverse phase column with a type of LP-C18 (250 mm Â 4.6 mm), which temperature was kept at 303 K. The wavelength of the UV detector was set to 210 nm, which was determined by continuous UV-Scanning. The mobile phase comprised two component, which were methanol and water with a flow rate of 0.8 mlÁmin À1 . The volume ratio of methanol to water was 25:75. Each analysis was carried out three times, and the average value of three measurements was regarded as the final value of the analysis. The relative standard uncertainty is estimated to be 4.5% in mole fraction solubility.
