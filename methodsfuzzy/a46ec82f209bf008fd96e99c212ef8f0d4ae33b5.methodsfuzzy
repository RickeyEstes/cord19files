Narrative history is the primary approach used in this study, but multivariate analysis is also used as a supplement. Primary data sources include various editions of the China Statistical Yearbook and the Chinese Health Sector Statistical Yearbook for 1990-2012. These are compendium of public sector data. The World Bank and the IMF are also important sources of secondary data. Multivariate analyses use ordinary least squares analysis in SPSS version 16.0 and Excel for Windows 7 to study determinants of household savings. Urban and rural data are analyzed separately consistent with Chinese statistical accouting practice. The first model includes only two independent variables: out-of-pocket health spending and health insurance payouts by insurers. The second model adds residential home and education spending. These models form the base case of the analysis. But urban and rural data are also augmented in separate models with consumption/GDP included as an independent variable. A disaggregation into two periods, 1990 to 2001 and 2002 to 2012, was also included. The general model specification is as follows: The dependent variable (Y) is the urban or rural household savings rate. Independent variables (X i ) in the base case include out-of-pocket health expenditures, health insurer payout, residential house spending, and education spending. All of these variables are standardized as a share of per capita urban disposable income or rural income. For urban households, health insurance refers to the UEBMI and the URBMI schemes. For rural households, health insurance refers to New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS). Data for savings rates are derived from household surveys. Savings is the difference between per capita disposable income and per capita consumption expressed as a proportion of per capita disposable income. Data for the independent variable of outof-pocket spending were obtained from national health expenditures accounts and measure per capita health spending as a share of disposable income. Data for payout of health insurers are used to measure these expenditures relative to per capita disposable income even though they are not part of disposable income. This helps to standardize this independent variable. Data for expenditures on residential housing and education are derived from surveys. These independent variables are constructed to measure shares of housing and education spending by households relative to disposable income. Sales prices are used for urban housing estimates, whereas building costs are used for rural areas. Table 1 shows results of time series analysis of savings rates as a function of out-of-pocket health expenditure, health insurance payout by insurers, education and housing spending at the household level. Adjusted R 2 statistics are all higher than 0.79. The Durbin-Watson statistic ranged from 1 to 1.5. For urban households, results from model 1 show a statistically significant relationship between health insurance payout and urban household saving. Coefficients indicate sensitivity of the savings rate to a 1% increase in respective independent variables. Results from model 2 show that all four variables were statistically significant, at least at the 0.1 level. Increasing out-of-pocket health spending, health insurance payout, and residential house spending were positively correlated with household saving. Education spending was negatively correlated with household saving.
