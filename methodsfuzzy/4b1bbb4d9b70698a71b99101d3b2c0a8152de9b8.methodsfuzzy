2.1. Isolation and culture of porcine alveolar macrophages, porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells and monocyte-derived macrophages Healthy crossbred conventional pigs of 3-7 weeks of age were used for the collection of venous blood samples and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). Pigs were maintained in an isolated room under experimental conditions. PAM were collected by lung lavage using cold PBS and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Fresh or 3-day in vitro cultured PAM cultures were used for staining and subsequent analyses. Porcine heparinized blood was diluted 1:2 with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged over Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (GE Healthcare, Sweden) at 1000 Â g for 40 min at room temperature. The buffy coat layer containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was isolated and washed three times with PBS at 250 Â g for 10 min at 4 8C. CD14-positive monocytes on the surface of PBMC were sorted by immunomagnetic labeling MACS system of cells using anti-CD14 mAb (clone M-M9, VMRD Inc., WA, USA) and goat anti-mouse IgG1-magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). CD14-negative cells, based on the cell morphology determined by flow cytometry analysis, were recognized as porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Purified monocytes were resuspended at 1 Â 10 5 cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 55 mmol/l of b-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics. Monocytes were then cultured in six-well plates at 37 8C in the presence of 25 ng/ml of recombinant porcine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rpGM-CSF, R&D systems) and 25 ng/ml recombinant porcine interleukin-4 (rpIL-4, Endogen). Half of the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium every 3 days. The cells were collected on the third or seventh day and used as monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMFs) were developed in a similar procedure, but cultured in the absence of the two cytokines. Cells were collected on the fifth days and used as MDMFs. A baby hamster kidney fibroblast cell line BHK-21, a monkey  kidney cell line MARC-145 and a porcine kidney epithelial cell line  PK15 were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and  antibiotics while a porcine monocytic cell line 3D4/31 (ATCC CRL-2844) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%  FBS and antibiotics at a 37 8C incubator. A mouse fibroblast NIH  3T3 cell line stably expressing hDC-SIGN was obtained through the  NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown,  MD) and was renamed as 3T3-HDCS in this study. This cell line was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
