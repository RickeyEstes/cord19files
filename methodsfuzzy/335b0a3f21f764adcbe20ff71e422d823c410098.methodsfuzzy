To accommodate the available datasets and the biological differences between both the canid hosts and the pathogens, our analyses involved several different approaches outlined below. Age effects. The viral pathogens CPV, CDV, and CAV-1 generally produce long-lasting immunity in their hosts [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , so we assumed that once a wolf, coyote, or fox was exposed to one of these pathogens they remained seropositive for life (although Mech and Goyal [unpublished] have found exceptions to this for CPV among wolves). Under this assumption, the serological status of pups, as compared to adults, offers the most precise information about whether a pathogen is circulating in a given year or region. Therefore, we examined wolf-pup and coyote-juvenile data separately from wolf adult ($1 yr) and coyote adult ($1.6 yrs) data in the analysis of CPV, CDV, and CAV-1 serological data. By contrast, CHV, a herpesvirus, produces life-long infections characterized by periods of latency where the virus is present but does not provoke a strong immune response [39] . A negative CHV test result most likely reflects an uninfected individual, although a latent infection cannot be ruled out, whereas a positive result suggests exposure, a more recent infection, or recrudescence [19, 40] . Canids acquire N. caninum infections by consuming ungulate tissue infected with the asexual stage of the parasite [41] , and a positive N. caninum test suggests an active or recent infection with the parasite [35] . Because neither CHV nor N. caninum induce consistent, long-term immunity, and because positive results suggest a recent or active infection, we evaluated age class (juvenile (wolf: 0.5-1.9 yrs; coyote: 0.5-1.5 yrs), young adult (wolf: 2-4.9 yrs; coyote: 1.6-4.9 yrs), and old adult (wolf & coyote: $5 yrs)) for both wolves and coyotes as a risk factor for recent infection in our analyses of these two pathogens. Temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns of pathogen exposure. Positive and negative test results were analyzed using a logistic, generalized, linear, mixed model with random ''pack,'' or in the case of coyotes, ''region'' effects [42, 43] . These random effects were considered important because they allowed for the nonindependence of individuals sampled from the same pack or trapping region. We developed sets of a priori candidate models including factors such as year, spatial location (wolves only; NR versus Interior), resident versus transient status (coyotes only), and age class (CHV and N. caninum analyses only), thought to potentially influence the probability of pathogen exposure ( Table 1, Table 2 ). Year effects were evaluated to test the evidence for temporal variation in exposure, location effects to determine whether NR wolves, living at higher densities, exhibited a higher risk of exposure compared to Interior wolves, and a year*location interaction to allow for the possibility that pathogens circulate at different times between the NR and Interior regions of the park. Among coyotes, we asked whether behavioral differences between residents and transients might contribute to differences in their risk of infection. Finally, as described above, we evaluated age class as a risk factor for recent infection with CHV or N. caninum. Sets of candidate models for wolves and coyotes were evaluated for each pathogen using model-selection procedures based on Akaike's Information Criterion, corrected for small samples (AIC c ) [44]. All candidate models within ,2 AIC c units from the bestsupported model (lowest AIC c value) were considered to have reasonable support, given the data and set of models [44] . Relative support for each model was evaluated based on its Akaike weight, [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] and location effects on wolf-pup survival were evaluated using a logistic, generalized, linear, mixed model with random pack effects and AIC c modelselection procedures. Not all monitored dens were visible from the air or ground, so we did not always have pup counts to match the serological results from a particular pack to directly test the relationship between seroprevalence and survival. Therefore, while the strength of inference was reduced, we used regression analyses to examine the relationship between annual wolf-pup survival and annual wolf-pup seroprevalence (n = 11 years of estimates), broken down by location (i.e., NR and Interior).
