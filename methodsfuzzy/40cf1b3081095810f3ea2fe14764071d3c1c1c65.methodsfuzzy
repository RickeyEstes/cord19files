Cells, virus, and infections. CMT93 cells (CCL-223) and C57BL/6 MEFs (SCRC-1008) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 5% and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively, before use. Primary peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 6-to-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (catalog no. 000664) as described previously (86) . Briefly, 6-to-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.2 ml 3% thioglycolate and euthanized 3 to 5 days later. The abdominal skin was carefully removed, exposing the peritoneum, which was then injected with 5 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The abdomen was massaged gently, and then the PBS containing the peritoneal macrophages was carefully withdrawn. The macrophages were centrifuged at 100 ϫ g for 4 min, and red blood cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.15 M ammonium chloride, 1 mM potassium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM EDTA disodium salt) for 2 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 100 ϫ g for 4 min, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in DMEM-5% heat-inactivated FBS, and plated in 6-well plates. WT and PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs (termed PKR WT MEFs and N-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs, respectively, throughout this paper) were obtained from Robert Silverman, Cleveland Clinic (87) , and were passaged in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS before use. PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs stably transfected with empty vector (termed C-PKR Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs throughout this paper) were obtained from Gokhan Hotamisligil, Harvard University (88) , and were passaged in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS before use. WT (SV40 MEFs) and K271R PKR mutant (K271R SV40 MEFs) MEFs were obtained from Anthony Sadler, Hudson Institute of Medical Research (54) , and were passaged in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS before use. Wild-type mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) stock was prepared, and titers were determined on mouse NIH 3T6 fibroblasts as described previously (89) . WT MAV-1 was subjected to UV inactivation by UV treatment of 200 l of virus for 10 min at 800 mJ/cm 2 . UV inactivation was confirmed by qPCR and plaque assay. For infection assays, medium was removed from cells and adsorption procedures were performed with 0.4 ml of inocula in 6-well plates with 35-mm-diameter wells (unless otherwise noted) for 1 h at 37°C at the indicated MOIs (PFU/cell). After 60 min, 2 ml of DMEM-5% FBS was added without removal of inocula; that time point was designated 0 hpi. For araC experiments, 20 g/ml araC (Sigma C1768) was added at 0 hpi and replenished every 12 to 16 h. Immunoblotting. At room temperature, cells were washed once with PBS, and Pierce radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific catalog no. 89900) with 1ϫ protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 78410) was added to the plate. The cells were allowed to lyse at room temperature for 10 min before being harvested and centrifuged at 4°C at 14,000 ϫ g for 10 min to remove debris. Equivalent amounts of protein, determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce BCA protein assay kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 23227), were subjected to acetone precipitatation by incubation with a 4ϫ volume of ice-cold acetone overnight at Ϫ20°C. Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 4°C at 13,000 ϫ g for 10 min, and the pellets were dried for 30 min at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended in a mixture of 10 l Pierce RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific catalog no. (Li-Cor Biosciences) or enhanced chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate; catalog no. 32106) and X-ray film (Dot Scientific catalog no. BDB810). Densitometric quantification was performed using .tif files and ImageJ software from NIH (92) . To attempt to demonstrate PKR ubiquitination status during MAV-1 infection, C57BL/6 MEFs were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Addgene catalog no. 11928)-tagged or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Addgene catalog no. 18712)-tagged ubiquitin plasmids 24 h before infection. We used Polyplus jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus catalog no. 114-15) with 10 g plasmid DNA and 30 l jetPRIME reagent per 10-cm-diameter plate. At 12 hpi (36 h posttransfection), we treated mock-infected and infected C57BL/6 MEFs with 10 M MG132 (Sigma M7449) for 6 h before collecting lysates at 18 hpi in HCN buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100 [Sigma T9284]), 1ϫ protease inhibitors [protease inhibitor cocktail kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 78410], 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide). The lysates were split into two aliquots, and 3 g PKR (Santa Cruz D-20 sc-708; discontinued) or 3 g isotype rabbit polyclonal antibody (Jackson Immuno catalog no. 011-000-002) was added to lysates. After rocking samples overnight at 4°C, 20 l of a protein A agarose suspension (Calbiochem/Millipore catalog no. IP02-1.5ML) was added to each sample and the samples were rocked at 4°C for 2 h. After incubation, the agarose was washed 3 times with 1 ml HCN buffer, resuspended in 40 l 2ϫ Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad catalog no. 161-0737)-5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma M6250), and boiled for 10 min. The lysate supernatants remaining after the initial PKR immunoprecipitation were then immunoprecipitated again using the same procedure but with 4 g anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO-1; Santa Cruz sc-126) or 4 g isotype mouse monoclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific catalog no. 02-6200). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting for GFP or HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin with antibodies for GFP (Roche catalog no. 11814460001) (1:3,000) or HA (Abcam catalog no. ab9110) (1:4,000). No ubiquitin signal was detected from the PKR immunoprecipitations, though the positive control, p53, showed ubiquitin signal with both epitope-tagged ubiquitins (Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Blots were also probed for PKR (PKR B-10 sc-6282) (1:200), p53 (anti-p53 sc-98) (1:200), and IRDye 800CW anti-mouse (Li-Cor 925-32212) (1:15,000) to confirm that the immunoprecipitations had been successful, and signals for both proteins were detected (Fig. S5) . Viral DNA yield analysis by qPCR. Cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS and harvested by scraping into PBS, centrifuging at 100 ϫ g for 4 min at 4°C, and resuspending in PBS. Total cellular DNA was purified using an Invitrogen PureLink DNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific catalog no. K1820-02) and quantitated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. A 10-ng volume of total cellular DNA was analyzed by qPCR using custom primers specific to MAV-1 E1A (mE1Agenomic Fwd [5= GCA CTC CAT GGC AGG ATT CT 3=] and mE1Agenomic Rev [5= GGT CGA AGC AGA CGG TTC TTC 3=]), and the results were normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which was analyzed using a GAPDH-specific primer/probe set (Thermo Fisher Scientific Mm99999915_g1; catalog no. 4331182). mRNA analysis by qPCR. Cells were harvested by scraping into media, centrifuging at 100 ϫ g for 4 min at 4°C, and washing the cell pellet three times with ice-cold PBS. RNA was purified using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit (Qiagen catalog no. 74134) and stored at Ϫ80˚C. A 125-ng volume of RNA per sample was used to make cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription (RT) kit (Applied Biosystems catalog no. 4368814), and 2 l of the cDNA was analyzed by qPCR using a primer/probe set specific to mouse PKR sequence (Thermo Fisher Mm01235643_m1; catalog no. 4331182). The results were normalized to GAPDH, which was analyzed using a GAPDH-specific primer/probe set (Thermo Fisher Scientific Mm99999915_g1; catalog no. 4331182). Arbitrary units were calculated as follows: Mean threshold cycle (C T ) PKR Ϫ mean C T GAPDH ϭ ΔC T for sample (arbitrary unit ϭ 2 ϪΔCT ). Proteasome inhibition. C57BL/6 MEFs were infected at an MOI of 10, and DMSO, 1 M MG132 (Sigma M7449), or 1 M bortezomib (Selleckchem catalog no. S1013) was added to the media after a 1 h adsorption. At 24 hpi, cells were washed once with room temperature PBS, and Pierce RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific catalog no. 89900) with 1ϫ protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 78410) was added to the plate. The cells were allowed to lyse at room temperature for 10 min before being harvested and centrifuged at 4°C at 14,000 ϫ g for 10 min to remove debris. Lysosome inhibition and DQ BSA assay. CMT93 cells were infected at an MOI of 10. After 1 h of adsorption, 10 l water, 10 mM (final concentration) NH 4 Cl (Baker Chemical Company catalog no. 0660-1), or 60 M (final concentration) chloroquine (Sigma C6628) was added to the media. At 24 hpi, at room temperature, cells were washed once with PBS, and Pierce RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific catalog no. 89900) with 1ϫ protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 78410) was added to the plate. The cells were allowed to lyse at room temperature for 10 min before being harvested and centrifuged at 4°C at 14,000 ϫ g for 10 min to remove debris. The DQ BSA assay was performed as described previously (59) . Briefly, C57BL/6 MEFs and CMT93 cells were plated at 1.5 ϫ 10 5 cells/plate and 3 ϫ 10 5 cells/plate, respectively, in MatTek glass-bottom microwell dishes (part no. P35G-1.5-14C) with 2 ml of DMEM-10% and DMEM-5% FBS, respectively. The next day, the cell medium was treated with 10 l water, 10 mM (final concentration) NH 4 Cl, or 60 M (final concentration) chloroquine (Sigma C6628). Four hours after addition of inhibitors, DQ red BSA (Invitrogen catalog no. D12051) was added to the media to reach a final concentration of 5 g/ml in 2 ml DMEM plus 10% and 5% FBS, respectively. At 24 h posttreatment, the cells were imaged on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope equipped with a mercury arc lamp; a Plan-Apochromat 60ϫ, 1.4-numerical-aperture (NA) objective; a cooled digital charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Quantix Photometrics, Tucson, AZ); and a temperature-controlled stage (set at 37°C). To image the DQ-BSA, we used an excitation filter centered at 572 nm and an emission filter centered at 635 nm. The exposure times were the same for all images. Ribosome pelleting. Ribosomes were pelleted as described previously (93) . Briefly, C57BL/6 MEFs were plated on 10-cm-diameter plates at 3 ϫ 10 5 cells per plate. The next day, the cells (ϳ90% confluent) were infected with MAV-1 at an MOI of 5. C57BL/6 MEF lysates were collected at 48 hpi by scraping the cells in ice-cold PBS containing 100 g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma C7698), pelleting, and resuspending in lysis buffer, which contained 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40, 100 g/ml cycloheximide, 20 U/ml RNasin (Promega catalog no. N2511), 10% sucrose, and 1ϫ protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail kit; Thermo Scientific catalog no. 78410). Cells were lysed by passage through a chilled 26-gauge needle five times and were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 21,000 ϫ g at 4°C. A 400-l volume of cleared lysate (optical density at 260 nm [OD 260 ] of 10) was layered onto 25% sucrose and centrifuged at 29,500 rpm in an SW41 rotor (average relative centrifugal force [rcf], 107,458) for 4 h at 4°C. After pelleting, the supernatant was removed by the use of a micropipette, and 350 l of Buffer RLT Plus (from Qiagen RNeasy minikit) (4°C) was added to the pellet for collection of the RNA. The RNA was purified immediately using an Qiagen RNeasy minikit (Qiagen catalog no. 74134) and stored at Ϫ80˚C until analysis. Polyribosome gradients. C57BL/6 MEFs were plated on 10-cm-diameter plates (2 ϫ 10 6 cells per plate). The next day, the cells were infected with MAV-1 at an MOI of 2. Following a standard protocol (94), 5 min prior to collection, cycloheximide was added at a final concentration of 100 g/ml and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C. Cells were collected at 24 hpi by scraping in ice-cold PBS containing 100 g/ml cycloheximide, pelleting, and resuspending in 500 l lysis buffer (20 mM ). Cells were lysed by passage through a chilled 26-gauge needle 10 times, vortex mixing for 30 s, and then incubating on ice for 5 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 ϫ g at 4°C. A 500-l volume of cleared lysate (OD 260 of 10) was layered onto a 10%-to-50% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (151,000 rcf) for 3 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, gradients were pumped out of the top with a Brandel BR-188 density gradient fractionation system with a continuous reading of the OD 254 . From 24 to 34 fractions (350 to 500 l) were collected. RNA was purified from selected fractions immediately using a Qiagen RNeasy minikit (Qiagen catalog no. 74134) and stored at Ϫ80˚C until analysis by RT-qPCR. Statistical analyses. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. For qPCR and densitometry analyses, the data were analyzed by individual Mann-Whitney tests. A P value of Ͻ0.5 was considered significant.
