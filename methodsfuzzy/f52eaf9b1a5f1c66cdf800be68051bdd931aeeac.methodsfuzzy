Protocols to address such patients in emergency departments or patients developing an apparent viral illness while hospitalized for other conditions should include the ability to rapidly isolate patients and run laboratory testing, which would likely mitigate spread within healthcare systems. Proper triaging of patients with acute respiratory illness is a fundamental step towards the application of a unified process to deal with such patients, as suggested by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [50, 51] . Despite such advice, not all healthcare systems in regions endemic for MERS-CoV or in non-endemic regions caring for a potentially infected traveller follow these steps. In a simulation of a 'mystery' infectious patient, 95 drills including 42 drills specifically for patients with possible MERS were conducted in 49 emergency departments in New York, USA. Hospitals were variable in the identification of potentially infectious patients and implementation of appropriate infection control measures, such as suboptimal adherence to hand hygiene, PPE use and isolation signage posting [52] . The Saudi Ministry of Health has recently introduced visual triage using a scoring system to aid in the assessment of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms in emergency departments, dialysis units and other clinical settings [53] . Also, the Saudi Ministry of Health has developed a rapid response team that visits hospitals upon the identification of any positive MERS cases to help streamline contact tracing and implementation of infection control measures [54] . A similar rapid response team was also formed following the MERS outbreak in South Korea [55] . An interesting observation of the outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection is the variability in intrahospital transmission of the virus. The South Korea and Jeddah outbreaks witnessed patients causing significant spread of secondary cases, while in other outbreaks, the index patient resulted in few secondary cases despite lack of infection control practices [1] . One reason may lie with prolonged viral shedding, observed more commonly in patients with multiple comorbidities [1] . One study found that 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR 12 days after initial positive samples [56] . A case report showed that a HCW shed MERS-COV for approximately 42 days after initial sampling for diagnosis [57] . Whether viral detection by molecular methods always equates to an infectious risk remains unclear. An additional factor likely rests in patient movements. Intra-and interhospital transmission were documented arising from patient movements within and between hospitals [4] [42, 44] . Control of patient flow within and between healthcare settings with proper infection prevention measures is necessary to decrease the chance of transmission of MERS-CoV. It is not clear how much asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients contribute to viral dissemination in the healthcare setting. Studies have found variable percentages of asymptomatic individuals from 7% to 66% [10,16,23,24,33,58]. Data from South Korea showed that none of 82 contacts of an asymptomatic carrier were positive [59] , and transmission occurred from asymptomatic individuals [11, 60, 61] . These differences do not yet provide defined answers for the variability in intrahospital transmission; however, they do highlight the need to review and refine infection control practices to help prevent the spread of infection within healthcare settings, and prevent unwitting spread, especially by asymptomatic individuals, by screening HCW contacts by PCR. What is the contribution of the persistence of the MERS-CoV virus in the environment to its spread? As an RNA virus, MERS-CoV survives surprisingly well on surfaces and in the air, especially at low temperature and low humidity [62] . Sixty minutes after aerosolization, the virus remains infectious at 63.5% at 25 C and 79% humidity, compared with only 4.7% at conditions 38 C and 24% humidity [63] . MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR and viral culture up to 18e27 days after symptom onset from most of the touchable environments in patients' rooms [64] . Bed controller devices and thermometers were PCR positive until five days after the last positive PCR result from the patient's respiratory specimen [64] . MERS-CoV was cultured in four of seven air samples from patients' rooms, a restroom and a common corridor, and from 15 (22%) of 68 surface swabs [37] . MERS-CoV RNA was detected from anterooms, medical devices, air-ventilating equipment, bed sheets, bed rails, intravenous fluid hangers and X-ray devices [65] . These data suggest that environmental cleaning needs to be meticulous, and that laboratory data may be required to prove adequate disinfection to allow discontinuation of isolation procedures. Further studies are required to assess infectious risks of the environment in the presence of molecularly detected MERS-CoV RNA. The prospect for control of MERS-CoV relies on multifaceted programmes to educate HCWs on the disease, to identify potential patients early in their course of illness, to isolate suspected and confirmed cases appropriately, and to implement proper infection control (Table II) . The best prospect for MERS prevention and control rests on basic principles of infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Balkhy argues that three pillars are necessary: policies and procedures, facility and human resources, and accountability and leadership [66, 67] . How these goals could be achieved is demonstrated, in part, in one study using a core group of nurses for an education programme consisting of an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and hands-on practice to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs [68] . Another study called for the use of the '3Is' (identifyeisolateeinform) tool in the emergency department to rapidly identify and isolate suspected cases with any emerging infectious disease [69] . Table II provides a summary of potential concern and possible interventions in infection prevention and control to halt MERS-CoV transmission with appropriate interventions. Some listed items are, by nature, parochial, including facility structure, knowledge and skills of HCWs, and patient-related issues. These can be individualized incorporating strategies that include education, feedback and tackling facility-related issues [70] . In a survey of 607 HCWs, hospital infrastructure and design, staffing shortfalls, and absence of infection control training were cited as the primary contributing factors for the spread of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare facilities [71] . In a study from Saudi Arabia of 228 trainees, half of the respondents indicated that their hospital had a clear plan while 28% did not feel that they were well prepared for MERS [72] . A targeted educational strategy increased HCWs' knowledge, skills and attitudes in private hospitals in Saudi Arabia [73] . Raising public awareness and recognition of the disease will also assist in preventing transmission [74] . MERS-CoV presents with a variety of clinical and laboratory findings [4, 13, 75] . There are notable challenges in diagnosis through laboratory and radiological methods, including the possibility of negative swab results by PCR methodology. Currently, the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection best relies on viral detection by RT-PCR [75e77]. Lower respiratory samples have been shown to yield better diagnostic results than nasal or oral swabs. In two studies, lower respiratory samples showed higher Ct values than upper respiratory samples, and MERS-CoV virus was detected later in the course of the disease [76, 78] . The World Health Organization recommends that both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected whenever possible [79] . Improved diagnostic tools are needed for early diagnosis of the disease. In conclusion, MERS-CoV, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), requires leadership insisting on formal and continued training of HCWs to be sufficiently prepared for emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Hospitals have varied in their ability to correctly identify potentially infectious patients and quickly implement appropriate infection control measures [52] . Prompt recognition, isolation and management of the suspected cases are vital factors for the prevention of MERS transmission. It has been shown that MERS-CoV nucleic acid was detected by PCR in serum, faeces and urine [80e84]. Thus, it is important to maintain proper infection control practices when caring for these patients. Repeated assessments of infection control and monitoring implementation of corrective measures leading to constant readiness will change the course of an outbreak or halt it before it starts [85] . Limiting the number of contacts and hospital visits are also important factors to decrease the spread Table II A summary of highlights of areas for concern and possible interventions to control Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infection of infection [86] . Healthcare facilities should take all the steps to learn from past experiences and build capacity for the prevention of outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and Ebola. Healthcare leadership and workers should strive to prevent future outbreaks. Failure to do so would mean that lessons learned from SARS, MERS and Ebola would be relegated to history, leaving patients, hospitals and HCWs vulnerable. Many infection control questions remain requiring further research, including a better understanding of the disease dynamics. Leading concerns include the role of asymptomatic individuals in transmission of the disease, and precise risk factors for transmission in healthcare facilities. Although data accrued have concentrated on respiratory transmission, the role of other body fluids and the built environment in transmission remains unknown. As zoonotic reservoirs for MERS-CoV may continue to produce sporadic human infections, rigorous infection control practices should prevent the virus from spreading past the hospital door.
