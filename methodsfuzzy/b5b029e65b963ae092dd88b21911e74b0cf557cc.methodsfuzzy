Five days after Depo treatment, the mice were vaginally swabbed with a calcium 432 alginate swab (Puritan, Maine) to remove vaginal mucus. The swab was wetted in sterile 433 PBS and blotted on sterile paper to get rid of excess liquid before being used. Ten to 15 434 microliters of antibiotic or PBS was delivered into the vaginal cavity using a pipette tip. 435 After 2-6 days of daily antibiotic treatment, mice were infected intravaginally with 2 x 10 3 to 436 5 x 10 3 PFU HSV-2, 10 6 PFU HSV-1 or 2. For intranasal treatment, mice were anesthetized by injecting a mixture of ketamine and 456 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

All antibiotics were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR) was used to visualize and analyze cytometry data. Cells 495 populations were analyzed as shown in the gating scheme ( Supplementary Fig. 14) . Statistics: Gene expression data was analyzed using unpaired t-tests, assuming unequal 528 standard deviation and correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak 529 correction unless otherwise specified. Graphs depicting disease scores were analyzed 530 using 2-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. Graphs 531 depicting viral titers across a time course of infection were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA 532 with no correction for multiple comparisons (Fisher's LSD) unless otherwise specified. 533 Survival curves were analyzed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

After 1 week of treatment, all mice were infected intravaginally with HSV-2. For 699 therapeutic neomycin treatment, depo-treated mice were infected with HSV-2, then treated 700 with 1mg neomycin or PBS at 4hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs and 72hrs after infection (g,h). Disease 701 score was monitored daily (a,c,e,g) and vaginal wash collected on the first three days 702 (b,d,f,h). Error bars represent SEM.

Mice treated subcutaneously with Depo-Provera were inoculated intravaginally with the indicated aminoglycoside (1mg) or PBS daily for 1 week. After 1 week of treatment, mice were infected with HSV-2. Viral titers in the vagina were measured at indicated time points (a-c). Viral titers in the dorsal root ganglion were measured 4 days post infection (d). Error bars represent SEM and signi cance was calculated using unpaired t-tests. Exact p values are reported in Table S2 . Depo-treated outbred germ-free swiss-webster mice (n=4-5) were treated with 1mg neomycin or PBS daily for 6 days and vaginal gene expression analyzed. Error bars represent SEM and statistical signi cance was determined using a one-way ANOVA with * representing p values < 0.05. Exact p values are reported in Table S2 . Mice treated subcutaneously with Depo-Provera were inoculated intravaginally with neomycin (1mg or 4.5 mgs) or PBS for 1 day (n = 3-5 mice per group). 24 hours later, vaginal gene expression was quanti ed. Depo-treated mice were innoculated intravaginally with neomycin (1mg/day) or PBS daily for 6 days. Mice were sacri ced 1,3 and 7 days after the last neomycin treatment as shown in (b) and vaginal gene expression analyzed at each time point (c). Depo-treated mice were inncoluated with 1mg neomycin daily for 6 days and vaginal and lung ISG expression analyzed in mice 1 day post neomycin treatment (d). Error bars represent SEM and signi cance was calculated using unpaired t-tests, corrected for multiple comparison. Exact p values are reported in Table S2 . Mice were treated subcutaneously with Depo-Provera and ve days after treatment were inoculated intravaginally with the indicated antibiotics (1mg/day) for 2 days (n=3 mice per group). Vaginal gene expression (a,b) and mitochondrial DNA abundance (c) was analyzed via qPCR .
