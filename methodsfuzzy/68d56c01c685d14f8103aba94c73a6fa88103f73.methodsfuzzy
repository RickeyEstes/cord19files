Cell culture HUVEC were purchased from VEC Technologies (Rensselaer, NY, USA) and maintained in MCDB-131 complete media. HUVEC cells (2-8 passages) were seeded on gelatin (1.5%) coated cultures at approximately 80% confluence. After growth for 24 h in complete media, cells underwent serum starvation for 6 h in Medium 199. Human recombinant HGF (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) and human recombinant TNF-a (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were added to the culture with fresh serum-free medium at a final concentration of 100 and 0.1 ng/ml respectively, or as otherwise indicated. In experiments with GSK3 blockade, the general apoptosis inhibitor BOC-Asp-CH 2 F (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA, USA) was added to the culture at the final concentration of 50 mM to reduce cell loss due to induction of apoptosis. 27 Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion. Human monocytes (THP-1) and RAM were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured in suspension respectively in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Ham's F12K containing 15% fetal bovine serum. For fluorescent viable labeling, THP-1 and RAM cells (1 Ã‚ 10 7 ) were incubated in their respective media containing 5 mg/ ml Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at 371C for 30 min. Excess dye was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline.
