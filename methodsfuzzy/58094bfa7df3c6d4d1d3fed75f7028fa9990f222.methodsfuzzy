The neutralization test measures the ability of the patient's antibody to neutralize infectivity and protect cells from infection, so it is considered a gold standard for the assessment of protective antibody. It is not used for routine diagnosis but is confined to specialty or public health laboratories for special indications, such as differentiating among highly related arboviruses and serotyping enteroviruses (Kuno, 2003; Malan et al., 2003) . In this method, a challenge dose of infectious virus is mixed with serial dilutions of patient serum. After a 1-hour incubation, the mixture is inoculated on to cell culture monolayers. Most often, the monolayer is overlayed with a semisolid medium to facilitate the production of virus-infected foci or plaques. After a defined incubation period the monolayers are fixed and stained, and the virus-induced plaques are counted. The endpoint is the dilution of the patient's serum that reduces plaque formation by 90%. Thus this assay is also called a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). For many years complement fixation was widely used in clinical virology. While inexpensive, it is manual, requires careful in-house standardization and quality control, and is less sensitive than current methods. It is currently confined to public health laboratories when other methods are not available. Hemagglutination inhibition was once widely used for viruses with surface proteins that agglutinate red blood cells. It is still used in public health or research laboratories to assess antibody response to specific strains of influenza viruses, especially after vaccination. IF assays can be used for the detection of IgM or IgG, and commercial kits are available for EBV and arboviruses (Malan et al., 2003) . Virus-infected cultured cells, mixed with uninfected cells, are affixed to glass microscope slides, and dilutions of patient serum are added. After an incubation period and wash step, bound antibody is detected by addition of antihuman antibody conjugated to fluorescein. IF is an excellent test when done well, but it requires a fluorescence microscope and extensive training and judgment to interpret the results. It is labor-intensive and subjective and not suited to high-volume testing. Multiplex tests detect the presence of multiple viruses in a single reaction. While greatly increasing efficiency of testing, multiplex assays can be less sensitive than single tests. Real-time PCR instruments incorporate multiple light sources and filters that allow for the simultaneous monitoring of three to five different fluorophores. This has allowed the development of multiplexed real-time assays, some of which are commercially available, such as several kits that detect influenza A and B and RSV as well as an internal control in a single test (Legoff et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2009) . To multiplex more than four targets, conventional PCR is used and the number of viral targets is limited by the resolution of the detection method. An early commercial test for six herpesviruses in CSF by Argene used conventional PCR for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, CMV and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) followed by plate hybridization, but was available in the United States as a research use only (RUO) test (Calvario et al., 2002) . The FDA-approved xTAG respiratory virus panel is the prototypical highly multiplexed assay, and it uses conventional PCR and virus-specific oligonucleotide TAGs that bind to fluorescent microspheres. The "color" of the microsphere corresponds to an individual virus, and the labeled DNA strand indicates whether an amplified product is present. Detection uses a Luminex instrument in which microfluidics and laser systems analogous to those used in flow cytometry monitor individual microspheres for the presence of amplified nucleic acid. The system is multiplexed for the detection of 12-20 respiratory virus targets in one reaction (Mahony et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008) . Highly multiplexed assays from Idaho Technologies (now BioFire) and GenMark have recently been FDAapproved for the detection of respiratory pathogens in the United States. These three highly multiplexed testing platforms differ dramatically in their extraction, amplification, and/or detection. The BioFire FilmArray system uses a self-contained pouch that combines extraction, two sequential PCR reactions (nested PCR), and detection in a single unit. Results take approximately 1 hour, but throughput is limited to one sample per instrument per hour. Like the Luminex xTag system, the GenMark respiratory virus panel requires separate extraction and endpoint PCR amplification, but this system uses their proprietary eSensor electrochemical detection method. Comparative studies are limited, but the GenMark assay demonstrates sensitivity comparable to optimized individual PCR assays, while the FilmArray was somewhat less sensitive (Loeffelholz et al., 2011; Babady et al., 2012; Pierce and Hodinka, 2012; ). The FilmArray system is able to be performed by staff with a wide array of skill levels and generates a final report in approximately 1 hour, in contrast to 8-16 hours for the Luminex and GenMark assays (Xu et al., 2013) . Nanosphere has developed a "bead microarray" technology capable of high-order multiplexing, but the available respiratory virus panel is limited to seven analytes (Alby et al., 2013) . Other highly multiplexed commercial tests for respiratory viruses use a variety of strategies for the detection and differentiation of amplified products, such as microarrays with an automated analyzer, automated endpoint melting curves, capillary electrophoresis, and other novel strategies Nolte et al., 2007; Raymond et al., 2009 ). These highly multiplexed methods have almost exclusively been developed for the detection of respiratory pathogens, but the underlying technologies can be applied to other body sites and specimens in which clinical syndromes could be caused by a variety of difficult-to-identify and/or distinguish pathogens such as gastrointestinal infections.
