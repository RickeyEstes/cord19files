The data in this paper are drawn from a qualitative study on the views of primary care staff and older people concerning the uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine in rural, urban, and semi-urban areas of South Wales. The study was carried out during 2002-03 and the main objectives were to understand why a large percentage of individuals in high risk groups failed to seek or accept vaccination and what could be done to improve immunization rates among older people. Respondents were selected from a previous agestratified random postal survey of people in the area aged over 65 who had reported on their immunization status. In light of those reports we chose to sample across a range of status groups. Eighteen people who had refused immunization, 15 who had previously accepted immunization but had since 'relapsed', 5 people who claimed that they had never been offered immunization and 16 people who had accepted the vaccine (including 5 'first timers') were eventually included in the study. The work was funded by NHS Wales Office of R&D, and ethical approval granted by the local (Bro Taf) research ethics committee. Findings relating to the original objectives were published in Evans, Prout and Prior (2007) . Data were gathered using a semi-structured interview schedule that contained a list of key topics for discussion. As well as focusing on the reasons why people might accept or reject the offer of a flu vaccine, the interview schedule contained questions asking: 'What do you think are the symptoms of colds and flu'? 'What do you think is the difference between cold and flu? 'How do you think people catch flu?' Qualitative interviews of this kind have previously been categorized as a genre of conversation (Kvale, 1996, p. 5) in which respondents tend to reply to questions in a free-flowing style. In our case, for example, that style led the research participants to talk about the causes of upper respiratory tract infections in general and not merely the causes of flu. The current paper is based on an analysis of that talk, and in that context the exercise might be seen as constituting a secondary analysis of an existing data set. For the purposes of this paper the 54 interview transcripts were initially analyzed using 'Text-mining for Clementine 12.0' (SPSS, 2007) . There are various advantages of using such automated text-mining techniques for data analysis. One offshoot is that the data set can be trawled for instances of co-occurrence between two concepts (such as flu jab and side-effects). The programme in use is capable of calculating a coefficient for all such co-occurring concepts and can display the results of such connections diagrammatically. Following the exclusion of terms with fewer than 5 citations, the programme identified some 119 concepts (flu, flu jab, side-effects, colds, etc) in our data set. The coefficients of cooccurrence between these concepts naturally varied in strength. In some cases the strength of the links was unsurprising (e.g. the cooccurrence coefficient for the link between cold and flu was unity since the two terms occurred in all interviews); in other cases the link was considerably weaker (e.g. the link between 'virus' and flu was only 0.15). Text-mining results provide a visible means of checking the veracity of interview analysis. For example, the number of instances a concept appears is given, as well as a visual representation as to how that term links to related concepts. Using the text-mining results it is also possible to identify exactly which of the 54 respondents associated the various concepts together and how they combined them. These data form the basis for the information displayed in Figs. 1 and 2. Unfortunately, text-mining software uses the document (interview) as the basis for all its calculations and so it is not immediately clear whether the interviewer or the interviewee makes the connections between concepts. In our case we have restricted ourselves to looking at explicit links made only by the respondents, and for that reason we have extracted the textmining results and re-incorporated them into semantic networks using social network software (De Nooy, Mrvar, & Batagelj, 2005) rather than the original text-mining software. Our focus is of course more on the concept networks than on social networks, and the figures provide a graphic indication of the nature and strength of the co-occurrence relationships between the basic terms and concepts in the 54 interviews. Colds and flu: a view from the clinic "Cold. A contagious viral infection of the upper respiratory tract usually caused by a strain of rhinovirus. It is characterized by rhinitis, tearing, low-grade fever and malaise and is treated symptomatically". "Influenza; a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract caused by the orthomyxovirus and transmitted by airborne droplet infection. Symptoms include sore throat, cough, fever, muscular pains and weakness . onset is usually sudden, with chills, fever, respiratory symptoms, headache, myalgia and extreme fatigue." (Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Professions, 2009 ). The view from the laboratory would suggest that colds and flu are viral infections, and indeed over 200 different virus types have been associated with the common cold. Around 30e50% of all colds are said to be caused by rhinoviruses, followed by coronaviruses (10e15% of all colds), and influenza viruses (5e15%) (Heikkinen & JÃ¤rvinen, 2003; McChlery et al., 2009 ). It is not surprising perhaps that in biomedical literature cold and flu are regarded as syndromes rather than as clear cut ontological categories, and the preferred contemporary biomedical designation is 'URTI' or upper respiratory tract infection. As is also implied above, colds and flu are diagnosed clinically, though laboratory findings are regarded as necessary for the confirmation of any diagnosis. Studies that compare the two forms of diagnosis highlight disjunction in a high proportion of cases (Call, Vollenweider, Hornung et al, 2005) . The symptom pattern for colds and flu is far from agreed upon. Sudden onset of fever and cough are regarded as good predictors of influenza being present, but in general there is a variable list of symptoms associated with the two syndromes in the medical literature. Eccles (2005) for example, lists sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, sinus pain, cough, headache, chilliness (for cold) and fever (for flu), anorexia, psychological effects and muscle aches and pains. During the recent (2010) pandemic alert the UK Department of Health information (http://www.direct.gov.uk/ swineflu) stated that, "the symptoms of swine flu are a fever or a high temperature (38 C) and two of the following symptoms: unusual tiredness, headache, runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath or cough, loss of appetite, aching muscles, diarrhoea or vomiting. The same symptoms were listed by the CDC in the USA (http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/symptoms.htm) with an added remark that diarrhoea or vomiting were more likely in children than in adults. Eccles (2005) makes no mention of either diarrhoea or vomiting, and nor do Call, Vollenweider, Hornung et al, (2005) . Diagnosis of flu, in particular, is not therefore a straightforward or clear-cut business. Clinicians, if necessary, can combine reported symptoms, information derived from clinical examination, together with laboratory and radiograph evidence, and data about current circulating strains from flu disease surveillance systems so as to arrive at a firm diagnosis. Lay people generally have access to only the first of these.
