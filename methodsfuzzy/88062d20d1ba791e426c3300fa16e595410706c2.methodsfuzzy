This study addresses planning for expanded baggage carousel capacity targeting on Incheon International Airport. The architecture consists of an ARIMA forecasting model, a discrete-event simulation (DES) model capturing the detailed operational activities at the baggage claim, and a heuristic algorithm based on a cost-benefit analysis, as shown in Fig. 3 . For application of DES, the models that can describe the operational activities at an airport infrastructure can be simulated using scientific programming languages such as C or Cþþ. However, standard simulation packages, such as ARENA and ProModel, AutoMod etc., are also available; such packages facilitate the process of building models and provide support for output analysis and optimization. To advance the author's knowledge of ARENA 14.0 (Kelton et al., 2002) , that simulation package is chosen for modeling the baggage claim process and conducting the experiment, including the forecast demand, the allocation rate, and the condition of the conveyor. We first forecasted the future arriving passenger demand and aircraft traffic volume with an ARIMA model by using historical monthly data from January 2001 to December 2012 that was obtained from Incheon International Airport. Next, the results of the forecast for the period from January 2013 through December 2015 were translated from monthly data into hourly data to use as input for simulation in the passenger flow analysis. There are three stages for translating the monthly demand data forecasted by an ARIMA model into hourly simulation input data. First, the monthly dataset is translated into four identical weekly datasets. Indeed, the demand pattern at Incheon Airport is almost identical on a weekly basis. Second, we generate daily datasets from the weekly datasets that reflect each day's relative ratio over total weekly demand (e.g., the Monday ratio ¼ 13.83% of passenger traffic as shown in Table 1 ). To generate the hourly arrival dataset for both aircraft and passengers, the arrival pattern of aircraft and passengers is generated as the relative ratio by each hourly time slot (00:00e24:00) in Table 2 . We developed the baggage carousel simulation model based on conveyor conditions and the aircraft allocation to baggage carousel rates at Incheon International Airport to capture the dynamic behavior of baggage claim. This simulation was used to measure the waiting time for picking up passengers' baggage at the baggage claim. During planning to expand baggage carousel capacity, we determined the start time, location, and quantity of expansion construction with a simulation-based heuristic search algorithm that reflected a cost-benefit analysis. In our search algorithm model, a baggage carousel is stopped for the duration of construction (3 months) after it is selected for expansion. Thus, although passenger waiting time decreases after construction, it increases at other baggage carousels during the construction period. Because of the fluctuation of demand and different aircraft allocation rates to each baggage carousel, it is important to consider the start time, location, and the quantity of expansion to answer the following key questions: 1) When is the proper period to expand a baggage carousel?; 2) Which baggage carousel should be expanded?; and 3) How many baggage carousels should we expand? 3.1. SARIMA model ARIMA and SARIMA models have been widely used in forecasting air passenger demand. The ARIMA model is acknowledged to be an accurate forecast method over the short and medium terms (Coshall, 2009; Andreoni and Postorino, 2006; Chen et al., 2009) . In this paper, we employed Incheon International Airport's historical data from January 2001 to December 2012 to generate an ARIMA model to forecast Incheon International Airport's monthly arriving passenger volume and aircraft traffic between January 2013 and December 2015. To forecast the future demand pattern using our ARIMA model, the historic time series should meet the stationary conditions. In general, if the mean and variance of the data are non-stationary, natural logarithmic transformation and differencing is used to stabilize the data. The non-seasonal and seasonal unit roots are tested to identify the stationarity using the augmented Dick-eyeFuller (ADF) test, which is the most notable and commonly used test. The unit root test is used to examine whether a time series is stationary. If the time series contains a unit root, then it is non-stationary and subsequently must be transformed into a stationary series by removing the unit root(s). This objective can normally be reached by differencing the series. In practice, most time series can become stationary series by replacing the original data with a first difference. In the case of seasonality, a time series can become stationary after taking d non-seasonal differences and D seasonal difference. Table 3 summarizes the results of the unit root test for the 1st order differenced variables. The ADF statistics for the 1st difference variables are all significant at the 5% significance level, which demonstrates that these are stationary. In general, when the time series plots of the original and 1st differenced variables appear to have seasonality, the seasonal unit root test is required to prove it scientifically. Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate the results of unit root tests for the 1st differenced variables and 1st differenced and seasonally differenced variables, respectively. Table 5 demonstrates that ADF statistics of variables after seasonal difference are significant at the 5% significance level. Both the ACF and PACF correlations are used to identify the orders of the AR and MA components for all the stationary time series. The best-fit SARIMA models are identified based on the lowest BIC and AIC test results. To confirm the adequacy of the selected models, the ACF and PACF diagnostic and the LjungeBox Q statistics verified that the residual series have 'white noise' characteristics. Table 6 presents the results of the ARIMA model's evaluation of SARIMA (0,1,3)(0,1,1) 12 for passenger arrival and SARIMA (0,1,0)(2,1,0) 12 for aircraft arrival. As a result, the two models are suitable for forecasting because they estimate proper coefficients and satisfy the hypothesis of white noise independence. The results of forecasting passenger demand patterns and aircraft traffic are shown in Fig. 4 . The MAPE test verifying forecast accuracy was 3.32% for air passengers and 6.4% for aircraft. Remarks: 1) Forecasted monthly data were translated to weekly data by dividing by 4 (1 month ¼ 4 weeks). 2) Weekly data were transformed to daily data by reflecting the weighted factor of the arrival rate of each day of the week during the peak month (August). 3) Daily data were changed to hourly data by reflecting the weight factor of the arrival rate of each hour of the day. According to Lewis (1982) , when the MAPE value is 10% for a forecasting model, its forecasting performance is considered to be acceptable.
