The methodology adopted in this research project was designed primarily to overcome a lack of prior research directly related to the research problem. Due to an apparent absence of research literature about travel agencies operating in regional settings and the consequent absence of empirically tested models, it was deemed necessary to develop propositions about the research issues. Therefore a two-stage process was adopted; first interviews with key stakeholders among travel agencies in the regional Australia were conducted in order to test the relevance of the current literature about consumer selection of travel agencies in regional settings, but also to identify other issues that may be specific to travel agencies in such settings. In the second stage, a mail-out survey using information gleaned from the first stage was conducted.
