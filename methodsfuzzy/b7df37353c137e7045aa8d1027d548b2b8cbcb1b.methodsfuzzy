Hybridoma culture media and mouse body fluids were screened for antibodies in an ELISA. Microtiter plates (Inotech) were coated (3 hr at 37" followed by overnight incubation at 4') with 0.5 pg virus in 100 ~1 0.15 NI NaCl per well. Plates were washed four times with washing fluid (0.15 M NaCI, 0.05Ob Tween 20 (v/v)). All subsequent steps were performed at 37". Fifty microliters of V-buffer (0.05 /1/1 Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCI, 1 mll/l EDTA, 0.1 Oh BSA (w/v), 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), 109/o newborn calf serum) and 50 ~1 hybridoma supernatant or dilutions of ascitic fluid in V buffer were added to each well and incubated for 2 hr. After washing four times with washing fluid, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Nordic Immunological Laboratories) was added and incubated for 1 hr, followed by four washes with washing fluid. Peroxidase binding was visualized by incubation with 300 ~1 per well of a freshly prepared solution containing 50 mn/l citric acid (pH 4.0) 2.3 mlLl H202, 40 mM 2-2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid (ABTS, Sigma). Absorption was measured at 405 nm in a multichannel photometer (Flow Laboratories).
