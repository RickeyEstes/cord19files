Experimental Procedures Viral nucleic acids SARS-CoV orfs were derived from subcloned cDNAs described by Yount et al. [16] and Thiel et al. [7] . ORFs were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plasmids pTOPO XL containing fragments A (nt 1-4436) and B (nt4344-8712), pSMART containing fragments C (8695-12070), D (12055-18924), E (18907-24051) and F (24030-29736) as well as plasmids pMal-ScoV-Mpro 5 (nsp5), pMal-ScoV-nsp8, pET-ScoV-POL 8 (nsp12), pMal-SHEL-nsp13, pET-ScoV-ExoN 3 (nsp14), pMal-ScoV-nsp15-7, pET-ScoV-MTR 12 (nsp16)and pBS-SARSCoV-S30.
