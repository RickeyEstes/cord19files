Building emergency staff members must be properly trained and tested to carry out their duties in the event of a fire or other emergency. According to Webster's College Dictionary, to train an individual is "to give the discipline and instruction, drill, practice, designed to impart proficiency or efficiency." Testing is "a set of problems, questions, for evaluating abilities, aptitudes, skills, or performance. The means by which the presence, quality, or genuineness of anything is determined." 61 Building management, the fire safety director, the alternate fire safety director, building engineers, security officers, and janitorial and parking staff should be trained in emergency procedures for all shifts they work (including weekend and holiday shifts). â™¦ The fire safety director generally determines the training necessary to prepare all emergency staff members to competently handle their duties and responsibilities. Some high-rise buildings set up monthly training for emergency staff. During these sessions, staff members review their specific duties and responsibilities, complete practical exercises, and take written tests to ensure that they are in a constant state of readiness. Training can involve exercises such as a building walkthrough and testing of the building emergency management plan using tabletop exercises and full-scale exercises (including evacuation drills).
