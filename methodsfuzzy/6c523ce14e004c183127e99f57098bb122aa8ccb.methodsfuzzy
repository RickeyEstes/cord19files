The generation of transgenic farm animals may be achieved according to species by DNA microinjection into embryo pronuclei, by using lentiviral vectors or transposons, by incubating sperm with DNA followed in vitro fertilization using ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), by transferring the foreign gene into pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells or primordial germ cells) followed by the generation of chimeric animals harbouring normal and transformed cells, by transferring the foreign gene into somatic cells used for the generation of cloned animals using nuclear transfer. These methods have been described in recent reviews [19] [20] [21] . They are summarized in Fig. 2 . Microinjection into pronuclei is very poorly efficient in ruminants and some other species. It is still being used successfully in mice, rats, rabbits, pigs and fish. In order to increase the integration frequency, foreign genes can be introduced in vectors containing natural elements favouring DNA integration such as transposons and lentiviral vectors ( [14, 18] and this issue). The latter proved highly efficient in ruminants and pigs. This technique is being adopted by experimenters even if these vectors have limited capacity to harbour foreign DNA and if the number of integration sites in the same animal is presently difficult to control. DNA transfer via sperm has been developed mainly in pigs and mice. It may simplify transgenesis in some cases. An improve protocol consist of initially degrading sperm membrane, to incubate sperm in the presence of DNA and to fertilize oocytes using ICSI ( [22] and this issue). ICSI gave a good yield of transgenic pigs [23] . The utilisation of cells as carrier for the foreign genes has been used in mice for almost 20 years. In this case, pluripotent cells capable of participating to the development of chimeric transgenic animals are being used. This method is laborious and used only for gene targeting and in practise essentially to inactivate genes (gene knock out). For unknown reasons, it has not been possible to obtain and use pluripotent cells from embryos (ES cells: embryonic stem cells) in species other than mice. A recent study has shown that, in chicken, it was possible to establish pluripotent cell lines (EG cells) from the pluripotent cells which are present in foetal gonads (PGC: primordial germ cells). This made it possible the generation of transgenic birds which are candidates to produce recombinant proteins in egg white ( [13] and this issue). The cloning technique used to generate Dolly the sheep is being used to generate transgenic ruminants and pigs. This technique allows gene addition but also gene targeting by homologous recombination. This makes it possible gene knockout. Gene targeting is also a way to integrate foreign genes in genomic sites known to favour their expression. The generation of transgenic animals remains relatively laborious and costly but it is no more a hurdle to the production of recombinant proteins.
