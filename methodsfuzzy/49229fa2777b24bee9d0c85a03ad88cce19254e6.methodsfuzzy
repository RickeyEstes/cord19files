Let us assume that we have daily statistics about S, I, and R. Let t n = t ref +n be time, where t ref is a reference time. Let DS n , DI n , and DR n be observed susceptible, infected, and removed data at time t = t n , respectively. Let S n , I n , and R n be numerical approximations of S(t n ), I(t n ), and R(t n ), respectively. In this paper, we propose a computation of β(t) and γ (t) on a daily basis, which fit best to the real data. To be more specific, for given data (DS n , DI n , DR n ) and (DS n+1 , DI n+1 , DR n+1 ), we want to find piecewise constant parameters β n+1 and γ n+1 which minimize the following where S n+1 , I n+1 , and R n+1 are the numerical solutions of Eqs. (4)-(6) with initial condition (S n , I n , R n ) = (DS n , DI n , DR n ). We divide one day between t n and t n+1 into m subintervals, then t = 1/m is the time step size. Let S n+1,1 = S n and I n+1,1 = I n , then by applying the explicit Euler's method to Eqs. (4) and (5), we have where we have used the condition R(t) = N −S(t)−I(t). Unless otherwise stated, we use t = 1/100 in all numerical tests. If the solutions of Eqs. (8)-(10) are obtained for all k, then we define S n+1 Note that while we can use higher-order numerical methods such as Runge-Kutta schemes to solve Eqs. (4) and (5), we use the explicit Euler's method for the sake of simplicity. Next, to find the best β n+1 and γ n+1 , we use a MATLAB routine called lsqcurvefit, based on the least-squares sense, which finds coefficients β n+1 and γ n+1 that solve the problem (7). We use β n+1 = 1.0e−6 and γ n+1 = 1.0e−1 as an initial guess in all numerical simulations. The MATLAB code is given in Appendix for the interested readers.
