Nasal swabs from two confirmed calicivirus infected California sea lions (Z. californianus) (one from 2004 and one from 2006), and a virus isolate from the 2004 swab that was isolated onto BSC40 Vero cells and passaged five times were used for this study. Both animals were from the same managed collection with open water access. The duration of clinical signs and severity of SMSV infections during 2006 were greater than those during 2004. Viral RNA was extracted from samples using the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Calicivirus-specific RT-PCR targeting the putative helicase and capsid precursor genes was then performed on the viral RNA using a modification of previously reported methods (Neill et al., 1995; Reid et al., 1999) . Primers incorporating additional adaptor oligonucleotides ''A'' and ''B'' designed for 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing were used (Pyro 1F 5 0 -GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGGTGAGGTGTTTGAGAATTAG-3 0 , Pyro 1R 5 0 -GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGACATCAATTCCGCCAGACCA-3 0 , Pyro Hel1 5 0 -GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGGTCCCAGTATTCGGATTTGTCTG-CC-3 0 , Pyro Hel2 5 0 -GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGAGCGGGTAGTTCAGT-CAAGTTCACC-3 0 ). The PCR targeting the capsid precursor amplified approximately 728 bp plus primers from region A and part of region B, which form the N-terminal third of the capsid precursor (Reid et al., 1999) . The PCR targeting the putative helicase amplifies approximately 307 bp plus primers. Together, these represent approximately 12.5% of the SMSV genome. RNA was reverse transcribed using the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) at 50 8C for 30 min and then denatured at 94 8C for 5 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94 8C for 30 s; annealing at 55 8C for 30 s, and extension at 72 8C for 60 s, with a final elongation step at 72 8C for 10 min. PCR products from both rounds were run in 1% agarose gels. Bands of interest were cut from the gel and extracted using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Products were quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To confirm product identity, Sanger sequencing was performed directly on aliquots using the Big-Dye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed on ABI 3130 automated DNA sequencers at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Sequencing Facilities. The 2004 oronasal swab sequences were used as reference sequences for pyrosequencing analysis. For each sample, aliquots of 2.5 Â 10 11 copies each of the capsid precursor and putative helicase gene PCR products were combined. Samples were submitted for 454 sequencing. This was performed as described in the supplementary material and methods to Margulies et al. (2005) with slight modifications from the specifications (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). The purified PCR products were hybridized to DNA capture beads and clonally amplified by emulsion PCR. DNA capture beads containing amplified DNA were deposited in individual regions of a 4-region 25 mm Â 75 mm PicoTiter plate, and DNA sequences determined with the GS-FLX instrument using the A primer. Individual DNA sequences were mapped to the SMSV reference sequences using Newbler (454 Life Sciences). The capsid precursor sequences were also manually double-checked using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) , and multiple sets of 499 sequences from each helicase data set were manually checked for consistency with Newbler results. To reduce errors, we discarded homopolymer-associated indels with a prevalence of less than 3% from mutational analysis, and any mutation without a prevalence of 1% or greater in at least one sample. We also discarded sequences containing large deletions from mutational analysis. Indels resulting in a frameshift were not counted, as even if these sequences are non-erroneous they are not likely to produce functional virus. Mutations with at least 1% prevalence of minority sequence in either the 2004 swab or the 2004 passaged culture sample that showed a 10-fold or greater difference in minority sequence prevalence with other sample were noted.
