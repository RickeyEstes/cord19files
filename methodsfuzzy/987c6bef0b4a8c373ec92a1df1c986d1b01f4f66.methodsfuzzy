The patients in this study were selected randomly without any specific bias from the paediatric infectious disease ward in Muhimbili Hospital, Dar es Salaam, which serves mainly an urban African population. Stool samples were examined for viruses from children with diarrhoea irrespective of whether bacterial pathogens were isolated. The study was performed between March 1976 and September 1976, a period which covers the cooler months of the year. Studies in Europe have suggested that stool viruses are more common in autumn and winter (Flewett, Davies, Bryden and Robertson, 1974) . A total of 123 children were investigated, of whom 26 had measles. The following information was collected from each patient: age, sex, a short feeding history and the degree of dehydration assessed clinically, using the criteria of Ironside, Tuxford and Heyworth, 1970 . Measles was diagnosed clinically by the agreement of two doctors who had considerable experience of paediatric infectious diseases in Tanzania. A sample Of faeces was collected within the first 48 hours after admission and usually within the first 24 hours. The faeces were stored at -20Â°C for between six and 12 months before being flown to Scotland by air freight. On receipt in Glasgow an extract of each stool in phosphate buffered saline was made and, after clarification at 3000 rev/min for 30 min in a bench centrifuge, was inoculated into cell cultures and prepared for electron microscopy (EM) as described by Madeley, Cosgrove, Bell and Fallon (1977) . Briefly, the extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 g for one hour, the pellet resuspended in two drops of EM diluent (0.1 per cent bacitracin) and mixed with three per cent potassium phosphotungstate pH 7.0 as a negative stain.
