Ethics statement. The study was approved by the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) Medical Ethics Committee. Standard, multilingual consent forms allowed by the Medical Ethics Committee were used and written consent was obtained from all study participants. All experiments were performed in accordance with approved guidelines and regulations. Study population and sample collection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from adults and children (aged 18 years and below) attending the primary care clinic in UMMC, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for a period of 28 months between February 2012 and May 2014. Eligible individuals were those who experienced symptoms of acute upper RTIs (URTI) for not more than two weeks at the time of study recruitment, defined as the presence of either sneezing, nasal discharge/congestion, headache, sore throat, hoarseness of voice, muscle ache and cough, as implemented in other studies on both naturally acquired and experimental colds [43] [44] [45] [46] . The estimated number of days since the development of first disease symptom (estimated days after disease onset) was recorded. Nasopharyngeal swabs were stored in universal transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, California, USA) and transported to the laboratory for immediate processing. Detection of human metapneumovirus. Total viral nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μ L of specimen using the NucliSENS easyMAG automated platform (bioMerieux, Durham, North Carolina, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. One-step multiplex PCR was performed using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) FAST Assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) according to the manufacturer's recommendation 47 . An internal positive control (Escherichia coli phage MS2) and a positive run control (bacteriophage lambda DNA) were included to monitor the assay performance. The resulting median fluorescence intensities were analysed using the Luminex 200 IS platform (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc.). Amplification and sequencing of the F and G genes. Viral RNA from HMPV-positive samples was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript III RNase H − Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The partial F open reading frame (ORF) (550 bp) and the complete G ORF (580-889 bp) of HMPV were amplified using primers as described previously 10 using BIO-X-ACT Short DNA Polymerase enzyme (Bioline Reagents Ltd, UK) under the following thermocycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55 °C for 1 minute and elongation at 72 °C for 1 minute, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 minutes. Overall, two separate sets of nested primers were used to amplify the G genes. For specimens that failed to be amplified, we used the following sets of newly designed nested primers: outer primers set F1_6206, 5′-AAAACAARAAWATGGGACAAG-3′ and R1_7176, 5′-TCAGGRAGATARACATTRACAG-3′ ; and inner primers set F2_6258, 5′ -RGCRAYWGACATGYTCAAAG-3′ and R3_7139, 5′ -GATCCATTGYYATTTRTCYC-3′ . Population sequencing was performed in both directions using an ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer with BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems). The newly-generated F and G gene sequences in this study were submitted in GenBank (accession numbers: KU254673 to KU254757 and KU320892 to KU320973). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis. Global (n = 214) and regional (n = 170) published nucleotide sequences of HMPV F and G genes were retrieved from the GenBank database and aligned with the newly-generated sequences using the PRANK algorithm available on the GUIDANCE server 48, 49 . In addition, 21 HMPV F and G sequences amplified among paediatrics diagnosed with acute lower RTIs by our laboratory were also included in the phylogenetic analysis (GenBank accession numbers: KJ196300 to KJ1963023 and KT852792 to KT852803). These samples were collected between April 2010 and December 2012 and were laboratory-confirmed as HMPV-positive by direct fluorescent-antibody staining and/or virus culture, as described previously 7 . Reference strains of HMPV genotype A and B sub-lineages comprising AF371337 HMPV NL/1/00/A1, AY297749 HMPV CA/83/97/A2a, AY530095 HMPV JP/240/03/A2b, GQ153651 HMPV CN/gz01/08/A2, AY525843 HMPV NL/1/99/B1 and GQ153651 HMPV CA/75/98/B2 were included 1,12 . Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbour joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter model with a transition-transversion ratio of 2.0 implemented in MEGA 5.05 50 . The reliability and robustness of the branching orders were analysed by bootstrap analysis of 1,000 replicates. The mean genetic distances of nucleotide and amino acid sequences within and between genotypes/sub-lineage were estimated using the Kimura two-parameter model in MEGA. HMPV transmission network. The HMPV transmission network was inferred from the newly-sequenced F and G genes based on the Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93) pairwise distance estimates 51 performed using a custom script in Python (release 3.2.6) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. A transmission cluster is characterised by the presence of at least two individuals (represented by nodes) whose viral sequences are genetically linked (represented by edges) at a given genetic distance threshold or cutoff 18, 19 . The genetic distance cutoff values can be determined between the highest and lowest values of intra-and inter-person distances (known as the patristic distances), respectively 24, 42 . However, since HMPV is associated with acute infection, measuring intra-person viral genetic distance is often challenging and impractical due to rapid viral clearance within a host. We therefore estimated the most probable cutoff values by determining the lower 0.025 percentile of the inter-person genetic distances calculated from the global F (n = 66) and G (n = 45) reference sequences representing all known genotypes and sub-lineages. Sequences from different individuals with genetic distance falling below these cutoffs were classified as transmission cluster. Clusters were described as dyads if they contain two nodes, and network if > 2 nodes 19 . The estimated date of infection (EDI) for each individual was predated from the number of days after disease symptoms onset as reported by the patients and the incubation period of 4-6 days for HMPV 28 . Difference between EDI for each individual was denoted as Δ EDI. In addition to genetic distance cutoff, adjacent nodes with a Δ EDI of less than 30 days were considered in cluster construction (viral shedding beyond 30 days following primary infection is probably uncommon, hence viral transmission may be very limited or absent). Such criterion was used for an acute infection in order to improve the analytical power of cluster determination by effectively eliminating genetically similar but epidemiologically unrelated viruses that may complicate transmission cluster interpretation. Probable direction of virus transmission within a cluster was also estimated by placing a directed edge from the putative "donor" node to the "recipient" node(s), where the EDI donor is older than the EDI recipient 18 .
