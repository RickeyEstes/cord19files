Rats. Female CDF rats (125-150 g) were purchased from Charles River Lab. (Wilmington, MA, U.S.A.). Antibodies. Immunocytochemistry was carried out with rabbit serum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dako) and the monoclonal antibodies OX6 (class II), OX18 (class I MHC), OX1 (LCA), W3/13 (T cells), W3/25 (T helper), OX8 (T cytotoxic/suppressor), OX33 (B cells) and OX42 (microglia) using a modification of the ABC Vectastain procedure (Whelan et al., 1986) . Briefly, sections were fixed in absolute methanol (-20 °C for 2 min) and incubated in succession with 2% normal goat serum (30 rain), diluted primary antibody (4°C, overnight), biotinylated horse antimouse IgG (pre-incubated for 30 rain with 2% normal rat serum to reduce background staining) (30 min) and ABC complex (1 h). The primary antibodies were diluted 1/10 except for OX18 which was diluted 1/3. Specific binding was visualized with a solution containing 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 0.001% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.01 M imidazole for 10 min. P3/X63 culture supernatant was used as a negative control. For GFAP staining, the sections were serially incubated with 2% normal goat serum, rabbit anti-cow GFAP antibody (1:10,000) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The remainder of the procedure was unchanged from the one outlined above. Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. Irradiation of tumor-free brain. The posterior half of the brains of 12 anesthetized rats was irradiated with a single dose of 1200 cGy using a GE Maximar XRay generator. This dose was biologically equivalent to the high doses of fractionated radiation used clinically in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas (Ellis, 1971; Kramer et al., 1977; Henderson et al., 1981) . Lead foil blocks shielded the anterior half of the brain, which acted as an internal control. Two unirradiated rats served as additional controls. The animals were sacrificed on days 0 (immediately after irradiation), 1, 2 and 5 and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 16. 6 /~m coronal frozen sections of the brains were obtained through the irradiated parietal lobes and the shielded frontal lobes and examined for histologic changes (hematoxylin and eosin; H& E) and demyelination (Luxol Fast Blue), and immunocytochemically. Sections from the corresponding areas of the brains of the unirradiated rats served as additional controls. Normal lymph nodes and brains from two rats that had 20,000 units of recombinant T-interferon (IFN-T) (Biogen Biologicals) injected into the parietal lobes 3 days prior to being sacrificed served as positive controls. Irradiation of tumor-bearing animals. The 9L gliosarcoma cell line was originally derived from tumors induced in CDF rats by weekly intravenous injections of N-nitrosomethylurea (Schmidek et al., 1971) . 2 x 10 4 9L cells were stereotactically implanted into the right caudate nucleus of CDF rats using a modification of the method of Kobayashi (Kobayashi et al., 1980) . On day 12 after implantation half the animals were anesthetized and the whole brain irradiated with a single dose of 1200 cGy. 1-2 irradiated and 1-2 non-irradiated rats were then sacrificed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21. Although an attempt was made to match irradiated with non-irradiated controls as closely as possible, none of the nonirradiated tumor-bearing animals survived beyond day 14 (26 days after implantation). Coronal frozen sections were obtained through the center of the tumors and assayed immunocytochemically. With each antibody, the percentages of positively staining cells/total number of all cells from six random high-powered fields within the tumor (minimum of 900 cells) were obtained and the average determined (Whelan et al., 1985) .
