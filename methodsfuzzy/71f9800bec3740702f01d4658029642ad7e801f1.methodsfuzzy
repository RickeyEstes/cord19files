Blood pressure (n = 5 SPF animals, n = 5 conventional animals). The femoral artery catheter was connected to a pressure transducer and Bridge Amplifier/Powerlab (AD Instruments) for blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In contrast to hemotology (n = 34, see below), only 5 SPF animals were used for blood pressure analysis and 20 for electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (see below), because the study was terminated after the adverse events were reported to the Institutional Animal Welfare Officer and Animal Ethics Committee. Blood pressure and ECG data were compared to the hemodynamics of conventional animals measured just prior to the SPF animal experiments. Electrocardiograph (ECG) (n = 20 SPF animals, n = 20 conventional animals). ECG leads were implanted subcutaneously in a lead II configuration (right and left forepaws and right hind paw) to measure heart rate 20 . Electrocardiograms were analysed using the LabChart Pro ECG Analysis module (AD Instruments) with rat beat detection settings and Bazett correction for QT. Arrhythmias were identified using the Lambeth convention as previously described by Canyon and Dobson 27 . Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were defined as discrete and identifiable premature QRS complexes. An episode of bigeminy was recognized as a variant of
