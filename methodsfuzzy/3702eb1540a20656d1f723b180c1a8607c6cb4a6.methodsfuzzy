Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 50 IU/ml penicillin and streptomycin in 5% CO 2 . Plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000, following the protocol of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). For siRNA transfection, Huh7 cells were seeded at~80% confluence in a 12-well plate 16 to 18 h postseeding, A 10-l volume of 10 M siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), followed by a second round of siRNA transfection after 24 h. At 24 h after the second transfection, cells were transferred into a 60-mmdiameter plate. Whole-cell extracts were prepared 48 h later, aliquots were used in Western blotting (to check silencing efficiency), and the remaining extract was stored at Ϫ80°C for future use in pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays. In experiments involving detection of viral proteins or HEV genomic RNA in siRNA-transfected cells, Huh7 cells expressing the viral RNA or plasmids were reseeded at~70% confluence and transfected with the siRNAs followed by harvesting of cells after 2 or 4 days, respectively. For virus infection studies, a g-1 HEV clinical isolate was used as described previously (34) . Briefly, ORF4-Huh7 cells were infected with a viral suspension containing 8 ϫ 10 6 genome copies.

A Web-based tool, Venny 2.1.0 (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html), was used to generate the Venn diagram for comparing the Y2H data set (this study) with the profiles of differentially expressed proteins identified in HEV-infected human, pigs, and A549 cells (24) (25) (26) . Protein purification and pulldown assay. Soluble protein fractions of E. coli BL-21pLyS expressing GST-X were bound to glutathione-agarose beads in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]). After three washes with wash buffer (binding buffer-0.1% Triton X-100) were performed, GST-X-bound beads were resuspended in thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 ) and incubated with thrombin at 4°C for 16 h.
