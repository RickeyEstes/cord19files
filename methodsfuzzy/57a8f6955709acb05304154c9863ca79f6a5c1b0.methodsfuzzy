The research that underpins this article is based on desk-based literature review as well as in-depth field interviews with individuals working in HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China. Discourse analysis was in particular employed to study the securitization of HIV/AIDS in China. Potter argued that "discourse analysis has an analytic commitment to studying discourses as texts and talks in social practice…the focus is…on language as… the medium for interaction…One theme that is particularly emphasized here is the rhetorical or augmentative organization of talk and texts" [13] . Silverman pointed out that the intellectual ancestor of discourse analysis is John Langshaw Austin, the original inventor of the idea of speech acts that later became the core element in securitization theory [14] . Concerning discourse analysis and speech acts share the Austinian concern with the rhetorical structure of talk and texts, the founding scholars of securitization theory, Buzan, Waever and Wilde explicitly stated, "the obvious method [to study securitization] is discourse analysis, since we are interested in when and how something is established by whom as a security threat" [15] . The authors also noted that the technique of employing discourse analysis to securitization studies is to "read[ing], looking for arguments that take the rhetorical and logical form defined here as security" [15] . The meaning of security is constructed when the political leaders (securitizing actors) frames an issue as an existential threat to the referent objects, 2 claiming the issue as having an absolute priority on the government agenda, thereby invoking a right to handle such an issue with extraordinary/emergency measures to ensure the survival of the referent objects [16] . In this research, public speeches (in written form) related to HIV/AIDS problems, which were delivered by the top-level political leaders, were examined. A specific rhetorical structure had to be located in their discourses, consisting of either one or all of the following elements: (1) the existence of an existential threat; and/or (2) the perceived threat is challenging the survival of the states or people in the states (referent objects), and/or which it requires to (3) be urgently dealt with by new political measures of the respective country. An array of documents ranging from official documents, reports, newspaper articles was initially identified via the search engines of Google Scholar and ProQuest with the keywords of "HIV/AIDS", "security threat", and "China". Nine key articles were consequently singled out to identify the textual discourses related to HIV/AIDS threat/ security nexus in China, published or released between 1987 and 2011 (Table 1) .
