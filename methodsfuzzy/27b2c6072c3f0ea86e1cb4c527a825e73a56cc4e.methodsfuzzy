Initial attempts to control PED involved "feedback" or controlled whole herd exposure which involved exposing the entire sow herd to infectious material (i.e. feces and gut tissues col-lected from infected piglets) in an attempt to stimulate active PEDV immunity (https://www.aasv.org/). The goal was to develop PEDV immunity in the sow, which would be transferred to her piglets through colostrum/milk. This would protect young piglets when they were most vulnerable. In general, this strategy seems to have worked well since the incidence of clinical disease has declined dramatically, but feedback has not been 100% effective (Goede and Morrison, 2016) . The apparent failure of feedback practices to consistently reduce or eliminate clinical disease has raised questions about the duration and quality of sow immunity following a controlled infection. In addition, there are questions about the difficulty of trying to expose a large group of sows to virus, the quality of the biologic material used for feedback, and how well the workers actually perform the task. Modifications to the feedback strategy have involved multiple feedback attempts to expose all sows 2-3 times over a two week period with the goal of making sure that all sows had at least one exposure to infectious virus (https://www. aasv.org/pedv/Conceptsforherdexposure121713.pdf). This practice improved conditions on some farms, but there are still field reports of farms that would have a chronic low level of clinical disease, which suggests that some of the breeding herd was not immunized through the feedback program. Or, if the sows were actually immunized (infected with wild-type virus), but their piglets were still clinically affected, (1) then the duration or magnitude of sow immunity was considered inadequate, or (2) the live virus feedback program may be too aggressive in sows near the time of farrowing that may lead to sows shedding an overwhelming dose of challenge virus in the farrowing room. These field observations further highlight a gap in knowledge of what influences lactogenic immunity in females and passive protection to PEDV in suckling piglets. Feedback may fail for similar reasons that attenuated vaccines fail: (1) if the virus dose is too low; (2) if the virus is non-infectious due to inadequate sampling/storage conditions; (3) if swine already have pre-existing immunity that blocks viral replication in the gut; or (4) if gestational stage at time of feedback influences lactogenic immunity as described earlier (Ackerman, 2016) .
