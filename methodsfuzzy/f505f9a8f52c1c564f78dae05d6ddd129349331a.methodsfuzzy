The application of several transmembrane (TM) prediction tools: DAS [18] , TMHMM [19] , TMpred [20] , SPLIT4.0 [21] and SOSUI [22] , which assume helical TM segments, have been used to detect the TM helical segments of the protein. An ideal helix of TMD of ORF8a (LLIVLTCI 10 SLCSCICTVV 20 , 8a 3-20 ) has been created using integrated protein builder of MOE (www.chemcomp.com). The helix was embedded into a lipid bilayer (POPC). Overlapping lipid molecules were removed using the MOE suite. The lipid-peptide system was then further processed using GROMACS-3.3 (www.gromacs.org). The topology and structure of the POPC bilayer was prepared as described elsewhere [23] . The lipid-peptide system was hydrated and a short minimization routine using steepest descent and conjugate gradients followed to remove unfavorable interactions. A short equilibration (500 ps) followed with the peptide restrained at the Cα atoms. At this stage the lipids were expected to surround the peptide adequately. In the production run (15 ns) all components were fully unrestrained. The program g_covar from the GROMACS-3.3 package was used to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The covariance matrix of positional variation was computed for the full 10 ns simulation length for the main-chain, based on the square fit of the Cα-atoms of TM residues 3-20. The rotational and translational motions were removed by fitting the peptide structure of each time frame to the initial structure. The derived averaged monomer structure was then used in MOE to generate tetrameric (TBMs), pentameric (PBMs) and hexameric bundle models (HBMs) [24] by creating symmetric copies of monomeric units around a central pore axis. Degrees of freedom such as the rotational angle, inter-helical distance and tilt angle (further on referred to as 'tilt') were changed systematically. To sample the whole conformational space of the bundles each of the degrees of freedom is varied stepwise (inter-helical distance 0.1 Å, rotational angle 2°and tilt 2°). For each position the side chains were linked with the backbone. Side chain conformation is chosen to be the most likely one for the given backbone position and referenced in the MOE library. A short energy minimization (15 steps of steepest decent) followed the linking. Consequently the potential energy was calculated using the Engh-Huber force field implemented in MOE. More than one hundred thousand conformations are generated and stored in a database for further analysis. Before embedding low energy models into lipid bilayers two amino acids residues of the protein were added at the N and C termini of each of the helices in each bundle model to account for the consequences of their interaction with the lipid bilayer during the simulation. Short ideal helices from Met-1 to Ile-5 and Thr-18 to Arg-22 were generated. They were aligned and superimposed with those residues from the bundle models. Those residues of the short helices which overlapped with the residues of the bundle models have been deleted and the remaining residues of the short helices conjoined with residues of the bundle models. This finally delivered bundle models of 8a . The selected bundle models were then embedded into a pre-equilibrated (70 ns) hydrated POPC bilayer [23] . GROMACS-3.3 with the Gromos96 (ffG45a3) force field was used for the simulations with an integration step size of 2 fs. The temperature of the peptide, lipid and the water molecules were individually coupled to a Berendsen thermostat with a coupling time of 0.1 ps. Isotropic pressure coupling was used with a coupling time of 1.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5e-5 bar −1 . Long range electrostatics was calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm with grid dimensions of 0.12 nm and interpolation order 4. Lennard-Jones and short-range Coulomb interactions were cut off at 1.4 and 0.8 nm, respectively. The simulation boxes contained around 26,011 atoms for A B Fig. 1 .

Calculations of the root mean square deviations (RMSD) were based on the Cα atoms. The simulations were run on a DELL Precision 490n workstation and a 28 core Opteron based compute cluster with Infiniband interconnects. All pictures were generated using xmgrace, VMD-1.8.6 and MOE-2007.09.
