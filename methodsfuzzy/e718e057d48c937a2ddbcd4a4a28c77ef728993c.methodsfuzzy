MD simulations were carried out with the AMBER10 suite of programs 28 for 12 ns using the ff99 force field. 29 During the density equilibration, the pressure relaxation time was 0.2 ps and the temperature coupling parameter was 2.0. SHAKE constraints were applied so that bonds involving hydrogen were constrained. 30, 31 During constant energy simulation, the pressure relaxation time was 2.0 ps and the temperature coupling parameter was 5.0. Throughout all simulations, the time step was set to 2 fs, and the particle mesh Ewald method was employed 32-35 accordingly with a direct sum tolerance of 0.000001. For minimization, the solvent was first minimized with the solute fixed with a 10-kcal/ mol·Å constraint, where 1010 steps of steepest descent minimization were performed followed by at most 50,000 steps of conjugate gradient or until the RMS gradient was less than 10 − 4 kcal/mol·Å. Then, the constraints on the solute were released, and 100 steps of steepest descent minimization were performed followed by at most 50,000 steps of conjugate gradient or until the RMS gradient was less than 10 − 4 kcal/mol·Å. Two model systems were studied, the first of which was directly adapted from the apo (open) crystal structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2fe8], 12 with the second system extracted from the closed complex structure of GRL0617 bound to PLPro (PDB ID: 3e9s) 15 with the GRL0617 inhibitor removed. These structures show that the thumb, finger, and palm sub-domains of PLpro are in close contact with each other. In contrast, the ubiquitin-like domain is loosely connected to the rest of the catalytic domain and is separated from the active site by 30-50 Å. Hence, we considered the ubiquitin-like domain to be less relevant to the BL2 (Gly267-Gly272) loop movement and excluded it from our study. These modified structures, with open and closed BL2 loops, were used as starting points of our MD simulations. Each of the model systems was solvated in a 10-Å octahedral waterbox of TIP3P waters 36 (total, 43,410 atoms). Adding one sodium counterion neutralized the systems. Minimization was carried out in two steps, with water molecules further than 10 Å from the protein minimized first for 50,000 steps followed by minimization of the entire system for another 5000 steps. Periodic boundary conditions were applied with a 10-Å non-bonded cutoff. The systems were first heated from 50 K to 300 K using the NVT ensemble in 50 ps. Then, the systems were density equilibrated for 2.95 ns using the NPT ensemble. The production run was performed in a microcanonical ensemble for 12 ns (NVE). NVE was used to permit obtaining information about the time dependence and equilibrium behavior of the system.
