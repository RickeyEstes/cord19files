Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), and lung epithelial (A549) cells were grown in complete DMEM (HyClone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. A vaccinia virus Tian Tan mutant strain carrying green fluorescent protein gene (VTT-EGFP) was constructed by homologous recombination as described previously (35) . VTT strain and VTT-EGFP were propagated in BHK-21 cells, and handed according to the standard biosecurity procedures in a BSL-2 (Biosafety level 2) laboratory and purified on a sucrose gradient as described previously (33) . The infectious titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. The concentrations of purified viruses were determined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 260 nm (1 OD = 1.2 × 10 10 virions) (36) .
