Fifty-two of the 64 surveys (81%), relied on self-reporting, i.e. respondents single-handedly completed a paper or online diary after receiving oral instructions (in person or via telephone) or written guidelines from investigators. A face-to-face interview was used in nine surveys 17-24 and a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) was employed in three [25] [26] [27] . Although self-reporting can be used for both retrospective and prospective designs, face-to-face interviews and the CATI only allow for a retrospective design, unless they are supplemented by some form of personal diary keeping that is used during the interview. Akakzia et al. 28 found the paper diary to provide more number of contacts compared with CATI (the median number of reported daily contacts per participant was 13Â·5 for the paper diaries and 4 for CATI) because it gives the respondent more time to recall contacts. All four household-based surveys conducted face-to-face interviews at the respondent's residence 18, 19, 22, 23 . Face-to-face interviews exhibited a greater response rate (46% 20 to 100% 19 ) compared with self-reporting and CATI. We could not identify any contact survey directly comparing self-reporting with a face-to-face interview, but different surveys were compared in one work 24 .
