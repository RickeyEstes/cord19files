To evaluate the specificity of the utilized RealAmp assay, we used several poultry disease viruses (described in methods section). As expected, the typical amplification curve was only obtained in the test using EDSV sample as template. The results showed that the RealAmp could amplify and differentiate EDSV gene within other DNA viruses ( Fig. 4a and b) . The amplified product was digested with restriction enzyme BsrGI-HF, which results in the digestion of target region out from a total amplified DNA. The target RealAmp region was cleaved by specific enzyme which is located in the EDSV fiber gene, then separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and shown in Fig. 4c .
