The bacilli M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2 155 harboring the pLuxGFP plasmid (kind gift from G. R. Stewart, London, UK) were cultivated in 7H9 medium containing ADC supplement (Difco) and 50 g/ml hygromycin. Suspensions of fresh, viable, nude mouse-derived Thai-53 strain M. leprae were obtained from the National Hansen's Disease Programs Laboratory at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (LA, USA). This isolate of leprosy bacilli is maintained in programmed serial passage in the foot pads of athymic nu/nu mice infected with 5ϫ10 7 freshly harvested M. leprae. Briefly, bacilli were harvested from the foot pads 3-4 months after infection (at mid-log growth), washed by centrifugation in Middlebrook 7H12 medium (18,000g for 5 minutes) and enumerated by direct count according to Shepard's method. The relative viability of M. leprae in a suspension was evaluated using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Molecular Probes). For the present study pure preparations of bacilli, free of mouse footpad tissue, were obtained by treating the footpad suspension with 0.1 M NaOH for 5 minutes followed by neutralization with 0.1 M HCl and three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell membranes of these pure bacilli were stained with green PKH67 dye (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, recounted by the Shepard technique, resuspended in RPMI-1640 at 1 ϫ 10 9 M. leprae per milliliter, and stored at 4°C. HeLa and DC-SIGNexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa::DC-SIGN) were cultivated in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Dutcher). For binding experiments, cells were cultivated in six-well plates (BD-Falcon) until 75% confluency and infected with the bacilli at a multiplicity of infection of 1 bacterium/cell for 4 hours at 4°C. After three washes in RPMI, cells were gently collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry for green fluorescence using a Facscalibur apparatus (Becton). Four independent experiments were conducted to assess the ability of M. leprae to bind to DC-SIGN. In two of these experiments, M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were included as controls.
