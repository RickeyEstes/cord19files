Human OGC-enriched cell culture Tissue from temporal lobe or corpus callosum was removed in fragments by ultrasonic aspiration or resected en bloc as part of surgical treatment of young adult patients suffering from intractable seizures. The isolation procedure was adapted from that reported by Kim et al. (1983) . Meninges and blood vessels were removed from the block specimens and the fragmented tissue was washed extensively to remove the blood. The tissue was enzymatically dissociated by use of 0.25% trypsin (Gibco Canada, Burlington, Ont., Canada) in Ca 2+-and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Trypsin was inactivated by addition of fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco Canada) and the tissue was further mechanically dissociated by passage through two nylon meshes (210 and 132 /~m pore size; Industrial Fabrics Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.). The obtained suspension was washed once and separated on a 30% Percoll (Pharmacia LKB, Montreal, Que., Canada) gradient in a Beckman J2-21M/E centrifuge with a fixed angle 17J rotor (15,000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min). The gradient resulted in formation of an upper layer of PBS, a layer of densely packed myelin, a clear layer of glial cell suspension and a narrow band of red blood cells at the bottom. Glial cells were recovered, diluted in PBS and washed 3 times at 1800, 1500 and 1200 rpm respectively in a Beckman IEC Centra-8R centrifuge with swinging bucket 216 rotor. Viable cell numbers, usually > 90%, were estimated under a haemocytometer by trypan blue exclusion and cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco Canada) supplemented with penicillin 2.5 U/ml, streptomycin 2.5/tg/ml, glutamine 2 mM (all from Gibco Canada) and 10% FCS and plated on 80 cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Nunclon, Gibco Canada). After 24-48 h, floating cells were removed and plated on poly-Llysine (10 /xg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) coated cell culture flasks at a density of 10 6 per ml in DMEM supplemented with 5% human AB + serum (normal human serum, NHS).
