Cell lines and viruses. Baby hamster kidney BHK-21 cells (BHK-21; ATCC, CCL-10) and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T; ATCC, CRL-11268) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin (GENVIEW) and 10 μ g/ml streptomycin sulfate (GENVIEW) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The JEV SX09S-01 strain, a genotype group I virus 45 , was used in this study, and virus titer assay was conducted in BHK-21 cells. Antibodies, reagents, and plasmids. Various commercially available antibodies were used in this study. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Flag-tag and HA-tag, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Flag-tag, Cy3 or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from ABclonal Biotech Co., Ltd (USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies were obtained from Boster Bioengineering Ltd (China). Rabbit anti-JEV NS3 polyclonal antibodies and EasyBlot anti mouse IgG (HRP) were acquired from GeneTex Inc (USA). Mouse anti-GAPDH, anti-GST and anti-His monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Proteintech Group Inc. (USA). Rabbit anti-ubiquitin (linkage-specific K48) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), NH4Cl, and proteasome inhibitor MG132 were obtained from Sigma (St. louis, MO). cDNA encoding full-length NS1, NS2A, NS4B, and NS5 from JEV 45 were cloned into mammalian expression vector pCR3.1/3Flag. cDNA-encoding full length human TRIM52 or TRIM52 mutant was cloned into pCR3.1/3Flag or pCAGGS-HA vector. For pull-down experiment, the full lengths of TRIM52 and TRIM52 RING domain truncation (TRIM52dR) were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-1. All constructs were identified through sequencing. or 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with indicated plasmids. The cells were infected with JEV at an MOI of 1 at 30 hpt. The cells and supernatants were collected at 24 hpi. The progeny virus titers were measured using plaque forming unit (PFU) assay. Confluent monolayers of BHK-21 cells were infected with 10-fold serially diluted JEV samples in 12-well plates. After 1 h of incubation, 2% methylcellulose overlay was added. The plaques were visualized 4 days (d) post-infection (p.i.) by fixing with 10% formaldehyde and staining with crystal violet. The amount of plaques were observed and statistically analyzed. All virus titers were expressed as PFU/milliliter (PFU/ml). GAPDH was used to normalize the total protein loading. ***P < 0.001.
