Tissue glycogen was measured from heart, liver and skeletal muscle using a colorimetric tissue glycogen assay kit (Sigma, Inc., Cat. #G3293) as previously described [31] . Briefly, 15-25 mg of tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen, collected in a pre-chilled 2 ml tube, 0.5 ml 1 N HCl added, then homogenized with bladed homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Power Gen 125, Cat. #14-261, setting 6, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) under a hood. The resulting homogenate (100 µl) was quickly added to 100 µl 1 N NaOH and kept on ice until heated in HCl at 95°C for 90 min, mixing every 30 min, cooled to RT and 0.4 ml 1 N Na OH was added to neutralize the sample. After the sample was centrifuged at 14,000×g for 10 min at RT, the supernatant was used for glucose analysis using a hexokinase-dependent assay kit (Sigma, Inc., Cat. #G3293) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μl (liver) or 20 μl (heart and gastrocnemius) of supernatant was put into a 96-well plate, mixed with 200 μl of reagent, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm.
