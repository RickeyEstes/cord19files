Thirty-three pet cats from the UK were studied including representatives of eight breeds. Seventeen were part of a larger cohort of cats involved in a FCoV excretion survey (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003) and 20 were also included as part of study of FLA-DRB polymorphism (Kennedy et al., 2002) . Samples from cats with FIP were naturally occurring cases submitted to University of Glasgow for diagnosis. One FIP case was a clinical case of one of the authors (DDA) at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School and his sibling was also tested. Eight cats were from a household with FIP, but whose FCoV status was not yet known. They are included because they supply data for another breed (Korat). Exon 2 of the FLA-DRB was amplified by PCR and polymorphisms detected either by clonal sequence analysis (Kennedy et al., 2002) or by reference strand mediated conformational analysis (RSCA; Arguello et al., 1998) . FCoV definitions are as follows: FIP-the cat had histopathologically confirmed and/or clinically diagnosed FIP. For the latter, the cat had to fulfil the following criteria: be seropositive for FCoV antibodies by immunofluorescent antibody test; be hyperglobulinaemic; have an albumin:globulin ratio less than 0.7 and 1-acid glycoprotein level over 1500 µg/ml (Duthie et al., 1997) ; have an effusion with total protein over 35 g/l and albumin:globulin ratio <0.7 and white blood cell count less than 2×10 9 /l comprising mainly neutrophils and macrophages; be lymphopenic (Paltrinieri et al., 2001) ; have a haematocrit less than 30% which is nonregenerative. Eight cats with FIP were included in this study. FCoV carrier-a cat which has shed FCoV continuously for 9 months or over (Addie and Jarrett, 2001) . Four carrier cats were included, one developed FIP. Transient infection-a cat which has been exposed to FCoV, has seroconverted and shed virus, subsequently ceasing to shed FCoV and becoming seronegative (Addie and Jarrett, 2001) . These cats may then be re-infected by the same or another strain of FCoV (Addie et al., 2003) . Ten transiently infected cats were included. Resistant-cats that have been exposed to FCoV infection but do not shed virus and do not develop high immunofluorescent antibody titres (although antibodies to the FCoV nucleocapsid protein can be detected by Western blotting). Three FCoV resistant cats were included in this study. These cats have been followed for over 7 years, where despite continual exposure to FCoV, they remain uninfected (Addie and Jarrett, 2001) .
