A total of 872 fecal samples were collected from pigs with diarrhea across different districts of Sichuan Province during the winter from 2011 to 2013. Most of the sampled piglets were 1 to 3 weeks old, with the reminder being 3 to 7 weeks old, 7 to 11 weeks old or over 11 weeks old. Antibiotic treatment was invalid in all sampled pigs. Samples were analyzed based on collection time and geographical location in either the east or west sections of Sichuan Province. A portion of each sample was homogenized for RNA extraction, and the remaining samples were stored at −70°C. According to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted from fecal homogenate using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Viral cDNA was synthesized from RNA using reverse Table 1 Oligonucleotide primers used for the detection of PEDV, TGEV and RVA in fecal samples obtained from pigs  with diarrhea   Target viruses a  Target genes b  Primer sequence, 5'-3 72°C for 30 s), and a final extension of 72°C for 7 min. The PCR product was resolved using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and visualized under ultraviolet light with the Bio-Rad gel imaging system (Hercules, CA, USA). All specimens were also tested for the presence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and group A rotavirus (RVA) in terms of the methods described in previous studies [19, 20] . The PCR and Nested PCR specific primers used are listed in Table 1 . PToV genomic cDNA was obtained from 19 positive samples as described above. The 702 bp fragment of the complete M gene was amplified with primers M1 (5' -ATGTTTGATACAAATTTTTGGCCTT -3') and M2 (5' -CTACTCAAACTTAACA CTTGACAACTGC -3'). PCR amplification was carried out as described above, and the PCR products were visualized using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis under ultraviolet light. The PCR products were gel-purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The purified target fragments were ligated into a linear vector pMD19-T (Takara, Dalian, China), and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen). The identity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing (Invitrogen). Genetic distance was initially measured by pairwise comparisons of nucleotide sequences to reference PToV sequences available in GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/). Multiple alignments were achieved using the Clustal_W method of the MegAlign 5.01 program (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA) [21] . The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method on Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0 [22] and carried out using the Kimura 2-parameter model [23] . The transition/transversion bias (R) and substitution rates were estimated using MEGA 5.0. The substitution pattern and rates were estimated using the Kimura 2-parameter model, with nucleotide frequencies of A = 25.00%, T/U = 25.00%, C = 25.00%, and G = 25.00% [23] . For estimating MLmaximum likelihood values, a user-specified topology was used. The maximum log likelihood for this computation was −1680.662 and −2731.225. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 702 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [24] . All analyses were based on PToV M gene sequences. The novel PToV M nucleotide sequences have been submitted to NCBI GenBank and assigned accession numbers KF727566-KF727584. Other toroviruses fulllength sequences for M gene were obtained from Gen-Bank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore).
