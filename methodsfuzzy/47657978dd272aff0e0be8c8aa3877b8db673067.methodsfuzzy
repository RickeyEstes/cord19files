The coding region of CVB3 (Nancy strain) major capsid protein VP1 was amplified by PCR from pcDNA3.1-VP1 [14] and cloned into the G-L junction of the pVSVXN 2 plasmid. Recombinant VSV containing VP1 (VSV-VP1) was recovered as previously described [22] . Six-week-old male BALB/c mice were purchased from the experimental animal center of Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and remained in pathogen-free conditions and housed at the Soochow University School of Medicine animal facilities. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Health, China, 1998) and the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Ethical Commission of Soochow University. Mice were lightly anesthetized by injecting 0.75% pentobarbital sodium into cavum abdominis (30 mg/kg) prior to all immunizations. Each group contained 6 mice. For VSV-VP1 or VSV-GFP immunization, single dose of 10 6 plaqueforming units (PFU) viruses in a 25 l volume was intranasally administered. The group of mice receiving PBS alone was used as control. For chitosan-DNA immunization, each group of mice were mildly intranasally immunized with chitosan encapsulated 50 g pcDNA3.1-VP1 (chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1) or 50 g pcDNA3.1 (chito-pcDNA3.1) for 4 times biweekly. The detection of antibody response, lymphocyte proliferation assay, CTL activity assay, measurement of dendirtic cell maturation et al. as described previously [42] . All data are given as mean Â± SD. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with the two-tailed independent Student's t-test using GraphPad Prism version 4.01 (GraphPad Software Incorporated). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Full detailed methods are provided in Supplemental materials and methods.
