Recruitment for the Vinku2 trial was carried out in Turku University Hospital from June 2007 to March 2010 (vinku means ''wheeze'' in Finnish). The inclusion criteria were age of 3 to 23 months, delivery at 36 gestational Abbreviations used HR: Hazard ratio RCT: Randomized controlled trial RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus weeks or later, first wheezing episode (based on parental report and confirmed from medical records), rhinovirus detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample by using PCR, ongoing signs of lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough, noisy breathing, or wheezing) at the time when PCR results were available, and written informed consent from a parent or guardian. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a chronic nonatopic illness, previous systemic or inhaled corticosteroid treatment, participation in another study (excluding long-term follow-up studies in childhood), varicella contact in a patient without a previous varicella illness, need for intensive care unit treatment, or poor understanding of Finnish (Fig 1) . The study was commenced only after obtaining written informed consent from a parent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Turku University Hospital. Rhinovirus species A, B, and C; enteroviruses; and RSV A and B were detected by using ''in-house'' reverse transcriptase PCR at the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory, Department of Virology, University of Turku. 22, 23 A nasal swab (nylon flocked dry swab, 520CS01; Copan, Brescia, Italy) was dipped into the nasopharyngeal aspirate and stored at 2708C. In analysis the swab was diluted in 1 mL of PBS, which was analyzed for viral load (ie, copy number). A multiplex PCR test (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used for detection of rhinovirus A and B, RSV A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), and influenza A and B virus from frozen samples. Human bocavirus-1 was analyzed by using PCR and serology, as previously described. 24 Blood eosinophil counts and serum levels of allergen-specific IgE were analyzed by using the routine diagnostic procedures of the Central Laboratory of Turku University Hospital. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements were done by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Mass). For more details, see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository. After obtaining nasopharyngeal aspirates, a sterile flocked swab (Copan) was dipped into the aspirate, placed into a new dry tube, and stored at 2708C until analysis. The nucleic acids for RT-PCR were extracted by eluting the swab in PBS and lysis buffer. After this, they were extracted with the NucliSens EasyMag automated extractor (bioM erieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was done for rhinovirus by using known concentrations of rhinovirus 14 plasmid as a positive control. The plasmid was a gift from Glyn Stanway at the University of Colchester (Essex, United Kingdom).
