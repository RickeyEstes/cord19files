The hotel sector was chosen as the sample population for this study for five reasons. Firstly, the hotel sector is one of the largest sectors of the South Korean tourism and hospitality industry in terms of capital investment and tourist expenditure ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Secondly, hotels provide the largest number of jobs, generate the greatest multiplier effect outside the industry and are major foreign currency earners ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Thirdly, in order to bid for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of FIFA's requirements of the host country to have compliance with under FIFA's stipulation was secure accommodation for the FIFA's family and delegation ( Lee, 2000 ; WCOIA, 1995 ) . Fourthly, it has been claimed that the hotel sector is the most affected by events due to the direct impact of event related visitor arrivals and the resulting demand for short-term accommodation ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ; McKay and Plumb, 2001 ) . Finally, little research has been specifically undertaken on the perspectives of the hotel sector on the hosting of mega-events ( Shultis et al., 1996; Byeon and Hall, 2003; Byeon, 2008 ) . The data for the pre-/post-event impacts study were obtained through a questionnaire using closed question techniques. The questionnaire was first draughted in English and then translated into Korean by the researcher, who is Korean. The questionnaire was designed to identify the Korean hotel industry's perspective on the positive and negative aspects of the Football World Cup 2002 on their individual hotel. A five-point Likert scale ranging from ' strongly disagree ' (1) to ' strongly agree ' (5) was used to rate 24 impact variables of the 2002 Football World Cup for the pre-event impacts study. However, when present results, percentage of ' strongly agree ' and ' agree ' were combined as ' agree ' and ' strongly disagree ' and ' disagree ' were joined as ' disagree ' . Settle (1995, 2004) noted that scales are used to obtain responses which will be comparable to one another and may be regarded as both efficient and practical. Twenty-four impact variables were generated from a combination of several sources of information including Ritchie's (1984) article concerning the analysis of the impact of hallmark events, Hall's (1992) hallmark tourist events book and a review of the Seoul Olympics by Jeong (1987 Jeong ( , 1992 . Table 5 .1 presents 24 pre-event impact study's variables. To make a comparison between the two points in time, including total 24 impact variables of the pre-event impacts study and adding 3 more impact variables which derived from limitation of pre-event impacts study were used to rate. Thus, a total of 27 impact variables were used in the postevent impacts study (see Table 5 .2 ). The pre-event impacts survey was administered to the entire hotel industry (as of 19 April 2000) in South Korea. Korean hotels are divided into five classes and they are divided by facilities. The quality of the hotel is symbolised by a Rose of Sharon and exhibited by a bronze shield in the lobby. They are deluxe 1st class ( ϭ super deluxe, 5 Rose of Sharon), deluxe 2nd class ( ϭ deluxe, 5 Rose of Sharon), first class (4 Rose of Sharon), second class (3 Rose of Sharon), third class (2 Rose of Sharon) ( KNTO, 2000 ) . Since the hotel classes are divided by facilities, Chi-Square test conducted to see there is any relationship between the hotel class and hotel room numbers ' variables. The results revealed a significant relationship between the two variables in both the pre-and post-event studies. Even though the entire population was sampled both in the pre-/post-event studies, the two points in time results are predominantly those of first class hotels because factors other than equal Note : Scale indicates 1 ϭ strongly disagree, 2 ϭ disagree, 3 ϭ neutral, 4 ϭ agree, 5 ϭ strongly agree, R ϭ rank, F ϭ frequency, % ϭ per cent.
