Liu, B., Li, N.L., Shen, Y., Bao, X., Fabrizio, T., Elbahesh, H., Webby, R.J., and Li, K. (2016)  For proteomic experiments, 1 3 10 6 HFFF-TERTs were seeded in a 25-cm 2 flask. Cells were infected at MOI 5. All time course experiments (WCL1-3) were performed in biological triplicate. Where indicated cells were incubated with cytosine arabinoside (AraC) at 40 mg/ml from the time of infection. For the experiment comparing wt infection with the derivative lacking the C6L, and wt infection in the presence or absence of MG132 ('wt_C6L_MG'), where appropriate, after 2 h, inocula were removed and replaced with fresh medium with or without 10 mM MG132. This experiment was conducted in biological triplicate for wt(-MG132), wt(+MG132) and DC6L, and in single replicates for mock infection ± MG132 to fit the 11-plex limit of TMT experiments (Table S7B) . For immunoblots, 1 3 10 6 HFFF-TERTs were plated in 6-well plates. Cells were infected or mock infected at MOI 5. After 2 h, inocula were removed and replaced with fresh medium with or without 10 mM MG132. For virus replication assays, 2 3 10 6 parental or HDAC5 À/À HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Cells were infected at MOI 0.001 with A5GFP VACV. After 2 d, both the supernatant and infected cells were collected for titration on BS-C-1 cells. Thus, in Figure  7G , virus yield is shown without distinction between intracellular and extracellular virions. VP26GFP HSV-1 infections were as above, except supernatants were collected at 3 d p.i. for titration on U2OS. Similar virus infection assays were performed on parental and HDAC5 À/À HeLa cells. To measure GFP positive foci, infected monolayers of parental or HDAC5 À/À HeLa cells were infected for 2 d with VACV or 3 d with HSV-1 and then imaged at 50X magnification using a ZEISS Axio Vert.A1 fluorescent microscope and the AxioVision 4.8 software.
