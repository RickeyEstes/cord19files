Human Sera. Sera from patients with Golgi autoantibodies were obtained from serum banks at the University of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta), The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA), and Immuno Concepts Inc. (Sacramento, CA). The serum samples were stored at -20 or -70~ The specificity of the autoantibodies for Golgi antigens was first identified on the basis of indirect immunofinorescence (IIF) microscopy (4) . Control sera were randomly selected from a bank of 2,000 female Red Cross blood donors (37) or sera pooled from healthy volunteers. Cell Lines. HeLa (ATCC CCL 2.2; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD); MOLT-4 (human T cell lymphobhstic leukemia; ATCC CRL 1582); HEp-2 (human epidermoid carcinoma ceils), and HepG2 (human hepatic carcinoma, ATCC HB 8065) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM t-glutamine, and 5/~g/ml gentamycin sulfate. Indirect Immunafluorescence. IIF was performed on cells grown on teflon-masked slides or commercially prepared HEp-2 cell substrates (Immuno Concepts Inc.) using a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (light and heavy chain) as previously described (38, 39) . Double-hbeling and colocalization studies used TRITCconjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Slides were viewed with a microscope fitted with epifinorescence (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) or a confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with a krypton-argon light source (MRC600; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Immunoelectron Micmscolv. Human HEp-2 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS in Lux Permanox dishes (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). After 2 d in culture, monolayer cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed 30 min at room tempera-1 Abbreviations used in thispaper: BFA, brefeldin A; COP, coatomer protein; lie indirect immunofluorescence. ture (RT) with 4% electron microscopy-grade formaldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) buffered with PBS, rinsed with PBS,  and then permeabilized with 100% acetone for 1 min at -20~  After a rinse in PBS, cells were blocked for 30 min at RT with  I% BSA/PBS, incubated 1 h at 37~ with the serum SY diluted  1:200 in 1% BSA/PBS, rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS, blocked  30 min with 1% BSA/PBS, and then incubated I h at 37~ with affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG coupled to peroxidase (Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA) diluted 1/100 in 1% BSA/PBS. Cells were then rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS, fixed 30 min at RT with 1% glutaraldehyde buffered with PBS, rinsed in PBS, rinsed in 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.6), and then incubated 5 min at RT in 1 mg/ml diaminobenzamine/0.03% HzOz dissolved in Tris buffer and distilled water, and then stained for 30 min with 2% OsO4 in distilled water, rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated with ethanol, and then embedded in Polybed 812 (Polysciences). Embedded whole cells were photographed in the light microscope, thin sectioned as monolayers, and then examined unstained in the electron microscope. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting. Proteins or cellular preparations were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (40) . The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described by Towbin and Gordon (41) and adapted in our laboratory (42) . After transfer, nitrocellulose strips were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), and then overlaid with the primary antibody and washed with PBST to remove any unbound antibody. Bound antibody was traced with polyvalent, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Ig (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA) or 12sI-protein A (2-4 x 10 s cpm/ml (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA). Bound antibodies were visualized by incubating the washed nitrocellulose strips in substrate solution or by exposing the air-dried nitrocellulose to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). eDNA Library Screening. Clones from a HepG2 XZap cDNA library were initially screened by an immunological method as modified by Young and Davis (43) . All screening was performed on duplicate filters and positive bacteriophages were subsequently purified to 100%. Before screening the cDNA library, the sera were extensively adsorbed against bacteria and wild-type )~_ap phage to reduce background binding. Bound antibodies were detected by immunoblotting as described above. DNA Subcloning and Sequence Determination. Purified )~7_ap clones were subcloned in vivo into pBluescript plasmids using R408 helper phage as recommended in the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the dye primer cycle sequencing kit and DNA sequencer (373A; Applied Biosystems, Inc., [ABI], Foster City, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (380B; ABI). DNA sequences were determined in both strands and compiled using the alignment program SeqEd (ABI). PCR. PCR was used to determine the size and orientation of cDNA inserts using methods essentially as described in the GeneAmp DNA Amplification Reagent Kit (Perkin Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). 50-or 100-/~1 reaction volumes were used and were composed of PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCI, 1.0 mM MgC12, 0.01% gelatin), dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP to a final concentration of 0.2/~M. Sample DNA was added and solutions were heated to 95~ for 5 min, followed by addition of 2.5 U amplitaq (rTaq DNA polymerase; Perkin Elmer Corp.), and one drop of paraffin oil DNA amplification was performed using a microcycler (Eppendorf Inc., Freemont, CA) with up to 35 cycles of 94~ for 30 s; 55~ for 30 s; 72~ for 90 s; and a final 7-rain elongation step at 72~ Typically, 10-40% of the reaction volumes were separated on 1% agarose gds and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize PCR products. DNA samples for PCR were obtained from phage suspensions or bacterial colonies (44) . A~inity Purification ofAutoantibodies. Affanity purification of antibody from kZap dones used confluent plates that were induced to produce recombinant protein with isopropyl-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG; Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ)-impregnated nitrocdlulose filters. After incubating the plates overnight, the filters were blocked and probed with primary antibody and washed as described above for immunoblotting. Bound antibody was ehted from the filters with 3 ml ofelution buffer (50 mM KHzPO,, pH 2.5, 150 mM NaC1, 1.0% BSA) by rocking at room temperature for 5 min. The filter was quickly rinsed with an additional 1-ml dution buffer and the eluates were collected and neutralized with 225 ~1 1 M "Iris, pH 8.8. The eluted antibodies were concentrated with a microconcentrator (Centricon 100; Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) and used for IIF and immunoblotting analysis. In Vitro RNA Transcription and Translation. Appropriate clones identified in the screening outlined above were used for in vitro transcription and translation experiments. 1/zg of linearized plasmid DNA was used as template for in vitro transcription with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase. RNA transcripts were analyzed in 0.8% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. 1 ~g of the transcribed RNA was added in a 50-/A translation reaction containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate, [3SS]methioniue (Trans-~SS label, 70% methionine, 15% cysteiue; ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA), and RNase block II (Stratagene Inc.) as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). Translation was carried out at 30~ for I h followed by SDS-PAGE of a 2-5-/zl aliquot to confirm the presence of translation products. Samples were stored at -80~ until required. lmmunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of ~sS-labeled in vitro translation products was performed using protein A-Sepharose beads (45) . Briefly, 10 #1 of human serum and 2-5 ~1 of in vitro translation product were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads 1-2 h at 4~ After incubation, the Sepharose beads were washed five times with buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-FAGE.and autoradiography as described above. Recombinant Protein Production. Plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coil strain XL-1BIue (Stratageue Inc.). The recombinant protein was prepared from 200-ml cultures of the recombinant ceils grown to OD~ = 0.6 at 37~ and induced with IIrI'G added to a final concentration of 10 raM. After overnight incubation, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The recombinant protein was enriched by the method of Adams et al. (46) . The final pellet of iuclusion bodies was extracted with 1 M urea in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.3) on ice for 1 min to remove residual bacterial proteins. The inclusion bodies were then pelleted in an Eppendorf microfuge at 13,000 rpm and extracted with 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tr/s buffer for 15 min on ice. In some experiments, the SYll inclusion granules were extracted with Tris buffer containing 8 M urea, 0.2% 3-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants from the extractions were stored at -70~ Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Rabbit Immunization. Three New Zealand white rabbits were separately immunized by subcutaneous and intramuscular injection of 1.5 mg of extracted recombinant proteins in an equal volume of CFA. 2 wk later, the animals were boosted with 2.0 mg of the protein in IFA. The appearance and titer of Golgi antibodies was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence using goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L chain) antibody (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., LaJoUa, CA) as described above. BFA. HEp-2 cells growing under standard conditions on teflonmasked microscope slides (Cell-Line Associates Inc., Newfield, NJ) were incubated in 7.5 pM BFA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Slides were removed from the BFA media after 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, washed in ice-cold PBS, then fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 rain. In cultures growing in paraUd, the BFA media was replenished with fresh media without BFA and slides were removed for methanol fixation 90 rain later. Changes to the structure and distribution of the Golgi complex antigens were followed by indirect immunoperoxidase staining (47) using the prototype serum SY, rabbit antibodies to the recombinant SY2, SY10, and SYll proteins, and affnity-pufifed antibodies as described above. Computer Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequences. Nucleic acid and protein sequences were analyzed by the University of Wisconsin Genetics Group Sequence Analysis Software Package (48) . Alignment of protein sequences was achieved with the GAP program that used a published algorithm (49) . Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the CLUSTAL programs (50).
