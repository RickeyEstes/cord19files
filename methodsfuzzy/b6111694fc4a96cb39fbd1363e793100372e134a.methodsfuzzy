Pharyngeal culture is the benchmark test to discover the aetiology of the infection. Its main disadvantage is the time it takes to obtain results. However, it is very probable that aetiology due to anaerobic infections has been underestimated to date, since strict anaerobic culture conditions are required to identify them, which few microbiology laboratories possess. Rapid antigen detection tests for GABHS (Strep A) were developed in the eighties in samples taken with swabs. These techniques presented the advantage that the result was available during the consultation. They are based on extracting the carbohydrate antigen from the GABHS from the microorganisms obtained from pharyngeal exudates. They are easy to apply in the surgery; the sample should be taken using a tongue depressor, keeping the tongue immobilised, taking the sample from the tonsil and posterior pharynx area, and from any inflamed or ulcerated area. It is essential to avoid the swab being rubbed by the uvula, oral mucosa, lips or tongue, before and after taking the sample. 30 The swab samples are deposited in cuvettes to which a reagent is added which contains anti-streptococcal antibodies. Validity depends on the sample collection technique (false-negative results can be given when little material has been obtained), on the area from which it is collected (there is a better yield when collected from the tonsils and/or the wall posterior to the pharynx), on the culture procedure and conditions, on the probability of streptococcal infection (some authors have found a spectrum bias, so that the sensitivity of Strep A increases the higher the Centor criteria number presented by a patient), the presence of other germs in the pharynx (false-positive results can be given if the pharynx presents major growth of Staphylococcus aureus), on the use of tests which are past their expiry date, and on commercial brand. Another aspect to be considered is that Strep A positivity does not distinguish acute carrier state infection, neither does the culture. The percentage of asymptomatic carriers can be up to 20%, but its prevalence in adults does not reach 5%. 31 It has been observed that doctors who use rapid antigen detection tests prescribe fewer antibiotics for AP than those who do not use them. 32 However, although the negative predictive value is very high, a recent clinical study showed that Spanish doctors prescribed antibiotics for little more than 30% of cases with negative Strep A. 30 This could be due to the custom of systematically prescribing antibiotics for patients presenting with at least 2 Centor criteria. The rapid antigen detection tests used for the aetiological diagnosis of AP are specific for GABHS and do not rule out other aetiologies, such as those caused by S. dysgalactiae and S. anginosus, which have similar clinical manifestations. These tests offer the advantage of diagnosing streptococcal AP in a few minutes, with an associated specificity greater than 95% when used in patients with 2 or more Centor criteria. 11 Nevertheless, not only are these tests of no use in ruling out causes other than GABHS, but it was observed in a recent study that they do not prevent the onset of complications when their results are false-negative. 33 For these reasons, it is necessary to continue to research new, more reliable, rapid diagnostic tests in order to help the primary care physician in making a clearer decision as to whether or not to treat an AP with antibiotics. 34
