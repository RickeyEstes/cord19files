for Cytotoxicity The MTT assay method is a way to evaluate the hazard assessment of nanoparticles, in which the activation metabolism in a mitochondrium in a cell is measured and the influence of nanoparticles on the prolification of the cell is qualitified. The MTT is a kind of tetrazolium, whose molecular formula is C 18 H 16 BrN 5 S. Taken into a cell, it is decomposed by a dehydrogenase enzyme in a mitochondrium into a pigment called "hormazan." The measurement of the fluorescence intensity of the pigment shows the prolification of the cell [42e44].
