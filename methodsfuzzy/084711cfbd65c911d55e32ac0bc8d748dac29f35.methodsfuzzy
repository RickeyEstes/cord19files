The starting 3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole [25] , 5-bromothiazolidine-2,4-dione [26] , and (2,4-dioxothiazolidine-5-ylidene)-acetyl chloride [27] were obtained according to the Table 1 Anticancer screening data at the concentration of 10 mM. methods described previously. Preparation of compounds 4ae4d and 4f was described in our previous report [29] .  Primary antiviral assay was performed on a respiratory viruses panel (Flu A (H1N1), Flu A (H3N2), Flu A (H5N1), Flu B, SARS CoV) [43] . Compounds were diluted to 20 mg/ml in DMSO then eight half-log dilutions were prepared in MEM solution with 50 mg/ml gentamicin. Each dilution was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate with 80e100% confluent cells, and three wells of each dilution were then infected with the test virus using a multiplicity of infection of <0.006 CCID50 per cell for each virus. Two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. A known active compound was run in parallel as a control. After cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed microscopically, plates were stained with neutral red dye for approximately 2 h, then supernatant dye was removed from the wells and the incorporated dye was extracted in 50:50 Sorensen citrate buffer/ethanol and read on a spectrophotometer at 540 nm. The optical density of test wells was converted to percent of cell and virus controls, then the concentration of test compound required to inhibit viral CPE by 50% (EC 50 ) was calculated by regression analysis. The concentration of compound that would cause 50% cytotoxicity in the uninfected cells was similarly calculated (CC 50 ). EC 50 and CC 50 were presented in mM. The selective index (SI) is the CC 50 divided by EC 50 .
