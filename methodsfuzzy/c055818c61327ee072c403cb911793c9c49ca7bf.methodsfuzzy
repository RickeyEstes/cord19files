Antigens and Media . Lyophilized Escherichia coli a-galactosidase (GZ)' was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp ., Freehold, NJ (sp act, 85,000 EU/mg) . 1 enzyme unit (EU) is defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 10 -9 mol o-nitro-phenyl (ONP) from ONP-D-galactoside (ONPG) in 1 min in conditions of substrate excess . Calculations of EU were made assuming a molar extinction of ONP corresponding to 4,700 at pH 9 (12) . Purified protein derivative (PPD ; Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark) and tetanus toxoid (TT Massachusetts Public Health Laboratories, Boston, MA) were used to generate human antigen-specific T lines. RMPI 1640 (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 P.g/ml streptomycin, 10 mM glutamine, 5 x 10 -s M 2-ME, and enriched with 10% FCS (Sterile Systems, Inc., Logan, UT) or with 5% autologous human plasma was used with murine cells or with human cells. Murine and Human T Cell Lines and Clones. GZ-specific murine T lines were generated according to the protocol originally described by Kimoto and Fathman (13) , with minor modifications IL2 Production by Murine T Hybridoma Cells and Prolferative Response ofHuman T Cells. Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were used as APC for T hybridomas . Peritoneal exudate was induced with one intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml Thioglycollate broth (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI). The peritoneal cavity was washed 4 d later with 8 ml ice-cold complete RPMI 1640 without serum. The cells were washed twice, resuspended in complete medium, and counted after staining with crystal violet . Lymphocytes, accounting for 20-30% of the cells, were not considered . Antigen and antibodies (20,ul each) were dispensed in flat-bottomed microtiter plates and preincubated for 2 h at room temperature . Antiserum was diluted in heat-inactivated normal rabbit serum and affinitypurified antibodies in normal rabbit gammaglobulins. PEC (5 x   38 Processing of Complexed Antigen 10') and T hybridoma cells (2 x 104) were added to a final volume of 200 ul. After 24 h, the supernatants were harvested and tested for 11,2 production on the IIr2-dependent line CTLL as described (16) , the amount of supernatant being 25 ttl at afinaldilution of 1:4 . Inhibition experiments were performed with mAb 2AG2, kindly donated by Dr . J. Unkeless, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, specific for mouse FcR. Macrophages were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with the anti-FcR mAb, or with heat-aggregated rabbit gamma globulins (HAGG; 62°C for 10 min) before addition of T cells and immune complexes. Proliferative response by human T clones was measured by culturing 2 x 104 T cells plus 105 autologous irradiated PBL in 200 /Al medium in flat-bottomed microtiter plates . After 30 h, the wells were pulsed with 0.5 p,Ci ['H]TdR (5 Ci/mmol; Amersham International, Amersham, UK) and harvested 12 h later. Complexes were prepared in the culture wells with antigen and antibody at 10-fold dilutions in 20 I1 volume. 2 h later, cells in 200,ul were added. Final antigen concentration and antibody concentration are shown in Results. Effect of Complement on Potentiation . Lyophilized rabbit complement (Behringwerke) and guinea pig complement (Sclavo, Siena, Italy) were reconstituted with distilled water and sterile filtered . Human complement was fresh human serum stored in aliquots at -80°C from donor F.M . tested for lack of toxicity on mouse cells. Complement (20 P1) was added to complexed antigen and incubated at 37°C for an additional hour. PEC and T cells were added and cultured as described above. Digestion of GZ with Proteolytic Enzymes. GZ was preincubated with affinity-purified antibodies overnight at room temperature. The pH was brought to 5 with acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4), and pepsin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added as described in detail in the figure legends. Digestion with cathepsin D (Sigma Chemical Co.) was performed at pH 6 under similar conditions. Digestion with V8 protease (Sigma Chemical Co.) was performed in Tris-HCI buffer (0 .5 M, pH 8) . After incubation at 37°C for different time intervals, samples were neutralized with Tris buffer (1 M pH 8) and tested for residual enzymatic activity or analyzed for cleavage of the GZ monomer by SDS gel electrophoresis. SDS Gel Electrophoresis. GZ was radioiodinated with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham International) after the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Specific radioactivity of the sample was 3.4 x 105/cpm per hg protein. Gel electrophoresis was performed in a mini gel apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the gels were dried and autoradiographed on Hyperfilm (Amersham International) .
