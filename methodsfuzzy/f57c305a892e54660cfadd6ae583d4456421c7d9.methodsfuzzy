Methods for space-time disease surveillance can address a surveillance objective in a variety of ways. Most methods assume a study area made up of smaller, nonoverlapping sub-regions where cases of disease are being monitored. The variable under surveillance is the count of the number of cases. In retrospective analysis, the data are fixed and methods are used to determine whether an outbreak occurred during the study period, or characterize the spatial-temporal trends in disease over the course of the study period (Marshall, 1991) . In the prospective scenario, the objective is to determine whether any single sub-region or collection of sub-regions is undergoing an outbreak (currently), and analysis occurs in an automated, sequential fashion as data accumulate over time. Prospective methods require special consideration as data do not form a fixed sample from which to make inferences about (Sonesson and Bock, 2003) . Parallel surveillance methodologies compute a test statistic separately for each sub-region and signal an alarm if any of sub-regions are significantly anomalous (Fig. 1A) . While in vector accumulation methods, test statistics in a parallel surveillance setting are combined to form one general alarm statistic (Fig. 1B) . Conversely, a scalar accumulation approach com-putes one statistic over all sub-regions for each time period (Frisen and Sonesson, 2005) (Fig. 1C ). For example, Rogerson (1997) used the Tango (1995) statistic to monitor changes in spatial point patterns. Cumulative sum methods for space-time surveillance developed out of traditional statistical surveillance applications such as quality control monitoring of industrial manufacturing processes. In CUSUM analysis, the objective is to detect a change in an underlying process. In application to disease surveillance, the data are in the form of case counts for sub-regions of a larger study area. A running sum of deviations is recalculated at each time period. For a given sub-region, a count y t of cases at time t is monitored as follows where S t is the cumulative sum alarm statistic, k is a parameter which represents the expected count, so that observed counts in exceedence of k are accumulated. At each time period, an alarm is signalled if S t is greater than a threshold parameter h. If a CUSUM is run long enough, false alarms will occur as exceedences are incrementally accumulated. The false-positive rate is controlled by the expected time it takes for a false alarm to be signalled, termed the in-control average run length, denoted ARL 0 . The ARL 0 is directly related to the threshold value for h, which can be difficult to specify in practice. High values of h yield long ARL 0 and vice versa. In practice, approximations are used to estimate a value for h for a chosen ARL 0 (Siegmund, 1985) , though this remains a key issue in CU-SUM methods. The basic univariate CUSUM in (1) can be extended to incorporate the spatial aspect of surveillance data. In this sense, CUSUM is a temporal statistical framework around which a space-time statistical test can be built. In an initial spatial extension, Rogerson (1997) coupled the (global) Tango statistic (1995) for spatial clustering in a CUSUM framework. For a point pattern of cases of disease, compute the spatial statistic, and use this value of the statistic to condition the expected value at the next time period. Observed and expected values are used to derive a z-score which is then monitored as a CUSUM (Rogerson, 2005a) . One scalar approach taken by Rogerson (2005b) is to monitor only the most unexpected value, or peak, of each time period as a Gumbel variate (Gumbel distribution is used as a statistical distribution for extreme values). An additional approach is to compute a univariate CUSUM in a parallel surveillance framework (Woodall and Ncube, 1985) . Here the threshold parameter h must be adjusted to account for the multiple tests occurring across the study area. Yet this approach takes no account of spatial relationships between sub-regions (i.e., spatial autocorrelation). CUSUM surveillance of multiple sub-regions can be considered a multivariate problem where a vector of differences between the observed and expected counts for each sub-region is accumulated. Spatial relationships between sub-regions can be incorporated by explicitly modelling the variance-covariance matrix. Rogerson and Yamada (2004) demonstrate this approach by monitoring a scalar variable representing the multivariate distance of the accumulated differences between observed and expected over all sub-regions. This is modelled as , and P is a variance-covariance matrix capturing spatial dependence, and S t is a 2 Ã‚ p vector of differences between observed and expected cases of disease in time t for each p sub-region (Rogerson and Yamada, 2004) . CUSUM methods are attractive for prospective disease surveillance because they offer a temporal statistical framework within which spatial statistics can be integrated. They therefore overcome one of the limitations of traditional spatial analysis applied to surveillance in that repeated testing over time (and space) can be corrected for. A full description of the inferential properties of the CUSUM framework is given by Rogerson (2005a) . These methods are therefore most appropriate for long temporal scales, especially when historical data are used to estimate the baseline. Multivariate CUSUM given by Rogerson and Yamada (2004) is for a singular disease over multiple sub-regions, but could be used to monitor multiple diseases over multiple sub-regions. This may be most applicable in a syndromic surveillance application. The simplicity of univariate CUSUM makes training and technical expertise less of a factor than the multivariate case. Multivariate CUSUM is also more difficult to interpret and specification of the threshold parameter requires simulation experimentation or a large temporal extent from which to establish a baseline.
