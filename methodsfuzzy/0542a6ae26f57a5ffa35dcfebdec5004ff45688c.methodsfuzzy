In both studies, respiratory (nasal and oropharyngeal) swabs were collected at enrollment for influenza testing. The combined respiratory sample was sent to one of two central laboratories for influenza testing (SAIC Frederick, Inc, Maryland or Advanced BioMedical Laboratories, New Jersey) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using specific primers and probes for detection of influenza A, (seasonal H1, H1N1pdm09, H3), and B viruses. In FLU 003, a local RT-PCR test result was required either prior to enrollment (for confirmed diagnoses) or at the time of enrollment (for suspected diagnoses). Initially, local RT-PCR test results were only recorded as influenza A positive or negative; after the first year, influenza A subtyping results were recorded. We assessed the discordance of local and central RT-PCR results. Results are shown in Appendix S2 with a rationale for inclusion of patients in each A(H1N1)pdm09 virusinfected cohort.
