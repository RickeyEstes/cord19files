Numerous human diseases exist for which viral etiologies are suspected, yet specific causal agents are not known. Among these are up to 20% of cases of acute hepatic failure, up to 35% of cases of acute aseptic meningitis and acute encephalitis, up to 50% of cases of acute respiratory infections, and numerous other conditions. In addition, infectious agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of chronic conditions, most notably disorders such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune and degenerative conditions, as well as some forms of cancer. While it is unlikely that viruses cause all of these diseases, identifying causative agents in even a modest number of disorders will have profound implications for understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions. New approaches to viral diagnostics and discovery are needed to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. These methods include viral culture, electron microscopy, serology, specific polymer chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, and techniques based on subtractive hybridization. While these methods have been critical for identifying many important human and nonhuman pathogens, each of these methods has intrinsic limitations. For example, many viruses are refractory to culture. Inspection by electron microscopy may prove difficult depending on the titer and morphological features of the virus. Serology-and PCR-based techniques are highly specific methods, but their specificity frequently renders them ineffective for the detection of variant or novel viral species. In the case of PCR, there exist dozens if not hundreds of variations on the method which may extend the scope of the assay, usually through multiplexing or by the use of degenerate primers, yet the number of possible targets that can be interrogated remains small relative to the number of known viral pathogens. Finally, subtractive hybridization techniques, while unbiased, are difficult to troubleshoot and essentially impossible to scale up for high throughput.
