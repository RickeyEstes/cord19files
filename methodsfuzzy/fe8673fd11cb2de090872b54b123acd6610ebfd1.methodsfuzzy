Our methodology for taxonomic classification, reference-based mapping and de novo assembly of short reads used time series and digital signal processing data transformation techniques.

Figure 2 illustrates the fundamental concept of our approach. The short reads and reference genomes are mapped to a numerical space using an appropriate method from Table 1 . Subsequently, lower dimensional approximations were generated for all data using the appropriate data transformation method, such as DFT, DWT and PAA. A VP-tree was constructed to allow fast data comparison. Depending on the application, the VP-tree was constructed either by using k-mer transformations obtained from the reference genomes or by using the short reads' transformations. Consequently, the best matches for our short reads' transformations were identified using a k-NN search approach on the VP-tree. As a final step, the results obtained from the k-NN search were re-evaluated in the original space to remove potential false positive results.

Validation of inferences against original, full-resolution input sequences. In the case of referencebased alignment and taxonomic classification, approximated read transformations were compared with a reference sequence. In our de novo implementation, pairwise comparisons were performed between all of the approximated read transformations.
