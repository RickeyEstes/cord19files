Study site and setting. Malawi has hot rainy (mean temperature > 22°C and rainfall > 100 mm; December to March), cool and dry (mean temperature < 22°C and rainfall < 50 mm; April to August), and hot and dry (mean temperature > 22°C and rainfall < 50 mm; September to November) seasons. The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) is the only government inpatient facility providing free health care to the 1.3 million residents of Blantyre District. Consequently, most individuals requiring hospitalization from this community will present to QECH. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence in Blantyre is estimated at 17.7%, 12 but up to 74% of patients admitted to the QECH medical wards are HIV infected. 13 Malaria is endemic in Malawi (peak transmission months January to June), and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity is 8% among adult inpatients at QECH. 14 Lower respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of medical admission at QECH. 13 There is no national influenza vaccination policy in Malawi. A WHO-led influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine campaign targeting health-care workers and pregnant women occurred in 2010. 15 Study procedures. Patients aged 15 years and older presenting to the QECH Emergency Department during surveillance hours (8 AM to 3 PM on weekdays) were screened for study eligibility. Consecutive patients from the start of the day fulfilling the SARI case definition were recruited (maximum four per day). Study staff collected demographic, clinical, and risk factor information using structured questionnaires and obtained nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood specimens for malaria and HIV testing. SARI was defined as 1) an acute respiratory illness with symptom onset < 7 days, 2) reported or recorded fever (³ 38°C), 3) cough or sore throat, and 4) shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In our resource-limited setting, patients with severe illness requiring admission were often sent home. Therefore, hospital attendance (not admission) was required for study enrolment. Laboratory procedures. The processing of respiratory specimens has been described previously. 16 In brief, nasopharyngeal aspirates were stored at −80°C in Universal Transport Medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy). These were batch-tested for influenza A and B by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) using the CDC human influenza reverse transcription-PCR diagnostic panel (CDC Influenza Division, http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/flu. html). Influenza-positive specimens were subtyped using the CDC rRT-PCR protocol. The FTD respiratory pathogens 33 kit (Fast-track Diagnostics Ltd., Luxembourg, http://www. fast-trackdiagnostics.com) was used to detect coronaviruses OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E; parainfluenza viruses 1-4; respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; adenovirus; and bocavirus. Samples with a Ct value < 40 were recorded as positive. Human immunodeficiency virus testing (Alere Determine ™ HIV-1/2, Waltham, MA, and Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold ™ HIV, Bray, Co., Wicklow, Ireland) was performed according to WHO guidelines. 17 Rapid diagnostic test for malaria (Paracheck Pf ® , Orchid Biomedical Systems, Bamboli, Goa, India) was also performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Climatic data. Data on rainfall (millimeters), temperature (degree Celsius), and relative humidity (percentage) were obtained from the Malawi Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services for 2011-2013. Statistical analysis. Analysis was performed using Stata (Version 12.0; StataCorp Limited, College Station, TX). Monthly mean temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity were plotted against the number and proportion of influenza-positive SARI cases over the surveillance period to assess the association between climatic variations and influenza activity. Numerators for minimum adult influenza-associated SARI incidence estimates were generated from the number of enrolled SARI with a positive influenza PCR that resided in the Blantyre district and adjusted for non-enrolment (during weekends and outside of surveillance hours on weekdays) by multiplying by the reciprocal of the proportion of recruited cases among all SARI cases attending the emergency department. The latter was recorded on the Surveillance Program of Inpatients and Epidemiology (SPINE) electronic data collection system. 13 The annual incidence of hospitalattended influenza-positive SARI per 100,000 persons was estimated using the adjusted number of medically attended influenza-positive SARIs, divided by the census estimates of Blantyre District population aged ³ 15 years for each year, 18 and multiplied by 100,000. Incidence by HIV status was also calculated for individuals aged 15-49 years (in whom HIV prevalence is available 18 ). Human immunodeficiency virusassociated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing the incidence in HIV-infected strata by the incidence in HIV-uninfected strata. 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence estimates and HIV-associated IRRs were calculated using the Poisson distribution. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs to compare clinical variables between influenzapositive and influenza-negative patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed for two outcomes of interest: 1) influenza positivity and 2) clinical severity (defined as Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) > 4). 19 Modified early warning score is a simple physiological score based on five parameters (respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, and conscious level). It has been widely used in developed health-care settings to identify patients at risk of deterioration. A score of greater than 4 has been shown to be predictive of inpatient mortality in both well-resourced 19, 20 and African settings. 21, 22 Covariates with a P value of < 0.2 on univariable analysis, in addition to age, gender, and year of surveillance considered a priori confounders, were assessed for significance using backward stepwise selection. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported. Factors with 2-sided P values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Ethics approval. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (P.07/10/958), Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (10.76), and the CDC through an ethical reliance. All participants provided written informed consent.
