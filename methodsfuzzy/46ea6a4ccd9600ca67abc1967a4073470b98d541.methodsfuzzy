Conventional methods of viral diagnosis consist of virus isolation and serology; light and electron microscopy are performed in certain situations. Although there is tremendous interest in the development of rapid diagnostic techniques, conventional diagnostic methods remain the most widely used and are essential in confirming the usefulness of newer techniques. However, it must be emphasized that only standard virus isolation and electron microscopy allow for success in recognition of unexpected or 'new' viruses.
