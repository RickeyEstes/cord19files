Cell Cultures. HUVEC cells were grown in EGM Bulletkit medium (cc-3124, Lonza) in tissue culture flasks coated with 0.2% gelatin. ASF-2 cells were grown in DMEM (Lonza) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific), 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Lonza) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks by trypsination with Trypsin EDTA (Lonza). Cell were passaged 1:4 at approximately 80% confluence. Selection on biotinylated membrane proteins. Cells grown to subconfluency were labelled with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology,) according to manufacturer's instructions but adapted to adherent cells. Briefly, the cells were washed trice with cold PBS, labelled for 30 minutes at RT with 2 mM biotin. Labelling was quenched with 1 mM cold Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, washed once with Tris-HCl and twice with cold PBS. The cells were scraped in cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol) on ice and then lysed on ice for an additional 30 minutes. Biotin-labelled lysate was coupled to 20 µl streptavidin coated magnetic beads (Roche Diagnostics) on a rotating wheel for 30 minutes at RT. Unbound lysate was removed using a magnetic concentrator and the beads washed twice with lysis buffer and once with M-PBS. Tomlinson I+J libraries were added in M-PBS and incubated on the rotating wheel for 1½-2 hrs at RT. Beads were washed 15 times with PBS-T and 15 times with PBS with 2 minutes incubation each time. After washing, the remaining phages were eluted by adding 100 μl trypsin in PBS (1 mg/ml). After 10 minutes the eluent was infected into TG-1 (OD 600 0.5) and spread on TYE plates with 100 μg/ml Ampicillin and 1% (W/V) Glucose. Plates were incubated at 30 °C overnight. Phage-ELISA on whole cells. For cell screenings, endothelial cells (HUVEC and HMEC-1) were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates, 10,000 cells/well in 100-200 µl of growth medium, and cultured for 1-4 days. After two times wash in PBS, the plates were either used directly or dried at 37 °C and frozen at −80 °C. As background controls, 100 µl/well of the appropriate growth medium was added to fresh 96-well cell culture plates and incubated overnight. After two times wash in PBS, the medium plates were used directly. Coated plates were blocked in 2% M-PBS 1-2 hrs, washed 2-3 times in PBS and incubated with 50 µl phage solution and 50 µl MPBS 1-2 hrs. Plates were washed 2-3 times in PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 (GE Healthcare) diluted 1/5000 in MPBS for 1 hr. After 2-3 times wash in PBS-T, plates were developed using TMB (tetra-methylbenzidine, Invitrogen). Reaction was stopped with 1 M H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was read at 450 nm with 655 nm as reference.
