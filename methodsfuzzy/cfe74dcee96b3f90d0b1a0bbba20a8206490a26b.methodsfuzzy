Poisson regression model was used as a multivariate analysis comparing the effects of vaccination type, gender, starting age of daycare, duration of breastfeeding, number of siblings and pets to the number of infections recorded in the 1:2-5 matched case-control groups in this cohort study. Results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR). The 2 -test was used to analyze the statistical significance of differences observed between the smoking habits during pregnancy of the mothers of OPV and IPV vaccinated children. The software packages used were SPSS, version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata, version 8.2 (StataCorp, 4905 College Station, TX, USA). Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
