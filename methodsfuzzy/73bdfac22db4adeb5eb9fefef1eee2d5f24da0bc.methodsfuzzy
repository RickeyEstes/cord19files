Besides the relative entropy, there are a great many of alignment-free comparisons on the basis of short word composition. In this part, we will list some of them and compare them with our method through phylogenetic experiments on the same data set. (1) Euclidean distance [31, 32] : where f i A and f i B are the frequencies of the ith word in sequences A and B, respectively. (2) Linear correlation coefficient [33] : (3) Cosine function [20, 34] : where A , and f i A is the expect frequency of word i in sequence A estimated from the frequencies of appropriate shorter subwords under a Markov model of order k À 2. (4) Information-based similarity index [35] : where H i A ¼ Àf i A log f i A is the Shannon entropy for word i in sequences A. R i A and R i B represent the ranks of word i in sequences A and B. We repeated our experiment using the above classical distances for different values of k, and some phylogenetic trees (at word length k ¼ 6) are shown in Figs. 3-5. Phylogenetic tree obtained using Euclidean distance d Eucli as the dissimilarity metric is shown in Fig. 3 . This tree is mainly identical to our tree, i.e., torovirus stays outside of all coronaviruses, and SARS-CoVs are closer to the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). But an obvious default in this tree is that it fails to cluster the three group I coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, PEDV and TGEV. Fig. 4 lists the phylogenetic tree constructed by d COS . This topology supports SARS-CoVs and group II as a closer pair, which is in accordance with the result of Liò and Goldman using a fragment of the spike protein [26] . However, this tree also fails to cluster the group I coronaviruses. In Fig. 5 , we list the tree built by linear correlation coefficient between pairwise frequency vectors. This tree perfectly clusters species within each typical group, and supports the outgroup status of SARS-CoVs relative to other coronaviruses. But it fails to identify the outgroup status of torovirus relative to coronaviruses.
