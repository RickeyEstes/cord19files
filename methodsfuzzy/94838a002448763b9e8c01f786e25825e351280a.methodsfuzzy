Within-host viral accumulation data set from parental and recombinant viral genomes The parental begomoviruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-Mld, accession no. AJ865337 here referred to as Tyx) and Tomato leaf curl Mayotte virus (ToLCKMV- [Dem] accession no. AJ865341, here referred to as Tox) (Delatte et al., 2005) , were both used previously to generate a series of recombinant genomes in vitro by DNA shuffling (European Patent 1104457, US Patent 6951719; Proteus, Nîmes, France). Multiple genome alignment using Clustal ω version 2.0 ( (Larkin et al., 2007) ; http://www.ebi. ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/) and whole genomes of recombinant clones are presented in Additional file 8. Agroinfectious clones were obtained for these 47 distinct recombinant clones and were tested for their within-host viral accumulation in tomato plants at 22 dpi. The logarithm of the calibrated Normalized Relative Quantity (logNRQ) reflecting the within-host accumulation of the virus were obtained from real-time PCR assays. The average and median of the log-transformed data presented in (Vuillaume et al., 2011) were used in this study. In addition, the efficiency of the 47 clones to reach a detectable viral DNA accumulation after inoculation was measured by the percentage of PCR-positive plants at 15 dpi which is here referred to as early infectivity (13).
