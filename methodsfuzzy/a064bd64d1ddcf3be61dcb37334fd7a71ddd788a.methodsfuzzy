Proteomic changes can be studied at the level of individual virus-host protein interactions, organelles, and whole cells. 2D-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) have been used in numerous studies to identify gene expression patterns in infected cells [1 ] . While 2D-PAGE methods and variations thereof allow the identification, relative quantification, and comparison of the abundant protein in infected versus noninfected samples, very small, very large, hydrophobic and low-abundance proteins are difficult to resolve. Drawbacks are a frequent limitation in reproducibility and lack of HT capabilities. Mass spectrometry is an excellent means of protein identification. Isobaric tagging techniques [2] including stable isotope labeling by amino acids (SILAC) in cell culture allow quantitative examination of virus-host cell relations and have improved the field significantly [3 ] . MS-based techniques have recently also been used to characterize host-pathogen interactions within purified, mature virus particles including vaccinia virus [4] , influenza virus [5] , HIV [6] , vesicular stomatitis virus [7] , SARS-Corona virus [8 ] , and several herpes viruses [9 ] . Finally, the twohybrid-based mammalian PPI trap (MAPPIT), which drives a cellular signaling cascade with an endogenous transcriptional reporter, has been used as a HT assay for HCV and HIV-1 proteins and for human protein interactome analysis [10, 11] . Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is a popular and intensely used alternative for studying virus-host protein-protein interaction on a global proteome scale [12 ] . It exploits yeast genetic engineering and the modularity of eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) utilizing DNA-binding domains (DBD) and activating domains (AD). Bait proteins fused to DBD and prey proteins fused to AD reconstitute functional TFs (e.g., yeast GAL4) upon interaction of the fusion proteins to be tested. The system can be used in a HT manner performing array-based matrix screens (e.g., all virus proteins against each other) or screens of individual bait virus proteins against cDNA prey libraries of different origin [13 ] . Former allows the establishment of intraviral [14 ] , latter of virus-host interactomes [15 ,16] . Concepts of virus-host interactome studies are outlined in Figure 1 . There are limitations to the Y2H system as the transcriptional reporter system is on the basis of nuclear localization, which limits the analysis of hydrophobic membrane proteins because of possible disruption of the nuclear membrane. Also, the lack of mammalian translational modifications might contribute to the detection rate of about a quarter of all interactions as estimated in recent studies [17 ,18] . False positive interactions, a further drawback, can be efficiently prevented using proper controls, thus resulting in high-quality large-scale screens [19] . Increasing reliability by decreasing false-negative rates has recently been achieved by systematically combining screening strategies using novel N-terminal bait and C-terminal bait and prey fusion-protein vectors [20 ] . Biological significance can be addressed by the validation of Y2H interactions with different biochemical and/or mammalian cell-based methods. Co-immunoprecipitation was successfully applied to co-produced proteins containing short fusion tags in mammalian cells [14 ,21] . As this method is very time-consuming, it is only applicable to small-scale evaluations. The LUMIER (LUminescence-based Mammalian IntERactome mapping) [22 ] assay or modified versions thereof [15 ] are pull-down assays with bait proteins used as fusions to Flag-tag or Protein A and with prey proteins used as fusions to luciferase (and vice versa) for detection. This methods as well as protein fragment complementation assays (PCAs) such as split-YFP-based or split-luciferase-based methods are well suited for HT screening. In the latter two assays, the test proteins are fused to subdomains of YFP [23 ] or luciferase [24] . Upon physical interaction of the bait and prey proteins, the respective YFP or luciferase fragments reconstitute the fluorescent or enzymatic activities, respectively. A split beta-lactamase interaction assay has very recently been described as a cell-free test for the screening of small molecular peptide inhibitors [25] . A very intriguing fluorescent two-hybrid (F2H) assay allows the direct visualization and analysis of PPIs in single living cells utilizing a stable nuclear interaction platform [26 ] .
