The radiation treatment policy for the department of radiation oncology at the occ states that weekend radiation treatments should be considered only in the following circumstances: When a delay in radiotherapy might compromise • treatment outcome When pain control is impossible with medical • therapy and, in the judgment of the attending radiation oncologist, radiation has the potential to provide pain relief within 48 hours Treatment should not be undertaken on the weekend simply to facilitate the patient's discharge from hospital unless the use of multiple fractions per day was not possible earlier in the week, or the inpatient bed is urgently needed for another oncology patient 2 . To handle weekend emergencies at the occ, a radiation oncologist and two radiation therapists are on call at all times during the weekend and on scheduled hospital holidays. A weekend is defined as commencing at 6 pm on a Friday and concluding at 8 am of the next scheduled workday (usually a Monday). Using the Oncology Patient Information System scheduling module at the occ, we retrospectively identified patients who were treated with radiotherapy on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday between September 1, 2002, and September 31, 2004. These dates were chosen based on the retrospective availability of patient tracking into the radiotherapy system. Once the patients were identified, their identification numbers were used to obtain relevant information from the associated electronic patient records. Variables subsequently collected included patient age, sex, primary cancer site, specific radiation treatment field, rationale for treatment, referring hospital, attending radiation oncologist, total treatment dose, dose fractionation, occ inpatient or outpatient status, and duration of treatment. Results were then analyzed using descriptive statistics and, to assess adherence to quality assurance standards, were compared with the current departmental policy as described earlier for treatment of patients on weekends. All patient information was rendered anonymous, and research ethics approval was obtained. Patient treatments were grouped into intervals based on the date of first visit to the radiotherapy
