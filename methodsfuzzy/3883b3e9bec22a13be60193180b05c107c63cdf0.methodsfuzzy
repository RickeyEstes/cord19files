Several strategies can be used to study the cellular internalization of CPP-ON conjugates or CPP:ON complexes [160, 165] . 1. Biophysical characterization of CPP/ON using circular dichroism, infra-red spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering or by insertion studies into phospholipid layers. 2. Inhibition of a specific endocytic pathway and assessment of its effect on CPP/ON internalization and biological activity. 3. Co-localization microscopy studies of the association of CPP/ON with fluorescently labelled endocytic markers The association of CPPs with membranes induces the modification of several physical properties, such as the surface pressure of monolayer (Langmuir Blodgett) and the secondary structure of the peptide (FT-IR, CD, etc.). Deformation of the lipid bilayer due to hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between the components as well as the peptide localization in the membrane can be also assessed using NMR, X-ray diffraction, coupled plasmon waveguide resonance, EPR or FRET [166] . Assessing endosomal escape directly has turned difficult and can only be monitored using artificial models such as liposomal leakage assays. Different protocols were developed using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with entrapped dyes such as calcein [167] , carboxyfluorescein [168] or ANTS (fluorescent dye)/DPX (quencher) [169, 170] . In cellulo, clathrin-mediated endocytosis can be predominantly characterized by the use of transferrin. Its uptake in cells can indeed be inhibited by a clathrin-specific siRNA or via cell transfection cells with a mutant form of dynamin [171] . However, dynamin is now known to regulate other endocytic and membrane trafficking pathways. Alternatively pharmacological inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine or dynasore (a dynamin inhibitor), can be used to inhibit this pathway even if these reagents cause significant cell toxicity and have to be used over short incubation times [18] [19] [20] . Potassium depletion or hypertonic medium incubation is also commonly used to investigate clathrin-mediated endocytosis [21, 22] . Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma membrane that are localized in lipid rafts. A number of ligands, such as cholera toxin B, SV40 virus and albumin have been shown to be internalized more or less specifically via caveolae. The glycosphingolipid analogue lactosylceramide (LacCer), a fluorescent probe, was also shown to be internalized via this route and may represent a more selective marker for this pathway [172] . A range of pharmacological inhibitors of this pathway have been described and, in the main, they are agents that deplete cholesterol synthesis (lovastatin), agents that rapidly extract cholesterol from lipid rafts (methyl-ÃŸ-cyclodextrin), and other cholesterol-interacting molecules such as the antibiotics nystatin and filipin. Dowdy, Futaki and their colleagues have shown that Tat and other arginine-rich CPPs induce a ubiquitous form of fluid-phase endocytosis termed micropinocytosis [174, 173] . For example, the uptake of octaarginine (R8) peptide by HeLa cells was significantly suppressed by the macropinocytosis inhibitor ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) and the F-actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D, suggesting a role for macropinocytosis in the uptake of the peptide.
