The Ethics Committee of S. Martino Hospital (Genoa, Italy) approved the study protocol (N° 18/2010). Study design. A case-control study was performed in the elderly population (> 64 y of age) residing in Genoa (Italy), accounting for 163,808 elderly subjects (65,648 males and 98,160 females) as of 31st December 2010. 46 Cases and controls were matched in a 1:1 ratio. Matching was based on gender, age (+/-3 y), socio-economic status (evaluated on the basis of educational level and the district of residence) and type of influenza vaccine. Each case and matched control had the same GP. In 2010-2011, the Regional Health Service (RHS) provided 4 vaccines for the influenza vaccination campaign. In particular, Inflexal V ® (Crucell Italy Srl), Fluad ® (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Srl) and Intanza ® 15mcg (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SpA) were used for the elderly. Case definition and selection. The cases were recruited among hospitalized subjects by choosing patients with discharge diagnoses of influenza or pneumonia (hospital discharge code ICD9, 480-487). Two important hospitals of Genoa were considered Our results highlight the fact that many subjects with more than two concomitant high-risk conditions were not vaccinated against influenza. For example, 52.6% of cases with heart disease and 46.5% of those with respiratory disease were not vaccinated. Although the Italian Ministry of Health has set the objective of vaccinating 75% of the elderly population during annual influenza vaccination campaigns, current coverage is about 58% in Italy as a whole, and 62% in Genoa (Data from Liguria Region -Influenza vaccination: 2010-2011 season). 44 For this reason, it is very important to raise awareness of the utility of influenza vaccination in the elderly; it is also advisable to implement training courses for GPs. Furthermore in occasion of annual influenza vaccination campaign, it is useful to vaccinate the elderly against pneumococcal infections. Indeed, the synergism between influenza infection and a greater susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae is well established. 45 With regard to this item, our results also demonstrate that vaccination against S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent among controls than cases, although the pneumococcal vaccination status of many subjects, both cases and controls, could not be ascertained. In conclusion, our results indicate that the adjuvanted vaccines seem to fulfil the purpose for which they were designed. In particular, our findings reveal the very high efficacy of Inflexal V ® , even if, on the basis of the lower limit of the 95% CI, we adopt a conservative estimate of the effectiveness (62.8%). It can be hypothesized that the use of this vaccine for influenza prevention would yield considerable saving for the National Health (cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular events, regular treatment with hypertensive agents, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, hepatic disease, rheumatic disease and neoplasia). Furthermore, subjects were asked about their smoking and drinking habits and whether they had received pneumococcal vaccine. The influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status was checked by using the vaccination registers of GPs and the LHU. All vaccinated subjects enrolled received the influenza vaccine during the seasonal campaign vaccination (October 20th-November 10th 2010). Statistical analysis. The analyses were performed with the SPSS vers.16.0 for Windows and Graph-Pad software. The characteristics of the study population were described as means ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical ones. The differences among cases and controls groups were analyzed with MacNemar's test. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as IVE = [(1-OR)x100] and crude odds ratios with relative 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were estimated by conditional logistic regression models, using the dichotomic variables "hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia" as outcome and "vaccination" as main predictor. Otherwise, adjusted ORs were estimated by multivariable logistic models. After evaluating the role of possible confounding factors of all the variables measured in the study (Heart Disease, Respiratory Disease, Alcohol consumption and smoking etc), those variables that resulted in a change of the effect of exposure for recruitment: the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino and the Ente Ospedaliero "Ospedali Galliera." Control definition and selection. The controls were subjects who were not hospitalized for influenza or pneumonia in the study period. The controls were recruited by GPs. Soon after the recruitment of each case, GPs picked out potential control subjects (fitting the control definition) among the patients registered in their databases. From this group of potential candidates, GPs randomly selected control subjects. Study period. The 2010-2011 influenza season was considered. Since the diagnosis of influenza was only based on hospital discharge code ICD9, to improve the specificity of diagnosis, the study took into account only the period of maximum incidence of ILI (December 2010 -March 2011) (Fig. 3) . The database of the Inter-University Centre for Research on Influenza and other Transmitted Infections (CIRI-IT), which monitors the trend in influenza throughout the year, was considered to have epidemiological and virological data in real time. 40, 47, 48 The CIRI-IT is located at the Health Sciences Department of the University of Genoa and is part of the Italian Influenza Surveillance System. Data collection. Once written consent had been obtained, data from both cases and controls were collected by means of an ad hoc written questionnaire. The information obtained was validated by GPs' medical records and, with regard to the cases, also by hospital medical records. The following variables were recorded: age, gender, socio-economic status, chronic conditions
