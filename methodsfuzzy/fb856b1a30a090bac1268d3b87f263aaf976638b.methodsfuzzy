The clinical and brief pathological features of the patient were reported previously [6] . The patient was a 33-year-old man who died of respiratory failure on day 11 of disease in 2003 in Hong Kong. He was admitted for symptoms of influenza for 4 days. Mild lymphopenia and radiological evidence of right lower lobe consolidation were noted. He was diagnosed with atypical community acquired pneumonia and was started on intravenous cefotaxime, oral clarithromycin, and sultamicillin after microbiological tests, which turned out to be negative. He continued to deteriorate with increased dyspnea, bilateral chest consolidation, and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intensive care on day 3 of admission. Oral oseltamivir was added. His oxygen saturation was at 93.3% with a 50% oxygen mask. Mechanical respiration was needed on day 4 when oxygen saturation dropped to 89.3% with a100% oxygen mask. He died of refractory respiratory failure on day 7. Corticosteroid was not given throughout the course. Influenza A subtype H5N1 was subsequently cultured from the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The present study included a complete histological review and immunohistochemical study of representative organs. The monoclonal antibody against NP was developed in the Department of Microbiology, the University of Hong Kong by hybridoma derived from mice infected with H5N1 strain CK/YU22/02 (clone 17H4). The derived antibody was immunoglobulin IgG2a class. Its specificity for NP was verified by Western blot using lysate from cells transfected with NP plasmid and control cells without transfection (cell line 293). For the immunohistochemical technique, formalinfixed paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with the monoclonal antibody at 1:5000 dilution at 4°C overnight, then incubated with goat antimouse IgG, heavy-chainspecific and light-chain-specific biotin conjugate (Calbiochem) at 1:2000 dilution for 30 minutes at room temperature. After incubation with streptavidin/peroxidase complex reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature, color was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunohistochemical technique was verified by using lung sections of mouse killed 48 hours after infection with H5N1 virus. To evaluate for falsepositive reactions due to endogenous biotin, we used controls with addition of antihuman papillomavirus (anti-HPV) antibody (monoclonal antibody of IgG2a class developed locally against L1 antigen of HPV serotype 18, dilution 1:5000) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) instead of the anti-NP antibody. In addition, sections of similar organs of 2 control cases were also tested. One was a patient dying of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the other was a patient dying due to a traffic accident.
