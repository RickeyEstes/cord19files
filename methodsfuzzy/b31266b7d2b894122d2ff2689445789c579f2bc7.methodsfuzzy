Due to the lack of morphological features and frequent gene exchanges, it is highly valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogeny for viruses. Now phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is well developed. Sequence alignments are always based on some special genes or some conserved fragments (Saitou, 1996) . Such analysis can be done at both the amino acid level and the nucleotide level. To overcome the biases caused by individual genes or genome segments, it is valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences. Being different from the sequence alignment method, the current method is a geometric approach which is based on measuring the differences of Z-curves of whole genomes, including coding and non-coding sequences. There is no need to search for similar sequences. Probably, the most remarkable advantages of the present method is its simplicity and intuitiveness. The result shows that four groups exist in the genus Coronavirus. Note that group I (HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV) and group II (BCoVM, BCoVL, BCoVQ, BCoV, MHVM, MHV2, MHVP, and MHV) cluster together forming a bigger group firstly. Second, this group joins group III (IBV) to form a much bigger group. Finally, SARS-CoVs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown here. Also note that the resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups. The increasing availability of complete genomes has cast doubt instead of adding details to the phylogenetic tree (Qi et al., 2004) . Phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is usually done on the most conservative part of a gene. These fragments are usually coding sequences, especially the sequences coding for catalytic sites or the core of proteins, because they tend to be more evolutionarily conserved. It was said by a virologist that people could not simply assume that a virus can be represented by its polymerase (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTV/). A virus must be viewed as a whole. Non-coding sequences also play an important role in the virus, so do the less conserved genes. In addition, analyses based on different genes may lead to different results. Consequently, by using complete genomes one can avoid choosing which genes to be aligned. Therefore methods that are based on the whole genome are likely to be more objective. Recently, a kstring composition approach was proposed to analyze prokaryote phylogeny based on the whole proteome and satisfactory results were obtained (Qi et al., 2004) ; however, such analysis must rely on the annotation information. In contrast, the complete genome sequence is the only input of the current method; neither the annotation information, nor any adjustable parameters are needed. It is noteworthy that the current method is performed automatically without any human intervention. The Z-curve, which serves as the foundation of the present method is a powerful tool to study the complete genome sequence. The Z-curve contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. Many characteristics of a genome with biological meaning can be observed from the corresponding Z-curve, such as the replication origins and genomic islands for some bacterial and archaeal genomes . We can inspect a genome in an intuitive way regardless of the gene content and gene order, even though the sequences are of different lengths. If the Zcurves of two species show similar pattern even though the genomes have different lengths, one may infer that they are evolutionarily close organisms, and vice versa. In this paper, we use the geometric center and the eigenvectors to describe the pattern approximately. Although this is only a rough approximation, it represents just an attempt to apply the Z-curve method to the phylogenetic analysis and the results obtained agree well with previous analyses. This method is aimed to analyze the phylogeny of the genomes which have close phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetics analysis is based on the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. In this paper, the 24 genomes under study all belong to the same genus Coro-navirus. Additionally, the differences of length among genomes are not very large. If the genomes under study have much farther phylogenetic relationships, and the differences in length are considerably large, the present method may not work. Consequently, cautions must be taken when using the present method to study the phylogeny of organisms with far evolutionary distances. In addition, unlike the estimation based on comparison of orthologous genes, the Z-curve approach is also sensitive to genome rearrangements: a single large-scale inversion can change the form of Z-curve drastically. Therefore, the method presented here is considerably limited in the cases of genome rearrangements. In addition, as mentioned above, the three-dimensional Z-curve is approximately depicted by a few parameters, such as the geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors. Consequently, information contained in the Zcurve is lost considerably in so doing. It is reasonable to suppose that the more information is extracted from the Z-curve, the more accurate result can be gained. Therefore, the current method can be improved if new and more effective algorithms are proposed to extract information contained in the Z-curves. In summary, although the present method has some advantages, it is still in its premature stage. The method may not be applied to some general cases, therefore the applications of it are considerably limited at present.
