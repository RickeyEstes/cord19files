In an effort to capture the variety of definitions and explanations of syndromic surveillance in the literature, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, proceedings from all ISDS conferences, and previous literature reviews and reference lists related to this topic were searched from 1998 to 2010. Search terms included ''syndromic surveillance'' and the 10 other terms mentioned above, which are considered synonymous with syndromic surveillance. In addition to general overview articles, the set of articles pertaining to country-and region-specific systems were narrowed by including the terms ''low-income'' and ''developing country'' to fit the emphasis on the translation of these systems to lower resource settings. Through a review of titles, abstracts, and fulllength articles, 81 general articles were identified describing and evaluating syndromic surveillance systems along with several hundred articles delineating surveillance systems implemented in specific countries or regions. Within the articles collected, those that defined syndromic surveillance or provided a description of fundamental aspects of these systems were selected and compiled for comparison. In total, 43 separate articles defined syndromic surveillance, of which 36 provided unique definitions. A majority of the unique definitions found came from overview of articles of syndromic surveillance, rather than countryspecific articles. However, the country-specific articles provided distinguishing examples of systems being implemented in various settings. Table 1 contains the 36 unique definitions of syndromic surveillance found in the literature. The five general points of agreement among those in the field and mentioned above are frequently noted in the definitions and are designated in the set of columns on the far right. The two shaded columns indicate that there are two fundamental categories of syndromic surveillance systems conveyed by the collection of definitions. These two categories involve the same investigational approach, and may even be components of the same system, but monitor two distinct outcome types: specific and non-specific outcomes. Within the two fundamental categories of syndromic surveillance (defined further below), all five principles are relevant, with the principles of early detection and response and the use of pre-diagnostic information being the most commonly referred to across the definitions.
