Chemical/physical methods of virus quantitation measure the amount (or relative amount) of a viral protein, genome, or enzyme, in a sample. Types of chemical/physical methods include: • Direct visualization of virions by EM. • Hemagglutination (HA) assay. • Serological assays (based on antigenÀantibody interactions, see Box 4.1). Examples of serologic assays include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), fluorescent-tagged antibody assays, and precipitation assays. • Genome quantification by PCR.
