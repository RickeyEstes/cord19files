The comparator method applied was expert panel adjudication in line with NHS Health Technology Assessment guidelines for evaluation of diagnostic tests [36] . The panel comprised three independent, experienced, clinically practicing physicians who reviewed after discharge clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological data accrued over the course of the patient's care, including PCR analysis of nasal swabs. The physicians were blinded to the diagnoses of their peers to prevent group pressure or influential personality bias. Each panel member independently assigned one of the following diagnoses to each patient: (i) bacterial (including mixed bacterial and viral co-infection); (ii) viral; or (iii) indeterminate. The study cohort for the current analysis included only comparator method outcomes when the expert panel were unanimous, i.e., all three panel members independently assigned the same diagnosis. Regarding the biomarkers and prediction rules under study, panel members were provided with CRP, WBC, and ANC data, and blinded to the following: hostprotein signature, IL-6, PCT, and HNL, and results of the prediction rules.
