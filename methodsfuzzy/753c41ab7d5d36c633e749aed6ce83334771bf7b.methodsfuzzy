All code used to generate the dataset is available on GitHub 6 . To estimate reporting effort and integrate it with our models, we wrote a series of scripts in Python and R to identify place names in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMCOAS), and aggregate them to the spatial grid used in our analyses. This section describes the current capabilities of the PubCrawler Python package, and then details the workflow used in the creation of the reporting effort layer for this study. We developed three components for our workflow: • PubCrawler, a Python package, which provides functionality for extracting information from PMCOAS. • Annie, a generalized text annotation Python package, first developed for the GRITS (Global Rapid Identification of Threats) natural language processing tool. 7 PubCrawler uses Annie's GeonameAnnotator() class, and a modified method from that class, to identify toponyms in article text. • pubcrawler2hotspots, a set of R scripts bundled as a package, which aggregates extracted toponyms to the spatial grid used in our main model, and fits a boosted regression tree model to the output.
