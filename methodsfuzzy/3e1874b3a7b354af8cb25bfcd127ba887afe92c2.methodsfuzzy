Virus construction. Recombinant viruses were constructed using a four-cDNA cloning strategy, the same strategy used to create wt DENV infectious clones (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Patterned after coronavirus cDNA clones (28, 29) , the DENV-4 genome was subcloned into four separate cDNA plasmids. A T7 promoter was introduced into the 5= end of the A fragment, and unique type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage sites are introduced into the 5= and 3= ends of each fragment to allow for systematic assembly into a genome-length cDNA from which full-length transcripts can be derived (28) (29) (30) . The EDIII residues from DENV2 were introduced into the DENV4 A subclone by replacing E nucleotides 900 to 1179 with the corresponding nucleotides encoding variant DENV2 amino acids. The new A fragment with nucleotides from DENV2 was synthesized and inserted into the pUC-57 plasmid (BioBasic). The new A plasmid and the DENV4 B, C, and D plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli cells, purified, digested with the corresponding type IIS restriction enzymes, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase to create a full-length cDNA dengue viral genome. The full-length cDNA was transcribed into genome-length RNAs using T7 polymerase, as previously described by our group (28) (29) (30) . Recombinant RNA was electroporated into BHK-21 cells, and cell culture supernatant containing viable virus was harvested. Virus was then passaged two times on C6/36 cells, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and stored at Ϫ80°C. Passage 3 represents our working stock. Cells. Mosquito Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells were grown in Gibco minimal essential medium (MEM) at 32°C. Vero-81 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and DC-SIGNexpressing U937 cells (U937ϩDC-SIGN cells) were maintained in RPMI at 37°C. Medium was supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10% for Vero-81 and 5% for C6/36 and U937ϩDC-SIGN cells), which was lowered to 2% after infection. The C6/36 and U937ϩDC-SIGN media were supplemented with nonessential amino acids, and U937ϩDC-SIGN medium was also supplemented with L-glutamine and 2-mercaptoethanol. All media were additionally supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 as previously described by our group (30) . DENV type-specific PCR and RFLP analysis. Total RNA was isolated from viral supernatants and used as the template for cDNA synthesis using standard molecular techniques. Serotype-specific PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) restriction endonuclease analyses were performed on cDNA samples in order to validate the purity of the recombinant viral preparations (see Fig. S2A , B, and C in the supplemental material). Binding ELISA. Equal quantities of virus (as previously titrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) were captured using either mouse anti-DENV MAbs 4G2 and 2H2 or human MAb 1C19. Primary antibodies were diluted 4-fold starting at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/l to 100 ng/l. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect binding of primary antibodies with p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate, and reaction color changes were quantified by spectrophotometry, as previously described (20) . DENV immune sera. Deidentified human DENV immune sera were collected from individuals with confirmed previous natural DENV infections (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). All donations were collected in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (protocol 08-0895). Deidentified human immune sera previously collected from adults given the NIH monovalent DENV2 vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00920517) was provided by Anna Durbin and Stephen Whitehead. All sera were collected following informed consent and approval by the Western Institutional Review Board. Nonhuman primate immune sera were collected following experimental DENV infection and kindly provided by Carlos Sariol (see Table S2 ) (31) . All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institute's Animal Care and Use Committee at Medical Sciences Campus, University of Puerto Rico (IACUC-UPR-MSC) and performed in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) (Animal Welfare Assurance no. A3421; protocol no. 7890108, 7890208, 7890209, and 7890210). Virus titration and FRNT. One day prior to inoculation, 24-well cell culture plates were seeded with either 5 ϫ 10 4 Vero-81 cells or 1 ϫ 10 5 C6/36 cells. Prior to inoculation, growth medium was removed. Virus titrations were performed by serially diluting virus stocks 10-fold and then incubating them for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, virus dilutions were added to cells for 1 h at 37°C and then overlaid with 1 ml 1% methylcellulose in OptiMEM I (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. After 3 to 6 days of incubation at 37°C, the overlay was removed, and cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 80% methanol. Plates were blocked with 5% instant milk made in PBS and then incubated with anti-E MAb 4G2 and anti-prM MAb 2H2, both diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. The plates then were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), diluted 1:2,500 in blocking buffer. Plates were washed, foci were developed with TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL), and then foci were counted. For the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), either MAbs or sera were diluted 4-fold and mixed with~40 focus-forming units (FFU) of virus and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, virus and MAb or serum dilutions were added to cells for 1 h at 37°C, and then the overlay was added and processed as described above. Growth curves. Either Vero or C6/36 cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Every 24 h, culture supernatant was harvested and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Samples were frozen at Ϫ80°C until use. Fresh medium was replaced each day. Virus titers were determined on their propagating cell type, as described above. U937ϩDC-SIGN cells were infected at an initial infection of 1%, and every 12 h, a sample of cells was harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and probed with 2H2 (anti-prM antibody) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Infected cells were quantified using a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore). Immunoblotting. Virus stocks were diluted in PBS, mixed with 4ϫ Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), and heated for 10 min at 50°C. Samples were run on 12% Protean TGX gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and blocked in 5% instant milk in PBS plus 0.05% Tween overnight at 4°C. Membranes were probed with 0.5 g/ml anti-E MAb 4G2, 0.5 g/ml anti-prM MAb 2H12, and MAb 5L20 in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37°C. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-human secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane was exposed to chemiluminescent substrate and developed on film. Depletion of DENV2-specific antibodies from immune sera. Polyclonal immune sera were depleted of DENV2-binding antibodies as previously described (10) . Briefly, polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences catalog no. 17135) were coated with purified DENV2 antigen (Microbix catalog no. EL-22-02-001) or the bovine serum albumin (BSA) control. Immune sera were depleted of antibodies by incubation with coated beads for 45 min at 37°C for at least three rounds, until maximum depletion of antibodies was measured. Depletions of antibodies were confirmed by ELISA. Depletion of rEDIII-specific antibodies from immune sera. Polyclonal immune sera were depleted of rEDIII-binding antibodies as previously described for rE-binding antibodies (10) . Briefly, Dynabeads (Life Technologies catalog no. 14302D) were covalently conjugated to DENV2 rEDIII protein following the manufacturer's protocol or BSA control. Immune sera were depleted of antibodies by incubation with conjugated beads for 45 min at 37°C for at least three rounds, until maximum depletion of antibodies was measured. Depletions of antibodies were confirmed by ELISA. ELISA confirmation of DENV2 or rEDIII-depleted sera. ELISA plates were coated directly with either 50 ng of DENV2 antigen or 100 ng DENV2 rEDIII per well at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked as described above. Undepleted, control depleted, and antigen/rEDIII-depleted sera were diluted 1:40 in blocking buffer and were incubated on plates for 1 h at 37°C. DENV2 or rEDIII reactive antibodies were detected using the secondary antibody and substrate as described above.
