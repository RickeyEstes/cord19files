Cells and virus. The SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. H.F. Rabenau from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany. Vero E6 cells were propagated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 in minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD), and 1.4% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Virus-infected cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 in MEM supplemented with 2% FCS. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The methodology of the realtime RT-PCR assay has been described previously [26] . Briefly, a real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-CoV genome. A 25 ll RT-PCR was carried out using 5 ll of extracted RNA or standard cRNA, 12.5 ll one-step RT qPCR Mastermix containing ROX as a passive reference (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 900 nM forward and reverse primers, and 150 nM minor groove binding probe. Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 48°C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95°C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C). During amplification, the ABI PRISM sequence detector monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysis of fluorescence emissions. The reporter dye (FAM) signal was measured against the internal reference dye (ROX) signal to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence fluctuations occurring from well to well. The threshold cycle represented the refraction cycle number at which a positive amplification was measured, and was set at 10 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3-15. Extracellular and intracellular viral RNA quantitation. One hundred CCID 50 (50% cell culture infectious dose) SARS-CoV was allowed to adsorb at 37°C for 20 min on Vero E6 cells in 24-well culture plates, containing 10 5 cells and 400 ll MEM 2%. Subsequently, the cells were washed 5 times with PBS. At different time points post-infection, supernatants putatively containing free viruses and infected cells were collected. Viral RNA was isolated from the supernatant and total RNA was isolated from the infected cells, using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) and the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), respectively. The samples were tested by quantitative RT-PCR for the presence and quantitation of viral RNA. The 18S Genomic Endogenous Control Kit (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) was used for normalization of the intracellular quantitative RT-PCR analysis by determining the number of collected Vero E6 cells. Virus yield assay. One hundred CCID 50 SARS-CoV was allowed to adsorb at 37°C for 20 min on Vero E6 cells. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed 5 times with PBS. At different time points, cell culture supernatant putatively containing free viruses was collected. The yield of infectious viral particles was determined using a CCID 50 assay where virus titers are determined by visual scored CPE, using 10-fold dilution steps. The limiting dilution end point (CCID 50 / ml) was determined by the Kärber equation, where CCID 50 / ml = 10 [LÀd(SÀ0.5)] /V, in which L is the lowest dilution, d is the logarithm of the dilution factor (d = 1 for the 10-fold serial dilution), S is the sum of proportions of infection-positive wells per total wells at each subsequent dilution, and V is the volume (ml) of the diluted virus used for inoculation [27] . Statistics. The statistical significances of the rise of intracellular and extracellular viral RNA load were assessed by using a two-tailed StudentÕs t test.
