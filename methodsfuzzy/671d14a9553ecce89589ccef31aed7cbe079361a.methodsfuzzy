Log 10 50% end point dilution ¼ log 10 of dilution showing a mortality next above 50% -(difference of logarithms Â logarithm of dilution factor). Generally, the following formula is used to calculate "difference of logarithms" (difference of logarithms is also His. (C) CD spectra of the purified G4-T in PBS solution with 0%, 25%, and 50% TFE. A typical a-helix secondary structure is showed with double minima at 208 and 222 nm. (D) Thermal denaturation of G4-T at wavelength of 222 nm. known as "proportionate distance" or "interpolated value"): Difference of logarithms ¼ [(mortality at dilution next above 50%)-50%]/[(mortality next above 50%)-(mortality next below 50%)].
