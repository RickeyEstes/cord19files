To study the stability of UAE method for T, ITB, ITA, TN and INA in I. tectorum, six replicates of the same ground sample (1.0 g) were processed according to the same optimal UAE protocol, i.e. 15 ml of 70% methanol, 45 â€¢ C, 150 W, 45 min, 60-80 mesh. The relative Fig. 8 . Effect of the particle size on extraction yield of isoflavones from I. tectorum. standard deviations (RSDs) for the determined extraction yields of the T, ITB, ITA, TN and INA were 1.16%, 0.82%, 0.75%, 1.04% and 1.87%, respectively. The results showed a good stability of UAE method.
