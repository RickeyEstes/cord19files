The theoretical model of the SARS-CoV S1 domain (PDB code: 1Q4Z) (Spiga et al., 2003) and the native crystal struc-ture of the human ACE2 extracellular domain (PDB code: 1R42) (Towler et al., 2004) were downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) and used as inputs to the fully automatic ZDOCK (Chen and Weng, 2003) server (http://zdock.bu.edu/) for protein docking computation. Relying on a composite scoring function combining pairwise shape complementarity with desolvation and electrostatics (Chen and Weng, 2003) , ZDOCK uses a fast Fourier transform based algorithm (Chen and Weng., 2002) to perform a global search in the translational and rotational space without the need for assumption about binding sites. As shown in previous critical assessment of prediction of interaction (CAPRI) challenge, ZDOCK is among the best for protein docking algorithms (Chen et al., 2003a,b) . But due to the difficulty of protein docking task, ZDOCK server, like other approaches, always generates multiple predictions ranked in descending order on the basis of scoring function for one target, and consequently the identification and Fig. 1 . Ribbon diagram of the SARS-CoV S1 (yellow)/ACE2 (blue) complex model (PDB code: 1XJP). The theoretical model of S1 domain (PDB code: 1Q4Z) and the native crystal structure of the human ACE2 extracellular domain (PDB code: 1R42) were downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB). This model was generated by the fully automatic ZDOCK protein-protein docking server and manually selected on the basis of structural biology knowledge. Table 1 The interacting residue pairs in the S1/ACE2 complex model S1 residue ACE2 residue Contact type Hydrogen bond ASP312 THR334 incorporation of crucial biological knowledge must play a significant role in the following manual inspection to choose the most likely complex model (Chen et al., 2003a,b) . In this case, a previous study derived from a homologous model of ACE2 (Prabakaran et al., 2004) has indicated that the distal ridge of this molecule was likely to participate in binding because there was no room for the S1 protein to associate with its receptor at the cellular membrane proximal face of the ACE2 ectodomain. Moreover, a recent research , suggesting that the S protein-binding site of ACE2 is topologically separated from its catalytic site that is surrounded by the two distal ridges, further strengthened this point of view. Furthermore, the previously identified RBD, especially the two key residues within this fragment, must be on the interface of selected complex model. In conclusion, our criteria for model selection is to choose the highest ranked prediction in agreement with the biological information mentioned above. Based on the criteria, the fourth model, out of 1000 predictions generated, was proposed as the best model ( Fig. 1) . Subsequently, interface forming residue graphical contacts (IFRgc) , which is a webbased tool integrated in the STING Millennium Suite (http://asparagin.cenargen.embrapa.br/SMS/), was used to identify and analyze amino acid contacts across protein interfaces within the proposed complex model. The resulting list of interacting residue pairs and their contact types are shown in Table 1 .
