2.1. Challenge model 2.1.1. Calf enrollment Calves used in this study were cared for in compliance with the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). This randomized, double-blinded study was performed at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) from February to March 2011. Thirty calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born. Control calves (n = 3) were enrolled concurrently with test calves (n = 30). At least one study author attended all calvings. The perineum of the dam was thoroughly cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent manure contamination. Immediately after birth, a physical examination was performed and an identification tag was placed in the right ear. All calves were fed 4 L of â‰¥50 g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG, Colostrum Replacement, Land O'Lakes Inc., St. Paul, MN) within the first 4 h of life via an oroesophageal feeding tube in order to replicate conventional calf management on commercial dairies as best as possible. Commercial colostrum replacer was fed instead of colostrum in order to minimize variability between calves, to limit potential pathogen exposure, and to provide adequate passive transfer of immunity without providing anti-Cryptosporidium specific antibodies. The calves were then transported from the source farm to Cornell University.
