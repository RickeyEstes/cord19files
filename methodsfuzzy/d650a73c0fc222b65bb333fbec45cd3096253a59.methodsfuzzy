Multiple NAAT methods are used in the diagnostic virology laboratory for the diagnosis of viral aetiologies of respiratory infections including PCR, RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), conventional Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, PCR coupled with mass spectrometry and microarrays. Of these techniques, RT-PCR is the most commonly employed qualitative method for detecting respiratory viruses.
