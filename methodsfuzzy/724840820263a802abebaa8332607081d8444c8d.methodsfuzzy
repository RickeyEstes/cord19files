Resuscitation mannequins fitted with lung models have been used extensively by Hui et al. to demonstrate the production and dissemination of exhaled plumes from oxygen masks or ventilation systems that may potentially disseminate infectious agents from the wearer. 46e51 The air flow was visualised with smoke particles illuminated by a laser light sheet. The buoyant exhaled plumes moved an average horizontal distance of 0.4e0.5 m. These results have led to some recommendations for the use of such respiratory support procedures to be avoided, which has in turn led to some controversy about the relative risk:benefit ratio of applying a potentially life-saving intervention that may subsequently result in secondary infections in healthcare staff and other patients nearby. 52, 53 Hui et al. do point out that their respiratory model has limitations and can only illustrate the movement of air. It cannot and does not attempt to estimate the actual number or sizes of particles that may carry potentially infectious organisms within such airflows. Therefore using these results to preclude the use of such potentially life-saving, respiratory support interventions is premature. More sophisticated thermal mannequins have been designed to mimic human skin temperatures and create the thermal body plume, as well as to produce buoyant, warm exhalation flows as an accurate model of normal human breathing. 54e56 These mannequins, originally developed for the study of advanced ventilation systems, have now been successfully adapted for the study of small particle and bioeffluent release from the body surface, e.g. the transport in the thermal plume above the person and exposure to other common, indoor, airborne contaminants. 57e59 For infection control purposes, these thermal mannequins have also helped to define the most effective ventilation modes to be used on hospital wards in order to reduce the potential for the cross-transmission of infectious agents potentially carried in exhaled air, between patients on neighbouring beds. 54, 55 These mannequins can be adapted to better understand the mechanisms involved with aerosol or airborne-transmitted infections. Such cross-infection is caused by the movement of airborne particles in the room airflow (particularly of droplet nuclei smaller than 5e10 mm) or by larger droplets settling at a short distance from the exhaling source. Droplet nuclei can be simulated with tracer gas released from the mannequin, e.g. CO 2 or N 2 O, because the settling velocity is very low (i.e. these particles may stay suspended in the air for a considerable time, e.g. 5 mm droplet nuclei have a settling velocity of 1 m/h). 53, 60, 61 A qualitative study of droplet nuclei movement can also be performed with a smoke tracer, as shown in Figure 1 . Airflow visualisation using tracer gas to simulate the smaller droplet nuclei, or particles used to simulate the larger droplets, has been performed in simulated hospital wards, where life-size, breathing, heated mannequins are placed in typical patient postures and smoke tracers are used to visualise the behaviour of their potential exhaled airflows. 54, 55, 62, 63 In addition, two or more thermal mannequins with heated skin surfaces and simulated respiratory functions have been used to study the behaviour of airflows and the potential for cross-infection between people ( Figure 1 ). 32, 59, 60, 64 Thermal mannequins have also been used to design and test personalised ventilation systems that could be built into seats in aircrafts and trains. These systems produce a jet of air which can protect against 'incoming' air potentially carrying infectious agents. This is a new and promising research area that requires thermal mannequins with respiratory functions because of the detailed level of life-size, human anatomical realism required. 65e72 A specialised version of such a personalised ventilation system, designed for use in hospital beds, has also been tested with a thermal mannequin and tracer gas. 55, 73, 74 The disadvantage of such systems is that they are only effective if patients remain in their beds, as such systems are not designed to be portable. Further work using such thermal, breathing mannequins is currently being conducted on the exhalation of suspended particles or droplets as a potential source of cross-infection in a hospital setting. 61 Although shortrange, large droplets (as opposed to long-range, small droplet nuclei) are often quoted as a major source and route of crossinfection in healthcare environments, this has been mainly inference and the actual visualisation of this phenomenon has not been performed convincingly. Thermal mannequins are versatile and can be used with lasers or with tracer gas. They have advantages and also some disadvantages (Table I) . Their thermal profile may in some cases not exactly mimic that of humans and they are generally unmoving, although moving mannequins with a certain prescribed range of movements are now commercially available, mainly for shop-front or in-store advertising purposes. The use of realistic, human-like mannequins for simulating exhaled airflows has mostly required some kind of particulate tracer, such as smoke particles. However, using potentially irritant particulates precludes their use with actual human volunteers. Although mannequins may mimic human respiratory airflows to a certain extent, the use of human volunteers adds an additional realism that can further enhance the understanding of the behaviour of human exhaled flows. One method of doing this that has become popular recently is the use of Schlieren imaging. 75e78 The Schlieren imaging technique is not new and has been known to science and engineering for many years. It has been used previously in an infection control context, particularly in the UK, by Clark et al. starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s and 1980s. 79e81 Clark et al. discovered by way of Schlieren imaging, for example, the escape of potentially contaminated air from neckline, cuffs, and ankles of surgical gowns and the backflow of air from microbiological safety cabinets (fume hoods) when switched off. Early work by Whyte and Shaw also used the technique to demonstrate the influence of the thermal plume generated by operating theatre lights. 82 Schlieren imaging relies on thermal differences in the air to refract a light beam in order to visualise airflows. No invasive or potentially irritant tracers are necessary, and human volunteers are required only to stand in front of a concave mirror and breathe (or talk, cough or sneeze) across the illuminating light beam that is directed at the centre of the mirror, to produce a real-time, visible image of their exhaled airflows and thermal plume. A simple embodiment of this instrument e actually the classical Foucault mirror test e is shown in Figure 2 . A small light source such as a light-emitting diode (LED) illuminates a precise, front-aluminised spherical mirror from its radius of curvature. The mirror is slightly offset to refocus the light below the LED. Beyond this focus a camera collects the beam to form an image which will be a uniform spot under ideal conditions. However, thermal disturbances in the air in front of the mirror e the test area e refract light rays such as the one shown by a dotted line in the diagram. By placing a knife-edge (razor blade) at the focus as shown, such refracted rays are stopped, and corresponding dark regions appear in the camera image. In this manner a Schlieren image is made up of illumination differences due to light refraction in the test area. 76 The most recent infectious disease experiments using the Schlieren technique have visualised airflows from human volunteers coughing, with and without wearing various face masks, in front of a large concave telescope mirror. These were designed as qualitative or semiquantitative visual aids to help infection control teams understand the patterns of such airflows and how they may contribute to the transmission of infectious agents from infected patients. Recent findings have demonstrated that the maximum airflow velocity in a human volunteer cough reached about 8 m/s, and also showed that both surgical and N95 face masks are effective in thwarting the escape of potentially infectious aerosols when worn by an infected individual. 35, 44, 45 More specifically, in these experiments, airflow visualisation demonstrated to what extent the wearing of face masks could contain or limit (either by barrier, or redirection and deceleration effects) the potential airborne dissemination of infection, using airflow as a surrogate marker of the potential extent of such spread. 35, 45 Figure 2 shows the basic Schlieren imaging set-up with images of a female volunteer coughing without a mask, then while wearing a surgical-type mask. The strong turbulent cough jet that penetrates forward into the room air without the mask is effectively stopped by the mask. Note that the expelled air is not contained, but is vented into the rising thermal plume of the subject. Thus the potential for contamination of the room air still exists (although there is likely to be a significant dilution of the infectious agent), but the direct threat of cough or sneeze plumes impinging on a nearby person is ameliorated. Further experiments are planned (by Tang et al. in Singapore) to demonstrate how airflows behave during other everyday scenarios, e.g. quiet breathing, sneezing and talking between two people. Depending on the size of the Schlieren mirror available, other types of airflow environments can be simulated and examined, e.g. interactions among passengers in taxis, buses, trains and airplanes. In addition, it is possible in some circumstances to quantitatively measure the velocity and volume of exhaled airflows visualised using Schlieren imaging, which can be achieved by combining the principle of particle image velocimetry (PIV) with the Schlieren optics. In this case the 'particles' are actually turbulent eddies within the exhaled airflows, so again, no seeding with actual (potentially irritant) particles is therefore required. 44, 83 This approach, which is still under development, requires flows that are both turbulent and refractive, as are the human cough and sneeze. Although Schlieren imaging visualises airflows associated with human volunteers without the need for tracer gas or particles, safety concerns preclude the use of high-intensity laser lighting (Table I) . From an analytical viewpoint, Schlieren images integrate three-dimensional flow information onto a single plane and also cannot be used in environments where there is insufficient temperature difference between the human exhalations and the surrounding air. Finally, the large, precise astronomical-quality mirror required for Schlieren imaging of airflows associated with humans is quite expensive.
