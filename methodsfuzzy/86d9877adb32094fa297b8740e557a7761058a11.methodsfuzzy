Different species of nematodes can be variable in their pathogenicity, seasonal and geographical distribution and susceptibility towards different anthelmintics. Therefore, the accurate diagnosis of infections and the detailed knowledge of which parasites are present in a particular geographical environment are of major importance. Such information directly supports parasite control strategies and is of relevance for investigations into parasite biology, ecology and epidemiology. In addition to commonly used coprodiagnostic methods, a number of biochemical and immunological approaches have been developed that aim at the specific diagnosis of infection. These methods are mainly based on the detection and measurement of parameters (e.g. detection of elevated serum pepsinogen and gastrin levels or circulating antibodies) that might be indicative of parasitic infections. A wide range of immunological methods, including those that are based on the detection of an immune response in an infected animals and those for the detection of parasite antigens, have been developed for the specific diagnosis of parasitic infections (e.g. Engvall and Ruitenberg, 1974; Fletcher, 1965; Ogunremi et al., 2008) . Based on the target molecule (antigen or antibody), such immunological methods can be classified as being either direct or indirect. Direct immunological methods are those that provide direct evidence of an infection and can be based on the detection of parasite antigens present in the circulation and/or excreta from infected hosts. Parasitic extracts have a complex composition and contain molecules which are sometimes shared by other parasites (Cohen and Sadun, 1976) . Shared antigenic composition of closely related parasite species is a challenge, particularly for nematodes, and often leads to cross-reactivity in immunological tests (Eysker and Ploeger, 2000; Noordin et al., 2005) . Also the presence of host materials associated with the parasite can complicate antigen purification and can interfere with the specificity of a diagnostic assay. Furthermore, the life-cycle stage of the parasite used as an antigen source can influence immuno-diagnostic results, as parasites undergo significant structural and biochemical changes during their development (Cohen and Sadun, 1976) . As an example, the antigenic composition of larval stages differs from that of adults (Williams and Soulsby, 1970) and can give rise to variations in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (McLaren et al., 1978) . Although limited research has been undertaken, to date, for livestock parasites, Johnson et al. (1996) described an immuno-diagnostic assay for the quantitative detection of excretory/secretory parasite antigens in host faeces (coproantigens). These authors evaluated the usefulness of this approach in a murine model system using Heligmosomoides polygyrus, a trichostrongyloid gastrointestinal nematode related to the common nematode species infecting ruminants. The authors also suggested that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was useful to specifically detect parasite antigens in the host faeces and might have potential to detect pre-patent infections and make large scale, rapid screening possible. The diagnostic performance of the assay was promising under experimental conditions, but cross-reactivity, faecal 299 Next-Generation Molecular-Diagnostic Tools components interfering with the reactivity and the loss of antigens in faeces have been reported (Johnson et al., 1996) . Indirect immunological methods are usually based on the detection of anti-parasite antibodies or cell-mediated immune responses in infected hosts. A variety of methods have been developed and applied to the diagnosis of nematode infections, such as the complement fixation test, indirect immunofluorescence, indirect haemagglutination and ELISA, of which the latter has been most commonly used (Doenhoff et al., 2004) . However, parasitic helminths possess a huge variety of antigens, and there is limited information on which stages and antigens are actually responsible for eliciting immune responses (Berghen et al., 1993) . Antibody detection from serum has several disadvantages, including that it cannot distinguish between a current and past infection, which is a major challenge when evaluating the effects of chemotherapy, does often not reflect infection intensity and sometimes achieves poor specificity, particularly in disease-endemic areas (Doenhoff et al., 2004) . The detection of anti-Ostertagia antibodies in the serum of cattle has been found to be useful for epidemiological and cross-sectional studies, but only of limited utility for diagnosis on an individual animal basis (Berghen et al., 1993) . Although anti-Ostertagia antibodies are detectable in milk samples by ELISA, there are also some limitations to this approach (Charlier et al., 2010) . The response to parasitic infections is variable among host individuals, and it has been shown that serum antibody levels can be influenced by factors, such as milk yield, season, mastitis, the number of pregnancies of a cow, stage of lactation and genetic constitution (Gasbarre et al., 1993; Kloosterman et al., 1993; Sanchez et al., 2004) . Also the use of bulk milk samples has been investigated, which has the advantage of being an inexpensive and user-friendly approach (Charlier et al., 2010) . However, bulk milk samples taken only a few weeks apart can show significant variation in test results, depending on calving patterns, number of cows contributing to the milk in a tank (i.e. dilution effect) and their relative milk yields (Pritchard, 2001 ). Clearly, traditional methods (reviewed in Section 6) have limitations, in terms of sensitivity and/or specificity. In addition, they can be time consuming and costly to carry out. Advances in molecular biological technologies have enabled the development of new, sensitive and specific diagnostic methods that have found applications in the field of veterinary parasitology. The ability to specifically identify and study parasites (irrespective of lifecycle stage) using such tools has provided new insights into parasite systematics, population genetics, ecology and epidemiology, and has important implications for the specific diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitic diseases (Gasser, 2006) . In particular, methods that rely on the enzymatic amplification of nucleic acids can overcome some of the limitations of traditional approaches (Gasser, 2006) . Techniques that employ the PCR (Mullis et al., 1986; Saiki et al., 1988) can selectively amplify in vitro target DNA sequences from complex genomes or matrices and have led to advances in many areas of the biological sciences. PCR involves the heat denaturation of doublestranded DNA, followed by a decrease in temperature to allow oligonucleotide primers to bind (¼anneal) to their complementary sequence on sense and antisense strands of the target template. Then, the temperature is increased again to enhance the enzymatic activity of a thermostable DNA polymerase, which extends the complementary strands from the primer sites. These synthesis steps are usually repeated 20-40 times in an automated thermal cycler, resulting in an exponential increase in target DNA copies. The major advantage of this methodology is that it enables the study of parasite DNA from minute amounts of template, which would otherwise be insufficient for conventional analysis. The value of this technology in the field of diagnostic veterinary parasitology lies in its ability to specifically identify parasites, detect infection and analyse genetic variation, which are particularly important, given the increasing problems of AR in parasitic nematodes (Gasser, 2006; Gasser et al., 2008) . to assess the composition of strongylid nematode populations in sheep with naturally acquired infections Roeber et al. (2011) critically evaluated the performance of the RT-PCR method (Bott et al., 2009) for the diagnosis of naturally acquired strongylid nematode infections in sheep (n ¼ 470; in a temperate climatic zone of south-eastern Australia), using a panel of 100 'negative control' samples from sheep known not to harbour parasitic helminths. The authors compared the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this RT-PCR assay with a conventional faecal flotation method. They also established a system to rank the contribution of particular strongylid nematodes to the FECs from 'mixed infections' in individual sheep. The testing of faecal samples revealed that Te. circumcincta (80%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (66%) were most prevalent, followed by C. ovina (33%), O. venulosum (28%) and H. contortus (1%). For most sheep tested in this study, Te. circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. represented the largest proportion of strongylid eggs in faecal samples from individual sheep. This was the first large-scale prevalence survey of gastrointestinal nematodes in live sheep utilizing a molecular tool. The ability to rapidly rank strongylid nematodes according to their contribution to mixed infections represents a major advantage over routine flotation methods. The conclusion from this study was that this RT-PCR tool might be able to replace the conventional technique of LC. This assessment showed that the RT-PCR assay achieved high diagnostic sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%), and the test results were in 'good' agreement (i.e. Kappa: 0.95) with those achieved using conventional faecal flotation. In addition, of 53 field samples which were test-negative based on coproscopy, 23 tested positive by PCR for one or more target nematodes (a result which was confirmed by sequencing), demonstrating better sensitivity of the molecular approach compared with coproscopic examination, and reinforcing that microscopy is not an adequate reference technique (i.e. is an imperfect gold standard; cf. Conraths and Schares, 2006) for the detailed assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic assay. The results achieved demonstrated that the prevalences of key genera/species, such as Te. circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp., known to be the dominant species infecting sheep in the winter rainfall environment of Victoria, Australia, were largely in accordance with information available in the published literature (e.g. Anderson, 1972 Anderson, , 1973 . The application of an ordinal ranking system to estimate the contribution of individual parasites to observed FEC results showed that these genera/species were also responsible for the largest proportion of strongylid eggs in the faecal samples tested. Although known to be abundant in winter rainfall environments, C. ovina and O. venulosum were found at high prevalence (33.6% and 28.7%, respectively). An unexpected finding was that O. venulosum was the main contributor to the observed FEC results for one of nine farms tested, which has important implications for the interpretation of FECs and anthelmintic control. According to common practice (Brightling, 1988) , FEC results of !200 EPG are considered to relate to a 'significant' worm burden, and without further considerations of the species present and their reproductive capacity, give an indication for anthelmintic treatment. This common practice, which involves frequent and, in many cases, unnecessary or excessive administration of anthelmintic drugs can promote AR development in gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep and other hosts, as recent evidence has shown (Kaplan, 2004; Wolstenholme et al., 2004) . Given that O. venulosum is recognized to be less pathogenic than most strongylids of the upper alimentary tract (Donald et al., 1978) but has high fecundity (Gordon, 1981) , FEC results (e.g. >200 EPG) in which O. venulosum is the sole or main contributor would be misinterpreted, and sheep harbouring this relatively non-pathogenic would be treated unnecessarily. Therefore, the specific/generic identification of infecting nematodes assists the interpretation of FEC results and, subsequently, treatment decisions, thus, directly contributing to efforts of preserving the efficacy of currently available anthelmintics. The RT-PCR assay (Roeber et al., 2011) , coupled to conventional coproscopy, and the microscopic detection of Nematodirus, Trichuris and Moniezia eggs in faecal samples revealed that the majority of sheep investigated were parasitized by two to four helminth taxa per animal. Data from this study provided new and important insights into the composition and distribution of nematodes, which would not have been achievable in such detail using any of the currently used coprological methods. The results indicated that this tool should be applicable in other climatic regions and/or major sheep producing countries in the world. Depending on the nematode species infecting sheep in a particular climatic zone, minor modifications could be made to the molecular assay to adapt it for the diagnosis of infections with other important parasites (e.g. hookworm or lungworm) and to provide opportunities to study their biology, prevalence and distributions. For instance, as the life cycles of some lungworms, such as Muellerius capillaris and Protostrongylus rufescens, involve invertebrate intermediate hosts, such as snails and slugs, an adapted RT-PCR assay could be used to examine the prevalence and relative intensity of these parasites in their intermediate hosts and to study their ecology. The ability to identify helminth species and to rank them according to their contribution to FEC results (Roeber et al., 2011) represents a novel approach that is time-and cost-efficient compared with classical diagnostic techniques and enables a better interpretation of FEC results, particularly in relation to the anthelmintic treatment of infected sheep (cf. McKenna, 1996 (cf. McKenna, , 1997 . This advance in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal nematode infections could directly and significant contribute to enhanced parasite control. 9.4. Assessment of RT-PCR to replace larval culture (LC) and to support conventional faecal egg count reduction testing (FECRT) of sheep Roeber et al. (2012a) assessed the RT-PCR assay to support the diagnosis of AR in nematodes, in conjunction with conventional FECRT; in addition, a direct comparison of PCR results with those of LC and selective total worm counts (TWCs; considered a 'gold standard') was undertaken. In this assessment, the molecular assay achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87.5% in relation to TWC. These percentages where similar to those achieved previously (Roeber et al., 2011) (diagnostic sensitivity 98% and specificity 100% in relation to FEC), demonstrating that the RT-PCR assay consistently achieved a high diagnostic performance. DNA sequencing results also demonstrated that this molecular assay had a better sensitivity than the routinely used TWC method and, together with FECRT, was of practical value for the detection of albendazole resistance in Te. circumcincta and T. colubriformis populations. However, although the PCR test results were in accordance with TWC, the direct comparison of molecular and LC results showed markedly different findings, depending on the recommended measurements used for larval differentiation (Dikmans and Andrews, 1933; Gordon, 1933; McMurtry et al., 2000) . Using the morphometric criteria given by Dikmans and Andrews (1933) , the majority of L3s from the LC of the albendazole treated group of sheep were identified as Trichostrongylus, whereas, using the measurements recommended by Gordon (1933) and McMurtry et al. (2000) , the same larvae were identified as Teladorsagia. This discrepancy emphasizes the complications and errors associated with the use of LC, which can readily lead to misinterpretations as to which nematodes are resistant to a particular drug. Overall, this study (Roeber et al., 2012a) demonstrated clearly that the molecular assay coupled to FECRT provides a rapid, efficient and universally applicable tool for the diagnosis of AR and the early detection of residual populations of worms in sheep following treatment. Future studies should be conducted to test sheep on different farms and the response of gastrointestinal nematodes to the treatment with other main groups of anthelmintics, such as imidazothiazoles/tetrahydropyrimidines or MLs, and also the newly developed monepantel (Zolvix, Novartis) (Kaminsky et al., 2008) . The movement of sheep and their gastrointestinal parasites between or among farms favours the spread of drug resistance (Blouin et al., 1995) . Therefore, the routine use of the RT-PCR assay, in conjunction with FECRT, could provide a universally applicable method to test sheep before transport to and/or introduction on to a new farm, in order to reduce the spread of drug-resistant populations of nematodes. In addition, the assay allows the identification of sheep shedding large numbers of parasite eggs in faeces and, in conjunction with information about the infecting helminth species, can be used to support 'targeted, selective treatment' approaches (Kenyon et al., 2009) . Such a strategy focuses on treating only sheep that will benefit most from an anthelmintic treatment, whereas sheep with low-intensity infections remain untreated to provide refugia for the dilution of resistance genes within a parasite population. Furthermore, the present RT-PCR assay had a similar or improved sensitivity compared with postmortem diagnosis, thus being able to replace the latter. In practice, this means that the presence of particular species/genera and their prevalence can be assessed reliably without the need to kill sheep.
