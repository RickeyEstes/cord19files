Production and analysis of the immature virus particles Aedes albopictus cells (clone C6/36) were grown on microcarriers (Cytodex 2, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Upsala, Sweden)' in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (D-MEM) buffered with 25 mNI HEPES and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Cells were infected with MVE virus (strain Ord River) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 in D-MEM with 29/o FCS. Ammonium chloride (25 m/M) was added at 48 hr postinfection (p.i.) and the viruses were harvested on Day 6. At this time, ammonium chloride-containing medium was replaced with D-MEM, 2% FCS, without ammonium chloride, and the viruses were reharvested on Day 9 p.i. Viruses were precipitated with 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), purified by two cycles of glycerol-tartrate gradients (Obijeski et al., 1976) , and resuspended in 0.3 ml of D-MEM. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Untreated MVE viruses (without ammonium chloride) were propagated and purified as described above and were used as positive controls in all experiments. For the acid resistance experiments (see below) MVE viruses were also grown in SW1 3 mammalian cells in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. To quantify the amount of viral structural proteins in each propagation, the purified viruses were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acryamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) and proteins were stained using a rapid silver stain kit (ICN, Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Gels were scanned by a microprocessor-controled spectrophotometer (Gilford System 2600) and the peaks corresponding to each viral protein were identified and integrated to determine areas under the peaks, and the area ratios of prM to E were calculated.
