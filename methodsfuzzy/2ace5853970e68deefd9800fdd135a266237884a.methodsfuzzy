The IgG of mAb 1C3 was purified using HiTrapTM protein G HP (Figure 6a ). The IFA method was optimized for the detection of the TGEV M protein. At 36 h, TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (10 3 TCID 50 ) were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 30 min at 4 • C. Then, the cells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 37 • C for 1 h. The optimum concentration of the primary antibody (purified 1C3 IgG) was 1 ng/µL, and the dilution of the secondary antibody was 1:500. The IFA detected green fluorescence in the TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Figure 6b ). To further validate whether 1C3 react with PEDV, IFA was used. As shown in Figure 6b , 1C3 did not react with the PEDV.
