ISEM methods in this review include all the techniques where the "solid phase principle" is essential in a way similar to other solid phase immun-oassays. For the sake of simplicity and uniformity, we propose to replace the older names and acronyms by new ones (see Table I ). Thus the Derrick technique (Derrick, 1973) will be named the antibodycoated grid technique (AB-CGT), the method of Shukla and Gough (1979) the protein A-coated grid technique (PA-CGT), the method of Katz et al. (1980) using protein A containing S. aureus bacteria the protein A-coated bacteria technique (PA-CBT), and the "decoration" technique as proposed by Milne and Luisoni (1975) the antigen-coated grid technique (AG-CGT). Milne and Luisoni (1975) ; (3) Derrick and Brlansky (1976); (4) Milne and Luisoni (1977a) ; (5) Milne andLesemann (1978); (6) Roberts and Harrison (1979) ; (7) Shukla and Gough (1979); (8) ; (9) Lesemann and Paul (1980) ; (10) van Regenmortel et al.
