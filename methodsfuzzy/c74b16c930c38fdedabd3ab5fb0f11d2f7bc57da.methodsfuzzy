Patients and definition of severe H1N1 influenza A In total, 21 adult patients who were admitted in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and confirmed by the positive results of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 RNA detected by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were included in this analysis. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed by extraction of total RNA from throat swab samples and reverse transcription to cDNA, followed by amplification of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 RNA as described elsewhere [13] . The severe form of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus infection was defined based on the criteria set by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China [14] . Briefly, based on the positive results in the amplification of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 RNA, a patient who met at least one of the following features: (1) sustained high fever (>39 â€¢ C) more than 3 days, accompanied severe toxemia, (2) severe cough accompanied purulent and/or bloody sputum, with or without chest pain, (3) increasing respiratory frequency, dyspnea and cyanosis, (4) lethargy, agitation, and/or convulsion, (5) severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, (6) pneumonia confirmed by chest X-ray or CT scanning, (7) rapid elevation of creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme and other myocardial enzymes, (8) respiratory failure, (9) septic shock, (10) multiple organ dysfunction, and (11) other severe clinical conditions requiring intensive care treatment, was preliminarily defined with severe H1N1 influenza. The final diagnosis was established after the exclusion of other known causes for above conditions. This study was approved by the institutional ethics review committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
