Thanks to the advances in molecular biology -especially the development of next generation HTS methods -virus discovery techniques became extremely sensitive and VIDISCA-454 (the method developed in our laboratory) is not an exception (de Vries et al., 2011 (de Vries et al., , 2012 . The load of HPV-A2619 was determined by real time PCR, and only 200 copies per 100 Î¼l (input in VIDISCA) were measured. This sensitivity is remarkable and might be related to the nature of the virus. HPVs carry a double stranded DNA genome and their detection by VIDISCA-454 does not depend on reverse transcription and second strand synthesis, procedures which decrease the detection potential of RNA viruses. With state of the art HTS based virus discovery techniques and the possibility to obtain such a huge number of sequences from a clinical sample, the identification of novel viruses became very effective, and nowadays the detection of low load viruses is not uncommon since minority nucleic acids can be efficiently sequenced (Mokili et al., 2012; Cotten et al., 2014) . These methods are exclusively based on random sequencing of nucleic acids and they do not provide further information beyond the recognition of viral genetic material in a clinical sample, which does not necessarily correlate with the presence of a pathogen in the sample. In fact, some of these sequences might be derived from contaminating viruses introduced during the sampling or the sample processing procedures (Naccache et al., 2013) . It is therefore important to confirm the presence of the recognized viruses in the original sample and to investigate the clinical relevance of every discovery to avoid drawing false conclusions. With the development of HTS techniques the experimental time needed to discover novel viruses has dramatically reduced. However, targeted experiments and careful evaluation of all available data are essential to assess the relevance of every finding and to determine the role of every identified virus, since -as we show here -the mere identification of a virus is not sufficient to prove its involvement in a disease. This is especially true when dealing with body parts which are contiguous with the external environment -like the respiratory tract -and therefore more subjected to the presence of bystander or non-host-specific microorganisms.
