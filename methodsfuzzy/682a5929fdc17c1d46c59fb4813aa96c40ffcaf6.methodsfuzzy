Plasmids. The expression cDNAs used in this study were generated by PCR and cloning into pEGFP-C2 and pECFP-C1 (Clontech) (which express the fusion protein C-terminal of enhanced green and cyan fluorescence proteins, respectively), utilizing non-templated restriction sites in sequence specific primers [14, 23] . The plasmids generated were; pECFP-SARSCoV-NIIAB, pECFP-SARSCoV-NIIBC, pEGFP-SARSCoV-NIIA, pEGFP-SARSCoV-NIIB and pEGFP-SARSCoV-NII. The potential NES in SARS-CoV N protein was deleted by overlapping PCR using primers NewNESfor and NewNESrev (details of primers available on request). All constructs were verified by sequencing in both directions and Western blot (data not shown). Transfection and imaging. Cos7 cells were grown and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously [20, 23] . Live-cell imaging was performed on a Nikon Eclipse TS 100 microscope utilising the appropriate filter for EGFP and ECFP. Fluorescence and bright-field images were captured. Cells were processed for confocal microscopy as described [14, 23] .
