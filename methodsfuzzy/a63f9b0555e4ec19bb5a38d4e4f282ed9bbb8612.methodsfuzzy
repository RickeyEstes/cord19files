Most computational studies of lincRNAs rely on RNA-Seq results initially, with quality-control filtering steps to remove reads arising from spurious background noise [24] . Additional steps should be taken involving the removal of protein coding genes and small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. Methods to do such removals include ORF detection [1, 9, 16, 25] , BLAST to identify homologs of protein coding genes [25] , domain based searches such as Pfam [9, 25] , and predictions of coding potential based on nucleotide substitution frequencies given sequences from multiple species. The Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) [26] and iSeeRNA [27] programs are popular choices in determining coding potential. However, the extent to which some lincRNAs may be hosts of smaller RNA species such as microRNAs requires further study [28] . Another selection criterion is the number of exons in a transcript. Most of the exons (about 80 % in human) are less than 200 bp [29] , the minimum length requirement of lincRNA by definition. Transcripts with only one exon are less likely to be lincRNAs. Additionally, the number of exons can be used as an indicator of transcript quality. Multi-exonic transcripts are less likely to result from spurious transcription and genomic noise. The presence of introns is also indicative of robust and consistent transcription boundaries. Introns have less frequent terminal repeats and transposable elements in comparison to intergenic regions, suggesting that lincRNAs have additional conservation in splicing [30] . Finally, the axiomatic length-based filter, 200 bp, eliminates any non-coding sequences that fall into the current small RNA categories [31] . The filtering steps described above are often implemented through a pipeline with a series of cut-offs or a decision tree to interrogate multiple features involved in classifying lincRNAs [24] . In recent years, machine learning based classification approaches have been used to detect lincRNAs [17, 27, [32] [33] [34] . For example, iSeeRNA interrogated coding potential based on a variety of factors mentioned above, in addition to nucleotide composition. It was trained to differentiate protein coding genes and lncRNAs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 [27] . LncRNA-MFDL is another tool that uses a deep learning method and the fusion of multiple features to classify lincRNAs with an accuracy of 97.1 % [34] . There have been many attempts to computationally identify the function of lincRNAs. Given the length of lincRNA sequences and the complexity of their potential 3D structures along with the RNA and protein partners, this is a very challenging task. We review the different computational approaches in the following.
