Multiple studies have demonstrated that surfaces in hospital rooms are poorly cleaned during terminal cleaning. Although methods of assessing the adequacy of cleaning varied (ie, visibly clean, adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence, fluorescent dye, aerobic plate counts), several studies have demonstrated that <50% of room surfaces were properly cleaned. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Several reviews have concluded that improved cleaning leads to reductions in HAI. 11, 19 However, there is a paucity of high-quality studies demonstrating that improved cleaning and disinfection reduces HAIs. 20,21 Importantly, the studies that have assessed interventions to improve cleaning have reported that after the intervention, approximately 5%-30% of surfaces remain potentially contaminated. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Because of the demonstrated failure of interventions to achieve consistent and high rates of cleaning and disinfection of room surfaces, new no touch methods of room disinfection have been developed. The most promising no touch methods use either UV light devices or hydrogen peroxide systems. [22] [23] [24]
