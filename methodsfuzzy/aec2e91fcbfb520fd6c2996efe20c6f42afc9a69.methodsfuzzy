All data were analyzed using the SAS version 9 statistical software. As most of the statistical tests were performed one-sided, p values Â£ 0.025 indicate statistical significance. If not indicated otherwise, deviations are indicated as standard error of the mean (SEM). All efficacy analyses were performed with the pooled data set (see Statistical analyses). In the analysis of the pooled data the primary end point of ARhiSi-2 was evaluated using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A difference of one score point in MSS between the treatment groups was prospectively (in analogy to ARhiSi-2) judged to be clinically relevant. All secondary end points were analyzed exploratively. Categorical variables were tested by the chi-squared test. Continuous data were analyzed by ANCOVA similarly to the primary end point or by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Baseline values were compared between treatment groups and tested by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test (continuous variables) or chi-squared test (categorical test).
