The study experiments were carried out in the Agricultural School of Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, on a brood of chickens. The strain name of NDV was IR/IRK 1 /2013, and its molecularand-pathological characterization was carried out in RAZI institute, Karaj, Iran. Virulence type of the NDV in this study was velogenic strains and NDV tropism was viscerotropism, which mainly affects the respiratory system. The Avian Influenza virus in this study was H9N2. Fourteen-day old Ross 308 chickens were divided into four groups of 60 and each group was kept in a separate room. The first group was considered as control samples. The second, third and fourth group were infected by using Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza, respectively by eye drops (0.1 cc for each eye). Fig. 1 shows the chickens and virus infection. ND, BV and AI infection were verified using the RT-PCR test and virus isolation from infected tissues simultaneous with clinical signs. In this paper, RT-PCR was done using protocol 2 which has been described by Capua and Alexander for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease (Capua and Alexander, 2009 ). The first five minutes of recordings were not taken into account during the sound analysis because the behavior of the chickens might have been effected by the operator during the holding them inside of 50 cm 3 cubes. In order to obtain sound features of chickens and detecting disease without any surrounding noises all samples (chickens) put in the box. (Microphone specifications: 9.7 Â 6.7 mm diameter, less than 2.2 kX impedance, 100-16 kHz frequency, and À58 dB ± 3 dB sensitivity). Recordings were saved in the ''wav" format and signals in time domain were transformed into the frequency and time-frequency domains and analyzed in Matlab Ò 2015a (the Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). A total number of 720 sound signals were collected from 240 samples in two consecutive days after virus infection. Fig. 2 represents the proposed algorithm for diagnosing the avian Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza based on their sound signals. Based on Fig. 2 , the chicken's sound signals are firstly transferred to frequency and time-frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform. The next stage is Data-Mining part, which is consists of feature extraction and feature selection. After Data-mining stage, the SVM classifier will be trained and evaluated in diagnosing the diseases. The outputs of SVM based on frequency and time-frequency signals were considered as evidences of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, and finally the disease will be detected by the model.
