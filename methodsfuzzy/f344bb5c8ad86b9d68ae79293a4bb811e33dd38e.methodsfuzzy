The Winthrop-University Hospital ED used rapid influenza (QuickVue A/B) tests to screen for H1N1 infection. Patients who were rapid influenza A test-positive were also reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1. In our ED, 30% of patients with ILIs and possible H1N1 pneumonia had negative rapid influenza A screening tests. Because H1N1 RT-PCR testing was restricted, there was no laboratory test to confirm or rule out H1N1. Other rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), e.g., the respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel test, were used to identify H1N1 patients with negative RIDTs. RESULTS: Unfortunately, there was not a good correlation between RIDT results and RT-PCR results. There was a critical need to develop a clinical syndromic approach for diagnosing hospitalized adults with probable H1N1 pneumonia with negative RIDTs. Early in the pandemic, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed a diagnostic weighted point score system to diagnose H1N1 pneumonia clinically in RIDT-negative adults. The point score system worked well, but was timeconsuming. As the ''herald wave'' of the pandemic progressed, our ED staff needed a rapid, simplified method to diagnose probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs. A rapid and simplified diagnosis was based on the diagnostic weighted point score system, which we simplified into a triad of key, nonspecific laboratory indicators. In adults hospitalized with an ILI, a fever >102 F with severe myalgias, and a chest x-ray without focal segmental/lobar infiltrates, the presence of three indicators, i.e., otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, elevated serum transaminases, and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase, constituted the diagnostic swine influenza triad. The Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic swine flu triad was used effectively as the pandemic progressed, and was not only useful in correctly diagnosing probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs, but was also in ruling out mimics of swine influenza, e.g., exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, or congestive heart failure, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs), e.g., legionnaire's disease. T he H1N1 pandemic began in Vera Cruz, Mexico, and rapidly spread to the United States and throughout the world. New York was the initial epicenter of the H1N1 pandemic in the United States. 1,2 At Winthrop-University Hospital, like other area hospitals, we were inundated with individuals seeking H1N1 diagnostic testing. These individuals were tested and evaluated in our Emergency Department (ED). Patients who were ill and who required hospitalization were admitted via the ED. The H1N1 virus is a genetic reassortment of four influenza A viruses, i.e., swine influenza, human seasonal influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian swine influenza. Because the H1N1 virus is an influenza A virus, it was hoped that the screening tests used for human seasonal influenza A would be positive in H1N1 infections. In our ED, early in the pandemic, it became apparent that patients who tested positive using the rapid influenza (Quick Vue A/B) test, as well as other influenza diagnostic tests, e.g., the respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel, were frequently negative in clinically obvious cases of H1N1 pneumonias. 2,3 A definitive laboratory diagnosis was possible only with the H1N1 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test developed by the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and distributed to state health departments. Positive results with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) correlated fairly well with RT-PCR positivity for H1N1. Patients admitted through the ED who were RIDT-positive were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. However, the real problem involved hospitalized adults who were RIDT-negative. Clinicians were unclear regarding the clinical presentation and laboratory manifestations of H1N1 pneumonias. It was difficult to determine which patients who presented at the ED with an influenza-like illness (ILI) had H1N1 pneumonias. Because RT-PCR testing was restricted by the Health Department, it became very difficult to rule out H1N1 pneumonias in hospitalized adults. The inability to rapidly diagnose or rule out H1N1 presented great difficulties from both an infection control and infectious disease prospective. Because the RT-PCR test was not always available, or if it was performed, the results were not available in a timely fashion, we were faced with an inability to discontinue precautions and oseltamivir therapy. 4 Patients with ILIs and shortness of breath, lowgrade fevers, exacerbations of asthma, chronic bronchitis, or congestive heart failure (CHF), as well as those presenting with bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs), were not easily differentiated in the ED from patients with actual H1N1 influenza pneumonia. As of July 2009, there were two acceptable ways to diagnose H1N1 pneumonias. Firstly, there were the adult patients hospitalized with ILIs and a positive RIDT. The H1N1 pandemic began at the end of the human seasonal influenza season. There was initial concern that both strains would be circulating in the community simultaneously. This proved not to be the case. The H1N1 pandemic strain quickly became not only the predominant circulating strain, but the only influenza strain in late spring and early summer 2009. Therefore, adult hospitalized patients with ILIs and a positive rapid influenza A screening test predicted RT-PCR positive, and were considered to have H1N1 pneumonia. Results of respiratory FA viral panel testing did not correlate with either rapid influenza A or RT-PCR positivity. The respiratory FA viral panel was initially used in hospitalized adults with negative rapid influenza A testing to improve the diagnostic yield of swine influenza (H1N1) pending RT-PCR testing. Unfortunately, as the numbers of hospitalized patients with possible swine influenza (H1N1) continued to increase, Health Department restrictions on testing hampered infection-control efforts to make appropriate recommendations regarding influenza precautions and oseltamivir prophylaxis. During the ''herald wave'' of the H1N1 pandemic, it became apparent that even RT-PCR testing was not always positive in cases that were clearly H1N1 on a clinical basis. 4 It became known that even in fatal cases, RT-PCR testing could be negative, but RT-PCR testing of lung specimens from autopsies were RT-PCR positive for swine influenza (H1N1). To deal with the problem of hospitalized patients with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed a diagnostic weighted point score system to identify patients with swine influenza (H1N1) clinically. Because of restricted (H1N1) RT-PCR testing, in late July, the Centers for Disease Control finally adopted a new classification of definite/probable H1N1, because of restricted RT-PCR testing. 5 The clinical criteria for swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia, as developed by the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division, were for hospitalized adults manifesting an ILI, with a fever >102 F, with severe myalgias, and an admission chest x-ray (CXR) without focal segmental/lobar infiltrates. In addition, these patients had a variety of nonspecific abnormalities. These abnormalities included relative lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), and elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), among others. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point system to diagnose H1N1 pneumonia was based on proven, i.e., RT-PCR-positive, hospitalized adult patients with SI (H1N1) pneumonia. By basing our diagnostic weighted point system on known cases, it was possible to develop a clinical syndromic diagnosis that www.heartandlung.org 79 became the basis of presumptive diagnoses of H1N1 pneumonia. 6 Also critically important in the definition was a CXR on admission without focal segmental lobar infiltrates. Most hospitalized adult patients with H1N1 pneumonia had clear CXRs, and a CXR was also critical in ruling out mimics of swine influenza pneumonia in patients with ILIs. The CXR was invaluable in diagnosing the common conditions likely to be confused with swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia. Those common conditions include exacerbations of asthma, chronic bronchitis, and CHF. Bacterial pneumonias were easily recognized because of their appearance on CXRs, i.e., a focal segmental or lobar infiltrates. In addition to the nonspecific laboratory tests mentioned above, other laboratory tests were performed. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels, serum ferritin levels, and serum phosphorus levels were obtained in admitted adults with ILIs when the differential diagnosis included H1N1 pneumonia. [6] [7] [8] [9] Early in the swine influenza pandemic, every case of possible H1N1 pneumonia with negative RIDTs was reviewed by the Infectious Disease Division to validate the diagnostic weighted point score system, and to determine which patients had probable diagnosis of swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia requiring influenza precautions and oseltamivir therapy. The Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs provided a presumptive clinical diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia (Table I) . 6 As the number of cases continued to increase in the early days of summer, it was realized that the diagnostic weighted point score system, while providing a reasonably accurate presumptive clinical diagnosis, was too time-consuming. Therefore, we simplified the diagnostic point score system to contain only the key diagnostic features that could provide a rapid clinical presumptive diagnosis in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs, that could be used easily by clinicians. Accordingly, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed the diagnostic swine influenza triad, based on key elements of the previously developed diagnostic weighted point score system. The H1N1 diagnostic triad became the basis of the presumptive clinical diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia during the pandemic at Winthrop-University Hospital (Table II) . We present a case of fatal H1N1 pneumonia in an immunocompetent adult who was rapid influenza A test-negative, respiratory FA viral panel-negative, and RT-PCR H1N1-negative. The presumptive clinical diagnosis in this case was rapidly achieved using the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic swine influenza triad.
