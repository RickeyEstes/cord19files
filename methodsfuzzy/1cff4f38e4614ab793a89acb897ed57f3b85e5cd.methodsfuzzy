The current study included 2 distinct trials involving both laboratory and field experiments. The first study was a vaccine challenge study against IBV carried out in vivo on 70 conventional broiler chicks divided into 7 different groups. The program of the vaccination was based on the combination of the 2 different vaccines strains, H120 and CR88, and was evaluated by the protection level conferred against an experimental challenge using a local IBV variant strain. The second study was a field study conducted on commercial broiler chicken flocks. A vaccination schedule included the CR88 vaccine with the H120 strain and was applied on 4 different flocks, where 1 flock was vaccinated only with the H120 strain as a control flock.
