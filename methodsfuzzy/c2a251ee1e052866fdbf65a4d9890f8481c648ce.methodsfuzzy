In addition to RSV and HMPV RT-PCR, respiratory viral diagnosis for multiple respiratory viruses was performed on BAL specimens from preand post-HCT recipients according to institutional protocol. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, adenovirus, and RSV as well as RSV shell vial cultures were performed on BAL samples between 2006 and 2011 as described in a previously published protocol [10] . HMPV DFA testing was performed on BAL specimens from February 2008 through 2011. BAL samples were also assessed for a broad range of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens using standard culture and staining methods as well as the aspergillus galactomannan assay [11, 12] . RT-PCR was performed on BAL, nasal-wash, and sera specimens according to a previously published protocol [13] . Briefly, total nucleic acids were obtained from 200 mL of each BAL or nasal-wash sample by adding 400 mL lysis buffer. After incubation for 10 minutes at 60 C, 600 mL of isopropanol was added and the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 Ã‚ g for 15 minutes. The pellets were washed with 1 mL 70% ethanol and suspended in 200 mL RNAse free water. One-step RT-PCR reaction mixtures (TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were prepared using primers and probes targeting HMPV A/B and an internal control or RSV A/B and an internal control as previously published [13] . The reactions were performed and analyzed in a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 30 minutes at 48 C and 10 minutes at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 C and 1 minute at 60 C. Sera extractions were performed using the QIAamp RNA Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) as previously reported and provided a sensitivity of 200 copies/mL for a cut-off of 10 copies per reaction [14] . Cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads (copies/mL) of each virus using stored standard curves made of RNA transcripts.  Statistical comparisons were performed using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables (as appropriate), and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for continuous variables. The probability of survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hypoxemia. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for death by day 100 and virus-related death at day 100. Hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation occurring after diagnosis were analyzed as timedependent variables. All reported P values were 2-sided and considered significant if P < .05. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
