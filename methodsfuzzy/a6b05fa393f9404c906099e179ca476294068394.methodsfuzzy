Media and strains. Bacterial growth, plating experiments, and preparations of Sf6 phage stocks were all completed in Lysogeny broth (LB). Bacteriophage Sf6 (clear plaque mutant [33] ) was propagated on ompA -C -S. flexneri (dual ompA and ompC gene knock out), as previously described [25] . Phage used for in vitro genome ejection experiments were stored in phage buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6 and 10 mM MgCl 2 ) and phage used for BLI experiments were stored in NaOAc buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0 and 2 mM MgCl 2 ). S. flexneri strain PE577 was used for phage plating experiments [22] .

The initial concentration of purified OmpA-TM was determined using a Bradford assay. We then created 0.2 mg/mL stock solutions, ran a portion of each on a 15% SDS gel, and quantified the resulting bands by gel densitometry (BIORAD Gel Doc XR+) as previously described [23] to ensure that the final concentration of variant OmpA-TM dilutions were identical to OmpA-TM S.flex .
