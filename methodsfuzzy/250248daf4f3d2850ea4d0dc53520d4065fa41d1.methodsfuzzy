Investigations into intestinal glycosylation have mainly drawn upon biochemical and morphological techniques for the demonstration of enzymes (glycosyltransferases) involved in glycosylation reactions, as well as the carbohydrate products resulting from the enzymatic action. These techniques are not specific to the study of intestinal tissues, but rather have been used to study glycosylation in general. The unique application of these methods to intestinal tissues stems mainly from the following three areas: (1) separating activities from crypt and villus portions of the small intestine; (2) separating activities from Golgi apparatus membranes and plasma membranes; and (3) investigating glycosylation changes in different intestinal regions. Two main biochemical tacks have been followed in the investigation of intestinal glycosylation. The first was to assay for the activity of specific glycosyltransferases, followed by subsequent purification. These assays were usually employed with the goal of measuring and comparing activities of various glycosyltransferases in the different intestinal segments, as well as crypt versus villus. Moreover, such methods were also extensively used to compare changes in different glycosyltransferase activities during development (Section IV,A,2). The main drawbacks of this method were the possible contamination of cellular fragments which could lead to erroneous conclusions. as well as the inability to identify which cells in the mixture actually contained the glycosyltransferase of interest (Section IV,A, I). The second most popular method has been to measure the incorporation of radiolabeled sugars into glycoproteins and glycolipids and following their transport to final destinations (Section IV,A,3). As noted in the Introduction, classical morphological and cytochemical methods have been extensively applied to studies of intestinal glycosylation. These studies will not be mentioned again here so that we may focus on more recent types of cytochemical investigations. However, it should be borne in mind that although we now have available more sensitive and specific probes, as well as refined cytochemical techniques, the results obtained have dramatically supported the original conclusions drawn from the earlier studies. Investigations employing lectins have proven to be of particular importance for the study of intestinal glycosylation (Etzler and Branstrator, 1974) . Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins of nonimmune origin that agglutinate cells and precipitate glycoconjugates (Goldstein and Poretz, 1986) . When coupled to an appropriate marker ( Fig. 8 ) they can be used to demonstrate the cellular occurrence and distribution of specific sugar residues (Roth, 1978 (Roth, , 1987b . In intestinal studies they have been used to investigate Golgi apparatus glycosylation events, to determine the pattern of sugar residue expression at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells along the intestinal tract, and to monitor changes in the glycosylation pattern of epithelial cells during development and neoplastic transformation. For convenience, a list of lectins (with their saccharide specificities) mentioned in this article is presented in Table I . A major advance for the field of glycosylation investigation in general (however, also applicable to intestinal studies; Sections IV,B,2; IV,C) was the development of sensitive, yet routine methods for electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. The first was the introduction of colloidal gold particles as an electron dense marker for immunocytochemistry (Faulk and Taylor, 197 1) . This , or in a two-step cytochemical affinity technique employing an unlabeled lectin followed by a glycoprotein-gold complex (right side of figure). A detailed description of these procedures can be found in Roth er al. (1988a) and Roth (1989). was followed by the introduction of the protein A-gold technique for the postembedding localization of antigenic sites (Fig. 9 ). The virtues of this method have been detailed in many reviews (Roth, , 1989 Bendayan, 1984) and will not be enumerated here. It suffices to say that the protein A-gold technique in conjunction with the introduction of the low temperature embedding methods employing Lowicryl K4M (Carlemalm et al., 1982) provided the means necessary for the precise immunolocalization of the relatively scarce glycosyltransferases. Of course, of equal importance was the production and availability of highly specific anti-glycosyltransferase antibodies Weinstein et al., 1982; Shaper et al., 1985; Ulrich et al., 1986) . The combination of these innovations provided immediate dividends (1978) and Roth ( . 1989 ). with the publication of the first immunocytochemical localization of a glycosyltransferase at the electron microscopic level . This paper provided a key piece of evidence which led to the subcompartmentation model of the Golgi apparatus, which will be discussed in detail in Section IV,B,lb. At the same time, the opportunity had now arisen to explore the subcellular distribution of glycosyltransferases at the electron microscopic level in intestinal epithelial cells.
