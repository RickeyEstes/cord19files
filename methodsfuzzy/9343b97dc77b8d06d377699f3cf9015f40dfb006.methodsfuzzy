RABV was the first member of the Mononegavirales order to be successfully manipulated by reverse genetics to generate infectious, replicationcompetent virus (Schnell et al., 1994) . Subsequent observations, that a foreign gene could be inserted within an intergenic region of the RABV genome without significant effect on in vitro replication of the virus, that this insert was translated into functional protein and that the recombinant RABV (rRABV) was genetically stable (Mebatsion et al., 1996) , established the broad utility of this technology. Indeed the fact that the RABV genome can accommodate large increases in size (at least 55% more than wt RABV) (McGettigan et al., 2003b) and that reporter gene expression levels are dependent on insert orientation Conzelmann, 1997, 1999) , genomic position (Wu and Rupprecht, 2008) or the nature of the intergenic sequences (Finke et al., 2000) provides substantial flexibility in engineering novel and useful recombinants. Reverse genetics is now used for various applications, particularly to investigate RABV pathogenesis (see previous section) and to generate novel RV vaccines . The RABV reverse genetics system was initially developed based on the SAD B19 genome sequence, but systems for other lab-adapted RABV strains, including RC-HL (Ito et al., 2001 (Ito et al., , 2003 , HEP-Flury (Inoue et al., 2003) , and ERA (Wu and Rupprecht, 2008) , as well as the SHBRV-18 wildlife isolate , have now been described. As the technology has become more widely used, many methodological improvements have been developed. The original system employed host cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase to drive the transcription of the helper plasmids and the genomic cDNA. Use of host cell lines stably expressing T7 polymerase eliminated the need for the vaccinia construct and circumvented vaccinia virusinduced cytotoxicity and the requirement for removal of contaminating virus from the rRABV cultures (Buchholz et al., 1999; Ito et al., 2003) . One such cell line facilitated the recovery of an RC-HL-derived rRABV containing two copies of the G gene (Hosokawa-Muto et al., 2006) . Other improvements that increase rRABV/minigenome RNA yields have included construction of new helper plasmids that render the T7 RNA polymerase-transcripts cap-independent for translation (Ito et al., 2003) and the inclusion of ribozyme sequences at the termini of the cloned viral genome to permit generation of RNA with precise 5 0 and 3 0 genomic ends (Inoue et al., 2003; Le Mercier et al., 2002) . A recovery system using expression plasmids bearing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter in place of the T7 promoter, and which is transcribed by the host cell RNA polymerase II, yielded higher virus recoveries from multiple cell types compared to a comparable T7 promoter-driven system (Inoue et al., 2003) . Use of both CMV and T7 promoters enhanced transcription efficiency and, using a T7 polymerase engineered to localize to the nucleus (Wu and Rupprecht, 2008) , facilitated recovery of a recombinant ERA virus in which the order of the M and G genes was reversed; such a construct could not be recovered previously.
