Bioinformatics prediction of putative G4 motifs in the Mtb genome. An algorithm for the detection of putative G4 motifs was developed in house using Perl programing language and was applied to the reference genome of Mtb H37Rv (NC_000962.3) . First, all guanine homopolymers (G-islands) were identified through pattern matching with the following line of code: (equation I) where seq is the complete genome of Mtb and l is the minimum length required for the homopolymer. A putative G4 was reported when at least four G-islands were detected and the distance between consecutive homopolymers (loop region) was less than or equal to an additional parameter d (distance). G4s in the reverse strand were searched considering cytosines (C) in the same reference sequence. In order to rank the identified G4s and focus only on those with the highest folding probability, we implemented a score measure as reported by Beaudoin et al. 61 . This score evaluates the presence and the relative Table 3 . Melting temperatures (T m ) of Mtb G4 oligonucleotides (4 µM) in the absence and presence of increasing KCl concentrations (50-150 mM) and G4 ligands (16 µM) . When more than one G4 species were observed in the CD spectrum (i.e. I, II), T m values for each species were reported. B19 and NDI stand for the G4 ligands BRACO-19 and c-exNDI 2, respectively. where 'Gs(i)' is the set of substrings of consecutive 'Gs' found in the string s, and |Gs(i)| is the cardinality of the set. A short and a long score were calculated, considering the G4 regions 15 or 50 nucleotides upstream and downstream. The genomic coordinates of the predicted G4s were then intersected with promoter regions. To this aim, the list of primary TSS 62 was exploited to extract putative promoters, which were considered embedded in the 50 nts upstream of each TSS (downstream for TSS in the reverse strand). A G4 was deemed associated to a TSS when at least one nucleotide of the G4 overlapped with the promoter. A list of all potential G4s associated to promoters is provided in Supplementary File S1. Table S1 ). BRACO-19 was from ENDOTHERM, (Saarbruecken, Germany), c-exNDI-2 was synthetized by Dr. Filippo Doria and Prof. Mauro Freccero (University of Pavia).
