2.1. Plant materials, culturing, and heat-and flood-stress treatments Seeds of cauliflower (B. oleracea var. botrytis) 'H41', 'H69', and 'H71' were obtained from Chin-Long Seed Co. (Tainan, Taiwan). 'H41' is a heat-tolerant cultivar used especially in warm-subtropical regions such as southern Taiwan, where average day temperatures reach as high as 40 • C during the summer (June-August). 'H69' is a popular cultivar grown in Taiwan and is flood-tolerant during the rainy season, particularly in rain-fed lowlands. 'H71' is a heat-and flood-sensitive cultivar, and mostly grown during winter in Taiwan due to its cold tolerance. Seeds were sterilized with 1.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled-deionized (dd) H 2 O, and sown in a commercial potting soil mixture, and germinated seedlings were transplanted into 12.7-cm diameter plastic pots and raised in a growth chamber under 300 mol m −2 s −1 light with a 14 h photoperiod and 22/18 • C day/night temperatures at a relative humidity (RH) of 80%. Plants were watered three times a week and fertilizer (17:36:39, N:P:K) applied once a week to maintain optimal growth for 30 days before the imposition of stress treatments. Pots containing 'H41' and 'H69' plants were subjected to four treatments: non-flooding at 20 • C (NFC, as control), flooding at 20 • C (FC, control temperature), non-flooding at 40 • C (NFH, high temperature), and flooding at 40 • C (FH), for periods of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h in four growth chambers having a 14 h photoperiod at 300 mol m −2 s −1 radiation and 80% RH (Lin et al., 2010) . In the case of flooding treatments, pots were randomly placed in 28 cm × 14 cm × 14 cm plastic buckets and subjected to flooding by filling the buckets with tap water to 5 cm above the soil surface. Pots were removed from the buckets at different times following flooding, and plants were removed and their leaves from each plant clipped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 • C in an ultrafreezer until used. Three replicates of each time period for the four treatments were randomly placed in a growth chamber. The experiment was performed twice independently in a randomized design for growth environment, sampling day, and physiological analyses. 2.2. Determination of electrolyte leakage (EL), chlorophyll fluorescence (CF), chlorophyll content (CC), and water potential (WP) Cell membrane stability was estimated by measuring leaf ion leakage according to the method of Huang and Guo (2005) . Leaves were excised and immersed in 15 ml of distilled water in test tubes overnight at room temperature. The initial conductivity of the water was determined using a conductivity meter (model CDM 210, Radiometer, Cedex, France). Tubes were placed in boiling water for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature, and conductivity was again determined. The relative EL (%) was calculated as the ratio of conductivity before boiling to that after boiling. CF components were quantified with a portable modulated fluorometer (Mini-Pam Photosynthesis Yield Analyzer, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The measurement of variable fluorescence to (Fv)/maximum fluorescence level in light-adapted leaves (Fv/Fm) was previously described (Lin et al., 2007) . Relative CC per unit leaf area was determined using a SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) analyzer (SPAD-502 Chlorophyll Meter, Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). WP (in bars) was measured on the third leaf from the top of each plant using a pressure chamber (Plant Water System, Skye SKPM 1400, Tokyo, Japan) (Sairam et al., 1998) . The data shown in Tables 1-4 represent the means of at least two independent sets of experiments with similar results. Measurements of physiological parameters were analyzed by a three-factor completely randomized ANOVA that compared cultivars, treatments, and time periods. For significant values, means were separated by a least significant difference (LSD) test at p ≤ 0.05 using PC SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
