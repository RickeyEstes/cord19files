Many methods are available for making a rapid and accurate diagnosis of rotavirus infection. One of the methods most commonly used for detecting rotaviruses is examination of negatively stained stool by transmission electron lTIicroscopyY, 42, 67, 92 This method is limited by the necessity of having a large number of particles (> 10 6 particles per gm feces), and the inability to determine the serotype of the rotavirus. Immune electron microscopy can be used to determine serotype and presence of antibody in sera but otherwise has many of the san1e disadvantages.(-)7 Both techniques are too inconvenient and tin1e consuming to screen large numbers of specimens and require ready access to an electron microscope. One of the best methods for rapid screening of a large number of stool samples for virus and sera for antibody is the enzYl11e-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 159, 161, 193 The ELISA has been adapted to n1easure serotypes of rotavirus and type-specific serum antibody responses, and to determine the class of antibody response. Both radiomn1unoassay (RIA) and the ELISA are fast and efficient and at least as sensitive as electron microscopy in detecting rotavirus infection and serum antibody. 24, 66 Other techniques that have been used to detect rotavirus antigen and/or antibody include immunofluorescence, ll, 1.50 counterimmunoelectrophoresis, 94,141 immune adherence hemagglutination,86 and complement fixation. ll , 68 Many methods are available for making a rapid and accurate diagnosis of rotavirus infection.
