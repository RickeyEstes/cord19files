All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS PC v. 16 .0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). URTI outcomes were compared between groups (Q-1000, Q-500, and placebo) and within groups by gender, BMI categories (normal weight <25 kg/m 2 , overweight 25-29.9 kg/m 2 , and obese ≥30 kg/m 2 ), and age categories (<40, 40-59, and ≥60 years). Data are expressed as means ± SEM, and were compared between groups using one-way ANOVA, with a Tukey post hoc analysis. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to determine the effect of age, BMI, and other demographic and lifestyle factors on URTI outcome measures. Plasma quercetin data were analyzed using a 3 (group) × 2 (time) repeated measures ANOVA, between groups design, with post hoc analysis using Bonferroni adjusted independent t-tests that contrasted pre-to-post-supplementation changes of Q-500 and Q-1000 with placebo. For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered significant.
