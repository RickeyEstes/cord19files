This project was not conducted as a research project, and so no formal research protocol was written and submitted to a research ethics committee. A literature search was conducted on RECs/IRBs and their procedures in emergency situations in the Caribbean and worldwide, to ascertain whether any prior guidance existed for how RECs should deal with research in emergency and epidemic situations. As the largest English-speaking Caribbean country (and situated in the western Caribbean), Jamaica has four (4) functioning research ethics committees and so the Chairs of the 4 RECs were identified as key informants. Other key informants were public health officials in the Jamaican Ministry of Health and a major researcher who also serves on the largest research ethics committee on the island. The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) comprise 9 small island countries with St. Lucia being the centre of its governance, and so the latter country was identified as being representative of the smaller islands of the Caribbean for this project. Key informants were identified at St. Lucia's Ministry of Health and from its research ethics committee. Nine persons were interviewed in Jamaica, and eight persons in St. Lucia. The persons were specifically selected to be interviewed because of their work positions, knowledge of the subject area and experience -to be able to contribute to the knowledge and perspectives being sought. Interviews began with a preamble regarding emerging epidemic infections and the need for research during these epidemics, followed by specific questions. Eight main questions were asked, and individual responses were subsequently evaluated. The individual responses to each question were tabulated, and those that made the same points in common (coding) were written up. Other individual responses that were not proffered by other respondents were also evaluated for their pertinence in answering the question posed. Those that were pertinent were also included to provide a comprehensive response (collated answer) to each question (see Results). Further, among the many issues discussed at a retreat workshop of the REC of the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) in February 2016 were the components of what would be required for any submission to the committee for research in emergency situations. 6 That REC is the regional research ethics committee serving its 24 member states in the Caribbean. One outcome of the workshop was their recommendations for the most important subject headings in an application form for research in emergency situations, and guidelines for the content of such research proposals. All recommendations and data obtained were used to derive the standard application form to research ethics committees/IRBs for research in epidemic or emergency conditions, and a template for communication and collaboration between research ethics committees. Another study examined IRB members' experience in reviewing research protocols using emergency exception from informed consent, and found that those protocols took longer to review than other protocols. 24 Another reviewing the ethical guidelines related to research in disaster settings concluded that some concepts and terms identified in analyzed guidelines were used in an inconsistent manner and applied in different contexts. 25
