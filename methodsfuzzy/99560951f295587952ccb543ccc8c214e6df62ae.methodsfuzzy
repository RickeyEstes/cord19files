The intention of the study was the investigation of the incidence, genetic variability and clinical presentation of HRV-C collected over a whole calendar year. Non-selective amplification of all HRV (and HEV) species using previously developed 59UTRbased PCR methods would have identified an extremely large number of non-HRV-C positive samples that would preclude effective screening using pools. To overcome this, we modified the VP4/VP2-encoding region PCR previously used for genetic characterisation and (sero)type identification of HRV to enable selective amplification of HRV-C. The inner antisense primer was repositioned to a more variable position in the VP4 gene between species A, B and C sequences to enable selective hybridisation and strand extension of HRV-C sequences. The sensitivity and specificity of the selective PCR was evaluated using samples previously identified as HRV-A, -B and -C variants in a previous study [18] . All 26 species C samples were positive, along with 1 from 63 species A and 1 from 8 species B samples in the assay (sensitivity 100%; 98% specificity). Since all positive samples were to be sequenced in the more variable VP4/VP2-encoding region, this minor degree of non-specificity would not influence our identification of HRV-C positive samples for the study.
