Scenario development focuses on the micro-and macro-environment of the industry. As indicated in the introduction, we used the PEST-analysis (see Wilson and Gilligan, 2005, p. 123) and Michael E. Porter's five forces model (Porter, 1979) to investigate the future of logistics services. The following two research questions were addressed: ''How will the macroenvironment (political/legal, economic, socio-cultural, and technological structure-PEST) of the logistics services industry change by 2025?'' and ''How will the micro-environment (industrial structure) of the logistics services industry change by 2025?'' We base our research on the multi-stage process proposed by Bood and Postma (1997, p. 634) . The development of Delphi-based scenarios is an approach that has been explicitly recommended by numerous authors because the Delphi process is easy to integrate into the scenario development process and Delphi delivers valuable, valid, and reliable data for scenario construction (see e.g. Kameokaa et al., 2004, pp. 584, 595; Loveridge, 1999, p. 10; Rikkonen, 2005) . The Delphi method attempts to systematically develop expert opinion consensus about future developments and events which are formulated as projections, i.e. short and concise future theses. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in the form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round (Delbecq et al., 1986, p. 83; Linstone and Turoff, 1975, p. 3; Rowe and Wright, 2001, p. 126) . The Delphi process we employed is based on the classical procedure from RAND Corporation, which is the most approved and accepted variant of the Delphi approaches (Dalkey, 1967 (Dalkey, , 1969 Chermack et al., 2001, p. 10) . Fig. 1 illustrates the individual phases of our research and shows how the Delphi method was used for scenario development. First, we developed a set of projections based on the macroand micro-environments of the industry. Subsequently, we identified, evaluated, selected, and recruited logistics experts for participation in the Delphi survey. Third, the projections were evaluated by the experts, followed by an interim analysis to calculate the statistical group opinion and aggregate arguments. Fifth, experts were asked to revise first round answers based on the feedback of the interim results. Sixth, we used the Delphi data for scenario development. We decided to conduct two Delphi rounds, thus including one feedback and possible revision of first round answers. This approach guaranteed that research fatigue was kept as low as possible, which, in turn, assured a higher response rate and validity of the data (Mitchell, 1991, p. 347 ). In addition, numerous researchers have revealed that the major opinion of the study changes over time and, therefore, the most reliable study value occurs after the first iteration (see e.g. Rowe et al., 1991, p. 237; Woudenberg, 1991, p. 140) . We recognised that this approach may not lead to consensus for all projections. Finally, the answers were analysed and used for scenario development. The latter included desk research, scenario writing, discontinuity analysis and an expert check for plausibility and consistency. A planning horizon of nearly 20 years was chosen in order to fully distance ourselves from all planned and fixed decisions and to promote thinking ''out-of-the-box''. The scenarios focussed on the German logistics services market due to its central role in Europe: the largest market in Europe and the highest density of global players of the logistics services industry (Klaus and Kille, 2007) . For the empirical part of the scenario study, we decided to concentrate on the largest organisations to guarantee a global perspective across all modes of transport. Overall, the participating experts come from 24 organisations, equalling 71% of the cumulative turnover of the top 50 logistics service providers in Germany. Researchers agree that standardisation and pretesting may be considered the two most effective means to ensure reliability in Delphi research (Kastein et al., 1993, p. 322; Okoli and Pawlowski, 2004, p. 19) . Standardisation was, in fact, implemented in all of our Delphi and scenario activities. Moreover, the definition of research scope and aim, the structuring of the scenario field, expert selection, development of projections, and interim analysis followed phase-based standard procedures. In addition, the entire survey process was strongly standardised since it was planned and executed in line with the Total/ Tailored Design Method (Dillman, 1978 (Dillman, , 2006 . In the following discussion, we provide a more detailed explanation of the research methodology.
