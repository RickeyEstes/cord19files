Cell lines and DENV-3 strain -BHK-21 cells were propagated at 37ºC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Mosquito C6/36 cells were cultured at 30ºC in Leibovitz's medium (L-15) with 5% FBS. Both growth media were supplemented with 1% antibiotic solution (containing penicillin and streptomycin). 95016/BR-PE/02 strain is a DENV-3 clinical sample isolated from an 11-year-old female patient during the DENV-3 epidemics in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil in 2002 (Cordeiro et al. 2007 ). The patient presented typical symptoms of dengue fever. Virus was isolated in mosquito C6/36 cells (passage 1) and virus serotype confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus stocks were produced in mosquito C6/36 cell cultures and stored at -70ºC. The infectious clone and replicon described herein were derived from passage 3 in insect cells. E. coli strain, yeast strains and yeast transformation -Electrocompetent ElectroMAX DH10B E. coli cells were acquired from Invitrogen. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFY206 (MATa trp1Δ::hisG his3Δ200 ura3-52 lys2Δ201 leu2-3) strain (Finley Jr & Brent 1994) was grown in YPD media and made competent by lithium acetate treatment (Sambrook & Russell 2001) . S. cerevisiae YPH252 (MATα ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) strain (Sikorski & Hieter 1989) was purchased from ATCC. YPH252 transformation was carried out by electroporation as previously described (Meilhoc et al. 1990 ). Plasmid constructions -Plasmid pSVJS01, a newly designed shuttle vector, was constructed as follows: a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414 (ATCC). It contains necessary elements to allow replication (CEN6/ARS H1) and selection (TRP1) in yeast. The 5'-end primer used on this PCR reaction included a T7 promoter recognition site and a multiple cloning site (MCS). To assemble pSVJS01, the 2-kb fragment was inserted into NotI-linearised pBeloBAC11 vector (New England Biolabs) by homologous recombination (Polo et al. 1997 , Gibson 2009 ) in RFY206 yeast strain. Recombinant clones were selected in drop-out YNB agar plates lacking tryptophan. Purified plasmid DNA was amplified in DH10B E. coli strain in selective medium and analysed by restriction pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis. DENV-3 infectious clone was constructed as illustrated in Fig. 1 . DENV-3 genome was amplified in five overlapping subgenomic fragments (Table) using the KlenTaq LA polymerase mix (Clonetech), a high fidelity DNA polymerase enzymes mix. The first fragment (F1) was amplified using primers pSVJS01-F and DENV-3-1860-R. The forward primer used on this PCR reaction included an RsrII restriction site, a T7 promoter recognition site and an additional G immediately before the first base of DENV-3 genome. Fragment F2 was amplified using primers DENV-3-1141-F and DENV-3-3521-R. This reaction used as template a RT product derived from a DENV-3 infectious clone recovered by in vitro ligation (JJS Santos & LHVG Gil, unpublished observations) and introduced a unique BamHI site into the DENV-3 infectious clone sequence reported on this paper. The third fragment (F3) was amplified with primers DENV-3-3481-F and DENV-3-4570-R while primer set DENV-3-4370-F and DENV-3-6700-R was used to amplify fragment F4. The last fragment (F5) was amplified using primers DENV-3-6521-F and pSVJS01-R. DENV-3 replicon was generated by a PCR-mediated deletion, eliminating almost the entire structural coding region [from nucleotide (nt) 454-nt 2336)], as depicted in Fig. 2 , and cloned as a set of five fragments (Table) , three of which have been previously described (F3, F4 and F5). The first fragment (RF1) was amplified using primers pSVJS01-F and rep-prM-BamHI-E-R, generating a 0.5-Kb PCR product that retained the first six codons of prM. The second fragment (RF2) was amplified with primers rep-prM-BamHI-E-F and DENV-3521-R, producing a 1.3-Kb PCR product carrying the last 26 codons of E protein. Primers rep-prM-BamHI-E-F and rep-prM-BamHI-E-R were engineered to insert a single BamHI site in the DENV-3 replicon sequence. Both constructs were assembled into NotI-linearised pSVJS01 vector by homologous recombination (Polo et al. 1997 , Gibson 2009 ) in YPH252 yeast strain. Recombinant clones were selected in drop-out YNB agar plates, and then screened by PCR and DNA sequencing. Functional clones were maintained in yeast to prevent any instability of sequences in bacteria. Genome sequence was deposited in the GenBank under the accession KC425219. In vitro transcription and transfection -Full-length PCR product from DENV-3 infectious clone was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by etha-nol precipitation. Full-length RNA transcripts were in vitro synthesised using the MEGAScript T7 kit (Ambion) with the addition of a 7-methyl-guanosine cap analog (Ambion), following manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot from the reaction was analysed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and RNA transcripts were used without further processing. Full-length RNA transcripts were introduced into BHK-21 cells by electroporation using the ECM 830 electro cell manipulator (BTX Harvard Apparatus). 2 x 10 6 BHK-21 cells were trypsinised and washed twice with serum-free medium, resuspended in 100 µL Cytomix solution (Ansari et al. 2004 ) and mixed with 5 µg of transcribed RNA. Cells were transferred to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette with 0.2-cm gap. Electroporation was performed with two pulses of 100 µs at 1,200 V separated by 1 s interval. As negative control, BHK-21 cells were transfected under the same conditions except no RNA was added (mock). After electroporation, cells were allowed to recover for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in complete growth medium. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) -To detect DENV-3 virus antigen, transfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. At different time points, RNA-transfected cells in glass coverslips were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 50% cold acetone (v/v) in PBS for 5 min at 4ºC and air-dried. Fixed cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) for 1 h at 37ºC. This HMAF was raised against group B flaviviruses, including YFV and the four DENV serotypes. While its reactivity has not been fully tested, this HMAF reacts predominantly to E protein. After incubation with primary antibody, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37ºC with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), developed in goat. Then, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and the nuclei stained with a Hoechst 33258 solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior visualisation by fluorescent microscopy, cell were washed twice with ddH 2 0, air-dried and mounted. Immunofluorescence analyses were carried out on a DMI 4000B inverted microscope (Leica). Stability of DENV-3 infectious clone in yeast -To evaluate genome stability, cloned DENV-3 infectious clone was repeatedly propagated in yeast. Recombinant clones were grown in drop-out YNB agar plates at 30ºC for three days. Grown colonies were streaked out in fresh selective agar plates and incubated at 30ºC for other three days. After 10 consecutive passages, plasmid DNA was purified and genome integrity was assessed by DNA sequencing and virus rescue.
