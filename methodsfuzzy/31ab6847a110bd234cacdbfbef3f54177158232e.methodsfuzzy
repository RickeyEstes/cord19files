This was a nested case-control study. Study subjects included all Hajj mission members of the Al-Hada and Taif Military Hospitals for the year 2005 (a total of 375 individuals). Subjects with chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma or those who did not complete one week working for the mission were excluded from the study (28 members). A response rate of 250/347 (72.0%) was obtained. A questionnaire was distributed to the study cohort two weeks after the Hajj period and was self-administered by all recruited subjects. Items contained in the questionnaire included history of ARI during or within two weeks of returning from Hajj, possible risk factors for ARI such as smoking, and influenza vaccination history. Both Arabic and English versions of the questionnaire were distributed. In addition the medical records of study subjects were reviewed at Al-Hada Hospital for the same period in order to document ARI. Respiratory tract infection was considered in any person suffering from at least one constitutional symptom (fever, headache, and myalgia) plus at least one of the following local symptoms (coryza, sneezing, throat pain, cough with/ without sputum, and difficulty breathing). 8 Informed consent was provided by all subjects, and approval from the Ethical Review Committee of both hospitals was also obtained.
