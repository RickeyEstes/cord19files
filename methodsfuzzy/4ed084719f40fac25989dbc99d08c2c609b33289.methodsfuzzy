The complete list of viral species able to infect humans was retrieved from http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/678.html (accessed in April 2016) and, for each of them, all available complete genome sequences were downloaded from GenBank. Multiple alignments were built for each virus with usearch8 (Edgar 2010), using a permissive identity threshold (60%) to account for viral variability. Since in some cases nucleotide heterogeneity within viral species exceeded this value, multiple clusters of aligned sequences were obtained for some viruses, representing distinct genotypes. Considering the difficulty of obtaining high quality alignments beyond this limit of nucleotide similarity, all clusters obtained with this method were kept separate, manually assigned to specific genotypes and independently processed in the downstream analyses. One genome per each group of aligned sequences was chosen to serve as reference sequence, possibly belonging to the manually curated RefSeq database [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/]. The complete list of selected reference sequences is reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Table S1 ). G4 patterns were searched in all nucleotide sequences with an in-house developed tool, as previously described (Perrone et al. 2017a; Perrone et al. 2017b ). Briefly, a G4 was reported when at least four consecutive guanine islands (G-islands) were detected. If 'l' is author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Patterns in the negative strands of viral genomes were searched by looking for cytosines (Cs) instead of Gs. The conservation of each G4 in the multiple aligned genomes of the viruses was determined by looking at the conservation not only of the G-islands but also their connecting loops. We computed different indexes to measure the nucleotide sequence conservation of viral genomes and G4s: i) G4_scaffold_conservation_index (G4_SCI): it is an index referred to the G-islands. For each virus and for every detected G4 pattern, it is calculated as the percentage of independent genomes maintaining the corresponding G-islands: where NG_islands is the number of sequences possessing the G-islands in a certain genome position and Ntot is the total number of sequences available for the virus.
