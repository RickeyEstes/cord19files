Impact of an antimicrobial use algorithm on calf health and treatment rates Farms Two large commercial dairy farms located within a 120 km radius of the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, were selected to participate in the study on the basis of convenience, since both farms had a record keeping system for documenting health and disease events, treatment of calves and outcomes. No changes in management in the years before and after enrolment in the study were anticipated (e.g. expansion, new buildings or major changes in disease management practices); however, there was an unexpected change between use of milk replacer and pasteurised milk between study periods on both farms. The characteristics of farms identified in each period are presented in Table 1 . The production systems on both farms consisted of free stall housing with an automated milking system. The milking herds consisted of approximately 600 cows on farm 1 and 700 cows on farm 2. The average milk production was 10,300 kg/cow/year on farm 1 and 10,400 kg/cow/year on farm 2. Neither farm had a treatment protocol for diarrhoeic calves at the time of enrolment. Calves that developed diarrhoea on farm 1 were treated with three antimicrobial agents (trimethoprim-sulphadoxine, spectinomycin and lincomycin), while diarrhoeic calves on farm 2 were treated with one antimicrobial agent orally (sulphamethazine) and one parenterally (trimethoprim-sulphadoxine or sodium ceftiofur). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee (approval number eAUP 3793).
