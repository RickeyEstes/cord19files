Methods for characterization of the intestinal microbiota are based on cultivation techniques or molecular tools ( Fig. 2-1) . The selection of the best approach depends on the study problem (e.g., detection of specific pathogens in clinical specimens, or general characterization of the intestinal ecosystem), the cost, and the availability of technologies. Each method has strengths but also limitations (outlined below). For general ecologic surveys of microbial communities, molecular high-throughput sequencing techniques yield the most information as they allow in-depth identification of microorganisms. For screening of specific pathogens, culture techniques and species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays may be most useful. Both of these methods are sensitive to sample handling and processing. Detailed instructions for sample collection and shipping for each particular assay should be acquired before sample submission as many laboratories use their own in-house culture or PCR assays. In the case of molecular methods, there is usually no standardization of DNA extraction or PCR protocols among laboratories, and such factors impact on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays. Improper DNA extraction, especially from fecal samples, may result in the presence of residual PCR inhibitors that cause false negative results. Because of the high sensitivity of PCR assays (theoretically a single target copy can be amplified), any DNA contamination can lead to false-positive results. A laboratory should be chosen that has expertise in molecular analysis, and that has validated each assay in the target specimen.
