Plasmids and cell lines. pNL43LucE À R À (HIV-luc) and the codon optimized SARS-CoV S protein expression plasmid pcTSh (strain BJ01, GenBank Accession No. AY278488, a gift from Dr. Hongkui Deng) were utilized in the production of HIV/SARS pseudoviruses. 293T cells used in pseudotyped virus generation and Huh 7 cells used [21] . In the prehairpin intermediate, the central coiled-coil formed by three HR1s and three HR2s was exposed and could be targeted by exogenous HRs. In the absence of inhibitors, this transient state ultimately collapsed into a six-helix bundle that brought the HR1 and HR2 regions into close proximity, promoting membrane fusion. The entry inhibitors (black cylinder) targeting HR1 regions prevented the formation of the six-helix bundle. (B) HR121 contained two HR1 segments and one HR2 segment alternatively linked with the short Gly/Ser peptide sequences, while HR212 consisted of two HR2 segments and one HR1 segment. The sequences of HR1 and HR2 for constructing HR121 and HR212 were peptides N35 and C35, respectively; linker 1, GGSGG; and linker 2, SGGRGG. (C) Schematic models of the trimer of HR121 (left) and HR212 (right). Both HR121 and HR212 assembled into six-helix bundles with free HR1s or HR2s. in cell-cell fusion assays were cultured in DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Gene construction. Learn Coil-VMF program [28] was used to predict the amino acid sequences of HR1 and HR2 regions. Genes encoding amino acids 898-1005 for HR1 (N108), 900-943 for HR1 (N44), 916-950 for HR1 (N35), 1149-1186 for HR2 (C38), and 1151-1185 for HR2 (C35) were amplified by PCR from pcTSh. Based on TripetÕs finding [29] , we selected N35 and C35 to construct HR121 (N35-C35-N35) and HR212 (C35-N35-C35). HR121 consisted of two N35 segments and one C35 segment alternatively linked with the short peptide sequences, while HR212 consisted of two C35 segments and one N35 segment (Fig. 1B) . The genes encoding the two proteins were then subcloned into E. coli expression vector pGEX-6P-1 by two restriction enzyme sites of EcoRI and XhoI. A stop codon was introduced before the XhoI site. This cloning strategy yielded glutathione Stransferase (GST) fusion proteins and the fusion proteins were named after GST-HR121 and GST-HR212, respectively. N108, N44, and C38 were subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pET-30a and yielded the proteins with N-terminal 6· his-tag, thrombin, and enterokinase cleavage sites. The purified proteins were named after N108-30a, N44-30a, and C38-30a, respectively. Protein expression and purification. The recombinant plasmids of pGEX-6p-1-HR121, pGEX-6p-1-HR212 and the plasmid pGEX-6p-1 itself were transformed into E. coil strain BL21 (DE3). Single colony from the respective transformation was grown at 37°C in 2· YT to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.8-1.0 and then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 20°C for 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3; 150 mM NaCl). Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1% and the lysate was incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min at 4°C. The clarified supernatants were applied to Glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column (Pharmacia). The column was then washed with 10 bed volumes of PBS and eluted with reduced L-glutathione (15 mM). The HR121 and HR212 proteins were subsequently cleaved from the fusion proteins by GST-fusion rhino-virus 3C protease (GST-3C), kindly provided by Drs. K. Hudson and J. Heath, and were loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column again to remove GST and GST-3C. The samples were then purified by a Hiload Superdex G75 column (Pharmacia) running on Akta Explorer FPLC system (Amersham-Pharmacia). The fractions of the peak were collected and run on 12% SDS-PAGE. The peak molecular weight was estimated by comparison with the protein standards (Pharmacia) running on the same column. The clarified supernatants of N108, N44, and C38 were applied on Ni-chelated Sepharose affinity column (Pharmacia). The column was then washed by PBS over 10 column volumes and eluted with imidazole (500, 300, and 200 mM, respectively). Chemical cross-linking. This was done according to the method described earlier [26] . Briefly, the gel-filtration purified HR121 and HR212 were dialyzed against cross-linking buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.3; 100 mM NaCl) separately and concentrated to about 2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off). Proteins were cross-linked with ethylene glycol bis (succinimidyl succinate) (EGS, dissolved in DMSO) (Sigma). The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mM EGS and stopped by 50 mM glycine. Cross-linked products were analyzed under reducing conditions on 12% SDS-PAGE. CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer with proteins in PBS. Wavelength spectra were recorded at 37°C using a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette. The protein concentration used for this was 10 lg/ml. GST pull-down assay. Excess N108-30a and C38-30a in classified bacterium supernatants were, respectively, mixed with GST-HR121 and GST-HR212. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity gel was added. The gel with the protein mixtures was then incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min to sediment the gel with adsorbed fusion protein complexes. The column was then washed with 10 bed volumes of PBS and eluted with reduced L-glutathione. The eluted samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of HIV/SARS pseudovirus entry by HR121 and HR212. HIV/SARS pseudovirus was produced as described by Deng [30] . pNL43LucE À R À and pcTSh were co-transfected into 293T cells. Forty eight hours later, HIV/SARS pseudovirus-containing supernatant was mixed with serially diluted protein. The virus/protein mixture was then transferred to 24-well plates seeded with Huh 7 cells. Three hours later, the medium was replaced. Following 2 days incubation at 37°C, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer, analyzed for luciferase activity by the addition of luciferase substrate, and measured for 10 s in a TD-20/ 10 luminometer. The IC 50 values were calculated by fitting the HR121 and HR212 titration data Langmuir function {normalized luciferase activity = 1/(1 + C/IC 50 )}.
