Viruses, cells, and plaque assays. BtCoV HKU5-SE, MERS-CoV Hu/ England-N1/2012, and MERS-CoV Hu/SA-N1/2012 were cultured on Vero 81 cells and grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Gibco, CA) with 5% Fetalclone II (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) and gentamicinkanamycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). Growth curves in Vero and Calu-3 cells were performed as previously described (55) . All virus cultivation was performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory with redundant fans in biosafety cabinets (18, 20) . All personnel wore powered airpurifying respirators (3M Breathe Easy) and Tyvek suits, aprons, and booties and were double gloved. Generation of polyclonal mouse antisera, neutralization assays, and Western and Northern blot analyses. Genes encoding the CoV S and N proteins indicated above were synthesized by Bio Basic, Inc. (Ontario, Canada) and were packaged into Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus replicon particles (VRPs) under BSL2 conditions using attenuated VEE virus 3526 structural protein helpers. Following vaccination, mouse polyclonal sera were generated in BALB/c mice, and neutralization assays involving MERS-CoV isolates and SARS-CoV and using mouse antisera were performed as described previously (49) . For Western blotting, lysates from cells infected with BtCoV HKU5-SE or MERS-CoV isolates were prepared at 12 h p.i. as described previously (36) . The blots were then probed using the mouse polyclonal sera indicated above. Vero cells inoculated with BtCoV HKU5-SE were harvested at 12 h p.i. with TRizol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis to describe the genome-and subgenome-length RNAs was performed using a probe for the N gene as described previously (37) . Systematic assembly and recovery of full-length infectious clones of BtCoV HKU5 variants. The BtCoV HKU5 molecular clone was designed based on a consensus sequence of BtCoV HKU5 isolates available in Gen-Bank (nucleotide sequence accession number EF065512.1). The gene encoding the BtCoV HKU5 S protein (ORF2) was also replaced with the full-length ectodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein (residues 1 to 1190) using previously described strategies (16, 19) . The mouse-adapted substitution Y436H in the SARS-CoV spike protein (20, 25) was also included in the chimeric S construct to promote replication in mice. This clone was designated BtCoV HKU5-SE. The wild-type virus and chimeric BtCoV HKU5 E fragments were synthesized by Bio Basic, Inc. (Ontario, Canada) as six contiguous cDNAs. After assembly and in vitro transcription, recombinant virus was recovered on Vero cells through transfection of the full-length transcripts, as previously described in detail (16, 18) . Biosafety statement. Synthetic reconstruction of BtCoV HKU5 and BtCoV HKU5-SE was approved by the University of North Carolina IBC (Institutional Biosafety Committee), which also reviewed possible dual use research concerns before these experiments were undertaken. The IBC also examined the manuscript before submission. BtCoV HKU5-SE replication and serial passage in mice. Young (10week-old) and aged (1-year-old) BALB/c mice purchased from Harlan Labs were intranasally inoculated with a 50-l volume containing 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of BtCoV HKU5-SE virus. Infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and lung titers were determined by plaque assay. Adaptation to mice was conferred by serial passage in lungs of young BALB/c mice (10 weeks old) at 2-day intervals p.i. as has been described in detail previously (25) . Animal housing, care, and experimental protocols were in accordance with University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Immunohistochemistry. Lungs from mice infected with BtCoV HKU5-SE were harvested at 2 and 4 days p.i. in 10% formalin and were fixed for 7 days before removal from the BSL3. Paraffin-embedded tissues (5 M) were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain, and lung sections were blind scored for pathological changes. Staining of viral antigens was performed as described previously (25) , using polyclonal serum to the HKU5 N protein. VRP-based S and N vaccination experiments. Young (~5-to 6-weekold) and aged (~1-year-old) mice received, in the left footpad, a prime and a boost of 10 5 PFU of different VRP-based S or N vaccines or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus adjuvanted particles (VAP) which expressed no transgene as a mock-infection control, with a 3-week interval between the prime and the boost. At 3 weeks after the boost, the animals were moved into the BSL3 facility and allowed to acclimate for 1 week. Then, they were challenged with BtCoV HKU5-SE. All young animals were~13 weeks, and aged animals were 14 months old at the time of challenge. Flow cytometry. Young BALB/c mice that were mock immunized with 10 5 infectious units of VAP (expresses no transgene) or vaccinated with VRP encoding BtCoV HKU5 N or MERS-CoV N were challenged with 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of BtCoV HKU5-SE. The animals were weighed and monitored for clinical symptoms daily. On day 4 p.i., mice were sacrificed by isoflurane inhalation, and viable cell populations from the lungs were prepared, stained with appropriate antibodies, and sorted using flow cytometry as previously described in detail (27) .
