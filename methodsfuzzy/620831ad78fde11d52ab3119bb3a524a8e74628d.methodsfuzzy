The paramyxovirus human respiratory syncytial virus is a causative agent of respiratory infections worldwide. HTLV-1 has the ability to control T-cell activation for its own requirements. The HTLV protein P12 I expressed in early infection is capable of inducing T-cell activation by the activating transcription activator nuclear factor of activated T-cells and interleukin-2 production Ding et al., 2002 Ding et al., , 2003 Kim, Ding, Albrecht, Green, & Lairmore, 2003) . In addition, viral protein Tax is able to bypass TCR signalling and activate CD28, CD69, and CD5 expression (Chlichlia et al., 1995) promoting T-cell activation. Conversely, HTLV-1 reduces TCR cell-surface expression via downregulation of TCR genes (de Waal Malefyt et al., 1990) and similarly blocks transcription of Lck (Koga et al., 1989) , thus controlling IS formation and activation of T-cells.
