Samples were collected from broiler farms in Poland and consisted of pools of 10 swabs, either tracheal or cloacal. Information about collection date, birds age, applied vaccination, and presence of symptoms was also recorded. Pooled swabs were eluted in 2 mL of 1% PBS solution, and RNA extraction was performed with High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (ROCHE, Basel, CH). Samples were tested for IBV by RT-PCR using Super-Script III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), amplifying a 464 bp hyper-variable region of the S1 gene with XCE1+ and XCE2-primers described by Cavanagh et al. (1999) . Positive samples were Sangersequenced using the same primers. The chromatograms were evaluated with FinchTV software (http://www. geospiza.com) and consensus sequences were assembled with CromasPRO 1.5 software (http://technelysium. com.au/wp/chromaspro/). Sequences were then aligned using the MUSCLE method implemented in MEGA7 (Kumar et al., 2016) and analyzed for strain genotypization and characterization by comparing them to a database including a set of commonly applied vaccine strains and Valastro et al. (2016) reference sequences. The detected strains were classified as vaccines when they were identical or closely related (p-distance <0.01) to one of the administered vaccine (Worthington et al., 2008) . The other strains were considered: a field strain, if the p-distance was higher than 0.01 compared to known vaccines or a vaccine-derived one, if they were closely related (p-distance <0.01) to known vaccines not matching the ones applied in the farm. Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction was applied to infer non-casual distributions of categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using R software, setting the significance level to P < 0.05.
