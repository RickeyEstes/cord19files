Sera. Serum samples were obtained by jugular puncture from normal newborn calves before or after ingestion of colostrum and from some of their dams in 1973 and 1974, and by cardiac puncture from normal fetuses, 7 to 10 months of gestation, in 1979. The sera were stored at --20°C and inactivated at 56°C for 30 min before use. Viruses. The K-71 strain of bovine parvovirus was originally isolated from an aborted fetus (Sugimura, et al., 1974) and had undergone 5 passages in primary cultures of bovine kidney (BK) cells when used in the present study. The Lincoln strain of bovine rotavirus (Mebus et al., 1971 ) was used at the 7th passage level in BK cell cultures. Calf diarrhea coronavirus (Mebus et al., 1973) was found in our laboratory to replicate with cytopathic effect in cultures of the BEK-1 cell line derived from bovine embryonic kidney (Inaba et al., 1976) . In the present study the virus was used at the 7th BEK-1 passage. Neutralization tests. Neutralization tests with bovine parvovirus and rotavirus were carried out in tube cultures of BK cells and those with bovine coronavirus in tube cultures of BEK-1 cells. The medium for cell growth was Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 10% bovine serum and antibiotics, and the maintenance medium was MEM containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.5% sodium glutamate and 0.05% yeast extract. Cultures were prepared in 11 X 100 mm tubes by seeding 0.5-ml volumes of growth medium containing 2.5 X l0 s cells/ml and incubating at 37°C for 4 days. Serial twofold dilutions of the serum or fractionated materials were made with maintenance medium, and each dilution was mixed with an equal volume of maintenance medium containing 200 TCIDs0 per 0.1 ml of virus. The virus-serum mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 90 min, inoculated in 0.1-ml volumes into 2 tube cultures per serum dilution. The inoculated cultures were incubated at 37°C for 90 min for virus adsorption, fed with 0.5 ml of maintenance medium and incubated in a roller drum at 37°C for 8 to 9 days with parvovirus or for 6 or 7 days with coronavirus and rotavirus. The titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution showing neutralization in at least one of the two tubes. Treatment of serum with acetone. One volume of test serum was mixed with 20 volumes of chilled acetone, shaken vigorously for 5 min, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 ° C. The supernatant fluid was carefully aspirated from the sediments, which were again treated with acetone in the same manner. The resulting sediments were dried under vacuum at room temperature and resuspended in sufficient PBS, pH 7.2, to make a 1:4 dilution based on the volume of serum initially introduced. Treatment of serum with 2-ME. One volume of test serum was mixed with one volume of 0.1 M 2-ME {2-mercaptoethanol) in PBS, pH 7.2. After standing at 4°C for 24 h, the mixture was dialyzed overnight against 0.02 M iodoacetamide in PBS at 4 ° C. It was further dialyzed against PBS for 2 days at 4 ° C. A sufficient amount of PBS was added to the resulting material to make a 1:4 dilution based on the volume of serum initially introduced. Assay and identification of bovine immunoglobulins. Quantitation of immunoglobulins was made by single radial immunodiffusion according to the method of Kniazeff et al. (1967) using rabbit anti-bovine IgG, IgM and IgA (Miles Laboratories, Elkhard, Indiana). Of each test serum, 0.005 or 0.01 ml was transferred to a well and tests were run in parallel with a standard serum having known concentrations of immunoglobulins. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 22 h, and then examined for the appearance of precipitation rings. Ring diameters were measured to determine Ig concentrations in relation to controls. The lower limit for the detection of IgG, IgM and IgA was 1.6, 4.0 and 5.0 mg/dl, respectively. Immunoglobulins were identified by the slide microgel diffusion precipitin test of Mansi {1958) using rabbit anti-bovine immunoglobulins, IgGl, IgG2, IgM, and IgA.
