The search strategy and eligibility criteria used for identifying methods manuals for guideline development have been described previously [5] . The systematic search identified 'guidelines for guidelines' , guideline method reports and guideline manuals available from guideline development organisations (e.g. international and national agencies, professional societies, etc.), as well as clinical and public health guidelines describing their development process [5] . In addition, we contacted key stakeholders and topicspecific experts to identify relevant manuals. The topicspecific experts have worked in the guidelines for more than 10 years, served on key committees, and attended meetings in the field. Websites of organisations that develop RGs were reviewed to identify methods manuals. On the AGREE II instrument, the credibility of WHO, NICE and CDC guidelines varied across domains ( Table 3) . Participation of stakeholders was usually described in NICE and WHO guidelines while, among guidelines from CDC and other institutions, the scores in that domain were low, varying from 6% to 69%. Similarly, regarding group composition, patient participation was identified in all NICE guidelines, in 30% of WHO guidelines, in only one CDC guideline, and was not reported in the guidelines from other institutions. NICE guidelines described public consultation. Experts in guideline methods participated in all NICE guidelines and in 30% of WHO guidelines, but other institutions did not mention their participation. The use of tables summarising the characteristics and effects across studies or frameworks occurred in most of the NICE guidelines and approximately half of the guidelines from WHO; however, there was no description of these in the guidelines from other institutions. WHO reported the methods used to achieve consensus among members of the guideline development group in the majority of their guidelines; no other organisations mentioned their decisionmaking processes. Within the domain 'rigor of development' , both WHO and NICE guidelines scored higher than the CDC and others. WHO guidelines had lower scores in the applicability domain. Only WHO and NICE consistently described the external review process for their guidelines. Regarding editorial independence, WHO guidelines achieved the highest scores compared with NICE, CDC and others. In addition, AGREE II scores for clarity of presentation were high for both WHO and NICE guidelines. The median (minimum and maximum) AGREE II overall assessment score was 6.0 (5.0-6.5) for NICE, 6.0 (4.5-6.5) for WHO and 4.5 (3.5-5.0) for CDC. The overall assessment score for other institutions was 5.0 (2.5-5.0). Of the 35 methods manuals previously identified on guideline development, only WHO, NICE and CDC provided guidance on RG development (Table 4 ) [1, 54, 55] .
