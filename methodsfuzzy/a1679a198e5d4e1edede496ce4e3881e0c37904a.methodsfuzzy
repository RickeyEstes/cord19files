The research was carried out between 2003 and 2005, in 14 out of 16 Polish provinces. The diarrhoea of unweaned piglets was observed on all of the examined farms. Overall, 780 litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined. The Iinvestigation was conducted on three types of farms: 63 large farms (>100 sows), 30 medium farms (25-100 sows) and 11 small farms (<25 sows). The examined swine groups were comprised of: 571 litters and 159 sows from large farms, 171 litters and 98 sows from medium sized farms, and 38 litters and 10 sows from small farms. Faecal samples of 5 to 28-day-old piglets were collected directly from the rectum. Samples were taken from 3 to 5 piglets per litter and pooled. 5-10% of litters from each farm were investigated. In addition a faecal samples was collected from the mother sows directly from the rectum, or from the floor directly after defecation. The faeces were analyzed with the McMaster method in Raynaud modification and the OPG value (number of oocysts per gram of faeces) was estimated according to this method (Raynaud, 1970) . The saturated NaCl solution sugar enriched (1 litre of saturated NaCl + 500 g sugar) was used at room temperature (specific gravity 1.3). The enrichment of flotation solution with sugar improved the microscopic examination of the samples of fatty faeces of suckling piglets. The samples were examined at 100Â magnification and in questionable cases at 400Â magnification. Samples with unsporulated oocysts were mixed with 2.5% potassium dichromate solution and stored on Petri dishes at 25 8C in order to induce the sporulation. The species of coccidia were defined based on oocysts morphology and sporulation time. Chi-squared test with Yates correction was used to compare the prevalence of coccidia in piglets and sows of different types of farms. OPG values obtained in piglets and sows in different types of farms were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test (exceptionally, Kolmogorov-Smirnow test was used in the analysis of I. suis OPG in sows). The differences were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. All the data were analysed by the use of the STATISTICA 7.1 (StatSoft).
