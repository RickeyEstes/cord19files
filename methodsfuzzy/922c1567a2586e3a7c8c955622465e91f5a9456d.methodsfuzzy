2.1. siRNA design, synthesis, and screening siRNAs were rationally designed according to new strategies as described recently [31, 35] . The candidate siRNAs scored to six or more were selected and subjected to a BLAST search against GenBank to ensure that they are unique to SCoV genome sequences only. Three siR-NAs targeting each gene were designed and chemically synthesized by Proligo BioTech Ltd. (Paris, France). Their antiviral effects were detected by cytopathic effects (CPE) assay and those siRNAs markedly inhibited CPEs were chosen for this study. The sense-strand sequences of these siRNAs are CACUGAUUCCGUUCGAGAUC (SARSi-S); CGUUU-CGGAAGAAACAGGUAC (SARSi-E); CAAGCCUCUUCUCG-CUCCUC (SARSi-N); UGCUUGCUGCUGUCUACAG (SARSi-M1); and GUGGCUUAGCUACUUCGUUG (SARSi-M2). The sequences are corresponding to nucleotide 23150-23169, 26113-26133, 28648-28667, 26576-26594, and 26652-26671 of GZ50 stain (Accession number AY304495), respectively ( Fig. 1) . SARSi-R, the most potent siRNA targeting rep gene (GCACUUGUCUACCUUGAUG, Ref. [36] ), was used as positive control in this study. A siRNA targeting luciferase mRNA [33] , was used as a SARS-unrelated siRNA control. All the siR-NAs were labeled with fluorescence at 5 0 -end of the sense strands.
