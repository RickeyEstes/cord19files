Perkinsus marinus and dinoflagellate cultures, RNA isolation and cDNA construction Perkinsus marinus isolate ATCC 50439 and P. chesapeaki ATCC PRA-65 were grown in tissue culture flasks with liquid media, samples (3-4610 6 cells) were collected by centrifugation and total RNAs were isolated as reported previously [14] . Dinoflagellates Amphidinium carterae (CCMP1314) and Karlodinium veneficum (CCMP2778) were grown in f/2 seawater medium at 20uC at a 12 h:12 h light:dark photocycle with a photon flux of approximately 50 mE?m 22 s 21 . When the cultures were in the exponential growth phase, ,1610 6 cells were harvested and total RNAs isolated according to Zhang et al. [8] . These RNAs were used for cDNA synthesis as described previously [8] . Identification of the SL RNA genes from the P. marinus genome project Perkinsus spp. were suspected to possess a SL sequence similar to that of dinoflagellates (DinoSL; [8] ). Two types of SL sequences were detected at the 59 end of P. marinus full-length cDNAs of pcna and cyclins [14] , PmaSL1, 59-ACCGTAGCCATCTTGGCT-CAAG-39 (22 nt) and PmaSL2, 59-ACCGTAGCCATCTGGCT-CAAG-39 (21 nt). These two Perkinsus SL sequences were used to query P. marinus whole-genome shotgun reads [http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/46451] to identify SL RNA genes. For hits with 85-100% identity to the queries, the genome sequences were collected for alignment with one another and with SL RNAs from dinoflagellates. Type-specific primers were designed for amplifying the putative SL RNAs (Table 1) .
