Ecuador is crossed by the equator and divided into four regions: the Coast, Sierra and Oriente in the mainland, and the Gal√°pagos Islands in the Pacific. Most of Ecuador's population lives in the Coast (52.6%) and Sierra (42.1%) regions; the median age is 27.7 years [11] . The following respiratory viruses were searched: influenza (pandemic AH1N1, AH3N2, B), RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2 and 3), and (since 2014) human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The detection of respiratory viruses was made using nasal swabs. Laboratory tests were conducted at the National Influenza Reference Laboratory in Guayaquil and in the two regional laboratories in Quito and Cuenca. The detection of influenza viruses was performed using realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in accordance to the protocol of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [14] . The viral RNA was extracted using commercially available kits (Quick-RNA TM Viral, Zymo Research, and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, QIAGEN) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers. Specimens whose crossing point in the amplification curve was between 16 and 37 were considered as positive. The detection of respiratory viruses other than influenza was made using direct immunofluorescence assays (Light Diagnostics TM Respiratory Viral Screen and Identification DFA Kit, Millipore; and D 3 Ultra TM DFA Respiratory Virus Screening and ID Kit, Diagnostic Hybrids).
