All tissues were routine stn'gical (products of conception, endometrial curettage, placentae, and umbilical cords) or autopsy (neonates and infants) specimens fixed in 10 per cent buffered formalin or Bouin's solution (placentae and cords only) and embedded in paraffin. The products of conception and endometrial tissues had been collected from 1981 to 1984 at the Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic. The placentae, umbilical cords, and neonatal or infant tissues had been collected from 1981 to 1984 at the University of California San Diego Medical Center. Some neonatal cases had been submitted from other hospitals for consultation. Serial 4-I.tm sections were attached to glass slides with either 1 per cent Elmer's glue in deionized water or chromic acidfpoly-D-Iysine (50 per cent chromic acid in deionized water for 30 minntes at room temperature, followed by rinsing and 0.01 per cent poly-D-lysine [Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri] in deionized water for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by rinsing). The paraffin sections were not dried in an oven, but were left at room temperature for at least two hours before routine rentoval of paraffin and immunohistochemical staining. All of the following steps were done at room temperature in a humidified box. The tissue sections were treated with 0.25 per cent crude porcine trypsin (Sigma, catalog no. T-8128) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 60 minutes and rinsed with PBS by a jet-dribble technique. Primary polyclonal rabbit anti-HSV type 1 and type 2 IgG (Dako, Santa Barbara, California; lots 059A and 1188, respectively) and nonimmune rabbit IgG (Cappell Labs, West Chester, Pennsylvania) were incubated for 22 to 24 hours at 1:2,000 (HSV types 1 and 2) and at 10 txg/ml (nonimmune rabbit IgG) in PBS+ (PBS with 0.2 per cent sodium azide [Sigma] and 0.1 per cent bovine serum albumin [Calbiochem, La Jolla, California; type V]). The tissues were again rinsed with PBS, and biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG (3.25 lag/ntl PBS + ; Vector Labs, Burlingame, California), biotinylated horse antimouse IgG (30 Ixg/ml, Vector), or biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (7.5 Ixg/ml, Vector), depending on the species of primary antibody (see table 2), was added for 30 minutes. After PBS rinsing, a glucose oxidase-avidin-biotin complex (ABC-GO, Vector) was added for 30 minutes at room temperature. The staining reaction was identical to the previously described glucose oxidaseavidin-biotin (GAB) technique originally used in this study. 3 Tetranitroblue tetrazolium (TNBT) formazan formation (Vector) was used to detect sites of antibody binding. This "colorization reaction" was identical to that originally used in this study. 3 After a deionized water rinse, aqueous counterstaining was accomplished with 0.25 per cent metanil yellow in deionized water for 1 minute, deionized water rinse, and 0.1 per cent nuclear fast red for 5 minutes; a 0.45-~m filter (Gelman Acrodisc, Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, Michigan) was used at the time of addition to remove microcrystals. Aquamount (Lerner Labs, New Haven, Connecticut) was used for coverslipping. No loss of stain occurred during a four-year period. For statistical analyses a Clinfo software program was used in the Scripps Clinic General Clinical Research Center. All data were nonparametric, except for the patient age data, which were normally distributed and analyzed by the Anderson-Darling t-test. The nonparametric data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon nonpaired rank sum test.
