The computations are carried out by using a commercial program, Fluent [15] . This program solves the governing equations in a finite-volume procedure with a staggered grid system. The turbulent effect is simulated by the renormalization group (RNG) k-e model. All thermophysical properties are assumed to be constant except for density, which is treated with the Boussinesq model. The Boussinesq model approximates density in the buoyancy term in the momentum equation by the following equation: The generation of turbulence due to buoyancy in the transport equations for k and e equations is included by The convection terms are discretized by second order upwind scheme and the diffusion term by central differences and with second-order accuracy. The SIMPLE algorithm [16] is adopted as pressure-velocity coupling method. The elementary flow characteristics involved in the present study are natural convection flows in a cavity and forced convection flows over a bluff body. As validations of the above model, the simulations on natural convection and forced convection are compared with the measured data from the literature. In particular, the experimental data from Denmark Aalborg University [17] are also used to validate the modeling of pure buoyancy-driven singlesided natural ventilation.
