Virus detection in shellfish has to overcome several difficulties. On the one hand, viruses are expected to be present in shellfish in very low numbers, which nevertheless are sufficient to pose a health risk. This low virus load implies the use of methodologies yielding a high efficiency of virus recovery from shellfish tissues. On the other hand, shellfish extracts are both highly cytotoxic and not adequate to be inoculated in cell cultures for the detection of culturable viruses, and not compatible either with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methodologies for the detection of non-culturable viruses, particularly if a reverse transcription must be previously performed (RT-PCR). The key objective is then to develop procedures for shellfish analysis which result in a low volume of a non-cytotoxic or, even better nowadays, highly pure nucleic acid preparation with no inhibitory effect to the PCR. As a matter of fact, in this latter case, the degree of virus detection effectiveness achieved after RT-PCR is essentially the result of two related factors: the efficiency of recovery of the extraction procedure applied to the shellfish sample and the degree of final purity of the recovered virus. Table 3 .3 lists different procedures for the processing of shellfish samples prior to the detection of specific viruses by molecular procedures since the most relevant shellfish-borne viral pathogens are non-culturable. The first decision is to choose between performing virus detection in dissected shellfish tissues or in whole shellfish meats. Studies on the localisation of human enteric viruses in shellfish tissues have revealed that most of the viruses are found in the stomach and digestive diverticula (Romalde et al., 1994; Abad et al., 1997) . Atmar and co-workers reasoned that removal of these organs for virus extraction might simplify and shorten the time needed to purify viral nucleic acid for RT-PCR but also improve the sensitivity by increasing the number of individuals analysed (Atmar et al., 1996) . Testing the stomach and digestive gland for virus detection presented several advantages in comparison with testing whole shellfish: less time-consuming procedure, increased test sensitivity, and decrease in the sample-associated interference with RT-PCR. Following virus extraction, a variety of subsequent nucleic acid extraction and purification protocols may be employed (Table 3 .3). Owing to the small size Schwab et al. (2000); Shieh et al. (1999) of the PCR reaction volumes, a reconcentration step is incorporated prior to the molecular assay. Nucleic acid purification based on virus lysis with guanidine and recovery with a silica matrix (Boom et al., 1990; Lees et al., 1994) , or, alternatively, the use of organic solvents for purification, followed by nucleic acid precipitation using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (Atmar et al., 1995; Jaykus et al., 1994) , remain the procedures of choice. A wide variety of commercial kits have been applied for nucleic acid purification, offering reliability combined with convenience (Shieh et al., 1999; Loisy et al., 2000; Schwab et al., 2000) . Molecular analysis of viruses in environmental samples involves problems with inhibitors, low virus concentrations, and sequence variation. As the concentration-extraction procedure is not virus specific, the nucleic acid of several viruses can be extracted at the same time. RT-PCR must be performed under stringent conditions and confirmed by hybridisation. Sometimes it is necessary to analyse the amplified sequence in order to characterise the viral strains. This is particularly important for norovirus detection, owing to its wide strain diversity. However, sequence analysis is hampered by the sometimes scarce product obtained after PCR amplification from shellfish tissues. In addition, the high genetic diversity of norovirus makes it necessary to use broadly reactive primers. Despite several improvements in the methodology, up to now no single primer set is able to amplify all strains (Atmar and Estes, 2001; Vinje et al., 2003) . In the absence of such a universal primer set, multiple sets need to be used to detect all strains (Le Guyader et al., 1996a) . The use of multiple primer sets enhances the chance to detect a greater number of strains, and the homology of the primers with the norovirus strain is important in terms of sensitivity (Le Guyader et al., 1996a; Atmar and Estes, 2001) . No single assay stands out as the best by all criteria such as evaluation of sensitivity, detection limit, and assay format for stool analysis, and thus it is even more difficult for shellfish sample with very low contamination (Vinje et al., 2003) . For hepatitis A virus, primer selection is easier since the degree of variation, particularly in the non-coding regions, is significantly lower (Costafreda et al., 2006) . Not too long ago, methods for the detection of viral pathogens were restricted to assays for culturable viruses, focused almost entirely on enteroviruses, and the BGM cell line has long been the choice for infectivity assays of enteroviruses in environmental samples (Morris and Waite, 1980; Bosch, 1998) . Despite the fact that enteroviruses do not appear as epidemiologically relevant environmental contaminants, it will remain important to gather data on their occurrence in the environment until the global eradication of poliomyelitis becomes a reality. However, even for this latter purpose, molecular tools provide better perspectives than cell culture techniques. Wild-type rotaviruses present difficulties in their in vitro replication, although most isolates may be adapted to grow in several cell lines such as the monkey kidney cell line MA104 or the human intestinal cell line CaCo-2 (Kitamoto et al., 1991) . The standard methods for the diagnosis of specific infectious rotaviruses involve immunofluorescence tests and optical microscopic counting of infected foci in the culture (Smith and Gerba, 1982; Hejkal et al., 1984; Bosch et al., 1988) . A further refinement in this direction was the use of flow cytometry for the detection of fluorescent foci in rotavirus infected cells (Abad et al., 1998) . Flow cytometry is applicable for the detection of rotaviruses in environmental samples through an automatable and standardisable procedure that is much less cumbersome than direct optical microscopy screening of cell cultures for fluorescent foci. Another approach for the recovery of viruses that replicate poorly in cell cultures is to employ an integrated cell culture-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction system (CC-RT-PCR), enabling the in vivo amplification of virus sequences in cell culture prior to their detection by PCR, thus accomplishing the dual purpose of increasing the number of copies of target nucleic acid and of incorporating an infectivity assay as well (Ma et al., 1994; Pinto Ã‚ et al., 1995) . This approach has been reported for detection of infectious astrovirus (Abad et al., 1997) and enterovirus (Reynolds et al., 1996; Murrin and Slade, 1997) . Whenever possible, the use of a combined CC-RT-PCR procedure that utilises the major advantages of the separate methodologies, while overcoming many of their disadvantages is recommended. The inclusion of an infectivity test prior to the specific detection may contribute to solve the lack of sensitivity required for some type of samples such as environmental samples. However, so far the use of cell monolayers is of little use for the primary isolation of hepatitis A virus and unavailable for norovirus detection. The requirement of sophisticated facilities and well-trained personnel to conduct studies with enteric viruses and the unreliability of bacterial model microorganisms led to the search for alternatives. Several bacteriophage groups appear as promising candidates, among them somatic coliphages (IAWPRC Study Group on Health Related Water Microbiology, 1991), F+ specific (malespecific), RNA (FRNA) bacteriophages (Havelaar, 1993) and Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophages (Tartera and Jofre, 1987) , all of them with available ISO (International Standardisation Office) procedures for their detection in water. FRNA phages in particular have been described as promising candidates to evaluate the virological quality of shellfish (Lees, 2000) . Several studies have shown a correlation between the elimination kinetics of F+ RNA phages and those of enteric viruses Collins, 1989, 1990; Dore and Lees, 1995) . Nevertheless reports on discrepancies in the occurrences of FRNA phages and pathogenic viruses are frequent. In shellfish associated with a large outbreak of hepatitis A reported in the East of Spain in 1999, with 184 serologically confirmed cases, the discrepancy observed between hepatitis A virus and FRNA phages was 55%, while a 50% discordance was ascertained between generic enteric virus occurrence and F+ presence . In another study comparing the validity of E. coli, enterovirus and FRNA bacteriophages as indicator microorganisms, the phages failed to predict the risk of viral illness (Miossec et al., 2001) . Additionally, when the comparative positivity for human enteric viruses and FRNA phages was investigated in 101 randomly chosen shellfish samples from South and West coast of France, a good correlation between the occurrence of enteric viruses and FRNA phages was observed in only 49% of the samples (Le Guyader, unpublished results). Phages that could be reliable indicators in some cases can be used to classify areas for sanitary safety, but cannot determine if a batch of shellfish is viruscontaminated (Hernroth et al., 2002) . In the same type of cold seawater, a correlation was found between noroviruses and phage contamination of mussels, but more than half of the norovirus-positive samples were negative for FRNA phages. A positive FRNA phage result was less than twice as common in samples with norovirus than in those without norovirus, raising the question of use of FRNA phages as reliable indicators (Myrmel et al., 2004) . A study conducted among different European countries showed geographic variations with shellfish collected from Southern Europe negative for FRNA contained human viruses (Formiga-Cruz et al., 2002) . In Italy, most of shellfish found contaminated with hepatitis A virus did not present any phage or E. coli contamination (Croci et al., 2000) . Recently a 1-year study in the Netherlands showed the presence of phages in 67% of oyster samples analysed, but without the presence of pathogenic viruses such as norovirus or hepatitis A virus (Lodder-Verschoor et al., 2005) . Exhaustive studies are still required to ascertain the validity of a candidate indicator in a given scenario. A`universal' indicator for viruses, applicable to all situations, is probably unrealistic and the use of particular indicator, index, and model microorganisms for specific purposes is in order. The advent of molecular techniques for virus detection, and particularly RT-PCR, provided exquisite tools for the detection of fastidious health-significant viruses in food and environmental samples. Health-significant viruses, which were previously unrecognisable because they replicate poorly or not at all in cell cultures, became detectable with nucleic acid-based techniques. Virologists initially employed hybridisation assays which have been more recently replaced by polymerase chain reaction based procedures (Lees et al., 1994; Jothikumar et al., 1995; Bosch et al., 1996; Jaykus et al., 1996; Le Guyader et al., 1996a; Pinto Ã‚ et al., 1996; Schwab et al., 1998; Villena et al., 2003) . Many potential users may find PCR cumbersome, since a single test entails many different manual steps, and will consider the technique as suitable only for academic or reference laboratories, and inadequate for routine monitoring. However, over the last decade, PCR technology has improved on several fronts. On the one hand, commercial PCR systems significantly ameliorated convenience, and have been quickly adopted for diagnostic laboratories. Nevertheless, the most dramatic improvement comes from the emergence of combined rapid thermocycling and fluorescence monitoring of amplified product, collectively referred as`rapid-cycling real-time PCR' (Cockerill and Smith, 2002; Gassilloud et al., 2003; Kageyama et al., 2003; Loisy et al., 2005a; Costafreda et al., 2006) , together with nucleic acid sequence-based amplification or NASBA techniques (Jean et al., 2001; Yates et al., 2001) , both of which are now applicable in several commercially available systems. These procedures enable not only qualitative determination but also, and particularly, quantitative diagnostic assays. Although the generic determination of pathogens is the essence of diagnostic practices, the possibility for quantitative detection of virus agents represents a seminal refinement in routine monitoring virology. As stated above, norovirus and hepatitis A virus are the two most significant virus targets in shellfish tissues, owing to their incidence and pathogenicity. For this reason, considerable attention has been dedicated to the development of real-time procedures for the detection of these agents in bivalve molluscan shellfish (Nishida et al. 2003; Jothikumar et al. 2005; Loisy et al., 2005a; Costafreda et al., 2006) . However, methods cited in the literature are diverse, complex, poorly standardised and restricted to a few specialist laboratories. It is obvious that quality control and quality assurance issues must be solved, as well as simplification and automation of molecular procedures before they could be adopted by routine monitoring laboratories. An additional difficulty to solve in the detection of viruses in molluscs is that traditional shellfish extraction procedures are not always compatible with RT-PCR detection: inhibitory substances are concentrated and recovered along with the viruses. A great variety of procedures have been developed for the removal of inhibitors, which include dialysis, solvent extraction, proteinase treatments, lyophilisation, gel or glass filtration, nucleic acid adsorption or precipitation, antibody capture, and the use of commercial kits (Tsai et al., 1993; Atmar et al., 1995; Jaykus et al., 1996; Shieh et al., 1999; Loisy et al., 2000; Schwab et al., 2000) . The rule of thumb is that the degree of final purity of the assayed sample greatly determines the sensitivity of PCR, or particularly, RT-PCR virus detection. Methodologies for the accurate quantification of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in shellfish samples are being developed. The general approach is based on the use of several controls to measure the efficiency of those critical steps for the quantification: the virus and nucleic acids extractions, and the RT-PCR reactions. The first purpose involves the use of a non-pathogenic virus of similar structural characteristics to those of the target virus. In the case of hepatitis A virus, since it belongs to the Picornaviridae family, another member of the same family is used to validate the behaviour of hepatitis A virus during its extraction from the shellfish tissue as well as during the nucleic acids extraction procedures (Costafreda et al., 2006) . Encephalomiocarditis virus (EMCV) has been proposed as a model for hepatitis A virus in validation studies of hepatitis A virus removal in blood products manufacturing by several agencies such as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal products (http://www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/bwp/026995en.pdf) or the US FDA (http:// www.fda.gov/cber/sba/igivbax042705S.pdf). However, the use of this virus is hampered by its potential pathogenicity in several animals, including primates (Citino et al., 1988) including humans (Kirkland et al., 1989) . Mengo virus is serologically indistinguishable from EMCV, and non-pathogenic for humans, although it may infect several other animals. The removal of the poly-C tract from the 5 H NCR of the wild-type Mengo virus, gives rise to a mutant strain, i.e. Mengo virus vMC0, with the same growth and structural properties but with no pathogenic capacity (Martin et al., 1996) . Mengo virus vMC0 is employed as an extraction control for hepatitis A virus (Costafreda et al., 2006) , since it represents a phenotypic variant of Mengo virus, avirulent in all animal species (murine and non-murine) so far tested, and used as a vaccine for a wide variety of hosts, including baboons, macaques and domestic pigs . The same Mengo virus vMC0 is at the time of writing this chapter validated within the framework of an EU committee (CEN TAG4) as an extraction control, not only for hepatitis A virus but also for other viruses, such as norovirus, in shellfish, and other food matrices as fruits and salads. It is well known that one limitation of molecular techniques is that they fail to discern between infectious and non-infectious particles which may be of critical relevance in environmental virology (Abad et al., 1994; Gassilloud et al., 2003) . Several issues should, however, be taken into consideration. Most enteric viruses of public health concern bear RNA genomes. In studies employing RT-PCR, it has been shown that poliovirus genomic RNA is not stable in non-sterilised seawater (Tsai et al., 1995) . Although free DNA is fairly stable, it is unlikely that a free single-stranded RNA genome like those of noroviruses or hepatitis A virus would remain stable without its protein coat in the marine environment. This presumption is less clear for the double stranded RNA genome of rotaviruses. A possible approach for the molecular recovery of infectious viruses is to employ an antibody capture RT-PCR. This has been applied to the detection of hepatitis A virus in seeded shellfish samples and shown to be both sensitive and useful to remove RT-PCR inhibitors as well (Graff et al., 1993; Deng et al., 1994; Lo Ã‚pez-Sabater et al., 1997) . Since recognition by a conformationally dependent monoclonal antibody is lost when the particle conformation is altered, coupling of the molecular procedure with capture with this type of antibody may enable to discern between intact and altered virions. This approach may prove useful for other enteric viruses, provided that adequate immunological reagents for the most relevant viral pathogens are available. For this purpose, recombinant virus-like particles, which can be obtained in very high numbers in in vitro expression systems (Crawford et al., 1994; Lawton et al., 1997; Caballero et al., 2004) , may be employed for the production of antibodies of non-culturable viruses. Recent developments describe methods based on antigenic detection for norovirus (Tian and Mandrell, 2006; Colquhoum et al., 2006) but the high diversity of norovirus may limit their specificity and sensitivity (Zheng et al., 2006) .
