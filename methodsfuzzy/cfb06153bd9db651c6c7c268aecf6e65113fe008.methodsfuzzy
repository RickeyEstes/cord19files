Cells and plasmids TBK1 and TRAF3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (Tbk1 2/2 and Traf3 2/2 MEF cells), wild-type MEF cells [43, 44] , and HEK293T cells (ATCC, USA) were routinely maintained in DMEM (Hyclone, UT) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, Pasching, Austria) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Hyclone, UT). Cell line 17Cl-1 is a kind gift from Dr K Holmes (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, USA). The overexpression constructs, pCMV-Myc-PLP2, its DUB mutant derivative, pCMV-Myc-PLP2-C106A, and pFlag-CMV2-IRF3 were described previously [31] . To construct bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-2-PLP2, the DNA fragment encoding PLP2 was subcloned in frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P-2 vector (GE Healthcare). Full-length human Tbk1 gene was PCR subcloned into different pCMV vectors (Clontech) in between SalI and NotI sites, to generate plasmids of Flag-or Myc-tagged TBK1. Wild-type ubiquitin expression vector pRK5-HA-Ub and arginine substitutions of all lysine residues except for position 63 (designated as Ub-K63) [45] , were provided by Dr K Lim (National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore). Bacterial expression vector, pGEX-4T-1-IRF3-131C [46] , that expressing a GST-tagged Cterminal domain of IRF3 (GST-IRF3 131-426 ), was kindly provided by Dr I. Rogatsky (Weill Medical College of Cornell University, USA). Full-length mouse Ceacam-1 gene was created by PCR and was subcloned in frame into pBABE-puro vector in between EcoRI and SalI sites, to generate MHV receptor (MHVR) expression vector pBABE-puro-mCEACAM-1. To establish cell lines stably expressing MHVR, HEK293T cells seeded in a 12-well plate were transfected with 1.6 mg pBABE-puro-mCEACAM-1, and the stable clone was selected by 20-fold dilution in the presence of 1 mg/mL puromycin.
