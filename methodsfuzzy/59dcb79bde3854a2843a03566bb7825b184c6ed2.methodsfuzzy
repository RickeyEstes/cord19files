2.1. In vitro synthesis of siRNAs siRNAs were generated using the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). In brief, sequence candidates from VP1 gene of FMDV for siRNAs synthesis were selected using the web-based tool siRNA Target Designer (Version 1.51) from Promega (http://www.promega.com/siRNADesigner/) which meets the sequence requirement that the presence of a ''5 0 -GN 17 C-3 0 " sequence in the target RNA is needed. Specificity of the sequence candidates was verified by BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ ). The DNA templates for in vitro transcription of siRNAs contain T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and six extra nucleotides upstream of the minimal promoter sequence and an additional two adenine nucleotides are added to the 5 0 end of templates. The pEGFP-N1-siRNA (Qin et al., 2004) and scrambled-siRNA were also chosen as positive and negative siRNA control, respectively. The oligonucleotide-directed production of small interfering RNA with T7 RNA polymerase was carried out using T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Betz, 2003) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sense and antisense 21-nucleotide RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions, incubating at 70°for 10 min, followed by 20 min at room temperature to obtain small interfering doublestranded RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. The mixture was then purified by isopropanol precipitation followed by 70% ethanol washing, dried and resuspended in appropriate amount of nuclease-free water. siRNA aliquots were stored at À80°until used.
