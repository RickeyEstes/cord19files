Viruses are very small and are likely to occur in the environment in large volumes of water or in problematic food matrices. The default detection method was to infect susceptible cell cultures, which have a limited capacity for sample volume, a low tolerance for food residues, and the high susceptibility to contaminating bacteria and molds. We and others faced the challenge of concentrating virus from large volumes of fluid suspension, perhaps after separating the virus from a solid food sample.
