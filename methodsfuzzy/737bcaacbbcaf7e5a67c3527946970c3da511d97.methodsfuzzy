2.1. Animals and treatment protocols 11 FIV-positive cats were treated with oral rFeIFN-x (PO Group) and the results were compared with data previously obtained from 7 FIV-positive cats treated with the licensed protocol (SC Group). The inclusion criteria used were based on previous publications (de Mari et al., 2004; Gil et al., 2013) . No medications apart from rFeIFN-x were allowed during the period of the study. Retroviral status was confirmed in all the animals by ELISA kits using serum or plasma samples from D0 (Viracheck/FIV and Viracheck/FeLV, Synbiotics). The results of the SC Group were previously published as a single-arm trial which evaluated clinical improvement and concurrent viral excretion (Gil et al., 2013) . The data from this group were considered as a positive control for the current study. The PO Group consisted of 11 naturally FIV-infected cats referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which were treated, after obtaining the owner's consent, with 0.1 MU/cat rFeIFN-x orally, once a day for 90 consecutive days. 6/11 cats were single-housed or lived indoor with no more than one other cat while 5/11 cats were outdoor animals or came from a multi-cat environment. To obtain the correct dose, a vial containing the rFeIFN-x freeze-dried pellet (10 MU) was diluted in 25 ml of sterile physiological saline. Single-doses were prepared using 1 ml syringes containing 0.25 ml each by one of the members of the research group and given to owners who were instructed how to administer the therapy. The syringes were kept frozen (À18 to À20°C) after preparation and owners defrosted each single dose shortly before administration. All animals were submitted to full clinical evaluations on days 0 (before therapy), 10, 30 and 65. Animals in the PO Group had an additional evaluation on day 90 (end of therapy).
