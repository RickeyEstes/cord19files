NHNP TLA 3D cell culture system NHNP cells were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA) and propagated in GTSF-2, a unique media containing glucose, galactose and fructose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), at 37uC under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere [67] [68] [69] . NHNP cells were initially grown as monolayers in human fibronectin-coated flasks (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and pooled from at least five donors, as described previously [70] . NHNP cell cultures were expanded, tested for viral contaminants as pre-certified by the manufacturer's production criteria (Lonza), and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Three-dimensional (3D) NHNP TLAs were generated by seeding 3610 5 NHNP cells/ml onto 3 mg/ml Cultispher beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) into a 55 ml rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV; Synthecon, Houston, TX) and grown at 37uC under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were allowed to attach to the beads for 48 h in the bioreactor before re-feeding with GTSF-2 containing 10% FBS. To maintain the TLA cultures within normal human physiological blood chemistry parameters (pH 7.2 and a glucose concentration of 80-120 mg/dL), 20-90% of the media was replaced as required with fresh GTSF-2 media every 48 h, facilitating efficient TLA tissue growth and maturation prior to VZV infection. All metabolic determinations were made using an iStat hand held blood gas analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).
