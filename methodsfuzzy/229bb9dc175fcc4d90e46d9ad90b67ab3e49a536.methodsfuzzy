Cell lines and viruses. Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . 293T cells stably expressing IFITM proteins or CAT (22) as well as CMMT-CD4-LTR-␤-Gal (sMAGI, simian multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator) cells were previously described (28) and were also grown in DMEM supplemented with FCS and antibiotics. The BHK-G43 cell line, which expresses VSV-G upon mifepristone treatment (kindly provided by Georg Herrler), has also been described previously (30) . Further, a previously reported FLUAV encoding Gaussia luciferase was used (31) . Plasmids. Plasmids encoding the glycoproteins of murine leukemia virus (MLV-Env) (32), FLUAV (strain A/WSN/33, FLUAV-HA; neuraminidase was coexpressed during particle production to ensure efficient particle release) (33), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) (34), Nipah virus (NiV-F, NiV-G) (35), Machupo virus (MACV-GPC) (6) , and SIVmac239 (SIV-Env) (23) have been described previously. The MLV-based vector pQCXIP encoding IFITM proteins or CAT and the MLV gag-pol-encoding plasmid were previously described (22) and were employed for expression of IFITM proteins in 293T cells. Vector MLV-luc (22) and the SIV-based vector SIVmac239 Δenv Δnef Luc (23), both encoding firefly luciferase (fLuc), were also previously reported and were used to quantify transduction mediated by the viral glycoproteins under study. The plasmids encoding EBOV VP40 and HIV-1 p55 Gag fused with the ␣ fragment of ␤-galactosidase and the plasmid encoding the fragment of ␤-galactosidase have also been documented previously (36, 37) . A VSV minigenome (VSV-mini) was constructed as follows. First, the genetic information for all VSV genes and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was excised from the pUC18_VSV24* plasmid, a modified VSV genome in which each gene is flanked by identical restriction sites for convenient cloning (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer), making use of AvrII and NheI restriction sites of the nucleoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. By this process, only the leader and trailer sequences of the parental VSV genome were left between the T7 promoter (T7Pro) at the 5= end and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV-R) and the T7 terminator (T7Ter) at the 3= end. Next, a chimeric reporter gene consisting of eGFP and fLuc (eGFP-fLuc), fused via a linker sequence (GGG CCC GAT CCT CCT GTT GCT ACT), was generated by overlap extension PCR and ligated between the leader and trailer sequences, yielding a VSV minigenome of positive orientation (5=-T7Pro-leader-eGFP-fLuc-trailer-HDV-R-T7Ter Ϫ3=). To generate expression plasmids for VSV-N, -P, and -L, which together build the viral polymerase complex responsible for genome replication and synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, the respective ORFs from the pUC18_VSV24* plasmid were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCAGGS vector by restriction digest (VSV-N, EcoRI/NheI; VSV-P, EcoRI/NheI; VSV-L, NheI/NheI) and ligation. All PCR-amplified sequences were verified by automated sequencing. Production of retroviral vectors and transduction experiments. The production of retroviral vectors encoding IFITM proteins or fLuc and pseudotyped with a viral glycoprotein was described previously (22, 32) . In brief, for production of vectors encoding IFITM proteins, 293T cells were cotrans-fected with plasmids encoding MLV gag-pol and VSV-G and with pQCXIP coding for IFITM proteins or CAT as control. For production of MLV reporter particles, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding MLV gag-pol and the viral glycoprotein under study and an MLV vector coding for fLuc. Similarly, SIV particles were produced by cotransfection of the proviral plasmid SIVmac239 Δenv Δnef Luc containing fLuc in the place of the nef gene and a plasmid encoding the glycoprotein of interest. The culture medium was exchanged at 6 h posttransfection, and supernatants were harvested at 48 h posttransfection. Supernatants were sterile filtered through a 0.45-m filter, aliquoted, and stored at Ϫ80°C. Preparations of luciferase-encoding vectors were normalized for comparable transduction of 293T cells before usage in experiments. Production of VSV pseudotypes. For production of VSV particles, we employed a replicationdeficient VSV vector, VSV*ΔG-fLuc, that contains two separate ORFs, coding for eGFP and fLuc, instead of the genetic information for VSV-G (38) (39) (40) , which was propagated in a previously described VSV-Gexpressing, transgenic cell line (BHK-G43 [30] ). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with expression plasmids encoding the viral surface proteins under study. At 16 h posttransfection, the cells were inoculated with VSV*ΔG-Luc at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Subsequently, the cells were washed and finally received fresh culture medium supplemented with (MACV-GPC, NiV-F/G, FLUAV-HA/NA, MLV-Env, and SIV-Env pseudotyped vectors) or without (VSV-G pseudotyped vectors) neutralizing antibodies against VSV-G (I1; hybridoma supernatant from ATCC CRL-2700). After an additional incubation period of 16 to 20 h, VSV pseudoparticle-containing supernatants were collected, clarified from cell debris by centrifugation, and aliquoted. Aliquots were stored at 4°C for a maximum of 7 days. Inhibition of viral entry by IFITM proteins. In order to analyze IFITM-mediated inhibition of transduction by retroviral vectors, 293T cells were seeded at a density of 10 4 cells per well in 96-well plates and then spinoculated (41) at 4,000 ϫ g for 30 min with IFITM-or CAT-encoding vectors. Alternatively, 293T cells stably expressing IFITM proteins or CAT were used as targets. After incubating the cells for 48 h at 37°C, the culture supernatants were replaced by 50 l of fresh culture medium. Subsequently, the cells were inoculated with 50 l of luciferase-normalized vectors harboring the viral glycoproteins under study and incubated for 8 h. Thereafter, the supernatants were replaced by 150 l of fresh culture medium, and fLuc activity in cell lysates was measured at 72 h postransduction. For this, the cell culture supernatants were removed and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, 50 l of 1ϫ luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) in PBS was added to each well, and the wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the cell lysate was transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific). The measurement of the fLuc activity was carried out in a microplate reader, Plate Chameleon V (Hidex), using the MicroWin2000 software (version 4.44; Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH) and fLuc substrates from the commercial luciferase assay system (Promega) or Beetle-Juice (PJK) kits. Transduction efficiency, represented by fLuc activity, was displayed either in counts per second (c.p.s.) or as normalized values. For analysis of IFITM-mediated inhibition of transduction by rhabdoviral vectors, target cells were prepared as described above and inoculated with VSV pseudotypes for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Afterwards, the cells were washed and further incubated with fresh culture medium for 16 to 18 h followed by quantification of luciferase activity in cell lysates as described above. Analysis of VSV genome replication. To assess VSV genome replication, plasmid VSV-mini was transfected along with pCAGGS plasmids encoding VSV-N, VSV-P, VSV-L, and T7 polymerase (kindly provided by Andrea Marzi) into 293T cell lines stably expressing IFITM proteins or CAT via calcium phosphate precipitation. Upon transfection, the T7 polymerase synthesizes a cRNA copy of the minigenome, which is in the same orientation as authentic VSV genomes in the context of viral infection. The copy RNA then serves as a template for genome replication and synthesis of subgenomic mRNA, which is dependent on VSV-N, -P, and -L. However, instead of the synthesis of mRNAs for viral proteins, only mRNA for eGFP-fLuc is synthesized. At 48 h posttransfection, the medium was removed and fLuc activity in cell lysates was quantified as described above. siRNA knockdown in sMAGI cells. To knock down IFITM expression in sMAGI cells, 6,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and then transfected with siRNAs directed against IFITM3 (Santa Cruz) or against a scrambled sequence using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM and the cells were transduced with the MLV vector encoding luciferase and pseudotyped with SIV-Env. In parallel, IFITM3 expression was analyzed as described below. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were analyzed at 72 h posttransduction as described above. In parallel, cells were inoculated with a Gaussia luciferase-encoding influenza virus at an MOI of 10, input virus was removed by washing, and luciferase activities in cell supernatants were determined at 48 h postinfection. Immunoblotting. For analysis of SIV-Env and Gag or VSV-M incorporation into retro-and rhabdoviral particles, respectively, particles were purified via ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. MLV-Gag was detected using an anti-MLV-p30 mouse antibody (Acris). SIV-Gag was detected using an anti-SIV-p27 mouse antibody (55-2F12). VSV-M detection was performed using an anti-VSV-M antibody (Kerafast). SIV-Env was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody DA6, which recognizes an epitope within gp120 (42) . A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (HϩL) antibody (Dianova) was used for detection employing a commercially available kit (Amersham). To analyze IFITM expression in sMAGI cells, an IFITM3-specific antibody was used (Proteintech).
