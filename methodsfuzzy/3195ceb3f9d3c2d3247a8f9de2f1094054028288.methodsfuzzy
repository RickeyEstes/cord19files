For this method, antibodies purified from the ascites fluid of a cat that had died of effusive FIP (see above) were labelled with peroxidase and diluted 1: 200 for use in the immunohistological incubation. Control group tissues were provided from tissues of cats without FIP alterations, including cats with peritonitis from other causes. Control serum was provided by the use of antibodies prepared as above from the ascites of a FIP-negative cat that had also tested negative for FIP antibodies. The monoclonal antibody 631 was diluted 1 : 400 for the first incubation step, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1 : 100. Controls were as described above except that for the second type of controls an irrelevant murine IgG, monoclonal antibody directed against rat pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type L (Domingo et al., 1992) was used as primary antibody. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase method was performed as described previously (Evensen, 1993) using the monoclonal antibody described above. Briefly, deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed organ samples were pretreated with trypsin and the sections were overlaid with phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (5 mg ml-') to block unspecific binding sites. The monoclonal antibody was diluted 1: 10000 (formalin-fixed specimens) or 1 : 20000 (ethanol-fixed specimens), and incubated for 16-18 h at room temperature. Controls were performed as described above.
