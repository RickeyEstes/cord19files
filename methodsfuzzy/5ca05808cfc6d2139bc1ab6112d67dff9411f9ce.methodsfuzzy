A literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases, with combinations and variants of the keywords "prepublication," "social media," "Twitter," "Facebook," "scooping," "Ingelfinger rule," "publication embargo," and "data sharing". Articles that discussed prepublication release of data, social media release of research data, the use of prepublication data, social media publicization of conferences and journals, the phenomenon of "scooping," and similar topics were included. Presentation and publication guidelines of 10 national surgical society meetings and 13 major surgical journals were reviewed for mention of embargo and social media policies. National meetings were chosen as being probable sites of presentations by society members and those likely to be attended by a wide representation of the respective society. Journals were chosen as being the official organs of the specialty or those very likely to be read by members of a specialty. Abstract submission guidelines were reviewed for mention of data embargos or the use of social media. A data embargo was considered to be present if the guideline specifically stated that material which was to be published before the meeting could not be presented there. Comments regarding the use of social media at the meeting were also looked for. Instructions to authors in journals were reviewed for the presence of data embargos. In this context, an embargo could either be a statement that the material could not be shared with the media or in other broad contexts before publication or that the article itself could not be indiscriminately shared with nonsubscribers to the journal for a given time after publication. The presence of discussion of the use of social media to disseminate key research findings was also noted.
