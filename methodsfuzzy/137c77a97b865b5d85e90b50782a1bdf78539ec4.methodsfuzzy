Study population. The study population included patients of all ages and both genders presenting with signs and/or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection at 13 clinical sites located in the United States and Canada. Residual NPS specimens were prospectively collected from March 2013 through August 2014 from 5 sites and frozen at Ϫ80°C for future testing and were prospectively collected from September through October 2016 from 4 sites and tested fresh. To supplement the results of the prospective collection, NPS samples positive for low-prevalence pathogens were retrospectively collected and frozen. Frozen samples were thawed, pipetted into separate aliquots, and frozen at Ϫ80°C until they were tested by ePlex RP, the BioFire RP, and/or target-specific PCR/bidirectional sequencing as needed. Also, for low-prevalence pathogens, additional contrived samples were used to evaluate assay performance. Overall study design. NPS specimens were prospectively and retrospectively collected in viral transport medium, handled, and processed according to the NPS kit manufacturer's instructions. Either samples were collected specifically for this study, separately from a standard-of-care (SOC) purpose, or the residual sample was deidentified and provided after SOC was completed. The study was approved by a central quorum review institutional review board and/or individual clinical testing site institutional review board. Samples were tested with the ePlex RP panel at 1 of 5 sites and compared to results of testing with BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel version 1.7 (bioMérieux, Durham, NC) and an analytically validated PCR amplification assay(s) followed by bidirectional sequencing, if necessary (e.g., for resolution of discordant results or virus subtyping) (Laboratory Corporation of America, Morrisville, NC). GenMark ePlex RP panel testing. Testing with the ePlex RP panel was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the materials in the kit. Briefly, after vortexing, 200 l of the primary NPS sample was aspirated into the sample delivery device (SDD) provided with the ePlex RP panel kit and vortexed. The entire volume of the SDD was dispensed into the sample loading port of the ePlex RP panel cartridge, and the cap was depressed to close the port. Each cartridge was bar-coded and scanned with the ePlex instrument and inserted into an available bay (Fig. 1) . Upon the completion of the assay run, the ePlex instrument ejected the cartridge for disposal, and an ePlex RP panel report was generated. Comparator method and method for resolution of discordant results. The comparator method was BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel version 1.7. All collected samples were tested with the BioFire RP, which detects all the respiratory viral and bacterial targets included on the ePlex RP panel but does not differentiate between RSV subtypes A and B (12) . Samples with RSV detected by the BioFire RP were additionally tested with an analytically validated PCR amplification assay(s) followed by confirmation by bidirectional sequencing to determine the subtype (Laboratory Corporation of America, Morrisville, NC). Results from collected samples that were discordant between the ePlex RP panel and the comparator method (i.e., false negative [FN] or false positive [FP]) were tested with an analytically validated PCR amplification assay(s) followed by bidirectional sequencing as described above. For coronaviruses, additional repeat testing by the BioFire RP and ePlex RP panel was also conducted as part of discordantresult resolution. Reproducibility study. Three reproducibility panels, each with 6 pathogens (influenza A H3 virus, RSV-A, PIV1, hMPV, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus species B) at 3 different concentrations (moderate [3ϫ the limit of detection {LOD}]), low [1ϫ LOD], and negative) in NPS specimens, were tested at 3 sites. LOD studies were performed by the manufacturer (data not shown). Reproducibility testing was performed by 2 operators at each of 3 sites, and each operator tested the reproducibility panels in triplicate over 6 days (including 5 nonconsecutive days) by using 3 different cartridge lots, resulting in 2 days of testing for each of the 3 lots. Statistical methods. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) with the comparator method results or expected results were determined for each target detected by the ePlex RP panel. The PPA was calculated as 100 ϫ no. of TP/(no. of TP ϩ no. of FN), the NPA was calculated as 100 ϫ no. of TN/(no. of TN ϩ no. of FP), and OPA was calculated as 100 ϫ (no. of TP ϩ no. of TN)/(no. of TP ϩ no. of TN ϩ no. of FP ϩ no. of FN), where TP is true-positive results, FN is false-negative results, TN is true-negative results, and FP is false-positive results. The two-sided 95% score confidence interval (CI) was calculated for PPA, NPA, and OPA. Statistical analysis was performed by using SAS version 9.4. Workflow and turnaround time study. A time study was performed to determine the time needed to perform the ePlex RP panel test. Data were averaged from 20 samples tested by 2 operators. Each step of the process from sample preparation to unloading of the instrument was recorded and timed, and an average TAT was determined.
