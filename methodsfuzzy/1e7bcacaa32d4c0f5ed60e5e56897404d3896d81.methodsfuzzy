The RealAmp method was performed using the commercially available Loopamp DNA amplification kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions with the exception of the addition of 0.25 mL per 12.5 mL reaction volume of a 1:100 diluted SYBR Green (Invitrogen) or by the use of an in-house reaction buffer. To test the utility of an in-house reaction buffer, pilot experiments were performed in a 12.5 mL total volume containing a 2X in-house buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO 4 , 20 mM (NH 4 )SO 4 , 0.2% Tween-20, 0.8M Betaine, 2.8 mM of dNTPs each), 0.25 mL of a 1:100 dilution SYBR green and 8 units of Bst polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Genus specific primers, as described by Han et al. [14] were used to amplify the gene coding for the 18S ribosomal RNA. DNA amplification was carried out at 63uC for 90 minutes using the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner (ESE GmbH., Stockach, Germany) which was set to collect fluorescence signals at 1 minute intervals. A typical realtime amplification plot obtained using the RealAmp method is shown in Figure 1B . In the plot, the Y-axis denotes the fluorescence units in milli-volts (mV) and the X-axis shows the time in minutes. Amplification of P. falciparum DNA yielded sigmoid shaped amplification curve while the control tube (no DNA) had no measurable fluorescence indicated by a flat line in the plot. Clinical samples, with median parasitemia density of 3,200 p/ mL (range 61-248,950 p/mL), were used to test the utility of this platform for the diagnosis of field samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the RealAmp method compared to microscopy and nested PCR is shown in Table 2 . Of the 94 microscopically positive samples tested, 90 samples were confirmed to be positive by the nested PCR and 89 positive by RealAmp. Eleven out of the 12 microscopically negative samples were shown to be negative by the two methods. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp and nested PCR was similar when compared to microscopic data ( Table 2 ). The RealAmp method showed 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1-99.9%) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI: 100%) specificity when compared to nested PCR. We compared DNA obtained by the standard Qiagen method of DNA isolation and that obtained by direct heating for their performance in RealAmp method. As shown in Table 3 , the RealAmp method was able to amplify up to 40p/mL of P. falciparum from heat-treated samples and occasionally up to 4 p/mL whereas, up to 0.4 p/mL were detected when DNA obtained from the Qiagen method was used. There was no consistent amplification below 40 p/mL especially with heat treated DNA. No amplification was detected with heat-treated uninfected whole blood (data not shown). Cost analysis of the RealAmp method compared to the nested PCR Table 4 summarizes the cost of running the RealAmp method compared to that for nested PCR assay. The cost of performing RealAmp was lower when an in-house buffer was used. However, the cost of RealAmp increased when a commercially available buffer was used. The capital investment cost for both PCR and tube scanner was comparable (Table 4 ). In addition, there are important practical advantages of using RealAmp as further discussed.
