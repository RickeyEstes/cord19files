All qRT-PCR experiments were performed on the Rotor-Gene 6000 thermal cycler (Corbett, San Francisco, CA, USA) using Rotor-Gene Probe RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction was multiplexed with RPL18 as the internal reference, using 50 ng of template RNA. The final concentration of each test primer and probe set was 0.4 μM and 0.1 μM, respectively. The final concentration Table 2 List of commercially available, rodent specific, ELISA and Luminex based assays examined for cross-reactivity with hamster proteins. Red indicates acceptable cross-reactivity (within the range of supplied standards), orange indicates marginal cross-reactivity (low or suspiciously high concentrations detected) and blue indicates no cross-reactivity.
