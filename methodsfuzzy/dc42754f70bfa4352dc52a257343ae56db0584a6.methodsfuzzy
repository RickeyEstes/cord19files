A single-center observational clinical study was conducted from August 2009 to October 2009. The first case of H1N1 SOIV was reported in Taiwan in April 2009. Taiwanese hospitals and health care workers started a series of infection control measures to prevent hospital-acquired infection. The Taiwanese Department of Health, collaborating with the CDC and the Bureau of NHI, suggested rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) as a preliminary diagnostic measure. Patients with positive RIDTs were eligible for a free 5-day dose of antiviral agent oseltamivir. Hospitals were encouraged to set up flu clinics to reduce social interactions between patients with influenza-like illness and other patients, especially from immunocompromised patients. 7 Our hospital is a tertiary hospital located in southern Taiwan, equipped with 1,000 total beds, 100 of which are intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The annual census of the ED was approximately 750,000. The mean length of stay (LOS) at the ED during 2008 was 5.6 hours. The LOS for patients who left after ED management (ie, those who were not admitted after the ED visit) was 3.4 hours. To shorten the unnecessary LOS for flu patients and to follow the national policy, we established the RFCS to provide influenza tests and counseling for the H1N1 SOIV in August 2009.
