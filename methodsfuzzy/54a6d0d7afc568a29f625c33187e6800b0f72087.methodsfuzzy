developed using an Amersham ECL Plus Western blot developing kit (GE Healthcare), and densitometric analysis was carried out using ImageJ software. Statistical analysis. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Time course studies were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple-comparison posttest to compare the groups infected with TE, G32S, and Y114A 0 to 6 days after infection. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest was used to compare surviving G32S and Y114A groups at 8 days. Differences in a single group were determined using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test. Differences between groups at a single time point were determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student t test with a 95% confidence interval. The results are expressed as means Ï® the SD. Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 8 (GraphPad).
