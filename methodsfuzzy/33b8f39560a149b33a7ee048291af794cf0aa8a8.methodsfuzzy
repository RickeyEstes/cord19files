Smoke visualizations were carried out to demonstrate the flow patterns across the doorway induced by the hinged and sliding doors and the manikin passage. Theatre smoke was produced with a smoke generator (Martin Magnum 550, Martin Pro-Smoke Super ZRMix fluid, Martin, Denmark). This produced thick yet buoyant smoke suitable for airflow pattern visualization. The particle size distribution of the smoke was not measured, but according to the manufacturer's product document [39] it is around 1e1.5 mm, corresponding to fine particles whose dispersion process is similar with gaseous agents and hence suitable for airflow visualizations. The smoke generator was positioned outside the isolation room model to avoid unnecessary heat sources inside the mock-up. The smoke was dosed through a hose in which the smoke cooled down before entering the model. Only one of the rooms was filled at a time. The smoke was quickly and uniformly mixed inside the room due to effective mixing ventilation. In the empty room (smoke free in the beginning), a vertical or a horizontal sheet was illuminated. The vertical sheet (door wide, narrowing towards the lights) was used for side-view illumination and the horizontal sheet (between 0.6 and 1.4 m above the floor also narrowing towards the lights) for top-view illumination of the smoke. Altogether, the visualizations were recorded from four different angles (side-and top-view on each room) in separate, consecutive experiments, as only one camera (Canon 7D, Canon Inc., Japan) was used, with identical experimental parameters in each scenario. The camera and the lights were positioned far enough from the doorway so as not to interfere with the door and passage induced flows. Still images of the recorded videos are shown and discussed. Tracer gas measurements were carried out to quantify the total volume of air transferred through the doorway induced by the door operation. Two tracer gases, SF 6 and N 2 O, were used simultaneously in the experiments. This made it possible to study the airflows through the doorway in both directions at once. The gases were supplied continuously into different rooms via supply ducts. Mixing ventilation with high airflow rates ensured quick and uniform distribution of the gases inside the rooms. Two gas analysers (Brüel&Kjaer model 1302, Brüel&Kjaer A/S, Denmark), one for SF 6 and one for N 2 O, were used to sample the tracers from the exhaust ducts. Following the onset of the dosing, the tracer gases achieved equilibrium concentrations in their separate rooms. Prior to a door operation the analysers were set to record the equilibrium values in the supply rooms. A moment before the door was opened the analysers were changed to sample the tracer concentration changes in the opposite, empty rooms (i.e. tracer free before the door operation). Short sampling period (sampling interval~40 s) enabled sufficient tracking of the concentration changes within the rooms. During the door operation the tracer gases flowed across the open doorway leading to a sudden increase in their concentrations in the opposite rooms. After the door had closed the tracer migration ceased and the concentrations started to decrease towards the initial background values prior the door operation (see Fig. 5 ). The data analysis of the tracer gas measurements was based on the assumption that the tracers exited the isolation room model only through the exhausts, i.e. there were no leakages. This was considered a valid assumption as the model was made out of carefully fitted cleanroom elements. The air exchange through the doorway was calculated based on the tracer migration from the supply room through the doorway to the empty room induced by the door operation: (1) where m t is the total mass of the tracer gas migrating from the supply room to the empty room, r 0 is the initial concentration of the tracer gas in the release room and V is the volume migrating across the doorway to the empty room. After the door had closed the tracer migration ended and the concentration started to decrease (see Fig. 5 ). Since all the tracer gas leaves the room through the exhaust, the total amount of tracer can be calculated by integrating the exhaust concentration over time as: where Q E is the exhaust flow rate and r(t) the measured tracer concentration in the exhaust. Substituting Equation (2) in (1) we get the total volume exchange across the doorway from the release room to the adjacent room induced by the door operation. where, r i is the ith tracer concentration measurement after the door operation and Dt i is the sampling period of the ith measurement. Typically, one experiment consisted of 6 door openings, each separated by 60 min. After each experiment the rooms were evacuated of the tracers, new experimental setup prepared and subsequently measurements carried out with it.
