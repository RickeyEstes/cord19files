Ethical statement. Euthanizing piglets was done in agreement with the European legislation on animal experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, and all methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Piglets and virus samples. Healthy conventional 3-day-old suckling piglets were purchased from a conventional pig farm. Using tissues of euthanized animals was in accordance of the requirements of the Local Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. The piglets were euthanized by intravenous injection of 20% sodium Pentobarbital (1 ml/1.5 kg, Kela Laboratories, Hoogstraten, Belgium). Rotavirus RVA/Pig-tc/BEL/ RV277/1977/G1P [7] strain grown on MA104 cells, TGEV Purdue and Miller strain grown on ST cells and PEDV CV777 strain grown on Vero cells were used in this study. In addition, four diarrheic fecal suspensions containing rotavirus of suckling pigs less than 2 weeks old (Table 1 ) and PEDV CV777 fecal suspension from an experimentally inoculated 3-day-old sucking piglet were also included. Twenty percent fecal suspensions were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1000 U/ml penicillin (Continental Pharma, Puurs, Belgium), 1 mg/ml streptomycin (Certa, Braine l' Alleud, Belgium), 1 mg/ml gentamicin (Gibco BRL, Merelbeke, Belgium) and 0.01% v/v fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Braine l' Alleud, Belgium) 7 . Establishment of porcine intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts. The ileum was collected from a euthanized 3-day-old piglet and brought in ice-cold Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Merelbeke, Belgium), containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (flushing medium) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL). Subsequently, the intestine was cut into 6-8 cm long segments and turned inside-out, mucosal side facing outwards. Intestinal contents were removed by one washing with ice-cold flushing medium containing 10% FBS and two washings with flushing medium without FBS. The intestinal segments were incubated in PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and shaken at 150 rpm/min for 30 min at 37 °C. The EDTA suspension was removed and this EDTA incubation step was repeated 3 times. Next, intestinal segments were incubated in DMEM containing dispase II (1.2 mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and collagenase I (0.4 mg/ml, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the digested mucosa was gently scraped with a sterile scalpel blade, scrapings were collected and incubated in DMEM containing dispase II (1.2 mg/ ml) for 10 min whilst pipetting. After centrifugation for 4 min at 140 × g and 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 2% D-sorbitol (Sigma) and 2.5% FBS, and centrifuged at 50 × g for 4 min. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco BRL) culture medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2% FBS, and 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco BRL) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Culture medium was refreshed on day 2, afterwards medium was changed every 3 days. Morphology of the cells was evaluated daily by light microscopy (Olympus). Once myofibroblasts (cobblestone-like clusters) grew into big clusters (≈200 cells), they were marked and other cells (e.g. epithelial cells, fibroblasts) were removed by scraping. Then the cobblestone-like clusters were detached by trypsinization with 5 μg/ml trypsin-0.01% EDTA, and sub-cultured in a 24-well plate (split ratio 1:2) with culture medium containing 10% FBS and evaluated daily for cobblestone-like features by light microscopy. Subsequently, the cobblestone-like cells were digested by trypsinization and further expanded in flasks to generate a long-term semi-continuous culture.
