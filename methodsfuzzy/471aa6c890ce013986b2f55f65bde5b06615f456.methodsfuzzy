The proband (II-1) was born term without complications. At 6 months tremor was noted with reaching, which disappeared by adolescence. At 6 years he developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures; EEG showed sleep-enhanced bilateral independent centrotemporal spike-and-slow waves. Seizures were controlled with carbamazepine, from which he was weaned at 10 years with no further recurrence and with normalized EEG. He sat at 5 months, walked at 1 year, but was delayed in fine motor and intellectual (below) development. His father and two brothers had a similar course with onset of intention tremor in infancy, seizures in childhood, EEG as above, remission of all these by adolescence, and persisting intellectual disability in the boys and low-average function in the father (below). Mother is healthy. Neurological examination in all is unremarkable, except in the youngest, examined in pre-adolescence, exhibiting a kinetic and intentional tremor interfering with fine motor activities, but no dysdiadochokinesia. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was as previously described. 5 The human LMAN2L NM_001142292.1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1. The EQKLISEEDLA myc epitope was introduced downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site between codons for amino acids 44 and 45 ( Fig. 2A) . Site-directed mutagenesis on this wild-type (wt) construct generated the mutated version. Following sequence verification, the constructs were transfected into HeLa cells. Lysates were fractionated for cytosolic and light and plasma membrane proteins as previously described. 6 For microscopy, 24 h post-transfection cells were treated with 10 mg/mL cycloheximide for 2 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with anti-myc antibody followed by Alexa 488-coupled anti-mouse IgG.
