Animals and treatment. a total of 40 SKH-1 hairless mice (age, 5-6 weeks; weight, ~20 g) were initially obtained from jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, me, uSa), and were maintained in our facility with free access to water and food, under a 12-h light/dark cycle, with 35% humidity. the mice were divided into four groups: the control (con) group (without any uVB irradiation and juglanin treatment), the model (mod) group (uVB irradiation), and the 10 and 20 mg/kg juglanin-treated groups, which were treated with juglanin after uVB irradiation. all experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and, before the animal experiments were carried out, the procedures were approved by the research ethical committee of Southern medical university (Guangdong, china). the uV lamp (uVa-340; SolarSystems & Solutions, llc, clifford, Pa, uSa) used to irradiate mice in the present study simulates sunlight in the critical short wavelength region, from 365 nm to the solar cut-off of 295 nm, with a peak emission at 340 nm. The radiant dose was quantified, at the appropriate distance, using a uVB daavlin flex control integrating dosimeter (daavlin, Bryan, oH, uSa) and was further confirmed using an external radiometer (X-96 irradiance meter; daavlin) before and after each irradiation session. an electrical fan was used to avoid excessive heating. as for the acute radiation experiments, mice were exposed to uV radiation at a dose of 600 mj/cm 2 in groups and were euthanized 24 or 72 h after irradiation. for skin carcinogenesis experiments, the animals were exposed twice a week for 10 weeks on mondays and Wednesdays to solar-simulated uV radiation in clear bedding-free cages. during the process, the animals were consecutively administered various doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of juglanin by gavage. finally, the dorsal skin was harvested, and computer-assisted image analysis, using a Zeiss KS300 (version 3.0; münchen, Germany,) was used to observe vessel size. Some of the fresh skin tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid n 2 and stored at -80̊c for subsequent experiments. Histopathological analysis. Fresh tissue samples were fixed in formalin for 48 h at room temperature. then, the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse skin samples were processed and were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin, based on a routine protocol (17) . the stained tissue sections (5-µm thick) were then observed under a light microscope and digital micrographs of slides were captured for analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis. for immunohistochemistry, fresh tissue samples were fixed in formalin for 48 h at room temperature. Subsequently, tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and cut into sections (5-µm thick) using a microtome. The sections were then fixed onto slides. endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H 2 o 2 , and non-specific proteins were blocked with 10% goat serum for 30 min. the samples were then incubated with antibodies against Ki67, tnf-α and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) (1:100 dilution) in 5% horse serum (life technologies, Grand island, nY, uSa) with PBS at 4̊c overnight. Sections were then incubated with diluted streptavidin-peroxidase horseradish peroxidase (1:200; cat. no. 6721; abcam, cambridge, ma, uSa) for 30 min at room temperature using a foxp3 staining kit (eBioscience, San diego, ca, uSa), according to the manufacturer's protocol. finally, sections were stained with hematoxylin for 3 min, and were mounted and assessed using a phase-contrast microscope (dP70; olympus, tokyo, japan). Cell culture and treatment. B16f10 murine melanoma cells and Hs68 human foreskin fibroblast cells were purchased from american type culture collection (manassas, Va, uSa). the cells were maintained in a monolayer culture in dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (dmem; Gibco, Grand island, nY, uSa) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fBS; Gibco), 0.012% penicillin G, 0.027% streptomycin, 0.022% sodium pyruvate and 0.26% sodium bicarbonate at 37̊c in an atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% co 2 . juglanin stock solution was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmSo) and was diluted to the desired final concentration (10 and 20 µM) in culture medium 24 h prior to use. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). Cell viability analysis. the antiproliferative role of juglanin in B16f10 and human Hs68 cells was determined using the mtS cell Proliferation colorimetric assay kit (Biovision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5x10 3 cells/well. after 12 h, the cells were treated with various concentrations of juglanin (0-30 µm) and/ or uVB (5 mj/cm 2 ) for 24 h. Subsequently, fresh mtS and PmS mixture was added and incubated for 2-4 h at 37̊c according to the manufacturer's protocol. a mr7000 microplate reader (dynatech laboratories inc., chantilly, Va, uSa) was used to determine the absorbance at 500 nm. in addition, half maximal inhibitory concentration values were determined. data are presented as the mean of five replicates; each experiment was conducted in triplicate. Flow cytometric analysis. cancer cell apoptosis was calculated via flow cytometry. cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS, after which they were stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (Pi) in binding buffer. apoptosis was assessed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, nj, uSa) after 15 min incubation at room temperature in the dark. fluorescence was detected at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm via FL-1 (530 nm) and FL-2 filters (585 nm). The number of apoptotic cells was then analyzed using Win-mdi software (version 2.9; http://facs.scripps.edu/wm29w98.exe). Fluorescence imaging. tissue samples were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% triton X-100. for immunofluorescence, phosphorylated (p)-nf-κB and 50 µg/ml mouse anti-caspase-3 antibodies were employed, followed by incubation with 2 µg/ml alexa fluor 488-goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. daPi (Sigma-aldrich; merck KGaa, darmstadt, Germany) was also used to stain cells. images were acquired by confocal laser scanning using epifluorescence microscopy (nikon te2000-e; Shanghai Sunny Biotech co., ltd., Shanghai, china). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). total rna was extracted from tissue samples using the mirVana mirna isolation kit (ambion; thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. , Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, cdna was synthesized from total rna using the taqman mirna rt kit (applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. qPcr was conducted using the applied Biosystems 7500 Sequence detection system with iQ™ SYBr-Green Supermix (Bio-rad laboratories, inc., Hercules, ca, uSa) containing 5 ng cdna and 10 pm each primer. Amplification of pre-denaturated products was conducted at 94˚c for 60 sec; followed by 45 cycles at 95˚c for 30 sec, 58˚c for 30 sec and 72˚c for 30 sec; followed by 95˚c for 10 sec, 65˚c for 45 sec, and 40˚c for 60 sec. data were normalized to the geometric mean of the housekeeping gene GaPdH, and relative mrna expression levels were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔcq method (18) . fold changes in the mrna levels of target genes relative to the endogenous GaPdH control were calculated. Briefly, the quantification cycle (Cq) values of each target gene were subtracted from the cq values of the housekeeping gene GaPdH (ΔCq). The target gene ΔΔCq was calculated as Δcq of target gene -Δcq of control gene. the fold change in mrna expression was evaluated as 2 -ΔΔcq . the primer sequences used in the present study were as follows: il-1β, sense (5'-3') GtG aGG aGa aGa tGG Gta G, antisense (5'-3') aGa cct aGG Gaa Gaa cca at; il-18, sense (5'-3') aGG taa cct aca aGa cGt GG, antisense (5'-3') tta cca Gat cGG tGa GaG at; and GaPdH, sense (5'-3') atc aac acG aGG cta Gca GG and antisense (5'-3') cat cat aca cGc acc aca Gtc ac. Western blotting. melanoma cells were homogenized in 10% (wt/vol) hypotonic buffer [25 mm tris-Hcl (pH 8.0), 1 mm edta, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc Sc, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 4 mm benzamidine] to yield a homogenate. The final supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 10,800 x g for 20 min at 4˚c. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (thermo fisher Scientific, inc.) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. total protein extracts were used for western blotting. equal amounts of total protein (40 µg) were loaded and proteins were separated using 10% SdS-PaGe and electrophoretically transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (millipore, Billerica, ma, uSa). the membranes were then blocked with 5% skim milk tris buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 (tBSt), washed, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4˚c. the membrane was then washed with tBSt for three times, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HrP)conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,500; cat. no. 6721; abcam) at room temperature for 2 h. following another round of washing with tBSt, the membrane was then developed using ecl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and exposed to Kodak X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Protein expression levels were defined as grey value using ImageJ (version 1.4.2b, mac oS X; national institutes of Health, Bethesda, md, uSa) and standardized to the housekeeping gene (GaPdH) and expressed as a fold of control. all experiments were performed in triplicate and done three times independently. the primary polyclonal antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-GaPdH (1:500; cat. no. sc-293335; Santa cruz Biotechnology, inc., dallas, tX, uSa), p38 (1: Statistical analysis. data are presented as the means ± standard deviation (Sd). experimental groups were compared using GraphPad PriSm (version 6.0; GraphPad Software, inc., la jolla, ca, uSa) by one-way analysis of variance with dunn's least significant difference tests. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
