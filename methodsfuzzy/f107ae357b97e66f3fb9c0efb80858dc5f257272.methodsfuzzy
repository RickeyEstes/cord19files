Health planning and policy seek to create a group of mutually interacting bodies to produce goods and services to meet the health needs of a population. The investigation of the state of health of citizens often coincides with the field of health planning and policy because it tries to determine the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the output of these goods and services. This is achieved through the theory of opportunity cost which aims at not wasting resources in order to allocate these resources to meet other socioeconomic needs. The investigation, therefore, of the nosology and epidemiology spectrum and population and demographic data highlights and continuously reflects on the type and quantity of goods and health services that must be produced. Many times, however, despite the scientific approach of this investigation, the market of health-care, but also the failures of planning and health system development, produce either services, such as medical services, far in excess of what is necessary, or pharmaceutical products or diagnostic centers or private clinics, creating strong induced demand and imbalance in demand and supply of the health-care market. In any case, if we do not investigate systematically the size and age structure of the population, its regional distribution, and especially the types of diseases and causes of death, the prevalence and incidence of disease, it is not possible to specify the necessary actions of health policies on a preventive and therapeutic level. Social planning and health policy explore, on the one hand, the type and quantity of health services and goods needed by the population and on the other, the human, material, and financial resources, i.e., the necessary inputs for the system to operate as well as the outputs and outcomes. This is indispensable to the availability of resources and to the use of innovative methods to ensure: (1) the rationalization of health services; and (2) the planning of appropriate and specialized output for the operation of the health system and the equilibrium in the market of health-care. The establishment of the criteria of the mode of distribution of produced goods and services takes into account: (1) the strong external influence that health causes; (2) income inequality; (3) the form of the system of social security and thus the way of insurance coverage for citizens; (4) regional inequalities; and (5) the market types prevailing in an economy and the restrictions brought about by the development of private initiatives. In all countries, even those in which the free market insurance model prevails, a minimum of state intervention exists to protect public health through the delivery of health services and goods to categories of the population who are in a state of absolute poverty and deprivation. The more health is considered a public good, the stronger is the criterion of redistributive justice when it comes to health-care distribution and care is provided irrespective of the financial contributions of the citizens either through taxes or through insurance premiums.
