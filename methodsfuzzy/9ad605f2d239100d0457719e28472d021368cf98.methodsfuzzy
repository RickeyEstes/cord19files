Basic structure of the model Some assumptions in the basic structure of the model are summarized in Table 1 . We adopted the Markov model setting, following previous research, [5] [6] [7] [8] and the epidemiological characteristics, such as R 0 (infectious power, or natural history), were borrowed from previous research, 5 the natural history of smallpox is shown in Fig. 1 . In particular, we have assumed that the value for infectious power, R 0 , as in an actual case 10 is 1.5, and that it is distributed potentially in the prodromal and mainly in the symptomatic period, previously reported. 5, 10 We also assume that the incubation period lasts for 5 to 17 days, the prodromal period lasts for 2 to 3 days, and the symptomatic period lasts for 11 to 15 days, as in the base case. R 0 is the most commonly used and important number for infection control and is defined by the basic reproduction number (which means the number of persons who are infected from one patient if all the persons are susceptible). We have used the value of R 0 Ï­ 1.5, for the distribution of infectiousness, incubation, prodromal, or symptomatic period over each duration from the previous research. 5 We have also assumed, as in the previous research, that there is one initial-exposure case, and we assume that the initial susceptible population is 30 million persons, that is, the total number of the population who were born after 1976, when vaccination for smallpox had ceased (S. Assumption processed per day per public health worker a R 0 distribution follows data in previous research 5,11 b The durations of the incubation, prodromal, and symptomatic periods are according to previous research 5 susceptibles who were born after 1976 is just 50 persons. This contact number seems high, although it has been used in previous research. 7 In fact, in the episode in which a SARS-infected tourist visited Japan, 11 the public health authority had traced more than 200 contacts per day. Therefore 200 contacts per day seems to be a somewhat moderate number in our experience. In the ring vaccination, 200 vaccine shots can be performed per day per public health worker, but the workers have to trace the contacts. Because tracing probably needs more human resources than these required for vaccine shots only, we assume that each public health worker can trace two persons per day.
