Investigating lymphocyte responses to allergens has been hindered by the low frequency of circulating allergen-specific lymphocytes. It has generally been assumed that allergens induce T H 2 responses because most cultured allergen-specific clones have a T H 2 phenotype. However, analysis of allergen-specific lymphocytes in nonallergic individuals has not been extensively examined. In the current paper, the investigators reported a new approach using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE) to detect allergen-specific lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The CSFE dye is equally distributed into dividing cells so that its level is a specific indication of the number of replication cycles that a cell has undergone. Accordingly, the investigators examined CSFE-low cells after culture in medium supplemented with peanut antigen. Comparison of (1) peanut-allergic individuals, (2) non-peanut-allergic individuals, and (3) individuals who had outgrown peanut allergy revealed interesting findings. Notably, T cells of peanut-allergic donors showed a T H 2 polarization; in contrast, T cells of individuals who had outgrown their allergies and T cells of nonallergic individuals showed T H 1 cytokine responses to peanut antigen. Similar results were seen in lymphocytes of individuals with egg allergy when the lymphocytes were cultured with ovalbumin. These results suggest that food antigens (in particular, peanut antigen) do not intrinsically induce T H 2 skewing but that the type of response depends on the donor's allergic status. The finding that lymphocytes of individuals who outgrow peanut allergy do not have a T H 2 skewing suggests that shifting of a T H 2 response to a T H 1 response underlies clinical tolerance to orally administered allergens. The application of this novel approach to examine antigen-specific T cells is likely to be informative in developing better strategies for immunotherapy. Effects of early-onset asthma and in utero exposure to maternal smoking on subsequent childhood lung function It has been suggested that in utero exposure to maternal smoking and early onset of asthma in infancy are independently associated with subsequent chronic decreases in lung function in childhood. This study compared the effects of these factors, present individually and in combination, within a population of 5933 participants in a Children's Health Study. As predicted, children without asthma who had previously been exposed in utero to maternal smoking showed decreased FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratios and FEF 25-75 . Among children without prior in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with early-onset asthma had larger decreases in FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, and FEF 25-75 than those with later-onset asthma. However, the largest decreases in pulmonary function were seen in children with both in utero tobacco smoking exposure and early-onset asthma (FEV 1 /FVC decreased approximately 9%; FEF 25-75 decreased approximately 28%). Somewhat surprisingly, there was no significant effect of postnatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure alone on childhood lung function. These findings suggest a possible additive effect of in utero tobacco exposure and early-onset asthma on childhood lung function, providing further evidence of the deleterious effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Such smoking during pregnancy might be particularly harmful in situations in which the child to be born is Articles of note . . .
