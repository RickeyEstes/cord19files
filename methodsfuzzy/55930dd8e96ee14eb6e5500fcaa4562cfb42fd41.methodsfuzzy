To better understand innovative technology for removing air pollutants, verify the effectiveness of some commercialized technology and promote the enhancement of hotel IAQ knowledge, the study adopted an action research-dominated approach. The concept of action research can be traced back to the mid 1940s (Lewin, 1946) . Since then, this concept has become divided into a wide spectrum of approaches including action research, action science, system intervention and action inquiry (List, 2006) . Our investigation is characterized by the involvement of researchers with a goal to achieve an enhancement of hotel IAQ by using air purification technology in the studied hotel (Baskerville and Wood-Harper, 1996; Baskerville and Pries-Heje, 1999) . Differing from the typical consultancy approach and that of contracted research, which usually provides technical or specific deliverables, the action research in this case set out to collect hoteliers' real responses by direct observation and discussion via participation. The follow-through participation process included initiating the project, participating in meetings, exchanging views, installing air purifiers, cleaning air ducts, providing technical and professional knowledge guidance, checking equipment performance, collecting data, performing analysis, delivering findings and gauging management response. Through the process, researchers were able to professionalize the hotel department heads using three technical meetings, seven semi-technical meetings, six informal discussions and one "wrap-up" focus group discussion. The researchers' aim was to produce valid knowledge and act as a facilitator by proposing the topic, formulating the action research scenarios and compiling all the collected data (Waser and Johns, 2003) . More importantly, the use of action research allowed the investigators to gain an in-depth and thorough understanding of how the company's management responded to the processes and findings about the application of air-cleaning technology. Compared with other techniques, which use questionnaires and interviews to obtain responses, the action research methodology in this case may greatly reduce "noise" in the data collection process and ensure a high degree of data reality. To gauge the hotel management's response to the demonstration via technical research processes -planning, sampling, analysis and report -the study conducted a post-research focus group discussion with hotel department heads including the director of engineering, purchasing managers, the executive housekeeper, the front office manager, the executive and GM assistants. Focus groups are an in-depth group interview technique employing relatively homogenous groups to provide information about topics specified by the researchers (Hughes and DuMont, 1993) . They provide an opportunity to solicit true views from participants freely and in a flexible way. Such a method also allows for the exploration of beliefs and attitudes toward something new (Procter, 2000) . In addition, focus group discussions have the merit of allowing participants to react to the responses of other participants, encouraging a series of subsequent discussions, causing a snowball effect (Wilkinson, 2004) . Due to the exploratory nature of this research and the aforementioned advantages, the focus group method was adopted to explore the following two probing topics: (1) differences in the group's understanding about the investigation of air duct cleaning and its removal effectiveness before and after the research intervention; and (2) their response to the observed research process. A four-day sampling plan was scheduled. Day 1 deals with outdoor air measurement and cleaning one studied room's ventilation system. In Day 2, the cleaned air duct room's IAQ measurement was undertaken after 12 h operation of the cleaned ventilation system. In the same day, background IAQ was measured in two other studied rooms. Then, movable air cleaners (brand P and L) were placed in these rooms to test their removal efficiency. On the third day, fixed air cleaner (brand L) was installed on ceiling top and was tested for their pollutant removal efficiency on the fourth day. The L brand fixed air cleaner is an in-duct filter, such unit cannot be used without forced air systems. Therefore, the air conditioning has to be turned on when operating the L brand fixed air cleaner. For the testing of cleaning effects of the ventilation system and brand L fixed air cleaner, indoor and outdoor air samples were taken simultaneously. The indoor air temperature and the air velocity of air conditioning were set at 25 â€¢ C and middle level (1.85 m/s), respectively. Indoor/outdoor ratio was used to calculate the removal efficiency in order to rule out the influence of outdoor fluctuations in pollutant levels. We also interested in knowing whether there were indoor pollutant sources in sample rooms and how well can portable air cleaners mitigate the indoor air pollution. Therefore, we chose to close the windows and doors and shut down the air conditioning in sample rooms in order to limit the air exchange rate with outdoor environment, and no one was allowed to enter the rooms except for mask wearing researchers during measurement. As shown in previous studies, the performance of air cleaner strongly depends on the air exchange rate (Cheng et al., 1998; Green et al., 1999; Fisk et al., 2002) , thus limiting the air exchange rate is crucial for identifying the actual performance of air cleaners at realistic indoor conditions. The testing parameters for air pollutants included carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), fine suspended particulate matters (PM2.5), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), bacteria and fungi. Indoor air samples (for 8 h) were collected as near to the central positions of the guest room as possible. The measuring instruments were placed at 1.5 m above the floor and at least 1 m away from potential sources of air pollutants indoors (details of instruments can be found in Table A2 ). Outdoor air samples (for 2 h) were taken on the rooftop near the fresh air intakes. Background air sampling was carried out in each room for 2 h. Background air sampling was carried out in each sample room before testing the air cleaner or cleaned air ducts, the measuring parameters are exactly the same as the 8 h indoor air sampling afterwards. The room conditions for background air sampling were also the same as the following air cleaner test. The background levels were used as the "before cleaning/running" data in the findings. The reported levels were not adjusted for background levels. Original data were checked and no apparent skewed distributions were found. Therefore arithmetic means were used in this study. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) was measured using a portable Q-Trak monitor. A Dust-Trak air monitor (Model 8520, TSI Inc.) was used to measure PM2.5 concentrations in both the indoor and outdoor environment. Different devices were used to measure the TVOC and individual VOC. For measuring the TVOC, A ppbRAE 3000 monitor was used for continuous recording of TVOC concentrations for eight hours. The ppbRAE 3000 can detect a very wide range of VOCs, including benzene, isobutene, methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, trichloroethane, styrene, heptane, perchloroethylene, and etc. The lamp and sensor of ppbRAE 3000 were manually cleaned before the testing in order to avoid the drift of photoionization detector. Prior to sampling, the ppbRAE 3000 monitor was calibrated by a calibration gas (isobutylene) with a known concentration of 10 ppm supplied by the manufacturer. For individual VOC sampling, a canister sampling method was used. A batch of pre-cleaned canisters for sample collection was evacuated before sampling. Time-integrated VOC air samples were obtained by using mass flow controllers at a flow rate of 0.0042 l/min for 8 h. After sampling, the canisters were immediately transported to an authorized air laboratory supplier for GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass selective) analysis. A NUTECH Cryogenic Concentrator was used for sample pre-concentration and followed by an Agilent 6890/5873 GC/MSD system to conduct the analysis. VOCs in ambient air were collected by specially prepared canisters with subsequent analysis by gas chromatography. A portable air sampler for agar plates was used for bacteria and fungi sampling. Tryptic soy agar (TSA) was used as the medium for the collection of bacteria, while malt extract agar (MEA) was used for the collection of fungi. Each of the microbiological samples was taken over a period of 5 min. After incubation was completed, the concentration of bacteria and fungi was counted and expressed in terms of colony-forming units per cubic meter of air (cfu/m 3 ). There are a number of IAQ national standards available. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) under the Clean Air Act. These enforceable standards were developed for outdoor air quality, but they are also applicable for indoor air contaminant levels (see Table A1 ). The concentrations are set conservatively in order to protect the most sensitive individuals, such children, the elderly, and those with asthma. However, the EPA standard doesn't have parameter about bacteria. After the SARS (a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus) disaster, the Chinese guests are very concerned about the indoor air quality. Therefore the Hong Kong indoor air quality standard was employed in this study. The "excellent class" of indoor air quality level according to the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department was used in the analysis as a benchmark (HKEPD, 2003) .
