Yeast two-hybrid screening Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed with the pretransformed MATCHMAKER human bone marrow cDNA library (Clontech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, the bait plasmid was transformed into yeast strain AH109, and transformants containing the bait plasmid were mated with the pretransformed cDNA library. Candidates were initially selected on SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plates, and plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones and sequenced according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
