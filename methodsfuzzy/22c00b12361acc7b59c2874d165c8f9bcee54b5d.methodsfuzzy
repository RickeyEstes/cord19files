As mentioned, the formal curriculum is transformed using new teaching methods and medical humanity is emphasized in the new medical education program [ Table 2 ] [19, 27, 28] . Thus, the 6-year medical education program creates a complete learning environment using an innovative curriculum design that combines a formal curriculum, an informal curriculum, and a hidden curriculum (i.e., making it new). Several examples of curriculum design are presented as follows. In Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan, a flipped teaching method is applied in the anesthesiology course; this enables students to learn at their own pace and thus improve their professional competencies and engage in self-directed learning by engaging in pre-class preparations and using the interactive online teaching platform Zuvio in the class [29] . Several institutions have also applied a hidden curriculum. For example, Tzu Chi University in Taiwan has implemented a silent mentor program aimed at cultivating the spirit of service in students [28] . National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan has implemented an on-doctoring program that emphasizes the cultivation of human-centered thinking and lifelong learning in students [30] . Furthermore, the Miharashi medical service team in Tzu Chi University has, since 2006, taught students about serving others by arranging visits to indigenous tribes [31] . Such visits enable students to perceive health needs from residents of remote areas in eastern Taiwan and consequently inspire students to respect life and engage in self-reflection. Harden proposed SPICE model to design curriculum during implement of educational reform strategies [32] . Educators thus use problem-based methods to evaluate a community's needs and provide learner-centered courses for creating a comprehensive and systematic learning environment. However, numerous teachers and parents have raised concerns about the practical processes of an informal curriculum and a hidden curriculum in Taiwan.
