Specificity was demonstrated during development for Ad26 and Ad35 proteins by MS-based peak assignments and by demonstrating absence of the viral proteins in the formulation buffer. The method repeatability, accuracy, intermediate precision, and linearity were determined for 5 concentration levels in the range of 0.5 × 10 11 -2.0 × 10 11 vp/ml with 3 replicates at each concentration level, repeated on 3 different days by two operators on two analytical columns, and two LC instruments. The method repeatability requirements were ≤ 15% RSD for relative peak areas and ≤ 1% RSD for relative retention times. The intermediate precision was determined based on the method repeatability and linearity data on three different days and the limits were ≤20% RSD for relative peak areas and ≤ 2.0% RSD for relative retention times. The linearity requirements were r 2 ≥ 0.98 and the sum of residuals less than 5%. The accuracy requirement was recoveries of 80-120% for relative peak areas. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was determined as the lowest concentration level that met the requirements for accuracy and precision. Robustness was derived from the results of method development obtained with design of experiments. In the original RP-HPLC method, based on Lehmberg et al. [26] and Liu et al. [10] , the adenovirus proteins were separated on a C4 column (5 m, 2.1 × 250 mm) with a water-ACN gradient, with three segments of different slopes, from 20% to 60% ACN containing 0.1% TFA in 110 min, see Fig. 1 . The adenovirus samples are directly injected into the UPLC system without sample pre-treatment (e.g. denaturation, reduction or dilution) and the viruses dissociate into proteins upon coming in contact with the water-ACN mobile phase in the UPLC system. Dissociating the viruses into proteins prior to the UPLC analysis resulted in irreproducible chromatograms (data not shown) [26] . This method was transferred to an UPLC Xbridge BEH 300 C4 column (1.7 m, 2.1 × 150 mm). The linear gradient with three slopes was replaced by a single-slope linear gradient to improve elution reproducibility and the flow rate was increased The critical method parameters of the RP-UPLC method were studied in a screening design of experiments to assess their impact on the method's run time and the resolution between the adenovirus proteins.: The following conditions were evaluated: gradient start composition (0-20% solvent B), gradient end composition (45-65% solvent B), gradient run time (17-25 min), TFA concentration (0.04-0.12%), and column temperature (40-70 • C). JMP statistical software was used to fit a model based on standard least squares using the main effects of the parameters. The response that was chosen to study the effect of the tested parameters was the best resolution between the maximum number of protein peaks with the shortest run time. From a Pareto-analysis with standardized parameter estimates it was concluded that the TFA concentration and the column temperature had the strongest impact on the response. The peaks between approximately 6 and 8 min (proteins V, VII and VIII) and between 13 and 15 min (proteins IIIa and IX) were most influenced by the column temperature and the TFA concentration ( Fig. 2A -C and G-J). The best resolution between the different peaks was obtained at the highest concentration of TFA (0.12%) and a column temperature of 50 • C (Fig. 2B) . The gradient start and end composition and the gradient time were not critical regarding resolution or elution order, provided the gradient start composition was above 10% ACN to assure complete dissociation of the virus particles and the end composition was above 45% ACN to allow elution of all adenovirus proteins. Based on this feasibility experiment, the gradient start composition was fixed at 20% B and the end composition at 50% B, with a gradient time of 17 min. These settings resulted in the shortest run time with the best resolution possible. Initially, solvents A and B were prepared with 0.04-0.12% TFA, however, allowing this range of TFA concentration caused dayto-day variability (i.e. shifts in retention time), indicating that the TFA concentration is a critical method parameter which needs to be tightly controlled. Fig. 2A-C shows that TFA has a significant effect on the separation even with slight changes from 0.09% to 0.12% TFA. The method robustness with respect to this parameter was examined specifically by design of experiments (see below, Section 3.1.1). In addition, to increase the reproducibility of the mobile phase composition, the gradient mobile phase preparation method was changed as follows: Solvent A was 5% ACN in water, solvent B was 100% ACN, and solvent C was 1% TFA in 5% ACN. The UPLC-system was then used to mix the three solvents to reproducibly obtain constant concentrations of TFA in the mobile phase throughout the gradient. The optimized RP-UPLC-UV method is intended for protein profiling of Ad26 and Ad35 vector-based vaccine products. The protein profile of the test sample was compared to the profile of a reference sample based on the relative retention times and relative peak areas. The first purpose of the comparison was to confirm the identity of the adenovirus vector (type 26 or 35) based on matching relative retention times of the detected adenovirus proteins in the test sample versus the reference (i.e. protein fingerprinting). The second purpose was to detect potential protein modifications and degradation products of the vaccine product, by monitoring the relative peak areas of all peaks in the chromatogram, including any previously unidentified peaks. To validate the method for these two purposes, the specificity, precision, accuracy, linearity, and LOQ were assessed. The specificity of the method for the adenovirus proteins was demonstrated by MS during method development (see paragraph 3.2) and by demonstrating absence of peaks assigned to the viral proteins in the chromatogram of the formulation buffer (blank). Precision was evaluated as method repeatability and intermediate precision of the relative peak areas and relative retention times. The method repeatability of the relative retention times of all proteins was between 0.1 and 1% RSD. The method repeatability of the relative peak areas was between 1 and 14% RSD, which was a significant improvement compared to the current RP-HPLC method with a method repeatability of 6-26% RSD ( Table 1 ). The intermediate precision of the relative retention times was 0.1-2.0% RSD and 1-14% RSD for the relative peak areas (Table 1) , which met the acceptance criterion for method validation (≤ 20% RSD), except for the relative peak area for protein V (9-26% RSD), which was higher than obtained for other proteins and did not meet the acceptance criterion for method validation. Linearity was demonstrated for samples diluted with formulation buffer within a range of 1.0 × 10 11 to 2.5 × 10 11 vp/ml. The determination coefficients for the peak areas were between 0.98 and 1.00, based on five concentration levels with three replicates at each level. The accuracy of the absolute peak areas could not be determined by spiked recovery due to unavailability of pure adenovirus protein standards. Therefore, the accuracy was determined as percentage recovery of the measured relative peak area against the expected relative peak area at all concentration levels, based on dilutional linearity of the highest concentration level. The recoveries of the relative peak areas were between 79-108% for all adenovirus proteins. The LOQ of the method, the lowest concentration level within the linear range with acceptable precision and accuracy, was 1.0 × 10 11 vp/ml. The RP-UPLC-UV method was not validated for the quantification of protein V since the peak area repeatability was higher than the criterion. Protein IV, VI(3), VIII(2), 52.55 K (1), 52.55 K (2) could not be quantified because their peak areas were below the limit of detection. In summary, the method was validated for the quantification of the relative peak areas of adenovirus proteins II, III, IIIa, VI(1), VI(2), VII, VIII(1), VIII(2), IX, and X and for the detection of adenovirus proteins IV, V, VI(3), VIII(2), 52.55 K (1), 52.55 K (2) in adenovirus type 26 and type 35 vector-based vaccine products. To assess if the RP-UPLC-UV method can pick up changes in the protein composition that may occur during product storage, Ad26 samples were stressed under different conditions and characterized by several physicochemical and biochemical methods. The stress conditions comprised oxidation with peroxide or temperature stress at 50 • C for 45 and 120 min. The stressed samples and a non-stressed control sample were analyzed by RP-UPLC-UV and the chromatograms of the stressed samples were compared to the control sample based on the relative retention times and relative peak areas. The same stressed samples were also analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis [32] and by a potency assay, for determination of the concentration of virus particles and the infectivity, respectively. Thermal stress at 50 • C for 45 min resulted in overall RP-UPLC peak area decreases of approximately 17%. Thermal stress for 120 min resulted in 56% decrease in overall peak areas and, consequently, some proteins were close to the limit of quantification. The relative peak areas of the proteins, however, were the same in both temperature-stressed samples compared to the non-stressed sample. The CZE analysis of the temperature-stressed samples showed a decrease in virus particle concentration of 25% at 45 min and 74% at 120 min, which was in line with the peak area decrease of the RP-UPLC chromatograms (Fig. 6 ). This suggests that temperature stress resulted in loss of virus particles rather than specific degradation of adenovirus proteins. For the same samples, the infectivity decreased by 22% and 91% for stress times of 45 and 120 min, respectively. Oxidative stress resulted in the loss of almost all adenovirus proteins (approx. 91% overall chromatogram peak area decrease) and a number of new peaks were observed in the chromatogram, which were tentatively assigned to oxidized adenovirus proteins. The relative peak areas did change after oxidation stress due to the new peaks. The virus particle concentration measured by CZE decreased by 88% and the infectivity decreased by 99%, which indicated that almost all the adenovirus particles were degraded in the oxidized sample. The RP-UPLC method is sensitive for temperature stress and oxidative stress. The validated method was implemented for the analysis of adenovirus-based products. Some examples are provided in Fig. 7 and further described below. Fig. 7A shows the chromatogram of an Ad26 process intermediate sample which was stored for 9 months at 5 • C (normal storage condition of final product is −80 • C). All peak areas decreased by a factor of 3 compared to the reference sample (Fig. 7d) . Moreover, a degradation product was observed as shoulder of the peak of protein II at 12.9 min. This peak was identified by MS as intact protein II with oxidation and deamidation modifications. Fig. 7B shows a partially purified sample from downstream processing. Additional peaks were detected in the RP-UPLC chromatogram at 2 and 9 min. The DAD spectra of these peaks did not show the typical protein spectrum characteristics. Fractions containing these peaks were collected and analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The peaks at 2 min and 9 min were assigned to 2,4dimethylbenzaldehyde and 2,4 di tert-butylphenol, respectively. These could be leachables from the disposable container bags used in the process. Trace C in Fig. 7 is from another partially purified process intermediate sample with high concentrations of host cell protein impurities. The DAD spectra of the additional peaks showed typical protein-spectra, however the relative peak areas of the adenovirus proteins were unchanged compared to the reference sample. In this case, fractions of the additional peaks were collected and analyzed by LC-MS. The unknown peaks between 11 and 13 min were assigned to host cell proteins, which were present at high concentrations and could therefore be detected by the RP-UPLC method.
