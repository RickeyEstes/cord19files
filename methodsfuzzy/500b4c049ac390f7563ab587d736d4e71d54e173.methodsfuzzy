To the stirred solution of 1-oxiranylmethyl isatin 3 (1 mmol) and 4-aminoquinoline 9 (1 mmol) in dry toluene was added catalytic amount of p-toluene sulphonic acid. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 110 C for 6 h and the progress was monitored by TLC. On completion, water (15 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and subsequently extraction was done using chloroform (2 Ã‚ 50 mL). Combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduce pressure. Purification of reaction mixture via column chromatography using hexane:ethylacetate (3:2) mixture as eluent resulted in the isolation of desired hybrids 11aep. The W2 strain of P. falciparum was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% human serum, following standard methods, and parasites were synchronized with 5% D-sorbitol [50] . Beginning at the ring stage, microwell cultures were incubated with different concentrations of compounds for 48 h. The compounds were added from DMSO stocks; the maximum concentration of DMSO used was 0.1%. Controls without inhibitors included 0.1% DMSO. After 48 h, when control cultures had progressed to new rings, the culture medium was removed, and cultures were incubated for 48 h with 1% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Fixed parasites were then transferred to 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 nM YOYO-1 dye (Molecular Probes). Parasitaemia was determined from dot plots (forward scatter vs. fluorescence) acquired on a FACSort flow cytometer using Cell Quest software (Beckton Dickinson). IC 50 values for growth inhibition were determined from plots of percent control parasitaemia over inhibitor concentration using the Prism 3.0 program, (GraphPad Software), with data from duplicate experiments fitted by nonlinear regression [51].
