In AVA studies, we are especially interested in pedestrian-level wind velocity. The wind velocity ratio (VR) is used as an indicator, which is calculated by VR = V P /V ∞ , where V P is the wind velocity at the pedestrian level (2 m above the ground), and V ∞ is the wind velocity at the boundary layer not affected by ground roughness. Apart from the meteorological data used in estimating the atmospheric stability class, this study includes some wind tunnel test results and field measurements from previous AVA studies, and a pair of LES experiments are undertaken for cross-comparison.
