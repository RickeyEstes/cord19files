Plasma from the farmers and farmers' family members, veterinarians, animal workers and abattoir workers (n = 281, 52 farms plus eight other sites) and serum from the hospital population (n = 1,726) from Dong Thap (Figure 1) were screened for anti-HEV antibody (IgG) using the Wantai ELISA kit (Sanbio, China), following the manufacturer's instructions (Izopet et al., 2015) . All faecal samples and rectal swabs from pigs were screened for HEV RNA using quantified PCR (qPCR) to detect HEV RNA as described by Jothikumar, Cromeans, Robertson, Meng, and Hill (2006) . The qPCR-positive samples were amplified using a nested PCR targeting a 300 bp fragment of ORF2 as previously described by Li et al. (2009) . All PCR amplicons (300 bp) were visualised on 2% agarose gels under ultraviolet (UV) light and sequenced by Sanger sequencing using an ABI 3700 sequencer in both forward and reverse directions using the primers from the second round nested PCR. The HEV sequences were aligned with a subset of publicly available reference sequences from all seven recently new proposed classification of HEV genotypes (Smith et al., 2016) , yielding a 37-reference sequences data set (both ORF2 and whole genome) and 64 Vietnamese sequence data set from pigs (300 bp). All sequences were aligned with MEGA6. Maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred using RAxML v8.2.8 (Stamatakis, 2014) with 100 bootstrap replicates. The tree was visualised and annotated using FigTree (version 1.4.1).
