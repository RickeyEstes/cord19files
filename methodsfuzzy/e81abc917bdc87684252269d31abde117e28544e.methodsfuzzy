The retrospective statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows package version 10.1. The two groups were compared using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U-analysis for patients' profile and clinical outcome, depending on the nature of the data. The methodology chosen is reflected in the results tables and the level of significance was chosen as p < 0.05 for all statistical analyses. Tables 2 and 3 show the patients' profile and clinical results, respectively. Continuous data was summarised as the mean (Ā) followed by the standard deviation (S.D.) in the formĀ ± S.D. From Table 2 , it can be observed that the two groups of patients essentially have similar profiles. Patients who had early excision and grafting on an average underwent surgery 1.7 days post-injury as compared to 5.5 days for the control group (Table 3) . MR reduced significantly from 45% in the latter group to 16% in the study group. Like- wise, LOS reduced from an average of 58.5 to 48.3 days.
