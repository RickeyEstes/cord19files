Currently, the exponential growth of social media has created serious problems for traditional data analysis algorithms and techniques (such as data mining, statistics, machine learning, and so on) due to their high computational complexity for large datasets. This type of methods does not properly scale as the data size increases. For this reason, the methodologies and frameworks behind the big data concept are becoming very popular in a wide number of research and industrial areas. This section provides a short introduction to the methodology based on the MapReduce paradigm and a description of the most popular framework that implements this methodology, Apache Hadoop. Afterwards Apache Spark is described as emerging big data framework that improves the current performance of the Hadoop framework. Finally, some implementations and tools for big data domain related to distributed data file systems, data analytics, and machine learning techniques are presented. Social big data analytic can be seen as the set of algorithms and methods used to extract relevant knowledge from social media data sources that could provide heterogeneous contents, with very large size, and constantly changing (stream or online data). This is inherently interdisciplinary and spans areas such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, graph mining, information retrieval, and natural language among others. This section provides a description of the basic methods and algorithms related to network analytics, community detection, text analysis, information diffusion, and information fusion, which are the areas currently used to analyse and process information from social-based sources. One of the most important roles of social media is to spread information to social links. With the large amount of data and the complex structures of social networks, it has been even more difficult to understand how (and why) information is spread by social reactions (e.g., retweeting in Twitter and like in Facebook). It can be applied to various applications, e.g., viral marketing, popular topic detection, and virus prevention [75] . As a result, many studies have been proposed for modelling the information diffusion patterns on social networks. The characteristics of the diffusion models are (i) the topological structure of the network (a sub-graph composed of a set of users to whom the information has been spread) and (ii) temporal dynamics (the evolution of the number of users whom the information has reached over time) [76] . According to the analytics, these diffusion models can be categorized into explanatory and predictive approaches [77] . • Explanatory models: The aim of these models is to discover the hidden spreading cascades once the activation sequences are collected. These models can build a path that can help users to easily understand how the information has been diffused. The NETINT method [78] has applied sub-modular, function-based iterative optimisation to discover the spreading cascade (path) that maximises the likelihood of the collected dataset. In particular, for working with missing data, a k-tree model [79] has been proposed to estimate the complete activation sequences. • Predictive models: These are based on learning processes with the observed diffusion patterns. Depending on the previous diffusion patterns, there are two main categories of predictive models: (i) structure-based models (graph-based approaches) and (ii) content-analysis-based models (non-graph-based approaches). Moreover, there are more existing approaches to understanding information diffusion patterns. The projected greedy approach for non-sub-modular problems [80] was recently proposed to populate the useful seeds in social networks. This approach can identify the partial optimisation for understanding the information diffusion. Additionally, an evolutionary dynamics model was presented in [ [81] , [82] ] that attempted to understand the temporal dynamics of information diffusion over time. One of the relevant topics for analysing information diffusion patterns and models is the concept of time and how it can be represented and managed. One of the popular approaches is based on time series. Any time series can be defined as a chronological collection of observations or events. The main characteristics of this type of data are large size, high dimensionality, and continuous change. In the context of data mining, the main problem is how to represent the data. An effective mechanism for compressing the vast amount of time series data is needed in the context of information diffusion. Based on this representation, different data mining techniques can be applied such as pattern discovery, classification, rule discovery, and summarisation [83] . In Lin et al. [84] , a new symbolic representation of time series is proposed that allows for a dimensionality/numerosity reduction. This representation is tested using different classic data mining tasks such as clustering, classification, query by content, and anomaly detection. Based on the mathematical models mentioned above, we need to compare a number of various applications that can support users in many different domains. One of the most promising applications is detecting meaningful social events and popular topics in society. Such meaningful events and topics can be discovered by well-known text processing schemes (e.g., TF-IDF) and simple statistical approaches (e.g., LDA, Gibbs sampling, and the TSTE method [85] ). In particular, not only the time domain but also the frequency domain have been exploited to identify the most frequent events [86] . Trattner and Kappe [93] Targeted advertising on Facebook Real-time measures to detect the most valuable users Jansen et al. [94] Twitter as eWOM advertising mechanism Sentiment analysis Asur et al. [95] Using Twitter to forecast box-office revenues for movies Topics detection, sentiment analysis Ma et al. [96] Viral marketing in social networks Social network analysis, information diffusion models content of tweets in various corporate accounts. The results obtained show that 19% of microblogs mention a brand. Of the branding microblogs, nearly 20% contained some expression of brand sentiments. Therefore, the authors conclude that microblogging reports what customers really feel about the brand and its competitors in real time, and it is a potential advantage to explore it as part of companies overall marketing strategies. Customers brand perceptions and purchasing decisions are increasingly influenced by social media services, and these offer new opportunities to build brand relationships with potential customers. Another approach that uses Twitter data is presented in Asur et al. [95] to forecast box-office revenues for movies. The authors show how a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform marketbased predictors. Moreover, the sentiment extraction from Twitter is used to improve the forecasting power of social media. Because of the exponential growth use of social networks, researchers are actively attempting to model the dynamics of viral marketing based on the information diffusion process. Ma et al. [96] proposed modelling social network marketing using heat diffusion processes. Heat diffusion is a physical phenomenon related to heat, which always flows from a position with higher temperature to a position with lower temperature. The authors present three diffusion models along with three algorithms for selecting the best individuals to receive marketing samples. These models can diffuse both positive and negative comments on products or brands in order to simulate the real opinions within social networks. Moreover, the authors complexity analysis shows that the model is also scalable to large social networks. Table 1 shows a brief summary of the previously described applications, including the basic functionalities for each and their basic methods. Finally, data fusion and data visualisation are two clear challenges in social big data. Although both areas have been intensively studied with regard to large, distributed, heterogeneous, and streaming data fusion [144] and data visualisation and analysis [145] , the current, rapid evolution of social media sources jointly with big data technologies creates some particularly interesting challenges related to: • Obtaining more reliable methods for fusing the multiple features of multimedia objects for social media applications [146] . • Studying the dynamics of individual and group behaviour, characterising patterns of information diffusion, and identifying influential individuals in social networks and other social media-based applications [147] . • Identifying events [148] in social media documents via clustering and using similarity metric learning approaches to produce highquality clustering results [149] . • The open problems and challenges related to visual analytics [145] , especially related to the capacity to collect and store new data, are rapidly increasing in number, including the ability to analyse these data volumes [150] , to record data about the movement of people and objects at a large scale [151] , and to analyse spatio-temporal data and solve spatio-temporal problems in social media [152] , among others.
