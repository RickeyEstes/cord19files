A total of 28 cats that died because of FIP were included in the study. All of them were necropsied at the Department of Veterinary Pathology of the University of Giessen from 2008 to 2010. The cats originated from different husbandry forms, but all of them developed FIP spontaneously. None of the cats had been infected experimentally. With the exception of three cats, the following tissue specimens were taken from each animal: abdominal wall, omentum, liver, intestine, diaphragm, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, pancreas, kidney, lung, and brain. From two of the cats, sampling was restricted to liver and kidney, and from a third one to liver, kidney and pleura. Summing up, 282 tissues were investigated.
