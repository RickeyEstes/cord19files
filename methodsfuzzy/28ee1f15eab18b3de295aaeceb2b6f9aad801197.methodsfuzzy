Virus and cell culture. Murine hepatitis virus-4 was originally obtained from Dr. Leslie P. Weiner (Collins et aL, 1982) and is routinely propagated and assayed in this laboratory on L-24 cells as previously described (Collins et aL, 1982) . Cells were infected with MHV-4 (m.o.i. = 0.01-l) and incubated until extensive syncytium formation was observed (15-20 hr) to serve as a source of viral antigen for immunoblotting and EIA assays described below.
