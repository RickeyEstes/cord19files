Unless otherwise noted, reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Since cholesterol was also present in the supernatant of viral vector after vector production and during transduction, it is possible that the beneficial effects of cholesterol supplementation on transduction efficiency were due in part to either interaction between viral vectors and cholesterol after vector assembly or other effects during the transduction process. To examine these possibilities, viral vectors produced under control conditions were either incubated with 0.03 mM cholesterol for 1 h at 37 â€¢ C before transduction or supplemented with the same concentration of cholesterol during transduction. There was no benefit or a slight decrease for either treatment, while viral vectors produced with cholesterol supplementation yielded about a 2-fold increase in transduction efficiency (Fig. 4) . This indicates that cholesterol must be added during vector production to obtain the benefits. Cholesterol was delivered to cell culture as a complex with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. To evaluate the effects of MbCD alone on vector production, 0.25 mM of MbCD (the same concentration as that in the complex with cholesterol) was added to producer cells both before and after transfection. MbCD alone had little effect on transduction efficiency (Fig. 5) . As expected, a higher concentration of empty MbCD (5 mM) greatly decreased the transduction efficiency even when exposed to producer cells for only 9 h (Fig. 5  insert) .
