Families who where expecting a child were asked by the midwife at the maternity ward whether they were interested in participating in the study. Only parents who reported they had a history of allergy in the mother, in both parents, or in neither parent were eligible. The parents provided a blood sample and underwent skin prick tests (SPTs). Only parents whose SPT results confirmed their positive or negative history of respiratory allergy to pollen and/or furred pets were invited to continue. When evaluated at 24 months of age, 246 children (126 boys and 120 girls) born to the selected parents participated in the study. One hundred two children had 2 allergic parents, 75 children had an allergic mother, and 69 children had no parental history of allergy. All infants were born full-term (>35 weeks of gestation) at hospitals in Stockholm and had birth weights within the normal range (data not shown). The socioeconomic status of the  The serostatus against 13 viruses was investigated: respiratory tract infections, including adenovirus, influenza (A/H1, A/H3, and influenza B), parainfluenza (types 1, 2, 3), and RSV; and herpesvirus, including CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). IgG against the EBV capsid antigen and HHV6 was determined according to previously published immunofluorescence assays. 9,10 A specific fluorescence in dilution of 1/20 was regarded as a sign of seropositivity. For HSV, CMV, and VZV IgG ELISA with purified nuclear antigens from the respective viruses cultivated in human fetal lung fibroblasts were used. 11, 12 The cutoff for seropositivity was an absorbance of >0.2 at a dilution of 1/100. IgG antibodies against influenza A/H1, A/H3, and influenza B were determined with ELISAs by using recombinant influenza antigens. 13 IgG antibodies against parainfluenza (serotypes 1, 2, 3), RSV, and adenoviruses were measured by ELISA. The viruses were cultured to full cytopathogenic effect either in human fetal lung fibroblasts (RSV, adenovirus) or MA 104 cells (monkey kidney cells, parainfluenza) and prepared mainly by ultracentrifugation and sonification of clarified supernatants. For adenovirus, sonicated, infected cells were used. Preparations from the respective cell lines were used as control antigen in the assays using cell culture antigen. Optical densities above 0.3 after subtraction of control antigen activity were regarded as a sign of past infection for the respiratory viruses.
