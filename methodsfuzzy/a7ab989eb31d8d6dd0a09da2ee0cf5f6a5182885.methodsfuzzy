A cross-sectional study using Internet resources was carried out to analyze one health applications to zoonoses in scholarly resources from 1984 to 2012, representing a 28-year review. Before conducting the Internet search, clear definitions were made of the one health resources. Scholarly material was distinguished as eligible and ineligible using the following criteria which were found on Google Scholar and Ebscohost. (1) Peer-reviewed publications were classified as scientific journals and literature reviews of the pertinent subject matter (human, animal, and environmental health) that had been published in peer-reviewed journals. (2) Professional presentations were represented by formal presentations made by organizations and other professionals on the subject matter of human, animal, and environmental health, presenting research material, policy developments, or promotional activities in support of one health. (3) Grants and funding allocations were characterized as proposals for funding research, policy development, and so forth in the collaborative subject matter of humans, animals, and the environment accessed from reviewing all professional publications available from the systematic search conducted. (4) WHO-related reporting included updates from the website that involved relevant health issues, specifically reflecting the one health approach. (5) Book and book chapters were qualified as books or selections involving the subject matter. The target population included all published studies that addressed the one health philosophy and which met the inclusion criteria. The documentation review included resources found on the Internet through the search engines and databases identified, which fit into the criteria of a one health approach and which took place from the concept's adoption of January 1, 1984. Excluded from this study were studies that were not found on the Internet databases, those that did not involve the one health concept, or fit the criteria of a one health approach, or those that were reported outside the period of study. Database searches were conducted from May to July 2011. In the search fields for Google Scholar and Ebscohost, the terms "one health, " "health, " "human, " "animal, " and "zoonoses" were typed in. The first result that appeared from the database was reviewed and then assessed, using the definitions, to determine whether it fits into one of the one health approach criteria. Every fifth search result was examined and after reaching results on both databases numbered 130 onward, every second result was then considered. For every result that did not meet the inclusion criteria, the very next result was examined, and so forth, until a result did meet the criteria. After a result met the criteria, the fifth result from the last selected result was examined to be included in the review. Each scholarly initiative that met the inclusion criteria was separated into its initiative category as well as into its year of publication. In addition, each resulting initiative was further categorized by the subject matter covered in the scholarly work. Considering one health scopes, these were the common subject areas covered: zoonoses, agriculture, food safety, environmental health, and global health. These categories were condensed from a larger, more complex list provided by the One Health Initiative Task Force [3] . For resources that contributed to more than one scope, such as agriculture and food safety, the final determination was made on the emphasis of one of the scopes from within the contents of the title. Finally, each initiative was also categorized into being conducted in, or having an analysis on, either a developed or developing nation based on a country's gross domestic product (GDP). All the results were then categorized by their year of publication, the initiative that was represented, scope covered within the work, and the geographic distribution of where the initiative was conducted or what area was analyzed. SPSS statistical software package version 18.0 was used to analyze the frequencies of the years of scholarly resources, the initiative types, scopes categories, and geographic distribution.
