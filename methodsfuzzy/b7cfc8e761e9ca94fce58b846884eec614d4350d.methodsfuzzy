2.1. Mammalian expression vector containing porcine IFNA cDNA cDNA encoding porcine IFNA was prepared by RT-PCR and placed under the transcriptional regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate a plasmid expressing the insert (pINA) (Meier et al., 2004) . As a control plasmid, the IFNA cDNA was excised from pINA by EcoRI digestion and religated with the dephosphory-lated plasmid backbone to generate a recombinant having the insert in the opposite orientation relative to that in pINA (pANI). Plasmid structure was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. Unlike pINA, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with pANI failed to secrete detectable amounts of biologically active IFNA. Large quantities of both plasmids were prepared as previously described (Meier et al., 2004) .
