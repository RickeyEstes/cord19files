The One-Health approach has recently been applied to combat zoonotic viral disease, spearheaded by the veterinary community. Viral infection in humans can be prevented with the use of vaccinations, a common practice for a number of viruses for which vaccines have been developed, including influenza [67] , poliovirus [68] , and rotavirus [18, 69] . Vaccines are known to lessen the disease burden in a population both by preventing infection and promoting herd immunity [70] . In cases for which the pathway to human infection has an intermediary animal vector between the host organism and humans, the vaccination of the intermediary animal could also prove vital. This was performed in one of the most successful One-Health implementations to date, for a Hendra virus outbreak in Australia. Hendra virus is one of several zoonotic viruses, including Nipah virus, Tioman virus, and lyssavirus, that originate in bats. It was determined that Hendra virus is first transmitted from bats to horses before being transmitted to humans, and no direct infection between bats and humans was observed. Therefore, a Hendra virus vaccine was developed for horses in order to eliminate the transmission route to humans [71] . On different occasions the strategy is to eliminate or lessen the disease vector responsible for transmission of the disease to humans; for example, mosquito control strategies can be utilized to lessen the burden of West Nile virus, Zika virus, and other viruses for which mosquitos are the primary transmission vector. Chemical methods of mosquito control (such as insecticides, insect growth regulators, and sprays) are commonly used, though these methods could also have an adverse effect on the health of humans, animals, and the surrounding environment, which are of important consideration to the One-Health approach. More "eco-friendly" options are also recently in use, such as sterile insect techniques and plant-based non-harmful mosquitocidals [72] . A One-Health approach has been shown in the past to be effective at reducing costs and improving efficiency in the mitigation of Rift Valley fever virus to improve public health [73] . Smaller-scale policy changes that focus on particular viruses could also help to curb the spread of viral disease. For example, after it was determined that bats were the host species and civets the transmittance vector species for SARS coronavirus, affected areas (such as China) enacted bans on civet trading and the mixing of bats with other species in local markets [71] . This shows that policies can be created to require the use of interventions to block exposure pathways for particular viruses. Public education is also a useful approach, utilized with outbreaks of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, in which people were encouraged to avoid direct contact with bats and taking preventative measures to minimize the chances of viral transmission [71] . Still, these One-Health success stories have focused on zoonotic viruses, concentrating on how animal health relates to human health. Because viruses can be transmitted in a variety of exposure pathways, environmental health is also of vital importance. While environmental considerations have begun to be considered on a more local scale [74] , these aspects have still not been as thoroughly investigated using the One-Health approach. Environmental engineers and scientists therefore have a critical role in the application of the One-Health methodology. In the application of the One-Health concept to combat water-related viral disease, a three-tiered approach is appropriate (Fig. 2) . The first step is to identify critical pathways of exposure. The goal of this step is to identify and prioritize environmental virus reservoirs and critical exposure pathways that facilitate transmission and transport of viral disease among humans and animals. The second step is to design surveillance of the critical environmental reservoirs and pathways. The goal of this step is to identify critical times and critical locations for the onset of water-related viral outbreaks. The final step is to design intervention approaches. The goal of this step is design barriers to interrupt critical pathways at critical times and locations.
