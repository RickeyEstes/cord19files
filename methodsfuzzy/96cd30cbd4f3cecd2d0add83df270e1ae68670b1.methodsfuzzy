Viruses Ninety-nine laboratory isolates of influenza A viruses were obtained from the influenza virus repository at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA-Weybridge), grown in 9-to 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated fowls' eggs (EFEs) and typed using standard protocols. 27, 33 These included 51 swine influenza virus (SIV) isolates, 43 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates plus five H1N1v isolates, which included two from humans and three from pigs (Table 1) . These EFE-grown influenza A viruses were diluted at least 100-to 1000-fold prior to RNA extraction to give levels of virus that approximate to those present in clinical specimens. 34 Biological infectivity of EFE-grown influenza A viruses was determined as the median egg infectious dose (EID 50 ) per ml. 35
