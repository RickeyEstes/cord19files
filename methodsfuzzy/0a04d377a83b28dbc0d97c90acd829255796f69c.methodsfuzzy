All the raw materials including reagents, catalysts, solvents and drying agents were of fine chemical grade and utilized as received by the vendor. The MTT [2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazol-3-ium bromide] dye was purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA. Infrared (IR) spectra of the synthesized materials were recorded in the range of 4000-550 cm -1 with PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer. By using TMS as internal reference compound, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d 6 solvent on JEOL 400 MHz and Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature. Using ThermoQuest Elemental Analyzer, elemental analyses of the compounds was carried out. Electronic spectra of ligands and their metal complexes were recorded on a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 365 UV-Vis spectrophotometer in the range of 1100-200 nm. Thermal analysis of the metal complexes was carried out with an SDT Q600 analyzer, by increasing the temperature from RT to 1000 °C at the rate of 10 °C min -1 . The molar conductance measurements were made on ELICO CM 180 conductivity meter with a cell constant of 1.0 after calibration with standard KCl solution at 25 °C. LC-ESI-MS spectra were recorded on LCMS 2010A, SHIMADZU instrument.
