Homology modeling of the ACE2 structure. The sequences of ACE2, tACE, and AnCE were aligned by using the multiple sequence alignment program CLUSTALW [10] . The comparative modeling procedure COMPOSER [11, 12] implemented in SYBYL6.9 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) was used to build a 3D model of the ACE2 structure. We used the tACE and AnCE structures to find out topologically equivalent residues based on structural alignment and the structurally conserved regions (SCRs) were modeled. The structurally variable regions (loops) were modeled by using loops either from the corresponding location of the homologous protein or from the general protein database. The 3D model of ACE2 was then subjected to energy minimization by using standard Tripos force fields and finally validated with the PROCHECK program [13] . The coordinates were deposited to the protein data bank (PDB) (code: 1RIX). Modeling of a fragment containing the S-glycoprotein RBD. The threading was performed by the GeneFold module in SYBYL6.9 that uses three different scoring functions combining sequence and structure information [14] . The cytokine binding region of gp130 (PDB code 1BQU) was selected as a putative target structure with high scores from all the three scoring algorithms. The loops in the model were generated using protein loop search function of the GeneFold by scanning protein structural database for similar sequences. Among seven cysteine residues in the model, three pairs of disulfide bonds (S-S) were simulated and the resulting model was energy minimized. The model was validated with the PROCHECK program [13] . Modeling of glycosylation sites, electrostatic analysis, solvent accessibility, and surface hydrophobicity. The sequences of both ACE2 and the S RBD were scanned against the PROSITE [15] motifs in order to locate potential glycosylation sites. Six N-glycosylation sites with high probability of occurrences on ACE2 were predicted by PROSITE. Fully surface-exposed asparagine (N) residues were found at five of these sites, which were modeled by attaching N-acetylglucosamine moieties. Three N-glycosylation sites were found in the S RBD fragment and were modeled similarly. The areas of solvent accessibility (ASA) were calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 A by using the Lee and Richards' algorithm [16] . Electrostatistic potentials were calculated by using the program GRASP [17] with the following parameters: a protein dielectric constant of 2.0, a solvent dielectric constant of 80, an ion exclusion radius of 2.0 A, a probe radius of 1.4 A, and an ionic strength of 0.14 M. The calculated potentials were displayed at the solvent-accessible surface. The visualization of solvent accessibility, super-positioning of molecules, and calculation of surface hydrophobicity were performed by using InsightII. The hydrophobicity of the surface residues was calculated according to the Kyte-Doolittle method [18] with a window size of 5, and hydrophobic and hydrophilic levels of 0.7 and )2.4, respectively.
