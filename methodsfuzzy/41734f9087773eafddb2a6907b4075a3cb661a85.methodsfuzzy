The seasonal decomposition analysis was based on the seasonal trend decomposition using Loess (STL), which incorporates three components: trend, seasonal, and remainder or residual [21] . Advantages of the method include its simplicity and speed of computation, the robustness of results, and flexibility in the period of the seasonal component [22] . In the present study, IIDs were analysed by performing a seasonal decomposition of the time series. This assay employed Holt-Winters filtering and Ljung-Box test to define the structure (additive or multiplicative) and seasonality (stationary or non-stationary). Using an additive model, the IID results were compiled by summing three components: where Z t represents the monthly incidence rates of the diseases, M t represents the trend, S t symbolizes the seasonal variation, and R t denotes the remainder. The result of seasonal decomposition analysis is displayed in a figure with the time from 2006 to 2016 on the horizontal axis and the incidence rate on the vertical axis. The concept of spatial autocorrelation was proposed by Tobler in the first geography law [23] : "Everything is related to everything else, but nearest things are more related than distant things." Moran's I was the tool used to measure spatial autocorrelation and consists of two types: global Moran's I and local Moran's I. Global Moran's I measures the general spatial autocorrelation and the spatial distribution of research object. Local Moran's I reflects the local spatial autocorrelation and the cluster regions. In the present study, spatial autocorrelation was applied to analyse the IIDs. Global Moran's I shows the overall cluster level and distribution of IIDs; local Moran's I reveals the specific cluster regions and cluster categories and the hotspots of IIDs [24] . Global Moran's I is an index ranging from − 1 to 1. When the index was distributed around − 1, the overall spatial distribution displayed the dissimilarity, indicating that high cluster regions bordered on low cluster regions. When the index was approximately 0, a distinct spatial cluster was not observed in the studied regions. When the index was close to 1, the overall spatial distribution revealed the similarity, indicating that the same cluster category was bounded on another cluster category. The following equation was used to calculate the global autocorrelation: where n denotes the number of observed values, x i represents the incidence rate in province I, x j represents the incidence rate in province j, x indicates the mean value, and w ij represents a spatial weight matrix of systematic binomial distribution, which represents neighbouring relations between geographical units with n representing the total number of those units . In the present study, the data were based on regions. The value for w ij is 1 if province i and province j are adjacent. Otherwise, the value is 0. Local Moran's I avoids the weaknesses of global spatial autocorrelation by analysing the spatial autocorrelation of certain characters in local regions. The range and explanation for the local Moran's I was same as the global index. The cluster results obtained from local Moran's I were classified into four types: high-high cluster (HH, which indicated that the high cluster areas were surrounded by other high cluster areas), high-low cluster (HL, which indicated that the high cluster areas were surrounded by low cluster areas), low-high cluster (LH), and low-low (LL) cluster. The clusters were visualized using LISA cluster maps. The following equation was used to calculate local Moran's I: where y i represents the incidence rate in province I, y j represents the incidence rate in province j, y indicates the mean value. [25] In the present study, we analysed a long period to investigate the incidence rates of different IIDs. The years 2006, 2011, 2016 were selected to show the long-term changes.
