With an estimated fever prevalence of 10% among a population of subjects presenting to the medical centre and an estimated correlation of more than 0.5 between two thermal scanners, it was proposed that a total sample size of approximately 600 subjects would be needed for this evaluation. The questionnaire responses, ITDS recorded data and oral temperature measurements were entered into an Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) database and analysed with the R Statistical Software 3.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 21 Self-reported fever, ITDS and oral temperature measurements were analysed with descriptive statistics. Intra-class correlation and Cohen's Kappa statistics are descriptive statistics to determine inter-observer variability for quantitative and categorical measurements made by different observers respectively. Inter-observer variability for handheld thermoscope (quantitative measurements) and other ITDS (categorical measurements) were therefore assessed via intraclass correlation and Cohen's Kappa statistics respectively. Univariate regression models were conducted to investigate variables (age, sex, recent analgesic/antipyretic use, time of day and ambient temperature) which could be associated with temperature measurements and to identify factors that influenced the difference between oral and ITDS temperature measurements. Linear regression models were used if the outcome variable is a handheld thermoscope measurement and logistic regression models were used if the outcome variable is a self-reported fever or ITDS measurement. Factors that were significant at a significance level of 0.05 were included in the final multivariate linear or logistic regression models. All tests were assessed at a significance level of 0.05. Sensitivity (the proportion of those with confirmed fever identified as febrile by ITDS/self-report) and specificity (the proportion of those who are confirmed afebrile and were identified as afebrile by ITDS/self-report) were calculated. To examine the difference in sensitivity and specificity, McNemar's test was conducted.
