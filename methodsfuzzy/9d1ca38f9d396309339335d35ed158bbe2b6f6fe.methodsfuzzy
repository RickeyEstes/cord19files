Several different laboratory testing methods for detecting influenza virus are available in the United States ( Table 1) and Canada ( Table 2) . These methods include immunofluorescence microscopy (direct or indirect antibody staining), viral culture (conventional and rapid), RT-PCR, RIDTs, and serologic testing. Among these testing methods, RIDTs with rapid processing yielding timely results that can influence clinical decision making and patient management are most pertinent for the needs of the ED. Based on which type(s) of influenza virus (A and/or B) can be detected, diagnostic tests can be categorized into 3 types: (1) those that detect only influenza A; (2) those that detect either influenza A or B, but cannot discriminate between the two; and (3) tests that both detect and distinguish between influenza A or B viruses. Only RT-PCR and viral culture can identify influenza strains.
