Function f mentioned in Section 2.4.1 is defined as average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover operation. Based on the logical structure of Algorithm SEIQRA mentioned in Section 2.3, we can design a simple structure of SEIQRA as follows: Algorithm SEIQRA Initialize all the parameters SEIQRA involves as specified in Table 3 ; FORt ¼1 TOG //Where t is used to count generations or periods of evolution; G is the maximum generations or periods of evolution. FOR each individual i Step 1: Calculate the state transition probability of the individual by state transition Eqs. (10) and (11); Step 2: Determine which state s the individual may transfer to at time t based on its state transition probability computed by Step1; Step 3: If state transition from time t À1 to time t is legal, then carry out information exchange by transferring some features of some randomly-selected individuals at time tÀ 1 to the corresponding features of the individual at time t; else the state of the individual keeps unchanged. Step 4: Compute the IPI value of the individual by formula (13), if its IPI value is improved when comparing to that at time t À1, then the individual evolves to the new state s at time t; else the individual still stay at its old state at time t À 1.
