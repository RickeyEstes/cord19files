The sequence of spike protein was downloaded from GenBank (NP_828851). Liu et al. [6] found that the region 75-609 of SARS-CoV S protein matches to the conserved coronavirus S1 domain PF01600 in HMM database and the region 641-1247 matches to conserved coronavirus S2 domain PF01601 in HMM database. In previous study, we have predicted the structure of SARS-CoV S2 protein [7] . Here, we used the same method 3D Jury system [8] to predict the 3D structure of SARS-CoV S1 protein based on the domain (residues 75-609) mentioned above. The proteins with sufficiently high 3D score were used as templates to construct 3D models of S1 by MODELLER program [9] . The quality of 3D model was evaluated by ProQ program [10] and finally validated with the PROCHECK program [11] . The best model was used for further analyses. Specifically, NCI program [12] was used to identify noncanonical interactions in protein structures. VAST (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html), DALI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) and CE [13] programs were employed to search the structure neighbors of S1 protein. The structural comparison was performed by LGA [14] . The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).
