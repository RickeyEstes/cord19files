All PCR testing was performed at the Ministry of Health Regional Lab in Jeddah. The MagNa Pure Compact/ MagNa Pure 96 (Roche) automated system was used to extract RNA from samples. Primers and probes for upE and Orf 1a targets of MERS-CoV were used from TIB MOLBIOL (Germany) along with Master Mix from Roche for the Light Cycler 480 II (Roche) were used to amplify upE and Orf 1a gene targets. Samples that tested positive for both upE and Orf 1a gene targets with a cycle threshold time of less than 37 were considered confirmed cases. Positive and negative controls were used to monitor the amplification process & to check for any inhibition of amplification.
