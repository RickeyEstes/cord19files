Several approaches have been used together with liquid chromatography (LC) separation followed by either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem mass spectrometry to study protein-protein interactions. These techniques, namely tandem affinity purification (TAP), immunoprecipitation (IP), and quantification by stable isotope labeling, have been increasingly advanced to put perspectives into the interactions between viruses and hosts at the protein level. As sample preparation strategies differ, sensitivity and subsequent MS identifications also varies. However, each method has its own uniqueness and strength, and could be used complementarily for elucidating the mechanisms viruses use to infect their hosts and host countermeasures to fight the infection. TAP tagging is a dual purification technique. The protein of interest is expressed with the TAP tag at either the N-or the Cterminus. The TAP tag contains two affinity tags separated by a protease cleavage site. Usually, the distal tag is Protein A, the proximal tag is a calmodulin-binding peptide, and the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence is used to join the two tags [10] . When the TAP-tagged protein is expressed from a chosen cell type, it forms a protein complex with its binding partners. The protein complex can be isolated by first using IgG-sepharose beads, which capture Protein A, followed by washing and cleavage with TEV protease. Non-specific bindings with the complex can be reduced by washing and proteins bound to Protein A and resin are left behind after the cleavage. The protein complex is recaptured with calmodulin sepharose beads by calcium-dependent interaction with calmodulin-binding peptide, washed again to reduce non-specific binding and finally released by calcium chelation with EGTA. Finally, the purified protein complex is digested with trypsin and analyzed using nanoLC coupled with tandem MS for protein identification. TAP-MS based methodology has two main advantages. Firstly, the successive two-step affinity procedure helps to reduce the amount of contaminating proteins. Secondly, it can be applied to almost any protein without relying on any specific antibody, making it reproducible which contribute to the efficiency of the further robust MS analysis [11] . The TAP tagging strategy has been successfully used in various model organisms. However, in mammalian cells, expression of the tagged proteins is more difficult from their endogenous chromosomal locations. To circumvent this problem, various tag combinations and vector backbones have been introduced to express the cDNA encoding the protein of interest fused in frame with a TAP tag [12] [13] [14] . The expression of the fusion protein must be carefully controlled so that the level is similar to that of the endogenous protein of interest [15] . Several studies have used TAP tagging to identify virus and host factors associated with key virus proteins. In one experiment, a TAP tag was fused with the nucleoprotein (N) of borna disease virus (BDV), a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus that persistently infects the central ner-vous system of warm-blooded animals. The TAP-tagged N was efficiently incorporated into the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), did not interfere with BDV replication and was also packaged into viral particles. Tandem affinity purification of vRNPs resulted in two forms of N (p38 and p39), the phosphoprotein (P, p23), and the matrix protein (M, p16), as well as the viral genomic RNA [16] . In another study, the viral RNA polymerase subunits PB1, PB2 and PA of the influenza A virus were expressed by cotransfection of their cDNAs in human HEK293T cells, with one of the polymerases fused to a TAP tag. The purified protein complex containing all three viral polymerase subunits and their cellular protein partners were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. The 10 associated human proteins found included nuclear factors involved in RNA synthesis, modification and export, as well as cytosolic proteins involved in translation and transport [17] . Co-immunoprecipitation, also known as pull-down, is an antibody-dependent technique requiring a specific antibody, which recognizes and purifies the target protein from cell lysis. Although there exist some disadvantages of this method, e.g. that the number of antibodies is limited compared to the numerous intracellular proteins, and that the specificity of antibody is required but not always guaranteed [18] , CO-IP-MS is still commonly used in proteomic research as an increasing number of related papers have been published. In one study, Noisakran et al. employed coimmunoprecipitation, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to study the functions of NS1 protein in dengue and its interacting partners in the infected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). MS analysis successfully identified eight isoforms of NS1 and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2, which were co-purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody. This association between NS1 and hnRNP C1/C2 was suggested to have implications on cellular responses in favor of virus replications [19] . Also, Watanabe et al. utilized immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF-MS to analyze the influenza virus M1 protein and its interacting partners. It was found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) would bind to the C-terminal of M1 to repress its function [20] . From the immunological perspectives, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules are considered as bio-chips for collecting and displaying peptides degraded and secreted from the multiple cellular compartments [21] . Sharma et al. used an immunoinformatic strategy to characterize the potential peptides from the proteome of H1N1 influenza virus that could be recognized by HLA molecules, resulting in the discovery of 15 and 14 Influenza virus specific peptides matching with HLA class I and HLA class II molecules, respectively [22] . Therefore, these HLA class I molecules may carry invaluable information for viral and host proteome after the virus infection and HLA-chip followed by MS could be used as a strategy for mapping the host proteome changes before and after virus infection. Recently, Wahl et al. used MS for comparative studies of the eluted host peptides from the HLA class I molecules of the native Hela cells and Hela cells infected with three different strains of influenza virus, H1N1 PR8, H1N1 7485, and H3N2 309 [23] . In the infected cells, this approach not only identified 20 unique host peptides, which were strain-specific to these three influenza viruses, but also detected 347 host peptides with increased expressions. All these altered host peptides could be further studied by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to map the virus-host protein interactions. In another research, Hickman et al. utilized Q-TOF-MS to study peptides binding to HLA-B*0702 molecules produced by human T cells before and after HIV infection, resulting in identification of 15 proteins uniquely presented on the infected T cells [24] . What is more, an elevated level of soluble HLA class I molecules was detected in patients' serum, whether upon viral infection [25] or during cancer development [26] , and these sHLA class I molecules may also hold specific disease-related peptides, which could be further investigated as potential biomarkers for disease diagnostics [27] .
