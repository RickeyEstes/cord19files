This is a case controlled study involving 125 adult patients with SLE all suffering from LN (72 females and 53 males, age mean ± SD = 23.4 ± 4.4 years) and 112 healthy unrelated subjects (46 males and 66 females, age mean ± SD = 28.3 ± 6.2 years). Patients were recruited from the Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. The diagnosis of SLE in patients was according to the American College of Rheumatology (1982) revised criteria for SLE (Tan et al., 1982) . Assessment of the severity of SLE was based upon the classification of LN (Weening et al., 2004) where class I: normal glomeruli (0 cases), class II: purely mesangial disease (8 cases), class III: focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (25 cases), class IV: diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (88 cases), and class V: membranous glomerulonephritis (4 cases). The study was approved by the ethical and scientific committees of Mansoura University. An informed consent was also obtained from all participants before the start of the study.
