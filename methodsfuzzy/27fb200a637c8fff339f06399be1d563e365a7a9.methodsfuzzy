Preliminary metabolomic analysis was performed to select a suitable method for the comprehensive profiling of metabolites within bovine plasma. RP and HILIC chromatographic methods were compared using day 6 p.i. samples (n = 6), which corresponds to peak viral titre [25] . Despite improved resolution of poorly retained hydrophobic compounds eluting between 1-2min by HILIC separation, increased chromatographic peaks corresponding to plasma derived compounds (relative to blank injections) were observed in RP acquired profiles (Fig 1A and 1B) relative to HILIC profiles (Fig 1C and 1D ). Observable differences between plasma samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals within chromatogram profiles were only present using RP (S1 Fig) . Furthermore, upon data extraction and processing (metabolites with CV > 50% in QC pools), increased numbers of accurate mass retention time pairs (AMRTPs) were observed following RP (n = 1165) relative to HILIC (n = 538) separation of plasma. Unsupervised PCA analysis of plasma profiles acquired by RP-UPLC-MS resulted in clear separation between study groups when assessing principle components (PC) 1 and 2 (57.4% of systemic (R2X) variation within the dataset) as illustrated in Fig 2A. In contrast, HILIC-UPLC-MS metabolomic profiles facilitated only partial separation between study groups based on the PCA scores plot (PC1 and PC2, 35.6% of systemic (R2X) variation) ( Fig  2B) . Due to the small number of chromatographic peaks, fewer AMRTPs and poor unsupervised PCA separation of plasma profiles acquired following HILIC-UPLC-MS chromatography, RP-UPLC-MS was selected as the method of choice for metabolomic profiling of remaining study plasma samples.
