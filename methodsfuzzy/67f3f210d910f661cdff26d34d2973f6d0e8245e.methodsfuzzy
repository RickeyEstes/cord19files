We measured mucosa-to-serosa permeation rates of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 40,000 mol wt; polyethylene glycol (PEG), 4000 mol wt; and mannitol, 182 mol wt across stripped piglet jejunal mucosal segments, mounted in Ussing chambers and studied under zero transport conditions. Conventional York Landrace piglets, obtained at 14 days Abbreviations used in this paper: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TGE, transmissible gastroenteritis. of age from a local herd known to be free of TGE and weaned to an evaporated cow milk formula for 3-5 days, were studied after infection with a standard oral dose of Purdue strain of TGE virus, and the findings were compared with those from uninfected matched controls (3) . All TGE-infected animals were housed in an isolation unit and studied either 12 h (5 piglets) or 96 h (6 piglets) after they were inoculated with virus. The 12-h interval was selected to coincide with the time at which TGE virus is known to invade the upper small intestinal mucosa (4) . At 96 h, our own studies (6) and others in the literature (4) demonstrate that diarrhea is well established but that the viruscladen epithelial cells have been shed into the lumen. In the present experiments, the piglets consistently developed vomiting and anorexia within 12 h of receiving TGE virus; diarrhea began within 24 h and peaked between 40 and 96 h. For the macromolecular permeation studies, the animals were killed after an overnight fast with 325 mg of pentabarbilal sodium given parenterally; the proximal portion of the small intestine was then quickly removed. Fifteencentimeter lengths of piglet jejunum were flushed with ice-cold norma.l saline, slipped over 5-ml pipettes for identification of Peyer's patches, stripped of muscular and visceral peritoneal layers, and opened into sheets. For light-microscopic studies, segments containing Peyer's patches and adjoining segments without patches were fixed in Bouin's solution, then in 95% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For transport studies, adjacent segments were immediately mounted in conventional Ussing chambers (exposing an area of 1.27 cm Z ). Three pairs of tissue segments, each consisting of a patch-containing and a contiguous patch-free segment, were mounted in the chambers, using six chambers for each experiment. Chambers were per-fUSed with oxygenated chamber buffer (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate, pH 7.4 at 37Â°C with 1 mg/ml porcine serum albumin and 3 mM D-glucose). After a 10-min equilibrium period, HRP (Sigma type II, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the mucosal compartment at a final concentration of 0.5 mM (20 mg/ml); in some experiments [3Bimanriitol, 10 p,Ci/chamber, final concentration 0.5 mM or [ 14 C]polyethylene glycol 4000, 10 p,Ci/chamber, 0.69 mM final concentration, or both, were added to the mucosal chamber also. Preliminary studies had established that neither of these latter two compounds altered HRP transpoit. Serial samples were taken from the serosal reservoir for measurement of the macromolecules added to the mucosal side of the tissue. To eliminate any effects of transmucosal potential difference (PD) on HRP movement, a short-circuiting current was applied throughout the experiment to reduce the PD to zero; PD and the shortcircuiting current were monitored at 10 min. In previous studies (2), we found that HRP did not alter the shortcircuiting current, but HRP transport was -10% higher across short-circuited tissue than across tissue that was not short-circuited. Horseradish peroxidase was assayed kinetically as previously described (2) using o-dianisidine as the indicator. Radioactivity was measured using Aquasol 2 scintillation fluid (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.), in a Beckman MACROMOLECULAR ABSORPTION IN VIRAL ENTERITIS 999 L57500 Liquid Scintillation System equipped with a data reduction accessory (Beckman Instruments Inc., Irvine, Calif.) for double-label analysis. Mucosa-to-serosa transport rates were determined from the slope of the line describing probe appearance in the serosal chamber in the steady-state time period, 40-80 min after addition. Serosato-mucosa transport rates were not studied because of an apparent toxic effect of HRP when presented at the serosal surface (2) . Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t-test. The molecular weight distribution of the peroxidase activity appearing in the serosal chamber was examined by gel chromatography on a 1.5 x 27-cm column of Sephadex G-75 (fine) (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J.), as previously described (2) . The peroxidase activity from the serosal chamber moved as a single peak identical to that seen for native BRP in studies of both control and infected animals, patch and nonpatch segments. Horseradish peroxidase (grade II), porcine serum albumin (fraction V), bovine serum albumin (fraction V). o-dianisidine, cytochrome c (practical), Sephadex G-75 (fine), and NaF were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. [ 14 C]Polyethylene glycol 4000 (sp act, 0.78 mCi/mg) and [3H]mannitol (sp act, 17 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from local suppliers. Deionized water, prepared with a MilliQ apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) was used throughout.
