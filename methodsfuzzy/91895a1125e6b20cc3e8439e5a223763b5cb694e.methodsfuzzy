To show the superiority of our method, comprehensive comparisons with four existing tools (Muppirala et al [21] ., Wang et al [23] ., RPI-Pred [25] , rpiCOOL [28] ) were listed in Table 3 . Among existing prediction methods, RPI-Pred [25] performed best of those tested on the RPI369 dataset, and rpiCOOL [28] performed better than others on the RPI2241dataset. Table 3 shows that our method achieved the second rank when testing on RPI369, and encouragingly, our method ranked first when testing on RPI2241. As RPI369 only contained 369 RNA-protein interaction pairs, the models developed on this small sample size will not guarantee generalization capability. In contrast, models developed on RPI2241 used more training samples and will be more reliable for prediction on blind samples (the samples with no experiment information). On this point, because our method achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.95 on RPI2241, we believe that our method outperforms the four existing prediction tools.
