From 1 March 1995 to 30 June 1996 a total of 3078 faecal specimens arriving at the laboratory were examined on receipt and categorized as liquid, semisolid or solid. They were processed according to our laboratory's routine procedures for virus isolation and EM. A 10% suspension of faeces was prepared in 10 ml of Hank's salt solution containing 1000 units of penicillin, 1000 ~tg of streptomycin and 2.5 ~tg of amphotericin B per ml in a glass universal bottle containing sterile glass beads. The suspension was shaken in a mechanical floor mounted shaker for 15 min and centrifuged at 4000 g for I h at 4 Â°C. All faecal specimens were processed for virus isolation. Those specimens which from the clinical details on the request form were clearly from patients with an illness other than gastroenteritis were not tested by EM. All other specimens were tested by EM, including those with no clinical details on the request form. For the period of the study the consistency category of the faecal specimen was not used to decide whether or not to do EM. EM was performed using a protocol based on a published methodology. 3 In brief, drops of clarified 10% faecal suspension were placed on a sheet of dental wax. A glow discharged carbon-coated Formvar grid, film side downwards, was placed on each drop of specimen suspension and left at room temperature for 3 h or overnight. Grids were dried and stained with 2% methylamine tungstate pH 6.5 for 5-10 min and examined at a magnification of 34 000. Virus isolation was carried out using a microtitre plate based system using cells inoculated in suspension. ~ All specimens were inoculated into six cell lines: (HEp2 human epithelial continuous ATCC CCL23), Vero E6 (African green monkey continuous ATCC CRL1586), RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma continuous ATCC CCL136), primary rhesus monkey kidney (supplied by CPHL, Porton Down) and two human fibroblast semicontinuous cell lines (established in the Regional Virus Laboratory (RVL), Belfast, U.K.). The case notes of two inpatients who had a negative followed by a positive result for rotavirus during the same clinical episode were examined to see how the consistency of their faeces varied at the time of these results. The data was extracted using an in-house developed modular and generic relational data application (PVCS95) constructed using Paradox DOS Version 4.01 (Borland), which serves as the RVL Belfast laboratory computer system. Clinical data accompanying the request was entered as free text and subsequently searched for eight indicator text strings (diarrh, vomit, watery, foul, offensiv, D + V, gastro, enteritis) to determine the number of requests specifically detailing a gastroenteritis-like illness. The text search was not case sensitive and recognized both partial and whole worlds. In order to assess whether group differences (positive vs. negative) were due to the consistency of the faecal sample, a Chi-squared test for linear trend was performed. All statistical analyses were performed using EPI-INFO Version 6 (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A.) and the conventional 5% level of significance was used throughout.
