Culture and treatments of primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells Human bronchial tissues were purchased from the commercial source (National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia, PA) as described before [16, 17] . No tissues from patients diagnosed with lung-related diseases were used. All those lungs were either autopsy leftovers or were rejected for transplant. They were sent to us with arbitrary numerical code. No identity link to the actual patient can be identified. Protease-dissociated HBE cells were plated on TranswellH chambers (Corning) and were maintained in immersed culture conditions until they reached confluence when they were transferred to an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture condition [16, 17] . At air-liquid interface, the cells were maintained in a Ham's F12/DMEM (1:1) with the addition of transferrin (5 mg/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), cholera toxin (10 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 mM), bovine hypothalamus extract (15 mg/ml), BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and all-transretinoic acid (30 nM). Cells were maintained at ALI for 7 days and were placed in basal media devoid of the additives, with the exception of retinoic acid, overnight prior to the experiments. Recombinant IFN c was purchased from R&D Systems and synthetic double stranded (ds) RNA (i.e. poly I:C) from EMD Biosciences. IFN c was used at 50 ng/ml and poly I:C at 25 mg/ ml. A neutralizing antibody to IFNAR was obtained from US Biologics and used at 2.5 mg/ml [18] . Both IkB kinase and JAK inhibitors were purchased from EMD Biosciences and used at 5 mM. For influenza infection, cells were infected with the influenza virus strain MEM at 1200 HAU.
