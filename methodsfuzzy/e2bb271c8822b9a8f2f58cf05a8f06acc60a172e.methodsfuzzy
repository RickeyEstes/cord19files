Substantial progress has been made on modelling the stochastic dynamics of early generations of transmission after a novel pathogen is introduced to a population, yet major challenges remain. Particular challenges arise from heterogeneities (typically uncharacterized) in host contact patterns, host susceptibility and infectiousness, environmental factors, and possibly pathogen phenotypes. Which of these matter for a given outbreak, and how can this be determined? Further challenges arise from host population structure at scales from households to cities, and the resulting possibility that local pools of susceptibles will be depleted. These effects are often neglected for emerging pathogens, with the rationale that many hosts are available, but this assumption fails easily (Cross et al., 2007) . Non-stationary dynamics are also challenging: any changes through time arising from control measures or behaviour change will be entangled with non-stationarities driven by contact network effects (whereby the most connected individuals are infected early) or superspreading effects (whereby transmission rates revert to the mean after outbreaks are kicked off by superspreaders). These factors combine to shape the dynamics of early transmission chains, and the resulting data form the basis for inference about outbreaks of emerging infections. Outbreaks are often small, so data are commonly pooled from multiple introduction events at different times and locations, introducing further heterogeneities. Such 'mixed distributions' have been used to estimate reproductive numbers for post-elimination measles, for instance, though it is recognized that the largest outbreaks occur in populations with unusually low vaccination rates, where different parameters would apply (King et al., 2004) . Furthermore, imperfect observation causes cases and outbreaks to be missing from data sets, likely in non-random ways. We need models that can account for these problems, and ideally correct for them, to enable robust inference of parameters of interest. A particular set of challenges arises for subcritical pathogens, whose epidemiology is characterized by a mix of spillover events and self-limited chains of human-to-human transmission (socalled 'stuttering chains'). An essential and pervasive challenge is to disentangle contributions from these two sources. There has been recent progress in methods to estimate R 0 based on the distribution of chain lengths (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a) or ratio of primary to non-primary cases (assuming these can be distinguished) (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . These approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, so hybrid or alternative approaches would be valuable. Also, little attention has been paid to the joint characterization of temporal variation in spillover hazard and human-to-human transmissibility. In some scenarios it may be possible to extract the contribution of subcritical human-to-human transmission, leaving a robust description of the spillover hazard itself -or conversely to extract the contribution of spillover and see the human-to-human transmission more clearly (Kucharski et al., 2014) .
