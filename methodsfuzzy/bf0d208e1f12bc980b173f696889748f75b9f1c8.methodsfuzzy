Cells. Representative vertebrate cell lines (Df-1 and MDCK) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (pH 7.4). Cultures were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Insect SF9 cells were maintained and propagated in SF-900II serum-free medium at 27°C. Virus infection, titration, and transduction. Infection of Sf9 cells with baculovirus, and titration of baculovirus were performed as previously described [16] . Transduction of tested cell lines was carried out according to an optimized protocol [17, 18] . Influenza virus was amplified from eggs as previously described [19] . Constructs. For the generation of the recombinant baculovirus vector, vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA, AcMNPV polyhedrin promoter-controlled VSV G expression cassette and WSSV ie1 promoter-controlled HA expression cassette was inserted into the shuttle vector pFastBac1 and integrated into the baculovirus genome within DH10BACä through site-specific transposition according to the protocol of Bac-To-Bac system (Invitrogen). VSV G cDNA with b-globin terminator was PCR amplified from pVSV-G (Clontech) with a primer set of 5 0 -CGCGGATCCATGAAGTGCCTT TTGTACTTAGC-3 0 and 5 0 -CCCAAGCTTCCAACACACTATTGCAA TGAA-3 0 . VSV G cDNA was placed downstream of the polyhedrin promoter, which was PCR amplified from bacmid genome with a primer set of 5 0 -TCCCCCGGGGGATGGTTGGCTACGTATACTCCG-3 0 and 5 0 -CGCGGATCCGGTT TCGGACCGAGATCCGC-3 0 . The HA cDNA was amplified from genome of H5N1 virus (A/Goose/Guangdong/3/97/ H5N1) through RT-PCR with a primer set of 5 0 -ATAAGAATGCG GCCGCTATGGAGAAAACAGTGCTTCTTCTTG-3 0 and 5 0 -CCGCT CGAGCGGTTAAATGCAAATTCTGCATTGTAACGATC-3 0 . HA cDNA was then placed upstream of the SV40 terminator in pFastBac1 vector and downstream of ie1 promoter, which was amplified from WSSV genome with a primer set of 5 0 -TCCCTACGTATCAATTTTATG TGGCTAATGGAGA-3 0 and 5 0 -ACGCGTCGACCTTGAGTGGAGA GAGAGCTAGTTATAA-3 0 . The original polyhedrin promoter sequence in pFastBac1 was deleted with SnaBI and SalI digestion before insertion of the two expression cassettes (Fig. 1A) . Western blot analysis. Gel preparation, running, transferring proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotting were performed according to standard protocols. Quantified protein samples or Sf9 cellular extract of about 1 · 10 6 cells were subjected to 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in this study.
