Synthetic S gene and plasmid constructions. The cDNA of the SARS-CoV (strain BJ01, GenBank Accession No. AY278488) was a gift from Dr. Li Ruan (China CDC, Beijing). The SARS-CoV S gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5 0 -CGGGATCCA ACGAACATGTTTATTTTCTTATTATTTC-3 0 and 5 0 -CGGAATT CGTTTATGTGTAATGTAATTTGACACCC-3 0 . The fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) vector to generate the plasmid pS. In order to create a codon optimized S gene, 60 overlapping primers were synthesized and assembled by overlapping PCR. Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan) was used in all PCRs. In the first forward primer, tissue plasminogen activator (Tpa) signal sequence (MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSA) was introduced to replace the original signal peptide of the S gene (MFIFLLFLTLTSG). The chimeric wild-type S with Tpa was named TS, the synthetic S gene with Tpa was named TSh. Sequences were determined by sequencing and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 (+) vector to generate pTS and pTSh. Cell lines. 293T cells were used as packaging cell lines for preparing the pseudotyped virus. Huh7 was a gift from Dr. Stanley M. Lemon (The University of Texas Medical Branch, USA). Human cell lines (Bel7402, T84, Colo320, SW480, SPC-A1, A549, Glc-82, and Hep-2), a monkey cell line (Vero E6), and a mouse cell line (CHO) were obtained from Wuhan Institute of Virology (Wuhan, China). To establish the ACE or ACE2 expressing cell lines, the cDNA of human ACE (gift from Dr. Pierre Corvol) or ACE2 was transduced into NIH/3T3 or HeLa cells by retroviral vector pMX, and the expression of ACE or ACE2 was detected by FACS using anti-ACE or anti-ACE2 polyclonal antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis). FACS analysis of S protein expression. S expression constructs were transfected into 293T by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and incubated with the sera for 1 h. These cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma, St. Louis) for 30 min. After 3 washes, the cells were subjected to analysis using a Moflo cytometer (DAKO Cytomation, Denmark). Western blot. Viral pellets and lysates of the transfected 293T cells were then subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, which was followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham-Pharmacia, Germany) and incubated with sera (1:200 dilution) from rabbits immunized with the N-terminal domain (14-670) of the S protein; and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California) was used as the secondary antibody. Pseudotyped virus infection assays. The SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus HIV/SARS was produced by a similar method which was described previously [8] . Briefly, 10 lg pNL4.3.Luc. R À E À pro À [13] and 10 lg pTSh were co-transfected into 293T cells in 10 cm dishes. Supernatants were harvested 48 h later and used in infection assays. The pseudotyped virus was purified by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 50,000g for 90 min, resuspended in 100 ll PBS, and normalized by p24 ELISA using a Vironostika HIV-1 Antigen Mic-roELISA Kit (Biomerieux bv, Boxtel, The Netherlands). The supernatant containing 5 ng pseudotyped virus (p24) was used to infect cells in 24-well plates (4-8 · 10 4 cells/well). The cells were lysed at 48 h postinfection. Twenty microliters of lysate was tested for luciferase activity by the addition of 50 ll of luciferase substrate and measured for 10 s in a Wallac Multilabel 1450 Counter (Perkin-Elmer, Singapore). For neutralization tests, diluted SARS patientÕs sera were mixed with equal volumes of pseudotyped virus supernatants. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, 100 ll mixtures were added to Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates. The cells were lysed at 48 h post-infection and tested for luciferase activity as described above. Cell fusion assay. COS-7 cells were transduced with S gene (TS or TSh) by retroviral vector pBabe-puro and selected in culture medium containing 5 lg/ml puromycin for one week. The puromycin resistant cells were checked for S protein expression and named TS-COS and TSh-COS, respectively. These cells were mixed with Vero E6 cells at a ratio of 1:1 and co-cultured for 8 h, and the syncytium was examined under microscope. RT-PCR. The total RNA of target cells was isolated with a Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). The expression of ACE2 was analyzed with the following primers: forward 5 0 -GCACTCAC GATTGTTGGGACT-3 0 ; reverse 5 0 -ATTAGCCACTCGCACATCC TC-3 0 . The expression of mouse ACE2 was analyzed with the following primers: forward 5 0 -GCATTGACAATTGTTGGAACA-3 0 ; reverse 5 0 -ATCACTCACTCGTACATCTTC-3 0 . The expression of human ACE was analyzed with the following primers: Treatment with NH 4 Cl. Huh7 cells in 24-well plates were pretreated for 1 h with serum-free DMEM containing NH 4 Cl at various concentrations (0-30 mM), at 37°C. HIV/SARS, HIV/AMLV or HIV/ VSV-G pseudoviruses were added onto Huh7 cells in the presence of NH 4 Cl at various concentrations. After 12 h incubation, the supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The luciferase activity was determined at 48 h post-infection as described above.
