Clinical features, post-transplant outcome, and side effects were collected through retrospective chart review. Last follow-up was updated in February 2018. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. Patient and disease characteristics were reported using descriptive statistics (count and percentage). The time to event was calculated from the date of transplant to the date of event or last date of patients known to be alive. The main outcome variables of interest included overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS and RFS. The cumulative incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were calculated accounting for death and relapse as competing risks. The incidence rate of acute GVHD was estimated at day +100 and chronic GVHD at day +180. NRM was estimated using the cumulative incidence method accounting for relapse as a competing risk (Fine-and-Gray analysis). Survival rates were calculated 6 months and 1 year after hap-loHSCT. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), and EZR [6] . Table 1 shows baseline patient characteristics. Table 2 shows donor characteristics, graft parameters, and GVHD characteristics. Median follow-up for survivors was 168 days (range, 22 to 536 days), or 5 months (range, 0 to 17 months). Nearly 80% of donor-recipient pairs were mismatched at 5 HLA loci. Sixteen patients and donors were CMV mismatched. While cryopreserved grafts were used in the majority, 10 patients received fresh product. The hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index score was 3 in almost 40% cases.
