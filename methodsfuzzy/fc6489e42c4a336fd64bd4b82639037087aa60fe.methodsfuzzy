Virus isolation. Nasal swabs or lung tissues were collected from cattle exhibiting respiratory disease and submitted to Newport Laboratories for diagnostic investigations during the late winter and spring of 2013. Samples originated from Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana, Texas, Nebraska, and Tennessee and originated from animals of different ages. Virus isolation was performed on both ST and HRT-18G cells. Virus growth was determined by cytopathic effects, in addition to rRT-PCR and hemagglutination assays, using turkey red blood cells. rRT-PCR was performed as previously described (8) . Genome sequencing and analysis. Viral RNA was isolated using a MagMAX viral RNA isolation kit. Full-genome amplification was performed as previously described except that the primers were modified to match the noncoding regions of C/OK: 3= end, 5= ACGCGTGATCGCAT AAGCAG 3,= and 5= end, 5= ACGCGTGATCAGCAGTAGCAAG 3= (18) . Amplicons were used for library preparation using the NEBNext Fast DNA library prep set for Ion Torrent. Libraries were sequenced using an Ion Torrent personal genome machine with the manufacturer's reagents and protocols. Contigs were assembled using C/OK (accession numbers NC_922305 to NC_922311) and C/Ann Arbor/1/50 (accession numbers NC_006306 to NC_006312) as the templates and utilizing the SeqMan NGen module from DNAStar. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Mega 5.1 software using maximum likelihood analysis with 500 bootstrap replicates to verify tree topology. The terminal segment sequences of C/660, C/628, and C/729 were determined using an RNA sequencing kit (Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2) by following the manufacturer's instructions with viral RNA as described above. Next-generation sequencing of the viral transcriptome. Swine testicle cells were infected with swine C/OK at an MOI of 0.1. Total cellular RNA was isolated from mock-infected cells (0 h) and infected cells at 18 h and 36 h postinfection, respectively, with TRIZOL followed by RNA purification with ethanol. RNA quality was tested using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and then processed for cDNA library construction by using a cDNA library prep kit (catalog number FC-122-1001; Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. cDNA library construction and all other procedures were conducted in Genomics Core Research Facility (GCRF) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Briefly, mRNAs were purified from the total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads followed by fragmentation. The resultant mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs that were subjected to an end repair process followed by ligation to the adapters. After separation in agarose gel through electrophoresis, cDNA fragments with a size of about 200 bp were excised, extracted, and amplified by PCR using two primers that match the ends of adaptors. PCR-enriched samples were then sequenced by an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) sequencer in the GCRF at UNL. An infection experiment consisting of three time points (0, 18 h, and 36 h) was duplicated, and derived RNA samples were sequenced in deep RNA sequencing analysis. Three samples representative of three time points from each experiment were combined and loaded into one lane for sequencing. Each of the 6 samples submitted had approximately 9 million 100-nucleotide single-end reads, and the sequencing results passed quality control. Bioinformatic analysis of the NGS data set. Reads from each duplicate were merged and mapped to C/OK reference genomes using the GSNAP program (41) . The resulting SAM files were converted to BAM files, and read coverage at each position of the C/OK genome segments was calculated using SAMtools (42) . Sequencing reads were normalized according to total number of reads to viral and pig genomes obtained at each time point. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) was used for visualization and mapping quality assurance (43) . Reads mapped to C/OK genome segments with splicing were further analyzed with bash scripts. The accession numbers for the SRA database of NCBI are as follows: SRX471882 for the two repeats of 0 h, SRX471884 for 18 h, and SRX471846 for 36 h following infection. Cell culture and in vitro reassortment. ST and human rectal tumor (HRT-18G) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Influenza C/Taylor/1233/ 1947 (C/Tay) virus was provided by BEI Resources, while C/Johannesburg/1/66 (C/JHB) virus was a gift from P. Palese (Mt. Sinai Medical School, New York). For routine cultivation, cell medium was replaced by DMEM and virus was inoculated with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Nonhuman ICV were cultivated at 33°C or 37°C, while human ICV were cultivated at 33°C. For in vitro reassortment, all viruses were propagated at 33°C in ST cells and titrated to determine 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter (TCID 50 /ml). A single well of a 6-well plate with a monolayer of ST cells was coinfected with viruses as shown in Table 1 with an MOI of 0.1. Viruses were adsorbed for 1 h, and then the monolayer was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with DMEM. After 3 days, cell culture supernatants were serially diluted and plated onto a monolayer of ST cells with an agar overlay, and after an additional 1 to 3 days, individual plaques were picked and expanded on ST cells. Ten plaques were expanded for each reassortment experiment, and a single plaque was chosen from cultures of parental viruses. A second reassortment experiment was performed under conditions designed to optimize reassortment between C/JHB and C/OK. Cells were coinfected with both C/JHB and C/OK with either an MOI of 1.0:0.1, 1.0:1.0, or 10.0:1.0, as described above. After 3 days, cell culture supernatants were serially diluted and plated onto a monolayer of ST cells with an agar overlay, and after an additional 1 to 3 days, individual plaques were picked and expanded on ST cells. Twenty plaques were expanded for each reassortment experiment. In vitro growth kinetics were determined on ST cells for C/JHB and C/OK with the MOIs used in the second reassortment experiment. Cell inoculation was performed as described above using the same viral stocks used in the reassortment experiments. Samples were collected at 24, 60, and 72 h postinfection and analyzed by titration on ST cells. Serology. Bovine sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme overnight at 37°C and then heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were run with 0.5% packed turkey red blood cells as described in the WHO's Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance (36) . Bovine sera were a gift from the SD State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and represented samples from five states (South Dakota, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and California) submitted for unrelated diagnostic testing. All influenza A, B, and C reference virus antigens and antisera were obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources). AGID antigens for swine C/OK virus, bovine influenza C-like virus, human influenza virus C/JHB, and human influenza virus C/Taylor were prepared according to the protocol of WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Supernatants from uninfected cell cultures (MDCK and HRT-18G) were prepared as mock controls using the same procedures as those used for production of viral antigens. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against swine C/OK virus was prepared using purified C/OK virus antigens. AGID plates were prepared according to the standard procedure, and assays were performed in triplicate according to WHO/OIE protocol (36) . Similar concentrations of viral antigens for all tested strains (approximately 12 log 2 HA units per 0.025 ml) were used in parallel with mock controls for antigen recognition by antisera in AGID with two different dilutions (neat and 1:2). Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Genome sequences were entered into GenBank under accession numbers KF425652 to KF425658 (C/628), KF425659 to KF425665 (C/660), and KF425666 to KF425672 (C/729).
