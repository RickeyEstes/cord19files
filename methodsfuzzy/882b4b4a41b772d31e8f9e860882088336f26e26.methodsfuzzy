Serially diluted inactivated SARS-CoV isolate in transport medium was extracted by both the column-based manual method and the MagNA Pure LC instrument using the modified large volume protocol with external lysis. The SARS-CoV concentrations from both series of viral RNA extracts were compared using the Passing-Bablok regression method [9] . The Passing-Bablok procedure is a linear regression method developed for method comparison evaluations without dependence on the assignment of either one of the two compared methods as the reference. Furthermore, it makes no assumption on the distribution of sample data and measurement errors of the compared methods. The Passing-Bablok comparison of the SARS-CoV concentrations in transport medium as extracted by the two methods is presented in Figure 1A . The quantitative relationship can be described by y = -207.0 + 0.305x (95% confidence intervals for the slope, 0.260 to 0.407; and y-intercept, -661.7 to 128.6). The slope of the regression line being less than 1 suggests there is a proportional negative bias in SARS-CoV concentration extracted by the automated method when compared with the manual method. A similar comparison was performed for serially diluted SARS-CoV mixture in pooled sera. Figure 1B illustrates the Passing-Bablok comparison. The quantitative relationship can be described by y = -62.4 + 0.304x (95% confidence intervals for the slope, 0.252 to 0.442; and y-intercept, -205.6 to 380.4). The slope of the regression line being less than 1 also suggests the presence of a proportional negative bias in serum SARS-CoV concentration extracted by the automated method when compared with the manual method. The effect of the automated and manual methods on the overall assay sensitivity was next compared. Results for this part of the study are summarized in Table 1 . SARS-CoV RNA was detectable from all ten replicates when the serum aliquots containing 10 3 copies/mL SARS-CoV were extracted by either methods. For serum containing 10 2 copies/mL SARS-CoV, nine and seven of the replicates were tested positive when viral RNA was extracted by the manual and automated methods, respectively. For serum containing 10 copies/mL SARS-CoV, four of the replicates were positive when extracted by the manual method and only one was positive when the replicates were extracted by the automated method. To assess the effects of the two extraction protocols on the precision or reproducibility of the quantitative SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay, RNA extractions by each protocol were repeated 10 times for serum aliquots containing SARS-CoV concentration well above the detection limit of the assay, namely 10 3 and 10 5 copies/mL. Results for this part of the study are summarized in Table 1 . For serum SARS-CoV concentration at 10 3 copies/mL, the overall assay coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean Ã— 100%) was 45.3% and 76.9% when RNA extractions from the manual and automated methods were quantified, respectively. For serum SARS-CoV concentration at 10 5 copies/mL, the assay coefficient of variation was 47.4% for the manual RNA extraction and 51.0% when automated RNA extraction was used.
