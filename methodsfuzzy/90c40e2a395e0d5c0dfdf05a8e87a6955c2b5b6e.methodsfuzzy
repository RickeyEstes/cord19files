We searched PubMed and national databases for Indian medical journals (www.medind.nic.in) for 'Kumbh', 'Kumbh Mela', 'Hindu pilgrimage', 'Hindu fair', 'Indian pilgrimage', 'Indian fair', 'religious gathering', and 'Hindu mass gathering' obtaining peerreviewed articles on the Mela. We obtained grey literature on the history of Mela and its organization using Google search for the same terms. The search was limited to the first three pages of the results. Any news article, reports or government websites containing relevant information about the Kumbh Mela were used as information sources.
