According to the operation requirements of "Regulation for cleaning and disinfection technique of flexible endoscope WS 507-2016", every endoscope should be strictly reprocessed in accordance with the procedures of "precleaning, leak testing, washing, rinsing, disinfection, terminal rinsing, and drying". In order to avoid the deviation of the detection results due to the difference in the amount of bacteria contaminated between different endoscopes, two approaches were used in this experiment. One was to perform the biopsy channel sampling, the entire channel sampling, and disc brush sampling continuously on the same gastrointestinal endoscope in the same day for further testing, which was called as continuous sampling; the other was to perform biopsy channel sampling, entire channel sampling, and disc brush sampling on the same endoscope for three days respectively for further testing, which was called as intermittent sampling. e entire operating procedure followed the principle of aseptic technique. A peristaltic pump was used and an injection needle was repeatedly injected for 2-3 times for full amount collection. (1) Biopsy channel sampling group (Group A): the endoscopes a er reprocessed were sampled as below: 50 ml of the neutralizer was extracted with a sterile syringe, injected, and flushed the instrument channel through the biopsy port of the control section, and the total volume of elution was collected from the distal end of the endoscope. e eluate was thoroughly mixed and sent to the laboratory of Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 2 hours for culturing and colony counting (CFU/piece) ( Figure 1 ). (2) Entire channel sampling group (Group B): the endoscopes a er reprocessed were sampled as below: 50 ml of the neutralizer was extracted with a sterile syringe. A sterile film was placed onto the air/water port, suction, and instrument port of the endoscopic control section. Installed the sterile endoscope specialized washing joint to seal the air/water injection port, suction port; and instrument port of the endoscope control section. e neutralizer was injected and flushed through the endoscope channel from the suction port beside the endoscope light guiding connector, through the suction and biopsy channel and then the total volume of elution was collected from the distal end of the endoscope. e eluate was thoroughly mixed and sent to the laboratory of Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 2 hours for culturing and colony counting (CFU/piece) ( Figure 2 ). (3) Disc brush sampling group (Group C): the endoscopes a er reprocessed were sampled as the procedure below: a blunt head of a sterile disposable disc brush was inserted into the instrument port, and the instrument channel was brushed until the brush end completely exited the instrument channel outlet of the distal end. e upper part of the brush was cut off (2 cm) using sterile scissors, then the clipped brush was put into a sterile bottle for testing. 50 ml of neutralizer was extracted with a sterile syringe and injected into the instrument port, then the total volume of elution was collected from the distal end of the endoscope into the same bottle used for the testing of the clipped brush. e eluate was thoroughly mixed with the brush inside the sterile bottle and sent to the laboratory of Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 2 hours for culturing and colony counting (CFU/piece) (Figure 3 ). e data was analyzed using SPSS 20.0. e statistical methods used are chi-square test for counting data and independent sample Kruskal-Walis test for measurement data.
