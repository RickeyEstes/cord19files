2.1. Bacterial strains E. coli SHS-8 strain isolated from chickens with SHS was used as a source of VT2y [21] . E. coli strain K12C600 was used as a negative control and strain J2 (O157 :H-VT2) was used as a source of VT2 (kindly donated by Yoshifumi Takeda, Japan) in these experiments. All E. coli strains were stored at 320Â³C in Luria^Bertani (LB) [14] broth to which 15% glycerol was added.
