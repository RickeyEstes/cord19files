Wallinga and Teunis [20] (denoted WT method hereafter) proposed a method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number by making use of the epidemic curve, N = {N 1 ,…, N T }, where N t is the number of cases at time point t, and an estimate of the serial interval, p 1 ,…, p k , where p i describes the probability of a serial interval of length i and the maximum serial interval length is k. We review this method in Appendix 1. The estimator they obtain for the effective reproductive number for individual j on day t' is where n s denotes the number with symptom onset on day s and q s,t denotes the relative probability that case s was infected by case t. Wallinga and Teunis (20) (denoted WT method hereafter) proposed a method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number by making use of the epidemic curve, N = {N 1 ,…, N T }, where N t is the number of cases at time point t, and an estimate of the serial interval, p 1 ,…, p k , where p i describes the probability of a serial interval of length i and the maximum serial interval length is k. For ease of presentation, we assume that the time step is a day. Individuals are placed in a network temporally by symptom onset date and the probability of transmission occurring between two individuals in the network is determined by the serial interval. The calculation of R t occurs in three steps. In what follows, we let t i denote the i th individual with symptom onset on day t, where i = 1,…,N t . 1. For the i th individual with symptom onset on day t, calculate the probabilities of infection by all those with symptom onset on prior days t 2 (t2 < t.) These probabilities equal the serial interval probability for the distance in time between the potential infector, t j 2 , and infectee, t i , P (t j ' →t i ) = p t i −t 0 j .
