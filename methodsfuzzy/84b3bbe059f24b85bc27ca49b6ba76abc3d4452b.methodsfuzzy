Plasmids and recombinant baculoviruses. The DNA sequences coding the S, E, and M proteins of SARS CoV were obtained from the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (GenBank Accession No. AY291451). The coding sequences for the three structural proteins were cloned into a modified transfer plasmid derived from pBacPAK8 (Clontech), under the control of a strong viral promoter, polyhedrin promoter. This transfer plasmid also contains a red fluorescent reporter gene, DsRed2 (Clontech), driven by a heat-shock promoter. To generate recombinant baculoviruses using Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) viral genome, the individual plasmids containing S, E, and M proteins were co-transfected with linearized viral DNA (BaculoGold, BD Biosciences) by using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) into insect cells, successful recombinants were isolated by the indication of red fluorescence. The recombinant baculoviruses encoding the S, E, and M proteins, assigned as vABhRpS, vABhRpE, and vABhRpM, respectively, were obtained by two-or three-round serial dilutions, and all viral stocks were prepared and manipulated according to the standard protocol described by O'Reilly et al. [17] . Insect cell culture. The Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) insect cell line was cultured as a monolayer in TNM-FH insect medium, containing 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum as described previously [18] . It was used for the propagation and infection of recombinant baculoviruses; titers of viruses were determined by a newly developed quantitative real-time PCR-based method [19] . Isolation of coronavirus-like particles. Insect cells were co-infected with vABhRpE and vABhRpM at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1:5. At 4 days post-infection (dpi), cells were collected by a cell scraper (Costar) and then re-suspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), containing a cocktail of protease inhibitor (1:1000 dilution, SET III, Calbiochem), and lysed by sonication. The post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min, and was then placed on a 30% (w/w) sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 34,000 rpm for 20 h. Pellets were washed twice with TBS and resuspended in the same buffer, and then subjected to a 20-60% (w/w) sucrose gradient at 34,000 rpm for 60 h. Thirty fractions, monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm, were extracted from the centrifuged sucrose gradient using a density gradient fractionation system (ISCO). The fraction containing VLPs was subsequently examined by Western blot analysis and by electron microscope as described below. Western blot analysis. Each fraction of sucrose gradient was analyzed by an 8% and 14% of SDS-PAGE, respectively; the separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilin-P, Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h and then probed (at a dilution of 1:5000) by antiserum at 4Â°C overnight. The antiserum used to probe S protein was developed by immunizing rabbits with the amino acid fragment 510-1195 of spike protein (a gift from Dr. Pei-Jer Chen, Graduate School of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University), whereas those used to probe E protein were raised by immunizing rabbits with synthetic oligopeptides (LVKPTVYV YSRVKNL, C-terminal of E protein, Genesis Biotech). After three washes with 0.1% Tween 20 containing phosphate-buffered saline (TPBS), a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was added at a dilution ratio of 1:2500, incubating at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed with TPBS four times, followed by visualization using chemiluminescent reagent (Western Lightning, Perkin-Elmer) and developed on an X-ray film (BioMax, Kodak). Characterization of VLPs by electron microscope. Ultra-structure of cells co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses was collected, fixed, and then visualized by electron microscopy as described in our previous studies [20] . To visualize purified VLPs using transmission electron microscopy with negative staining, an aliquot of 10 ll of the VLP preparation was loaded onto a carbon-coated grid, letting standstill for 5 min. Grids were then stained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 1 min; after excess PTA was drained and the grid was examined directly under electron microscope (EM). For immunogold labeling, VLPs were loaded onto a collodion-coated EM grid for 5 min. After the removal of excess of sample solution by gently blotting with a filter paper at the edge of the grid, an antibody specific against S protein (developed by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 19-35 of S protein; IMG-541, Imgenex) was added onto the grid and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Grids then underwent 10 s wash six times in Sorensen's phosphate buffer at room temperature and were incubated with 12 nm gold conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. After six 10 s washes in Sorensen's phosphate buffer, the samples were stained with 2% PTA for 1 min, then drained, and examined under the EM.
