Technically, the PERCH integrated analysis is what Wu et al have called a nested partial latent class model, which acknowledges a case's or control's observations as error-prone measurements of their unobserved lung infection status [8, 9] . The "latent class" is the unknown etiology of the cases, and it is "partially" latent in a case-control analysis because the control's lung status is known (no infection). The detection of a pathogen in a control specimen indicates a false-positive result for case etiology attribution, therefore providing direct specificity estimates for that test result. A nested partial latent class model assumes that the pathogen infecting a case's lung is present and detected in each specimen with a given sensitivity of the test measurement. Nesting refers to extra latent subclasses within an etiologic class to account for situations where results of some measurements are not independent due to various biological or laboratory factors, such as poor specimen collection resulting in negative results for all pathogens measured. To estimate the etiologic fraction for each organism, the PERCH integrated analysis incorporates the etiology and sensitivity priors with the likelihood of the observed data through a numerical integration process (Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] [11] ) to obtain probability distributions of the etiology that comprise the main output from the model (ie, "posterior" distributions). The posterior is the prior distribution updated by the evidence measured by the study. We created a simulated population where the "true" etiology of the cases was known for a simple scenario in which only 4 pathogens (A, B, C, and D) plus a "None of the Above Pathogens" category (NoA) are responsible for pneumonia. The true fractions of disease caused by each pathogen were 30%, 30%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, and 10% for NoA. We simulated test results for 600 cases and 600 controls given the known etiology for each case and used random sampling to apply the sensitivity and specificity values for each pathogen A-D ( Figure 3A ). We created varying combinations of sensitivity and specificity for each pathogen (test sensitivity was 100% for pathogens A and B and 75% for pathogens C and D; test specificity was 85% for pathogens A and C and 50% for B and D). We created 500 simulated random datasets and performed attributable fraction and PERCH integrated analysis on each, as if a clinical study was conducted 500 times. The true etiology fractions were specified to mimic a plausible scenario for a pneumonia etiology study in which 12 pathogens plus an NoA category (ie, pathogens not tested for) are responsible for pneumonia ( Figure 4B ). The NP/OP PCR data had imperfect sensitivity and specificity (ie, bronze standard), and blood culture data had perfect specificity but imperfect sensitivity (ie, silver standard). Pathogens varied by the type of data available in that some had both bronze-and silver-standard data (eg, bacteria); some had bronze-standard data only (eg, viruses); some had silver-standard data only (eg, bacterial pathogens found on blood culture that were not tested for in the NP/ OP); and 1 had both bronze-and silver-standard data, but the bronze-standard data was uninformative (eg, bacterial pathogen with NP/OP PCR OR = 1.0 because it was commonly carried in all children). True NP/OP PCR sensitivity was 75% for all pathogens, but specificity varied by pathogen. True blood culture sensitivity was 15% for all pathogens. Simulated datasets containing 600 cases and 600 controls were created by random sampling from "populations" with the case and control pathogen prevalences produced based on the true etiology proportions and sensitivity and specificity values. We created 500 simulated datasets, and the PERCH integrated analysis was performed on each.
