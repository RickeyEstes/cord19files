A large number of immunostains are available that can be helpful in the identification of microorganisms (Table 2 .4). 13 Many of these are commercially available and currently enjoy wide popularity in diagnostic pathology laboratories. Others are available reliably only at highly specialized centers, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new immunohistochemical techniques can be a worthwhile but labor-intensive task. Because there is wide cross-reactivity among fungal species and among bacteria, it is critical to establish the potential cross-reactivity of any new antibody and its relative specificity. 14 Nevertheless, it may at times be possible to limit the use of a reagent to a narrow range of differential diagnostic possibilities (e.g., to distinguish Aspergillus spp. from Pseudallescheria boydii infection).
