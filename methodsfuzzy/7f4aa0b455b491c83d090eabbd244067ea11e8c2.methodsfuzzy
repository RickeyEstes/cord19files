An analysis of published articles on syndromic surveillance was undertaken in published English-language literature to examine the evolution of syndromic surveillance. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched using the term ''syndromic surveillance'' for English language studies published prior to February 2012. After removing duplicates and non-English language articles, 415 records were obtained. Citations were downloaded into Endnote X4. Reference lists were then hand searched to obtain further relevant additional published articles and a total of 769 articles were thus included in the study. To identify trends in the publication of syndromic surveillance articles, PubMed was searched for all articles with the term Ôsyndromic surveil-lanceÕ in the title or abstract, as published in Pub-Med prior to 20 February, 2012; 214 articles were obtained and were downloaded into Endnote X4. This database was then searched to identify publication year for each article and the number of articles published each year. The database was further searched using the terms ÔbioterrorismÕ and Ôinflu-enzaÕ to identify articles published each year on these topics. Keywords assigned to these articles were extracted for the periods [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] , and 2009-2011, based on visual changes in the data, and these were imported into NVivo 9. Each of these time-periods was queried and a tag cloud created. Tag clouds represent by size the frequency of a particular word in a document, or in this case the frequency of keywords used in syndromic surveillance publications. The tag cloud used a Word search for the 100 most frequent words with the following characteristics: a minimum length of six characters; matching set to include stemmed words; and used the following Stop words -epidemiology, methods, statistics, and numerical -to reduce visual confusion in the tag cloud results.
