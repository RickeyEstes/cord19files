The thermopile array (Chino Corp., Tokyo, Japan) comprises 48 Â 47 = 2256 pixels with multiple thermopile detectors. Because human skin emits infrared light at a wavelength range of 2-20 mm, we set the measurement wavelength at approximately 10 mm. The thermopile array was calibrated at a range of 20-40 8C and a Objective: Infrared thermography systems have been used for fever screening at many airports since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. However, many of these systems are expensive and non-portable. Therefore, we developed a cost-effective and compact (2.9 Â 5.8 Â 2.0 cm) thermopile array for fever screening of patients with infectious diseases in the clinical setting. Methods: The array was created with small pixels (48 Â 47 = 2256 pixels) fabricated on a silicon wafer using microelectromechanical systems technology. We tested this array on 155 febrile and afebrile patients (35.4 8C axillary temperature 39.3 8C) with seasonal influenza at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. Results: The maximum facial temperature, measured by the array at 0.3 m from the subject, exhibited a positive correlation with axillary temperature measured using a contact-type thermometer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the thermopile array in identifying the febrile subjects were 80.5% and 93.3%, respectively, setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature at an appropriate value. Conclusions: Our cost-effective thermopile array appears promising for future close-range fever screening of patients with infectious diseases at primary care doctor clinics, health care centers, and quarantine stations in developing and developed countries. (Figure 1a ). The present study was carried out at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. The 155 inpatients (aged 25 AE 6 years; 35.4 8C axillary temperature 39.3 8C) were diagnosed with seasonal (2012-2014) influenza based on several symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat, as well as the result obtained using a rapid test kit (Quidel Corp., USA). All patients were prescribed an antivirus medication (oseltamivir or zanamivir), and some patients had a normal body temperature. The thermopile array was placed 0.3 m from the face of each participant. Because the facial temperature is much higher than the surrounding ambient temperature, the maximum facial temperature (around the inner corner of the eye) can be derived from a two-dimensional thermal facial image by simple image processing (Figure 1b) . Subjects who wore eyeglasses removed them before the facial temperature measurements. The thermal image data were obtained at 6-Hz intervals. Thermal image acquisition and image processing were performed using LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). We set the ambient temperature to 22.2-23.8 8C and the relative humidity to 36-40% to ensure reproducible environmental conditions. To obtain measurements for cross-referencing, we measured the axillary temperature using a contact-type clinical thermometer (MC-107BW; Omron, Japan). We compared the maximum facial temperature obtained by the thermopile array with the axillary temperature measured using the contact-type thermometer. Moreover, we also evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the thermopile array in identifying the febrile subjects.
