Three of us (M.I., A.M., and M.N.) retrospectively evaluated the first 87 consecutive ankles with syndesmosis injury in 87 patients (49 males [56.32%] and 38 females [43.68%]), with a mean age of 35.2 (range 17 to 67) years in whom the described SB technique was used. These patients were treated from January 2010 to January 2014. All the patients were followed up radiologically for a minimum of 18 months after surgery and clinically for 2 years postoperatively. Of the 87 patients, 2 (2.30%) died in the first year after surgery; 1 (1.15) within the first 6 months of severe acute respiratory syndrome attributed to multiple injuries, and 1 of other irrelevant medical comorbidities. Neither death was related to the ankle fixation, and both ankles were stable in situ at the time of death. Another 13 patients (15 total [17.24%]) either withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up, leaving 72 patients (82.76%) for the final analysis. These 72 patients (42 right ankle [58.33%] and 30 left ankle [41.67%]) were successfully evaluated for 24 months. The study was performed at our trauma tertiary center, which serves a population of >5 million people. The present study was a 3-surgeon (A.M., M.N., and M.I.), single-center study, and the same technique was used in all recruited patients. The local institutional review board approved our study protocol. All patients had syndesmotic diastasis injuries evidenced by a tibiofibular clear space of >6.0 mm on the anteroposterior or mortise radiographs, a medial clear space greater than the superior clear space or 5.0 mm on the anteroposterior radiographs, and/or tibiofibular overlap of <6.0 mm on the anteroposterior radiograph or <1.0 mm on the mortise radiograph (8) .
