This study was conducted using a previously described protocol, ASTM E1053. [16] [17] [18] Two lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite were tested against human coronavirus strain 229E (ATCC VR-740) at the contact time of 10 minutes, based on the label claims of a common household bleach. 15 This test was repeated using the same lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite mixed with 2 lots of the color additive. Carriers of dried human coronavirus 229E film were sprayed with the test substance and left undisturbed for 10 minutes ± 5 seconds, then neutralized and filtered. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the resultant filtrate were then prepared and applied in quadruplicate to multi-well plates containing normal lung fibroblast cell monolayers. After incubation, each well was examined for cytopathic effects indicating infectious virus. The Spearman-Karber method was used to quantify the amount of infectious virus recovered. A suspension efficacy test was performed using a previously described protocol, ASTM E2315. [19] [20] [21] Calcium hypochlorite was tested against V. cholerae (ATCC 39050) with a 0.2% concentration based on World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cholera guidelines and a contact time of 3 minutes, based on the standard practices of a nongovernmental organization that field-tested the color additive during the 2017 Haiti outbreak. [22] [23] [24] The suspension test method is commonly used for efficacy testing against pathogens like V. cholerae that cannot survive the drying phase of standard hard surface tests. 25 For study NG8285, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite was prepared by dissolving 68% Calcium Hypochlorite Granular (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in AOAC hard water immediately before efficacy testing. This test was repeated using the same lot of 0.2% calcium hypochlorite combined with color additive. For study NG9676, both test substances were prepared and allowed to rest at room temperature for 4 hours before testing to determine if the color additive affected antimicrobial efficacy of 0.2% calcium hypochlorite over time. Ten mL of test substance was inoculated with 0.5 mL of V. cholerae culture for 3 minutes, neutralized, then plated and enumerated for colony-forming units (CFU) to determine log reduction after exposure. This study was conducted using a previously established protocol, ASTM E1153. [26] [27] [28] [29] In study NG8156, 0.5% NaDCC was tested against both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 15442) with a contact time of 5 minutes, based on the label claims of an existing 0.5% chlo- rine NaDCC disinfectant. 30 This test was repeated using the same lot of 0.5% NaDCC with the addition of color additive. 0.5% NaDCC was prepared by dissolving OASIS NaDCC Granules (Hydrachem, West Sussex, United Kingdom) in sterile AOAC hard water. In study NG8698, 4 test substances were prepared (0.5% sodium hypochlorite and 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, both with and without color additive) and allowed to rest at room temperature for 4 hours. Then, efficacy testing against P. aeruginosa was conducted with a contact time of 5 minutes to determine if prolonged exposure to the color additive interfered with the ability of these chlorine solutions to meet the ASTM E1153 passing criteria of >3 log10 reduction. Similarly, in study NG9375, 0.5% NaDCC solutions with and without color additive were prepared, allowed to rest at room temperature for 4 hours, then tested against P. aeruginosa with a contact time of 5 minutes. Test carriers inoculated with dried pathogen were sprayed with the test substance, neutralized, then plated and enumerated to determine log reduction after exposure. AOAC Method 961.02, or the AOAC Germicidal Spray Test, is a standard test protocol specified by the EPA for antimicrobial pesticide registration. This protocol, followed for studies GLP1540 and GLP1550, was conducted in agreement with EPA guideline OCSPP 810.2200 and GLP requirements, as defined in 40 CFR § 160. 12 A daily culture of S. aureus was prepared from frozen stock culture, and test cultures were initiated in 20x150-mm tubes containing 10 mL AOAC Synthetic Broth. After a 48-hour incubation at 36°C ± 1°C, all test culture tubes were pooled together with the addition of 5% ± 0.1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) as organic bioburden. Carriers were prepared by placing autoclaved 18x36-mm glass slides into sterile petri dishes matted with sterile 9-cm filter rounds. Each carrier was inoculated by evenly spreading 10 μL of pooled test culture onto the glass slide and drying for 30-40 minutes at 36°C ± 1°C. Two sets of 3 inoculated carriers were selected for enumeration of the amount of S. aureus present on the carriers, with 1 set harvested before and after the test. Sixty inoculated carriers were treated with 3 sprays of the test substance (0.5% sodium hypochlorite with or without color additive) on mist setting at a distance of 6-8 inches and an angle of 45°a nd left undisturbed for a contact time of 10 minutes ± 5 seconds. The treated carriers were then individually transferred into 25x150mm test tubes containing Letheen Broth supplemented with 0.1% sodium thiosulfate and 0.5% Tween 80, to both neutralize the test substance and allow any surviving S. aureus to grow. After a 48hour incubation at 36°C ± 1°C, the 60 test tubes were assessed for growth. Any tubes showing growth were confirmed to not be a result of contamination by plating on growth media and testing for S. aureus. Three lots of each test substance were tested, with 60 carriers for each lot test. All of the EPA-specified criteria for experimental success were met in these studies. The set of carriers from each lot that were enumerated for S. aureus before and after the test all demonstrated the required mean log10 density of between 5.0 and 6.5. Additional details around the control criteria that were met for this study to proceed (media sterility control, viability growth control, and neutralization control) may be found in the cited study protocols. 13, 14 ASTM Method E1053 ASTM E1053, or Standard Test Method for Efficacy of Virucidal Agents Intended for Inanimate Environmental Surfaces, is the primary testing method accepted by the EPA for virucidal claims. This protocol, followed for studies GLP1536 and GLP1538, was conducted in agreement with EPA guideline OCSPP 810.2200 and GLP requirements, as defined in 40 CFR § 158. 16 Stock aliquots of human coronavirus 229E were thawed on the day of use, and viral inoculum was prepared by combining the viral suspension to a 5% protein organic soil load composed of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), bovine serum albumin, bovine mucin, and yeast extract. Carriers were prepared by autoclaving 100x15mm glass petri dishes. Then, 200 μL of viral inoculum was spread evenly inside the bottom surfaces of the carriers using a sterile cell scraper, then left to dry for 20 minutes under ambient conditions. Three carriers were prepared: 1 as a plate recovery control to determine the baseline dried virus titer and 1 for each of the 2 lots of test substance to determine levels of infectious virus after exposure to the test substance. One dried virus test film carrier for each lot of test substance was treated with 3 sprays of the test substance (0.5% sodium hypochlorite with or without color additive) on mist setting at a distance of 6-8 inches and an angle of 45°and left undisturbed for 10 minutes ± 5 seconds. The treated carriers were then neutralized with 2 mL of 0.1% lecithin in 10% FBS Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium. The virus films were then mechanically detached from the carriers using sterile cell scrapers and filtered through preequilibrated Sephacryl (S-1000 SF) gel filtration columns for secondary neutralization. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the filtrate were then prepared from 10 −1 to 10 −6 , and each dilution was applied in quadruplicate to multi-well cell culture plates containing monolayers of normal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells (ATCC CCL-171). Assay plates were incubated at 37°C ± 2°C, 5% ± 1% CO2, for 7 days, and then each well was examined under a microscope for cytopathic effects, indicating presence of infectious virus. The Spearman-Karber method was used to quantify the amount of infectious virus recovered at the end of the assays. The virus stock titer, cell culture, cytotoxicity, and test substance neutralization controls were all assayed concurrently with the plate recovery control and virus-substance exposure tests and met all criteria necessary to validate this study, additional details of which may be found in the cited study protocols. 17, 18 ASTM Method E2315 ASTM E2315, or Assessment of Antimicrobial Activity Using a Time-Kill Procedure, is used to quantify the log reduction of a test microorganism after exposure in an antimicrobial suspension. 19 The suspension test method is commonly used for efficacy testing against pathogens like V. cholerae that cannot survive the drying phase of standard hard surface tests. 25 A culture of V. cholerae was prepared in tryptic soy broth medium as the inoculum. Ten mL of the test substance and 10 mL of the control substance (PBS) were dispensed into separate sterile tubes. Both the test and control substances were then inoculated with 500 μL of V. cholerae in growth medium and mixed. One mL of the inoculated control substance was immediately harvested to determine the starting concentration of the microorganism. After the contact time of 3 minutes ± 5 seconds, 1 mL of the inoculated test substance was harvested and chemically neutralized with 9 mL of Dey/Engley broth supplemented with 0.5% sodium thiosulfate, 0.5% lecithin, and 0.5% Tween 80. The neutralized test solution was plated on tryptic soy agar for 48 hours at 36°C ± 1°C, then enumerated to determine the number of CFUs. The surviving microbial population from the test substance exposure was compared to the population recovered from the control to determine the log reduction. The appropriate controls (positive/growth, negative/purity, neutralization, and media sterility) were performed and confirmed to validate these studies, additional details of which may be found in the cited study protocols. 20, 21 ASTM Method E1153 ASTM E1153, or Efficacy of Sanitizers Recommended for Inanimate Non-Food Contact Surfaces, is a test method typically performed to substantiate sanitizer claims for registered disinfectants. This protocol was followed for studies NG8156, NG8698, and NG9375. [27] [28] [29] Cultures of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were initiated from stock in tubes containing 10 mL of tryptic soy broth and AOAC synthetic broth, respectively. After a 24-hour incubation at 37°C ± 2°C, a 4-mm transfer loop was used to transfer the culture into 10 mL of fresh broth. Three consecutive daily transfers were made, with the final transfer of S. aureus incubated for 24 hours and the final transfer of P. aeruginosa incubated for 48 hours. Carriers were prepared by placing autoclaved 18x36-mm glass slides into sterile petri dishes. Each carrier was then inoculated with 10 μL of the culture, then dried for 30 minutes ± 2 minutes at 36°C ± 1°C. Test carriers were then treated with approximately 5 mL of the test substance by spraying 6 times from a distance of 6-8 inches at a 45°angle. Control carriers were treated with 5 mL of PBS. After a contact time of 5 minutes ± 5 seconds in ambient conditions, all carriers were chemically neutralized with 20 mL of Dey/Engley broth supplemented with 0.5% sodium thiosulfate and 0.5% Tween 80. Using standard pour-plate techniques, the neutralized substances were plated on nutrient agar and incubated for 48 hours at 36°C ± 1°C. The surviving microbial populations (CFU) on the test plates were compared to the controls to determine log reduction. The appropriate controls (positive/growth, negative/purity, neutralization, and media sterility) were performed and confirmed to validate these studies, additional details of which may be found in the cited study protocols. [26] [27] [28] [29] Direct primary skin irritation test Toxikon Corporation performed direct primary skin irritation studies in accordance with FDA-recognized test methods established by the ISO. The studies were based on standard protocols ISO 10993-10, ISO 10993-12, and ISO/IEC 17025 and conducted in agreement with GLP requirements, as defined in 21 CFR § 58. 31, 32 Three 2-4 kg New Zealand white rabbits were purchased from Covance Laboratories (Denver, Pennsylvania) for each test substance, for a total of 18 rabbits. The rabbits were maintained at 20°C ± 3°C under 30%-70% humidity, fed ad libitum, and acclimatized for a minimum of 5 days before treatment. The trunk of each rabbit was clipped free of hair within 24 hours before application of the test substance. Four application sites were designated, with 2 sites for the test substance and 2 sites for untreated control. 0.5 mL of the test substance was then applied directly to the 2 test sites, which were then covered with non-occlusive dressing and wrapped with a semi-occlusive bandage. The control sites were left untreated and wrapped in the same manner as the test sites. After a 4-hour contact period, the dressings were removed, the application sites were marked, and any residual test substance was rinsed off with sterile water. The rabbits were observed for signs of erythema and edema at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the dressings were removed. Signs of erythema and edema were both scored from 0 to 4 according to the ISO 10993-10 scoring system for skin reaction. 31 The observation values for each animal were obtained by adding the erythema and edema scores at the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour time points and dividing the sum by 6 (2 test sites x 3 observation time points). The same was done for the control sites of each animal. The control scores were then subtracted from the test site scores. To obtain the final PII score of a test substance, the calculated values of the 3 animals were totaled and divided by 3.
