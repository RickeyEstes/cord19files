The expression and purification of SARS 3CL proteinase. The C-terminal His-tagged 3CL proteinase was expressed and purified as described previously [18] . The non-His-tagged 3CL proteinase was expressed and purified as reported [17] . The R4E, K5A, and M6A mutants of SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase were prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pET 3CLP-21h [17] as a template. The N-terminal deletion mutant, D7N, was constructed by inserting the PCR product which carried the NheI/HindIII site fragment with a deletion of the 6 codons coding for Gly-2 to Phe-7 into the NheI/HindIII-digested pET 21a DNA. The mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The purification method used for each mutant was the same as that used for the wild-type proteinase and their purity was verified by SDS-PAGE to be greater than 95%. Peptide synthesis. The octapeptide inhibitor N8 and its mutants were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tert-butyl chemistry. Cleavage of the peptide from Rink resin and removal of all sidechain-protecting groups were achieved in trifluoroacetic acid solution. The crude peptide was purified by reversedphase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Elite P200II, Dalian, China) on a Zorbax C18 semi-preparative column (9.4 by 250 mm, Agilent) using water/acetonitrile gradients containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of all peptides was measured by analytical RP-HPLC, and the identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Colorimetric enzyme assay. The enzyme activity was measured by a colorimetric assay as reported before [17] . In short, 20 ll pNA substrate stock solution (2 mM Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA water solution) was added to 180 ll 37°C preheated reaction buffer (40 mM PBS, 1 mM EDTA, and 3 mM DTT, pH 7.3), which contained 2.8 lM enzyme. Colorimetric measurements of enzymatic activity were performed in 96-well microtiter plates using a multiwell ultraviolet spectrometer (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Device) at 390 nm. Each assay was repeated three times. Peptide cleavage assay. The proteolytic activity of the His-tagged SARS 3CL proteinase was determined using an HPLC-based peptide cleavage assay as previously reported [18] . The peptide substrates S01: NH 2 -TSAVLQSGFRK-CONH 2 and S12: NH 2 -SAVLQSGF-CONH 2 were synthesized as described previously [18] . Zhang et al. [27] have established the Zhang-Poorman plot to distinguish dimerization inhibitors from competitive inhibitors. The three major hypotheses in their model were: (i) the bioactive dimeric enzyme was in equilibrium with the inactive monomeric enzyme; (ii) the inhibitor only bound with the enzyme monomer; (iii) the substrate concentration in peptide cleavage assay was very low compared with K m of the dimeric enzyme. For the Zhang-Poorman plot, peptide S12 was used as substrate. Cleavage reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature and contained 400 lM substrate S12, 8.12-43.32 lM His-tagged SARS 3CL proteinase, no inhibitor or 800 lM peptide N8, and 57 lM DTT in 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, at room temperature. Reaction was stopped after 5 or 10 min by adding 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution and analyzed as described previously. The inhibitor peptide was dissolved in DMSO and premixed with the His-tagged proteinase for 1-2 h. Cleavage reaction mixture (400 lM substrate S01, 2.43 lM His-tagged SARS 3CL proteinase, 800 lM inhibitor peptide, and 57 lM DTT in 10% DMSO, 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3) was incubated at room temperature. Aliquots of reactions were removed every 20 min within 80 min and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid aqueous solution, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. k cat /K m was determined by plotting the substrate peak area using the equation below: where PA is the peak area of the substrate peptide, c E is the total concentration of His-tagged 3CL proteinase, and C is an experimental constant. The inhibitory activities of the peptides were estimated using the same dimerization inhibitor model as in the Zhang-Poorman plot [27] . The dimerization inhibition constant K i was thus calculated using the following equation: where (k cat /K m ) app.0 is the apparent k cat /K m without inhibitor and [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were conducted on a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. An An60Ti rotor and standard six-sector equilibrium centerpieces were used. The freshly prepared wild-type and mutational SARS 3CL proteinase was further purified and buffer-exchanged using a gel filtration column, Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Bioscience), into sedimentation buffer (40 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.3). The molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (1.04 mg/cm 2 ), density of the sedimentation buffer (1.005 g/ml), partial specific volume (0.723 ml/g), and molecular weight of the monomer (33 914 Da) were calculated based on its amino acid composition using the program SEDNTERP (http:// www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html). For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 ll samples (concentrations between 0.1 and 4 mg/ml) and 400 ll reference solutions were loaded into cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20°C and rotor speeds of 60,000 rpm. Absorbance scans at 230, 280 or 290 nm were collected at a time interval of 4 min. Data were analyzed with the software Sedfit version 8.9 g [28, 29] . For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 110 ll samples and 120 ll reference solutions were loaded into nitrogen-flushed cells, followed by degassing and a further nitrogen flush prior to sealing. The protein was equilibrated for data collection at 20°C and three rotor speeds (15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm). Once equilibrium was reached (typically 24-32 h), absorption data were collected at 280 nm, using a radial step size of 0.001 cm, and recorded as the average of 10 measurements at each radial position. To determine the baseline values in the cell, at the end of the data collection time the rotor speed was increased to 42,000 rpm for 8 h, and the absorbance of the depleted meniscus was measured. Dissociation constants were determined by fitting a monomer-dimer equilibrium model using the Origin-based data analysis software for Beckman XL-A/XL-I (Beckman Instruments, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Data from different concentrations and speeds were combined for global fitting.
