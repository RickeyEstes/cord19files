performed after fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, using a monoclonal Cell culture, virus, and antibodies. DBT cells, a murine astrocyantibody against the N protein [19] and a rhodamine-conjugated toma cell line [14] , were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research, West (MEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated 7.5% newborn calf se-Grove, PA). Images of 512 1 512 pixels were recorded with a confocal rum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and tryptose phoslaser scanning microscope and printed as described above. The perphate broth. In this study, MHV strain JHM-DL, propagated in DBT centage of stained cells was calculated essentially as described under cells under serum-free conditions, was used [15] . MEM and Joklikstatistical analysis. modified MEM were obtained from GIBCO Life Technologies (Gaith-Virus inhibition studies. DBT cells were grown in 60-mm plates ersburg, MD). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the S and nucleocapto 80% confluence, washed with MEM, and incubated with various sid (N) protein of JHM have been described earlier [16] . inhibitors at the desired concentration for 2 h at 37ЊC. Subsequently, Calcium measurements and imaging. To determine intracellular cells were washed with MEM, and virus mixed with inhibitors (in calcium, 10 4 cells/well were plated in eight-well coverglass tissue 500 ml total volume) was added to the cells at a m.o.i. of 0.05 to 1 culture chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) 24 h before measureand incubated at 37ЊC for 2 h. The cells were washed again with ments. Cells were loaded with 2 mM fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes, MEM and incubated with MEM containing 1% newborn calf serum Eugene, OR) in serum-free MEM at room temperature for 20 min, and the inhibitors for an additional 7 h at 37ЊC. The supernatant and fluorescence measurements of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2/ ] i ) was harvested at 9 h postinfection and used for plaque assay on DBT were performed within 2 h after dye loading. Chambers were cells to determine virus titers. The concentrations of the inhibitors mounted on the microscope stage of an inverted confocal laser scanused were predetermined to be free of cytotoxicity. ning microscope (LSM410; Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an external argon-krypton laser. Time series of images of whole microscopic fields were taken and stored for further analysis. In each experiment,
