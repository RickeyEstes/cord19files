The faeces of five 35 day-old male pigs were pooled and subjected to purification of virus particles using the optimized protocol. By deep sequencing of the extracted nucleic acid, 69,613 reads with an average sequence length of 250 nucleotides were generated. After trimming of the sequence ends and exclusion of reads shorter than 50 nucleotides, 66,129 reads were included in the analyses. From these reads, 1,482 contigs could be assembled with a length between 100 bp and 1998 bp. The primary sequencing data are summarized in Table 3 . As a quality control of the method, the sequence reads were analysed for the presence of nucleotide sequences originating from the added bacteriophages T4, M13 and MS2. Sequences of all three phages could be identified. In detail, 175 reads originated Figure 1 . Optimization of the purification protocol using qRT-PCR detection of bacteriophages used as process control. The amplification curves determined by qRT-PCR for the phages T4 (blue), M13 (red) and MS2 (green) were determined before and after centrifugation for 17,0006 g for 5 hours. The shift between the curves, which corresponds to the degree of virus loss, is indicated by arrows coloured according to the bacteriophage type. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034631.g001 from MS2, 137 reads from M13 and 29 reads from T4 (Tab. 1), thus correlating with the numbers of the bacteriophage genomes detected by qRT-PCR in the final preparation. These reads were excluded from the following data analysis.
