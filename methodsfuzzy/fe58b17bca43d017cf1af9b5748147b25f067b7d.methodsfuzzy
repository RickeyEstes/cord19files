QTL Mapping: Testing for significance of marker-trait association. Let pB ijk be the mean frequency of the B-allele across both duplicate arrays of the i th marker in the j th pool of the k th tail. i = 1 − M, where M is the total number of markers analyzed; j = 1 − 5 for the GK pools, j = 1 − 2 for the NK pools; k = 1 − 2, where 1 = GK pools, and 2 = NK pools. We used a single-marker test for marker-trait association, where CWER P-value for the i th marker was calculated as P i = 2 x the area of the standard normal curve to the right of where, D i = pB i.1 − pB i.2 ; pB i.1 = mean pB ij1 across the 5 GK pools; pB i.2 = mean pB ij2 across the 2 NK pools. For SE(D i ) we used an empirical estimate of the standard erroof D i under the null hypothesis of absence of marker-QTL association. This estimate is based on the variance among individual replicate pools within the same tail [67] . The basic assumption is that under the null hypothesis, the sampling variance among individual pools across tails is the same as the sampling variance among individual pools within tails. On this assumption, it follows from elementary principles, that where, Var(pB i.1 ) = the variance among the pB ij1 of the 5 replicate pools in the GK tail; Var(pB i.2 ) = the variance among the pB ij2 of the 2 replicate pools in the NK tail. We expect Var(pB i.1 ) = (VarpB i.2 ) to be the same, hence denoted Var(pB i ). Then the best estimate of Var(pB i ) will be the mean of Var(pB i.1 ) and Var(pB i.2 ) weighted by the number of degrees of freedom in each variance. and Because the estimate of Var(pB i ) is based on a small number of pools, we used a global estimate of Var(pB i ), averaged across markers and denoted Var(pB), as our estimate of the sampling variance of pB i across pools. Because pB is a binomial variate, Var(pB) is a function of pB (1-pB) , which maximizes at pB = 0.5 and drops off to either side. Thus, each marker requires an appropriate SE 2 (D), depending on its frequency. Consequently, we binned the markers in bins of width 0.1 from 0.0 to 1.0, according to their average pB across all pools (Avg pB i ), and calculated average Var(pB) across the markers in each bin. Table 8 shows that indeed Var(pB) maximized in the range 0.4 to 0.6, dropping off to either side, thus justifying the use of Var(pB) according the marker mean pB. As a result, SE 2 D differed somewhat for the different markers, according to marker frequency in the pools. The proportion of false positives (PFP; [37] ) was used to correct for multiple tests. QTL regions (QTLRs): Declaration of a QTLR. While searching for regions containing QTLs (QTLRs), significance of a single marker may not be enough to declare a QTLR, as a singleton significant P, without any support from surrounding markers, is prone to be false positive. On the other hand, visual inspection of chromosomal scatter charts reveals clusters of significant marker -LogP values (e.g., Fig 1) . We interpret these clusters as putative QTLR. Note, however, that high -LogP values are interspersed with very low values across the cluster region. This behavior is related to complex LD patterns observed across small chromosomal regions [68] . Nevertheless, average -LogP value across a cluster region will be greater than in the adjoining regions lacking a concentration of high -LogP markers. Thus, to identify the clusters quantitatively, assign them an overall -LogP value, and determine their boundaries, we used a moving average of -LogP in 1 nucleotide steps taken across a window of markers. QTLRs were declared on the basis of windows having average -LogP above some chosen threshold. For the present study, average spacing between markers was 4,394 bp. Hence, windows of size 23 markers, equivalent to an average window size of 100 Kb were used. The size of a window was chosen to give a reasonable physical length yet not be overly influenced by the -LogP value of any single marker. A moving average of -LogP = 2, corresponding to P = 0.01, was set as the threshold value for declaration of a window as a QTLR. This threshold was set to give a reasonable number of ranked QTLR for further study in depth. The windows worked well, and clear peaks with monotonic shoulders were obtained. See Setting the boundaries of the QTLR. The popular LOD drop method [69] works well when applied to family-based linkage mapping and the low-density microsatellite maps of the previous generation of QTL mapping. In such studies, there is usually a monotonic inverse relation between marker significance and marker location relative to the most significant marker; with marker significance ascending monotonically marker by marker to the most significant marker and descending monotonically from that point. With GWAS and high-density marker maps, however, we are faced with the above-mentioned phenomenon where highly significant and non-significant markers are interspersed across the cluster. Consequently, there is no longer a monotonic relation between marker location and marker significance, making it impossible to apply the LOD drop method. That is, considering -LogP values of individual markers of the cluster, going out from the putative point location of the QTL (the most significant marker of the cluster), one will meet one or more non-significant markers, ostensibly setting a LOD drop boundary, but then just beyond these, are a new series of significant markers, clearly part of the same cluster and QTLR (e. g., Fig 2) . We found that the moving windows present a monotonic inverse relation of window location and window average -LogP values relative to the top window, forming a clear peak. This allowed the use of the LOD drop method for setting QTLR boundaries. For the present study, since we did not have LOD scores but -LogP, we used instead a -LogP drop of 1 (denoted "Log drop"). As noted above, for the cluster on BTA 29, the top window had average -LogP = 2.470. Accordingly, the Log drop 1 boundary of the QTLR were at -LogP = 1.470. The upstream and downstream windows with means closest to this value (-LogP = 1.470 and 1.492, respectively; Fig 2) were taken as the boundary windows. Since the windows are located by the average location of their markers, the actual boundaries of the QTLR were from the first marker of the upstream boundary window, to the final marker of the downstream boundary window. These markers were taken to define the final boundaries of the QTLR. Distinguishing adjoining clusters. When two clusters and consequent runs of windows above the threshold were close to each other, two top windows and two peaks are seen (Figs 3  and 4) . In this case, declaring the region as consisting of one or two QTLRs was based on the -LogP values of the region between the two top windows, relative to the lower of the Log drop 1 boundary thresholds of the two peaks. If the entire region between the peaks was above the higher Log drop 1 threshold, they were taken as one QTLR; otherwise, they were taken as two separate QTLRs. In the latter case, the exact boundary between the QTLRs was the window with lowest -LogP value.
