All chemical reagents were commercially available. Melting points are uncorrected. Ultraviolet (UV) spectra were recorded in methylene chloride or MeOH on a JASCO V-530 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Optical rotations were measured in chloroform, MeOH or DMF on a JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data were recorded on a Bruker AC 200, Varian Unity INOVA 400 spectrometer and Varian Unity AS 500 spectrometer, using CDCl 3 or CD 3 OD and chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) with reference to the respective residual solvent or deuterated peaks (d H 3.30 and d C 49.0 for CD 3 OD, d H 7.26 and d C 77.0 for CDCl 3 ). Coupling constants are reported in hertz. The abbreviations used are as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), q (quartet), qd (quartet of doublets), m (multiplet), dd (doublet of doublets), br s (broad singlet), or br d (broad doublet). All the reactions described below were performed under nitrogen or argon atmosphere and monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was performed on Merck precoated 60 F 254 plates. Column chromatography was performed using Silica Gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck). All anhydrous solvents were distilled over CaH 2 or Na/benzophenone prior to use. (7) A solution of 6 (10.56 g, 62.04 mmol) in EtOH (204 mL) was treated with sodium hydroxide (2.48 g, 62.04 mmol) in EtOH (204 mL). After stirring for 16 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was treated with sodium borohydride (11.74 g, 310.21 mmol) and refluxed for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, 2 N HCl (186 mL) was added slowly at 0°C. EtOH in the reaction mixture was evaporated off under reduced pressure and to the resulting solution was added 2 N HCI (408 mL). After being stirred for 18 h at room temperature, the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride several times. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using methylene chloride and MeOH (20:1) as the eluent to give lactone 7 (4.97 g, 62%) as a colorless oil: To a solution of 7 (4.70 g, 36.66 mmol) and imidazole (4.99 g, 73.31 mmol) in anhydrous methylene chloride (70 mL) was added tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride (9.38 mL, 36.66 mmol) dropwise at 0°C. After being stirred at room temperature for 2 h, the reaction mixture was extracted with methylene chloride. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexanes and ethyl acetate (7:1) as the eluent to give silyl ether 8 (11.35 g, 84%) as a white solid: mp 61. at À78°C, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at the same temperature. MeOH (42.06 mL), hexanes (84.12 mL) and ethyl acetate (84.12 mL) were added successively and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight, allowing it to reach room temperature. The generated gel was filtered off through a pad of Celite, and the filtrate collected was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexanes and ethyl acetate (4:1) as the eluent to give lactol 9 (13.67 g, 97%) as a colorless oil: To a stirred suspension of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (8.92 g, 24.96 mmol) in anhydrous THF (100 mL) was added potassium tert-butoxide (2.80 g, 24.96 mmol) at 0°C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to give a yellow suspension. The lactol 9 (4.60 g, 12.48 mmol) in anhydrous THF (30 mL) was added dropwise at 0°C, and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature. After being stirred for an additional 3 h, it was treated with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl solution (30 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexanes and ethyl acetate (3:1) as the eluent to give hydroxyl olefin 10 (4.03 g, 88%) as a colorless oil: 13
