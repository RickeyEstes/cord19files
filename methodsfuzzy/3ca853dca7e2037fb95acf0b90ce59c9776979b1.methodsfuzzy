The experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy (authorization no. 16/18). A total of 56 Limousine beef steers, approximately 6-10 months of age with an initial body weight of about 400 kg, were included in this study. They travelled for about 1600 km/28 h from an assembly point in France (Malonze, 23300 La Souterraine) to southern Italy (Gioia del Colle, Bari) in a gooseneck semitrailer with two mobile decks (first deck of 32.9 m 2 ; second deck 29.10 m 2 ) of the same transport company. Specifically, three different shipments, travelling on three different days one month apart from the other (February to April), transporting a consignment of about 30 animals each, were considered. More than half of the animals travelling in each shipment were included. Briefly, out of a total of 94 animals, in the first, second and third shipment (day1, day2, day3), 20/32, 15/29 and 21/33 animals were randomly tested, respectively. In France, before collection at the assembly point, animals were reared at pasture on different farms, located close to the assembly point. At the assembly point they were grouped respecting the original penning, were kept for less than 24 h, and then shipped to Italy. Before shipping, official veterinarians checked the health of the animals and those with clinical signs were not loaded. During the travel, steers received water and feed at regular intervals and no unloading stops were planned, in compliance with the EC Regulation 1/2005. Upon arrival, the animals included in the study were located separately (i.e., isolated in a different pen) to the other animals travelling together and the animals already reared at the arrival farm. During the study, the animals were fed with alfalfa barley silage mixed diets which were similar to the feed provided at the assembly point and during the journey. Prior to shipment (T0), and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/animal, one swab in each nasal cavity, were collected from the 56 selected steer using sterile transport swabs of 13 cm (Nuova Aptaca SRL, Canelli, AT, Italy). Contextually, at T1, four days after the first shipment arrived, two DNS/each were collected from two animals located in the arrival farm to evaluate the epidemiological status of the residential herd. T0 DNS were kept at 4 • C during the journey and at the arrival farm. After T1 collection, all DNS were stored on ice, transported to the laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari (Italy), and processed within 24 h. No antimicrobials or vaccines were administered prior to or during the study to any of the steers tested. Nucleic acids were extracted from each DNS using the commercial kit QIAamp ® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and were stored at −80 • C until tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Primers and TaqMan probe for qPCR assay were used as previously described [13] , in the same reaction conditions, including reaction mix component and thermal cycling (Supplementary Table S1 ). The tested pathogens were the following bacteria: Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis, and the following viral pathogens: BoHV-1, BAdV, BVDV, BCoV, BRSV and BPiV. Categorical dichotomous data regarding the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen detected in animals, considered as binary (positive/negative, 1/0), at different times (before and after journey, T0 and T1) and for different days (day1, day2 and day3) were described as counts and percentages. The relationship between the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen detected in animals as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable, defined as a dummy variable (positive/negative, 1/0), and the time (T0, T1) and day (day1, day2 and day3) as independent factors, were evaluated by univariate logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR), confidence interval 95% (CI 95%) and p-values were assessed. p values were calculated using Wald Test. Statistical analysis was carried out using GenStat ® Version 14 (VSN International, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Table 1 shows the number of positive animals in each truck at T0 and T1 for each pathogen tested. Neither BVDV nor BoHV-1 were detected, either at T0 or T1. There was an association between day and H. somni, and a higher prevalence was found in DNS collected from animals travelling in the third shipment (Day 3) (90%, 38/42) in comparison with the first (60%, 24/40) and second (60%, 18/30) days (OR = 6.3, 95% CI = 1.8-21.2, p = 0.006). There were no other changes in the prevalence of the other pathogens among days.
