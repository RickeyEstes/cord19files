The current diagnostic standard for viral infections is Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or molecular biology tests [19, 21, 36, 41] . Commonly used ELISA is a multi-stage procedure and is considered to be not efficient enough because of relatively low sensitivity as well as high rate of false positive results [19, 21, 36] . Moreover, it is difficult in use because of obligatory application of monoclonal antibodies, which are not available for some viral diseases [13] . Most of the currently used immunosorbent tests are able to detect a current disease just at the moment of specific antibody formation directed against the infective agent. However, a specific host immunity develops after several weeks or months from the origin of infection. The problem is known as the so-called "window period". In addition, some patients receive immunosuppressive therapy and the effective antibody generation may not occur [43, 44] . Alternatively, routinely used or even experimental diagnostic molecular tests allow for direct detection of the alien genetic material, without waiting for the immune response of the host. Furthermore, the advantage of molecular assays is their extremely high sensitivity: they are able to detect single viral copies and/or early viral transcripts immediately after the onset of infection [45, 46] . Unfortunately, due to very high costs, complicated procedures and necessity of employing highly skilled staff, they have been rarely performed. Aptamers seem to be an appropriate response to the problems described above. They present an attractive alternative to the currently used procedures, due to their high specificity, affinity of binding to any viral antigen and low cost production. The use of biosensors equipped with the aptamers or another research techniques using these molecules allows for detection of both: early (genetic material, viral proteins) and late (host own antibodies) infection markers [21, 23] . Furthermore, aptamers enable to distinguish between infected host cells and not infected ones and may be helpful to recognize active forms of the virus [39, 42] . ‫׳‬ Table 3 compares a few of the standard diagnostic techniques used in the detection of influenza, HBV and HIV. It should be noted once again that in many cases, the use of currently available diagnostic tools have a number of disadvantages, which could be easily avoided using aptamers [47] [48] [49] [50] . Moreover, the aptamer-based minimum threshold of detection is sometimes lower than in RT-PCR, as in case of influenza virus [36, 49] . On the other hand, when the detection threshold is similar, or even higher as compare to currently used techniques, aptamers ensure increased sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test [39] . Nevertheless, the time of diagnosis is also significant. As shown in Table 4 , the detection time of influenza virus using aptasensor-based technique is remarkable shorter than in other methods [19, [47] [48] [49] [50] .
