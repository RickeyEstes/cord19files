The binding of a large panel of MAbs to purified virus Cells and viruses was performed by RIA as previously (Correa et al., 1988; Sá nchez et al., 1990) using optimum amounts of virus Viruses were grown in swine testis (ST) cells (McClur-(0.5 mg of protein per well). kin and Norman, 1966). The virus strain PUR46-MAD-CC120 has been described (Sá nchez et al., 1992) . The RNA isolation Purdue virus strain PTV was previously named NEB72 (Sá nchez et al., 1992) ; however, due to sequence similar-Genomic RNA was extracted from partially purified virus as described previously (Mendez et al., 1996) . Briefly, ity to the PUR46 strain, its name was changed to PTV (Purdue-type virus). A ts mutant derived from PTV was ST cells from 10 roller bottles (500 cm 2 ) were infected with a m.o.i. of 5. Medium was harvested at 22 h.p.i. kindly provided by M. Welter (Ambico). This ts mutant was obtained after 5-fluorouridine mutagenesis using a Virions were partially purified as described above. The viral pellet was dissociated by resuspending in 500 ml previously described procedure (Robb et al., 1979) and three cycles of plaque purification. The ts mutant growth of TNE containing 2% SDS and digested with 50 ng of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at room was reduced ú10 3 -fold at the restrictive temperature (39Њ) and showed a reduced capacity for RNA synthesis. temperature. RNA was extracted twice with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 1C.C12 and 1D.E7, that are specific for the antigenic subsites RNA from TGEV-infected ST cells was obtained as described previously (McKittrick et al., 1993) . Briefly, ST Aa and Ab, respectively (Correa et al., 1988) , were used to select the neutralization escape mutant (double MAb-cells, grown in 8-cm 2 wells, were infected with TGEV at a m.o.i. of 5. At 22 h.p.i., the cells were resuspended resistant mutant, dmar) using the PTV-ts strain. The procedure used to obtain the dmar mutant was identical to in 400 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were incubated for 10 min on ice with 40 ml of 2 mM Vanadyl the one previously described (Correa et al., 1988; Geb- absence of neutralizing MAbs. A significant proportion of virions resulting from this infection should have only the spike protein encoded by one virus genome. The super-M9. The origin of the nucleotides in the recombinant natant was harvested at 12 h.p.i., and neutralization with viruses, in the positions indicated by these molecular MAbs 1C.C12 and 1D.E7 was performed to select recommarkers, were determined by sequencing RT-PCR-debinant viruses. Potential recombinants were plaque isorived cDNA fragments using the fmol DNA Sequencing lated at restrictive temperature in the presence of the two System (Promega). The primers used to sequence the neutralizing MAbs used in the selection. The surviving genetic markers M1-M9 are described in Table 1 . isolates were phenotypically characterized by calculating their neutralization and temperature inactivation indices. Virus tropism analysis In parallel, independent ST cell cultures were infected with each of the two parental viruses and the same re-Viral tropism was determined in NIH miniswine (Luncombinant selection procedure was attempted. ney et al., 1986; Sachs et al., 1976) or in piglets derived from crossing Belgium Landrace and Large White swine.
