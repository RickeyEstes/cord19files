Plasmid construction DNA sequences encoding the NS3 protease and NS2B from Dengue virus type 2 strain TSV01 (GenBank accession number AY037116) were optimized and synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). With designed primers, the optimized DNA by GenScript were used as templates for amplifying the DNA fragments encoding residues 14-185 of NS3pro and residues 48-100 of NS2B, which have the same starting and ending residues as the constructs used in the previous NMR study [10] , as well as the full-length NS2B over residues 1-130 including the N-and C-terminal transmembrane domains. Amplified DNA fragments for NS3 (14-185), NS2B (1-130) and were subsequently cloned into pET28a vector with N-terminal His-tag (Novagen) using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites, while fragments for NS2B (48-100) and NS2B (48-100; Î”77-84) with Thr77-Met84 replaced by three Gly residues were cloned into pGEX-4T1 vector with GST-tag (GE healthcare) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. DNA sequences of cloned constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing.
