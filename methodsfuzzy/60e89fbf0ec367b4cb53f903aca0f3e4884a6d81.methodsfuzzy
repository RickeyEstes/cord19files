A retrospective chart review was approved by the Human Research Protections Program at the University of California San Diego (HRP#180245) to evaluate the use of a cell-free plasma nextgeneration sequencing (CFPNGS) plasma test in the management of children with infections between June 1, 2017, and January 22, 2018. Inclusion criteria included previously healthy children with CAP or complicated CAP as defined by the IDSA/PIDS guidelines, for whom CFPNGS was ordered and who were discharged prior to February 28, 2018. CFPNGS was a restricted test, ordered by pediatric infectious diseases faculty through the electronic medical record. No prospective, standardized criteria delineated when to obtain CFPNGS; rather, it was at the discretion of the pediatric infectious disease faculty. Children with chronic or complex underlying medical disease were excluded (i.e., underlying oncologic, genetic, or chronic illnesses and/or use of immunomodulatory medications). Chart review was performed using the electronic medical record and incorporated into a REDCap database (Harris et al., 2009 ).
