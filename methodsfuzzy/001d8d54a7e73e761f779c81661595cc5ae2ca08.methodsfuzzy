Many forecasting and time series studies are based on the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model and on the methodology of Box and Jenkins (1976) . While the time series analysis based on the structural time series model of Harvey (1989) is somewhat less used in economics, sociology, crime, and other fields, we believe that the structural time series analyses carried out in Section 4 are especially appropriate when various non-stationary features need to be treated. We will not embark on a complete and detailed discussion of both approaches to time series modelling. For such an endeavour we refer to the discussions in Harvey (1989) , Commandeur and Koopman (2007) and Durbin and Koopman (2012) . Among others, Harvey (1996) has argued strongly how a structural time series analysis can be adopted effectively in an intervention analysis. We have confirmed in our study that a structural time series analysis can indeed be effective in capturing non-stationary features such as trends and seasonal effects simultaneously in a unified manner. In addition, we have shown that an effective intervention analysis can also be accomplished in a multivariate structural For the purpose of intervention analysis, many approaches have been developed on the basis of time series methodologies that are different from structural time series analysis. An early reference is Box and Tiao (1975) where a thorough approach is developed for intervention analysis in the context of stationary ARMA modelling. The more recent developments in detecting and testing for breaks in time series (in mean, regression coefficients, variance) have been initiated by Andrews (1993) and Zivot and Andrews (1992) . The key developments for identifying multiple structural breaks have been initiated by Perron (2003,1998) and Caporale and Grier (2005a) for non-trending data, and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) , Lee and Strazicich (2003) , and Narayan and Popp (2013) for trending data. 11 These different econometric approaches for the detection of structural breaks have been adopted and illustrated in various empirical studies. For example, Nelson (2000) adopts the Box-Tiao intervention analysis methodology to establish the impact of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Miguel and Kremer (2008) assess whether two events, the 9-21 Earthquake in 1999 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, had a temporary or long-term impact on the inbound tourism demand from Japan. Harvey and Fernandes (1989) and Atkinson et al. (1997) examine the number of outliers and breaks in a monthly time series of number of purse (handbag) snatches in Hyde Park in Chicago. The latter analyses are based on structural time series models. Caporale and Grier (2005a) verify the influence of political dummy variables while controlling for different inflation regimes, using the Bai-Perron methodology. Similarly interesting studies that assess the impact of breaks due to political and associated social and economic events are presented in Caporale and Grier (2005b) , concerned with detecting breaks in real interest rates, Smyth and Narayan (2006) , estimating both the number and location of structural breaks in concurring and dissenting opinions on the U.S. Supreme Court, and Chen and Wang (2014) , investigating the impact of political events on monetary policy.
