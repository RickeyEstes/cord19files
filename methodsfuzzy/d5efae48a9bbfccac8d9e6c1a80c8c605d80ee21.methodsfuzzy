Plasmid DNA. Plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 , including Addgene or NIH AIDS Reagent Program code numbers (where applicable), where full plasmid sequences can be obtained. A pcDNA3.1 based vector bearing codon-optimized pNL4-3 env with a cytoplasmic tail truncation after residue 710 (HXB2 residue 712), similar to that previously described (42), was generated using standard cloning techniques and is available from Addgene.
