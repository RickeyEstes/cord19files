A commercial CFD program, Airpak, was used to simulate the indoor airflow field and contaminant dispersion. Airpak is customised from a general-purpose program, Fluent, for indoor environment simulations [46] . Airpak has been widely used and validated in indoor airflow and contaminant dispersion studies, as reported by Xu [47] . An indoor zero-equation turbulence model was used to simulate the indoor turbulent flow [48] . An ideal gas law model was used to account for temperature-dependent density effects, and a surfaceto-surface radiation model was used to calculate radiative heat transfers [46] . For simplicity and illustration purpose, each contaminated ATD was modelled as a contaminant source, rather than a supply air inlet, in CFD simulations. After the test of mesh independence, the office room was divided into 121,038 hexahedral control volumes. The momentum equations were solved on nonuniform staggered grids using a SIMPLE algorithm [49] . A secondorder upwind scheme and linear under-relaxation iteration was used in the solution process. In the presented identification method, Component II identifies the emission rate of each potential contaminant source by solving a linear programming model (Eq. (6)). Linear programming was first presented by Dantzig in 1947 to refer to the optimization problems in which both the objective function and the constraints are linear [50, 51] . After decades of development, linear programming has become mature and widely used. The most popular algorithm in linear programming is called the simplex algorithm [51] . In this study, the simplex algorithm provided by Matlab optimization toolbox 2.3 was used to solve the linear programming model.
