Two real time RT-PCRs using SYBR Green I were developed, one specific for MPV and one specific for a house keeping gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate deshydrogenase (GAPDH)) which was used as an endogenous non target control. Both PCRs were validated according to the Association Fran√ßaise de Normalisation (AFNOR) NF U47-600 norm. RNA transcripts were produced in vitro for the validation of the RT-PCR. Reference AMPV strains were used for the validation of the complete method.
