siRNAs were synthesized by Sirna Therapeutics (Boulder, Colo) using standard synthesis techniques. 23 Duplexed siRNAs were prepared by mixing the complementary strands in equimolar concentrations in buffer containing 10 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mmol/L potassium acetate, and 2 mmol/L magnesium acetate. The sequence of the IL-13 siRNA used in vivo is shown in Fig 1, A. Two chemically modified control siRNAs were also used in these studies. An siRNA targeting hepatitis B virus was used as a control for in vitro studies (sense strand 59 iB GcAcuucGcuucAccucuGTTiB, antisense strand 59 CAGAGGuGAAGcGAAGuGcTT, modifications defined as in Fig 1, A) . A control siRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein was used for in vivo studies (sense strand 59 iB AGAAcGGcAucAAGGuGAATTiB, antisense strand 59 UUCAccuuGAuGccGuucuTT).
