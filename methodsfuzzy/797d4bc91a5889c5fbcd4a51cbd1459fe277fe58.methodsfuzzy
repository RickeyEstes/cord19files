Twenty-four 3-to 4-month-old immunocompetent C57BL/6 (H-2 b) and C3H (H-2 k) mice were untreated or inoculated intracranially (i.c.) with 30 Ixl of: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Armstrong CA 1371 clone 53B of LCMV (Dutko and Oldstone, 1983) in medium or LCMV inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and heating. Total body irradiation (900 rads) from a cobalt source given just before i.c. inoculations was used to suppress CTL responses in eight C57BL/6 mice. Each experimental paradigm was tested on groups of 3-4 mice. Typical signs of acute LCMV infection developed in non-irradiated mice inoculated with live virus after 5-6 days whereas none of the other mice showed signs of illness. All mice were killed 6-7 days after the acute i.c. inoculations together with three age-matched C57BL/6 mice persistently infected with LCMV by i.c. inoculation at birth (Oldstone et al., 1986) . Serial cryostat-cut sections of snap-frozen brains (10 txm) were air-dried at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min and stored at 4°C overnight. Subsequent incubations and washes were carried out at RT in 2% fetal bovine serum/1 × PBS (pH 7.3). After 30 rain of incubation in buffer alone sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) B22-249. R1 directed against D b (Lemke et al., 1979 ) (dilution 1 : 50) or mouse mAb 1-1.3 specific for LCMV nucleoprotein (Buchmeier et al., 1981) (dilution 1:100). This was followed by a 1 h incubation with peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG2a secondary antibodies (Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at a 1:200 dilution. Sections were developed with HzOz/diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 10-15 min and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin.
