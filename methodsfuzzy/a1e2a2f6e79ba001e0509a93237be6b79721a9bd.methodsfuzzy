Three kinds of SARS CoV strains: HKU39849(1), TW-1 and FFM-1(2) and their cDNAs were used. S, M, N or E cDNA was transferred into pcDNA 3.1(+) vector and pcDNA 3.1(+)/vs-His Topo (QIAGEN K K, Tokyo, Japan). These genes were expressed in eukaryotic cells and Escherichia coli. pcDNA 3.1(+) vector, 50 g each, containing SARS S, M, N, or E DNA was injected i.m. (M.tibia anterior) into C57BL/6 mice (female, 8 weeks CLEA Japan Inc, Japan) and BALB/c mice (female, 8 weeks) three times, at an interval of 7 days. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV in the serum from the mice immunized with SARS S, M, N or -E DNA vaccines were assayed by use of Vero-E6 cell. CTL activity against SARS CoV was studied using human type II alveolar epithelial cells, T7, expressing SARS antigens [6] . PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor ␥-chain disrupted NOD SCID mice [IL-2R(−/−) NOD-SCID], and SCID-PBL/hu mice were constructed [4] . SARS DNA vaccines at 50 g were injected i.m. into the SCID-PBL/hu mice. CTL activity of human CD8-positive lymphocytes in the spleen from SCID-PBL/hu was assessed using IFN-␥ production and 51Cr-release assay [4, 5] .
