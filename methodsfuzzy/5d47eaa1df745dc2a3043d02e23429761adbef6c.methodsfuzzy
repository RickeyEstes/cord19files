The evaluation of patients with suspected pneumonia begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination. Chest radiography confirms the presence of pulmonary inflammation, although in some instances infiltrates may be scant or missing because of dehydration, neutropenia, or a retrocardiac location?, 4, 38 Chest radiography is rarely pathognomonic for a specific cause of pneumonia. Routine laboratory studies (complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry, urinalysis, pulse oxymetry) are not helpful in establishing a specific etiology of CAP, but can assist in stratifying patients according to the severity of their pneumonias and need for hospitali~ation.~~, 15, 38 The usefulness of diagnostic testing in pneumonia remains in question. Guidelines from both the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) disagree on the extent of diagnostic testing needed in patients with CAP.l, ATS guidelines recommend empiric therapy without routine microbiological work-up, whereas IDSA guidelines support work-up whenever possible and especially in patients requiring hospitalization. Microbiological diagnosis of CAP may fail in over 50% of patients. Increased success in microbiological diagnosis usually occurs in patients who produce sputum, have not been treated with antibiotics, and require hospitalization. A specific microbial diagnosis allows appropriate antimicrobial selection and detection of resistant organisms. Increasing worldwide microbial resistance may force more specific diagnosis of CAP. Likewise, the potential for less common but possibly more serious causes of CAP such as Legionella, TB, nocardiosis, pneumocystosis, and other local fungal etiologies needs to be considered. Clinical acumen is important, because blood and/or pleural fluid cultures are rarely positive, sputum Gram's stain and culture are difficult to interpret, and the clinical manifestations of pneumonia are rarely specific for a single pathogen. The clinician often can focus on the most likely etiology using the clinical history and a wellcollected and examined Gram's stain of sputum, keeping in mind that "common things happen commonly." Compromised hosts, nursinghome residents, and patients who received prior antimicrobial therapy may require broader antimicrobial coverage and a more accelerated, invasive diagnostic work-up. Call laboratory for availability and instructions for specific *Although amplification methods using polymerase chain reaction are available, they are not standardized, are difficult to interpret, and are not at this time recommended for routine evaluation of lower respiratory secretion in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. tS. pneurnuniae, Haeniuphilus bijuenzae, Moraxella catawhalis, and enteric gram-negative rods most common. SDFA direct fluorescent antigen detection in specimens. Â§e.g., Coxiella burnetti (Q fever), Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Yersinia pestis (plague). Studies detecting urinary antigens of pneumococci and Legionella are available, but their clinical usefulness is either still in question (Pneumococcus) or depends on geographic prevalence of the specific serogroups detected. Sensitivities of the pneumococcal antigen urinary test, although surpassing those of Gram's stain, may vary from 75% to 95%. The legionella urinary antigen studies include only L. pneumophila group 1, and sensitivities range from 70% to 90%.24 Its clinical usefulness may depend on the geographic prevalence of serogroup 1. Larger studies indicating substantiated benefits of urine antigen studies on the initial therapy of CAP are not yet universally available.38 A productive sputum should be carefully acquired for analysis. The patient must be taught appropriate collection techniques. Secretions from the lower respiratory tract (expectorated sputum, deep cough) rather than a collection of oropharyngeal saliva (spit) are essential. Induced sputum does not increase recovery of bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi, but may help in the diagnosis of pneumocystosis in the immunocompromised host.I6 Induced sputum may be submitted for mycobacterial and fungal studies if expectorated sputum is not available. Swabs of nasopharyngeal secretions and 24-hour collections of sputum are not useful. Appropriate storage and transport must be available to assure specimen integrity. Specimens should be processed within 2 hours or refrigerated for up to 24 hours.28 Viability of pathogenic bacteria with potential overgrowth with commensal organisms is always an issue, so specimens should be processed as rapidly as possible. Purulent areas of sputum should be screened microscopically (Gram's stain, methylene blue wet mount) at low magnification for adequacy. Several criteria comparing presence of squamous epithelial cells (SEC) with polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and predominant morphologies of bacteria have been evaluated and 49 The presence of increased numbers of SECs (12 to 25/100 X magnification field) and a paucity of PMNs (<25) represents a specimen that is inadequate for routine bacterial culture and should be rejected ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Collection of additional expectorated sputum specimens for routine culture after rejection of an initial specimen is not useful if a patient has begun therapy. A well-prepared Gram's stain of purulent sputum demonstrating a predominant bacterial morphology associated with WBCs is useful in guiding pathogen-oriented therapy (Figs. 3 and 4) . 42 Sputum Gram's stains that demonstrate many WBCs but no organisms suggest a "stealth organism," such as a virus, mycoplasma, C. pneumoniae, Legionella species, or M . tubercdosis. In the absence of many WBCs and a predominant bacterial morphology, sputum microscopy is not useful. The Gram's stain can be viewed as a road map to the sputum culture. If what grows in the culture is not associated with WBCs on the smear, the culture is suspect. Acceptable sputum specimens should be inoculated onto agar media that allow growth of the most common bacterial pathogens and help provide early differentiation of species. A usual battery of media in- cludes sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and McConkey agar plates. Other media and incubation characteristics may be indicated by the result of the Gram's stain. Slower growing bacteria such as Nocurdiu require longer incubation times. Direct communication with the laboratory is essential whenever dealing with a compromised host or the potential for less common pathogens requiring special media or lengthy incubation. Anaerobic cultures are not recommended on expectorated or aspirated sputum. These should be set up only on specimens collected by biopsy or protected bronchoscopic brushing. Only organisms associated with WBCs as noted in the direct Gram's stained smear of the specimen should be evaluated (Fig. 4) . Susceptibility studies are indicated when pathogens noted on Gram's stain are isolated and known to have increased resistance to antimicrobial agents of choice. For in vitro antimicrobial studies and laboratory reporting formats, the standards and recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) should be followed.31
