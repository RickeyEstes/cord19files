2.1. Animal. All cases of natural porcine pneumonia were examined in the study. In the farms, affected pigs showed copious coughing, dyspnea, and crackle for approximately four weeks. They were empirically treated with amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for 10 days upon the onset of symptoms. Stratified case samples were drawn from postweaned pigs to grower-finisher pigs. Four serial sections (5-10 mm) were made in each pulmonary lobe. Two aliquots of each lobe were frozen in −80 • C until used, and the others were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin. Swine lung tissue blocks were examined for further investigations. All five cases (pigs) were collected from a small farrow-to-finish operation where chronic respiratory syndrome occurs sporadically. Five BOOP pigs and another five specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs, purchased from Animal Technology Institute Taiwan, were euthanised and necropsied. Fresh samples were stored in −80 • C until used.
