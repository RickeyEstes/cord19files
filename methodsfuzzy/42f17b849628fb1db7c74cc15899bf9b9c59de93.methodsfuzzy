In this section, we use the word "analytic" broadly, to imply models that are directly numerically integrable, without the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods, rather than systems for which all results can be written in terms of fundamental functions, of which there are very few in epidemiology. Analytic approaches to transmission of infection on networks fall into three broad categories. Firstly, there are approaches that calculate exact invasion thresholds and final sizes for special networks. Secondly, there are approaches for calculating exact transient dynamics, including epidemic peak heights and times, but again, these only hold in special networks. Finally, there are approaches based on moment closure that are give approximately correct dynamics for a wide class of networks. Before considering these approaches on networks, it is worth considering what is meant by nonnetwork mixing and showing explicitly how this can derive the standard transmission terms from familiar differential equation models. Nonnetwork mixing can be taken to have one of two meanings: either that every individual in the population is weakly connected to every other (the mean-field assumption), or that an Erdös-Rényi random graph defines the transmission network, depending on context. To see how this determines the epidemic dynamics, we consider a population of N individuals, with a homogeneous independent probability q that any pair of individuals is linked on the network, which gives each individual a mean number of edges n = q(N − 1). We then assume that the transmission rate for infection across an edge is τ and that the proportion of the population infectious at a time t is I(t); then, the force of infection experienced by an average susceptible in the population is nτI(t) ≡ βI(t). The quantity β, therefore, defines a population-level transmission rate that can be interpreted in one of two ways as N → ∞. In the case where the population is assumed to be fully connected, the limit is that q is held at unity, and so τ is reduced to as N is increased to hold q(N − 1)τ constant. In the case where the population is connected on a random graph, q is reduced as N is increased to hold n constant. In either case, having defined an appropriate populationlevel transmission rate, a stochastic susceptible-infectious model of transmission is defined through a Markov chain, in which a population with X susceptible individuals and Y infectious individuals transitions stochastically to a population with X − 1 susceptible individuals and Y + 1 infectious individuals at rate βXY/(N − 1). Then, the exact mean behaviour of such a system in the limit N → ∞ then has its transmission behaviour captured bẏ where S, I are the proportion of individuals susceptible and infectious, respectively. The mathematical formalism behind deriving such sets of ordinary differential equations from Markov chains is given by Kurtz [113] , and a summary of the application of this methodology to infectious disease modelling is given in Diekmann and Heesterbeek [114] . However, it should be clear that (8) is familiar as the basis of all random-mixing epidemiological models. In the case of exponentially distributed infectious periods and recovery from infection offering long-lasting immunity, the standard SIR equations provide an exact description of the mean behaviour of this system. Nevertheless, the existence of waning immunity, a latent period between an individual becoming infected and being able to transmit infection, and nonexponentially distributed recovery periods are also important for epidemiological applications [10, 42, 115] . These can often be incorporated into analytical approaches through the addition of extra disease compartments, which necessitates extra algebraic and computational effort but typically does not require a fundamental conceptual reevaluation. Sometimes, significant additional complexity does not even modify quantitative epidemiological results-for example, regardless of the rate of waning immunity, length of latent period, or infectious period distribution, if the mean infectious period is T, then the basic reproductive ratio is The estimation of this quantity for complex disease histories, from data likely to be available, is considered by Wallinga and Lipsitch [116] . We, therefore, focus on the transmission process, since this is most affected by network structure, and other elements of biological realism typically act at the individual level. An important caveat to this, however, is when an infected individual's level of transmissibility varies over the course of their infectious period, which sets up correlations between the processes of transmission and recovery that pose a particular challenge for analytic work, especially in structured populations, as noted by for example Ball et al. [117] .
