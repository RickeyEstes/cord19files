Cell Culture and Plasmids-Vero E6 cells and HEK 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 g/ml streptomycin. Vector expressing a C9-tagged SARS-CoV spike protein (pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV S) was provided by Dr. Michael Farzan, New England Primate Research Center. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out via PCR, using primers obtained from IDT Technologies. Mutations were then confirmed by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems Automated 3730 DNA Analyzer at the Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center. Plasmids expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the T7 promoter and the plasmid expressing the T7 polymerase used for quantitative cell-cell fusion assays were provided by Dr. Tom Gallagher, Loyola University, Chicago, IL. For pseudotyped virion production, we used Gag-Pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, containing the MLV gag and pol genes, and the MLV-Luc plasmid, encoding an MLV-based transfer vector containing a CMV-Luc internal transcriptional unit (15) . These plasmids were provided by Dr. Jean Dubuisson, Institut de Biologie de Lille, France. Proteases-Elastase-1 (from porcine pancreas, E0258) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (from bovine pancreas) was obtained from Pierce. Cell-Cell Fusion Assay-HEK 293T cells plated in 12-well plates were transfected with equal amounts of plasmids expressing the spike protein and plasmid expressing the luciferase under the control of the T7 promoter using TurboFect (Fermentas). 6 h after transfection, cells were plated in 48-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine. Vero E6 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the T7 polymerase were then used to over-lay the HEK 293T cells. 4 h later, fusion was induced by protease treatment for 30 min. 5 h after induction of fusion, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega) to measure light emission. Pseudotyped Virion Assay-Pseudotyped virions were produced as described previously (6) . Briefly, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein, a vector coding for MLV Gag-Pol, and a third plasmid coding for the genome containing a luciferase reporter gene. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 32°C, and supernatant were collected and filtered through a 0.45-m filter. For transduction, HEK 293T cells co-expressing ACE2 and DC-SIGN were plated in 48-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine. Cells were preincubated with 25 mM NH 4 Cl for 1 h at 37°C to inhibit entry through the endosomal pathway and transferred to ice. The same quantities of pseudotyped virions were bound for 2 h at 4°C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Hepes, and 25 mM NH 4 Cl. Cells were warmed with RPMI 1640 medium containing indicated quantity of elastase or trypsin. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with complete medium containing 25 mM NH 4 Cl, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were lysed 48 h later, and luciferase activity was quantified by using a Luciferase assay kit (Promega) and light emission measured using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer. Spike Protein Cleavage Analysis-HEK 293T cells plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 12-well plates were co-transfected with plasmid expressing the wild type or mutant spike protein and ACE2 by using TurboFect (Fermentas). The next day, cells were treated for 2 h with protease (trypsin or elastase). Cells were then transferred to ice, and cell surface proteins were biotinylated. Cells were incubated with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 g/ml sulfo-NH-SS-biotin [sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate] (Pierce) for 15 min twice. Free biotin was then quenched by two incubations of 15 min each with 50 mM glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed by using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, pH 7.4), including complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Biotinylated proteins were affinity-precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Novagen) overnight. Beads were washed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the pellet was resuspended with SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample loading buffer containing 50 mM dithiothreitol. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide). SARS-CoV cleavage products were analyzed by Western blotting by using the antibody Rho 1D4 (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) directed against the C9 tag.
