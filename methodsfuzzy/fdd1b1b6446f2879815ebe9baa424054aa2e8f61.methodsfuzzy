Study population. This study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was performed as a cross-sectional study, in which 353 patients with metabolic syndrome were analyzed. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to the proposed Asia-Pacific criteria of the WHO 1999 Consultation on definition, diagnosis, and classification of diabetes mellitus and its complications. 19, 20 We classified subjects with the metabolic syndrome by WHO criteria according to the following schema: impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus and two or more of the following: (1) blood pressure Ն 140/90 mm Hg or treated hypertension; (2) central obesity, waist-hip-ratio Ͼ 0.9 for men and Ͼ 0.85 for women; or BMI Ͼ 25 kg/m 2 ; (3) microalbuminuria Ն 30 mg/24 h on at least two different occasions, or more advanced nephropathy; (4) plasma triglycerides Ն 150 mg/dL (Ն1.70 mmol/L) or HDL cholesterol Ͻ 35 mg/dL (Ͻ0.9 mmol/L) for men and Ͻ 39 mg/dL (Ͻ1.0 mmol/L) for women. Sitting blood pressure was measured twice to the nearest 2 mm Hg after a 5-minute rest using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (phases I and V of Korotkoff). The mean value from three separate measurements was calculated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure levels Ն 140/90 mm Hg or the use of antihypertensive medication. 21 BMI was calculated by weight divided by height squared. Each subject received a detailed interview about personal disease history and smoking history. All study subjects were of Han Chinese origin, without any known ancestors of another ethnic origin, and were living in the same region at the time of the study. All patients underwent complete physical examinations and routine biochemical analyses of blood and urine as well as an assessment of the presence and extent of macrovascular or microvascular diabetic complications. The anthropometric parameters required to calculate BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were measured. Plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and glucose were determined by standard methods on a Beckman LX20 analyzer (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, Calif). ACE2 A/G polymorphism. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood. The A/G polymorphism at nucleotide 8790 in intron 3 was tested using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. 22 For the ACE2 A/G polymorphism, the primer pairs used and the annealing temperature were as follows: forward 5=-TTCTCCCTGCTCCTATACTACCG-3= and reverse 5=-TTCATTCATGTCCTTGCCCTTA-3=, which amplify the intron 3 region where the A/G polymorphism is located. PCR amplification products were obtained using 25-L reactions (0.5-pg genomic DNA, 500 pmol of primers, 0.5 mmol/L each of deoxy-ATP, -GTP, -CTP, and -TTP, 1.5mmol/L MgCl 2 , 0.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio. Inc. Japan), 50-mmol/L KCl, 0.001% gelatin, and 10-mmol/L Tris-HCl; pH 8.3) with 4 minute denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 50 seconds at 94°C, 50 seconds at 52°C, and 50 seconds at 72°C in a thermal cycler (PTC-200 Peltier Thermal cycler, MJ Research, Watertown, Mass). The reaction was terminated at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were digested for 4 hours at 37°C with Alu I enzyme, electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. The expected products after digestion were 817 bp for the G allel, 589 bp and 228 bp for the A allel, and 817 bp, 589 bp, and 228 bp for GA heterozygous (Fig 1) . Genotyping was performed in a blinded fashion. Statistical analysis. Parametric data are expressed as means Ϯ SD. Group differences of continuous variables were compared using unpaired the Student t-test or ANOVA as appropriate. The Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied. To assess the extent to which the allele frequencies and risk factors were associated with hypertension, we estimated ORs and the corresponding 95% CI by multiple logistic regression analysis using a stepwise approach. All tests were two-sided, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
