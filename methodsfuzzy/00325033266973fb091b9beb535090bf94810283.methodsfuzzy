Data for this study were obtained from a voluntary registry created by node 18 (Director: Jordi Rello) of CIBERES (PCI Neumonia) and recruited by investigators of the GTEI/ SEMICYUC Study Group (Coordinator: Rafael Zaragoza), in 2009-10. Inclusion criteria were: adult viral pneumonia patients aged over 18 years, febrile (>38°C) acute illness; respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, myalgia or influenza-like illness; ARF (conventional oxygen therapy ‡0.5 to maintain SpO 2 ‡92%) requiring ICU admission; and microbiological confirmation of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)v by real-time PCR. Data were reported by the attending physician reviewing medical charts and radiological and laboratory records within the first 12 h after ICU admission. Patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pulmonary oedema, acute asthma and those already intubated at ICU admission or using NIV for palliative use or rescue therapy were excluded from the analysis [11] . The study was approved [11] by the institutional review board of Joan XXIII University Hospital, Tarragona (Spain). Patient identification remained anonymous and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study. The ICU admission criteria and treatment decisions for all patients, including determination of the need for intubation and type of antibiotic and antiviral therapy administered, were not standardized and were made by the attending physician. Nasopharyngeal-swab specimens were collected at admission and respiratory secretions were also obtained in intubated patients. Reverse transcription-PCR testing was performed in accordance with the CDC protocol (http:// www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/guidance). H1N1 testing was performed at each institution, or centralized in a reference laboratory when not available. A 'confirmed case' was defined as an acute respiratory illness with laboratory-confirmed pan-demic H1N1 virus infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR or viral culture [12] . Only 'confirmed cases' were included in the current study. The following information was recorded: demographic data, comorbidities, times of illness onset and hospital admission, time to first dose of antiviral delivery, microbiological findings and chest X-ray findings at ICU admission. Intubation and mechanical ventilation requirements (invasive and noninvasive), medical complications during ICU stay and laboratory findings at ICU admission were also recorded. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was defined as a disease state characterized by the presence of airflow limitation because of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The airflow obstruction could be accompanied by airway hyper-reactivity and could be partially reversible [13] . To determine the severity of illness, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score [14] was recorded in all patients within 24 h of ICU admission. In addition, organ failure was assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system [15] . Definition of community-acquired pneumonia was based on current American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines [16] . Primary viral pneumonia was defined in patients in the acute phase of influenza virus illness who presented with acute respiratory distress and unequivocal alveolar opacities with negative respiratory and blood bacterial cultures. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was considered in patients with confirmation of influenza virus infection who showed recurrence of fever, increase in cough and production of purulent sputum plus positive bacterial respiratory or blood cultures [17] . Respiratory cultures were based on tracheal aspirates obtained immediately after intubation. Acute renal failure was defined as the need for renal replacement therapy, in accordance with the International Consensus Conference criteria [18] . We have defined comorbidities as the pathological antecedents of each patient, and antiviral gap as time of delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of antiviral treatment. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and shock were defined following international criteria [15, 19] . NIV was always used for ARF at an early stage. Failure of NIV was defined if the patient was intubated and invasively ventilated after an NIV trial (when SpO 2 <92% or important respiratory work appeared). Data were analysed using SPSS 18.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). Data are expressed as frequency (percentage) or median (25th-75th interquartile range). For univariate analysis of the qualitative variables, the Chi-squared and Fisher tests were used. Quantitative variables were analysed by comparison of means with the Student's t test. Stepwise multivariate analysis was performed with logistic regression taking the variables which had p values <0.20 in the univariate analysis, or others with a special clinical interest (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure), as dependent variables. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant.
