The DSGE approach is selected due to its advantages over other methods. First, it employs the consumer Euler equation from an inter-temporal overlapping-generations perspective which is not possible when using the traditional OLS technique (DeJong & Dave, 2011) . Second, it covers all sectors of the economy, in contrast to the narrower base considered in the VAR technique (Sims, 2001) . Third, it is able to produce solution choices according to economic theory, which the GMM approach is not (Dotsey, 2013) . For empirical applications of this approach, see www.dsge.net.
