Based on a literature review, 12 HBV-and HLArelated SNPs, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) five hepatitis-and immune-related SNPs in complement factor B (CFB), clusters of differentiation molecule 40 (CD40), and interferon lambda 4 (IFNL4) loci (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , and five nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)-related SNPs in HLA regions (19) (20) (21) were selected for this analysis (Tables 1 and 2 ). These SNP data from around the world were downloaded from the phase 3 data of 1,000 genomes (http://www. 1000genomes.org/). (22) The subjects participating in the 1,000 genome project were older than 18 years and had three out of four grandparents who identified themselves as members of the group. The location of the 26 populations evaluated in the 1,000 genomes are shown by abbreviation on a global HBsAg prevalence map reported by Hou et al. (2) (Fig. 1) . The allele frequencies of different geographic groups in viral hepatitis-related SNPs and NPC-related SNPs are illustrated in Fig. 2 . The SNP genotype differences between groups are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . We used interactive chi-square tests to calculate the difference in genotypes between groups (http://quantpsy.org).
