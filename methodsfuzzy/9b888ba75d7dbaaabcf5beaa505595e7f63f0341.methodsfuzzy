The extraction of DNA from EFS was performed as per the protocol laid down in OIE terrestrial manual (OIE, 2017b). Briefly; 10 μL of extended semen sample was added to 0.6 ml tube containing lysis solution {11.5 μL of 10 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), 7.5 μL of 1 M DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) in 90 μL nuclease free water (NFW)} and 100 μL of 10%, w/v Chelex 100 (Sigma). The sample mixture was vortexed for 10 seconds (s) and incubated at 56°C for 30 minutes (min). The tube was vortexed again for 10 s and incubated at 98°C for 8 min. The vortexing was then repeated and the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant containing DNA was transferred to 96 well PCR plate and stored at −20°C for future use. 2.3. Retrieval of DNA from FTA ® elute cards spotted with extended semen The retrieval of DNA from the FTA ® elute cards (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was carried out as per manufacturer's protocol with slight modification (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, 2011). For extended semen samples spotted onto FTA ® card, overnight DTT treatment step was included before proceeding for the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 30 μL of extended bovine semen was added to the FTA ® card and allowed to dry at room temperature. After complete drying, 10 μL of 0.1 M DTT was added to each spot and the card was left overnight for drying at room temperature. The next day one disc was punched out from the centre of the area spotted with semen using single hole paper punch (4.5 mm size) and the disc was transferred to a sterile 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube. The sample disc was then washed by addition of 500 μL NFW, pulse vortexed for 3 times of 5 s each followed by removal of NFW. This washing step was repeated thrice and the disc was transferred to a fresh 0.6 ml tube. Then 30 μL of NFW was added to the disc and the tube was incubated in the PCR machine (with heated lid) for 30 min at 98°C for elution of DNA. The tube was then pulse vortexed for approximately 60 times of 1 s each followed by brief centrifugation for 15 s. The FTA ® matrix disc was discarded using a sterile pipette tip. The eluate containing DNA was stored at −20°C. The two DNA extraction methods were compared based on the Ct value obtained from limit of dilution experiment as well as repeated testing of extraction control (10 1.8 TCID 50 /ml BoHV-1 spiked semen). The data were analysed by scatter diagram and Bland-Altman plot. The correlation coefficient (r) was found to be 0.9774 (95% CI: 0.9620-0.9866) which indicated a very strong correlation between the two methods and p < 0.0001 indicated the low probability of this association to chance. Bland-Altman plot was used to identify relationship between the differences and the averages, to evaluate any systematic biases and to identify possible outliers. The results suggest on an average, the Ct value obtained in FTA method is 0.29 (95% CI: −0.58 to −0.006) less than that of Chelex method. The positive extraction control (known negative extended semen spiked with 10 1.8 TCID 50 /ml BoHV-1 virus) was used in every batch of DNA extraction in both Chelex and FTA method. The Ct values obtained for the positive control sample (19 times on different days) was checked for normal distribution. The mean Ct value and standard deviation of Chelex method was 38.2779 and 1.14; and for the FTA method was 37.8563 and 1.33 respectively. While, all the Ct values were found to be within two standard deviations for the Chelex method; only one replicate showed Ct values higher than two standard deviation in the FTA method.
