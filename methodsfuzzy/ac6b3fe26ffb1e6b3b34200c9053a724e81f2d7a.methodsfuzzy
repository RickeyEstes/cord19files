Compound library, screening procedure, and DD363 analogs. The initial screen that allowed the identification of DD363 was described in detail elsewhere (8) . Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the pISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (reference no. 219089; Stratagene) and dispensed at 2 ϫ 10 4 cells/well in white 96-well plates already containing 1 l of compounds from the Institut Curie library at 2 mg/ml in DMSO. Since the final culture volumes were 100 l/well, compounds were screened at 20 g/ml, corresponding to 57 M for DD363. Compound synthesis is described in in the supplemental material and Table 1 . Cell lines, culture medium, and luciferase assays. Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin. Human MRC5 and HEK-293T cells were from the ATCC. The reporter cell line STING-37, corresponding to HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the ISRE-luciferase reporter gene, was previously described (8) . Luciferase induction in STING-37 cells was determined using the Bright-Glo (Promega) or Britelite plus reagents (PerkinElmer), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Bioluminescence was measured for 0.1 s with a luminometer (EnSpire; PerkinElmer). Cellular viability was determined by quantification of ATP in culture wells using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Viruses, infections, and immunostaining. Experiments with measles virus (MV) were performed with the vaccine strain Schwarz from the ATCC. The recombinant MV strain expressing firefly luciferase (MV-Luc) from an additional transcription unit was derived from the vaccine strain Schwarz and was previously described (30) . Virus stocks were produced on Vero cells and titrated by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) on Vero cells. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections were performed with wild-type strain 05115 from La Réunion Island or the recombinant strain CHIKV/Ren expressing Renilla luciferase (kindly provided by Philippe Desprès [19] ). HCoV-229E was originally obtained from the ATCC (VR-740), and virus stocks were produced on MRC5 cells, as previously described (31) . Firefly and Renilla luciferase expression from MV-Luc and CHIKV/Ren recombinant viruses was determined using the Bright-Glo (Promega) and Renilla-Glo (Promega) reagents, respectively. For immunofluorescence detection of viral proteins, HEK-293T cells were infected with CHIKV at an MOI of 0.1 and cultured on microscopy slides (Ibidi, Munich, Germany). At 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized for 5 min at 4°C in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 1 h in PBS supplemented with 5% goat serum and incubated again in the same solution containing the Cy3-conjugated antibody against the CHIKV E2 protein (clone 3E4; kindly provided by Philippe Desprès) (32) . For HCoV-229E, MRC5 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and cultured on microscopy slides (Ibidi) for 48 h. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above and stained with an anti-spike glycoprotein monoclonal antibody Aldrich (clone AC-15, catalog no. A5441). Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were from Dako (catalog no. P0447) and Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no. A0545), respectively. Protein detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified with the Adobe Photoshop software. Cytokine quantification in culture supernatants. Cytokine levels in culture supernatants of HEK-293 cells stimulated with ssRNA or MV with or without DMSO or DD778 at 30 M were determined using the LEGENDplex analysis kit, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (human anti-virus response panel with V-bottom plate, catalog no. 740390).
