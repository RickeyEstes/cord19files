Study participants Children 10 years of age with CSLD, undergoing chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and flexible bronchoscopy for suspected bronchiectasis, were prospectively recruited (2010-2013) from the Royal Darwin Hospital, Northern Territory, Australia. All children were clinically stable (defined as absence of recent exacerbation) and under the care of a specialist paediatrician at the time of sample collection. Radiographic diagnosis of bronchiectasis was made by the respiratory paediatrician (AC) and the severity of bronchiectasis scored using a modified Bhalla scale as previously done [13] . The total score was the sum of the score for each lobe, including lingula, based on the extent of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickness and dilation (maximum score 48). Routine clinical investigations [14] were undertaken in all children evaluated for bronchiectasis. Clinical and socio-demographic data were collected using standardised data collection forms. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical and research investigations were collected immediately prior to chest CT scan/bronchoscopy as previously described [8] . This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research; #07/63) and children enrolled following written informed consent from the parent/ carer.
