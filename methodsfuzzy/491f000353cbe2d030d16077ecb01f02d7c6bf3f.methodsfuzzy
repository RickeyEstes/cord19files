To determine long-term stability of RPA reaction pellets at different temperatures, all experimental parameters such as template, buffers, analyst, protocol, and detection devices were kept constant. Reaction pellets were stored at four different temperatures: ≤−15 ∘ C (reference), 2-8 ∘ C, 22-28 ∘ C (ambient), or 35-40 ∘ C. Reaction pellets were produced as a single batch, packaged in a dry-room facility as strips of 8 PCR tubes, vacuum-sealed, and shipped on dry ice. The ≤−15 ∘ C, 2-8 ∘ C, and 22-28 ∘ C (ambient) storage units were tracked via an automated system to ensure accurate temperatures. The 35-40 ∘ C storage unit was tracked on a weekly basis by manual recording. The reaction pellets from all four temperature conditions were tested at 18 defined intervals over a year. At each time point, eight reactions were tested per storage condition including six reactions using 0.1% RR2Y genomic DNA as positive control template and two reactions using genomic DNA from conventional soybean. Positive, negative, or invalid calls were made based on a slope cutoff of 90 mV/min for FAM and 600 mV/min for TAMRA. Statistical analysis was used to determine overall results of stability experiments using the following analysis of variance (ANOVA) model: where is the observed response of the th well of the th temperature at the th time; is the overall mean, is the effect of the th temperature; ( ) is the random effect of the th well in the th temperature; is the effect of the th time; is the effect of the interaction between the th temperature and the th time; and is the residual error. Pairwise comparisons of each time point to time zero were defined within the ANOVA model and tested using Dunnett's test at the 5% level. There were multiple cases where statistical significance did not indicate a lack of stability. For example, a significantly lower response at time would be followed by a nonsignificant difference at time + 1. As a result a biologically meaningful difference was also used to evaluate the data. When the average response reached half of the mean at time zero, the pellets were considered unstable.
