Patients diagnosed with MS were selected with prior informed consent and approval of the experimental protocol from institutional ethics and scientific committees. Thirtytwo patients were recruited at random for this study. Confidentiality was preserved at all times. Patients were not on immune modulating drugs at least 2 months prior the beginning of the study. HLA-typing of MS patients was done at the Histocompatibility laboratory of INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, Qu√©bec, Canada.
