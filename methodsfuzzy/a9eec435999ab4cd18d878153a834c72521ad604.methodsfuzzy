The VaccHemInf project is a single-centre prospective, consecutive cohort of adult HSCT recipients transplanted at the Haematology department of a 5362-bed tertiary-care university hospital (Lyon, France). During the past 5 years, the 114-bed Haematology department carried out an average of 102 (range, 90-110) and 81 (range, 73-88) autologous and allogeneic HSCT yearly, respectively. setting On referent haematologist's agreement, eligible adult (autologous or allogeneic) HSCT recipients will be referred to the vaccination centre dedicated to immunocompromised patients hosted by the Infectious Diseases department of Lyon's university hospital for inclusion in the VaccHemInf cohort. The recruitment period will be of 24 months and recipient overall follow-up will cover Open access a period of 48 months. For the purpose of FIGHT, 30 control healthy volunteers will be enrolled and will be tested for immune functional assays. Healthy volunteers will be recruited among the donors to the blood bank of the Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS) of Lyon. According to the EFS standardised procedures for blood donation, informed consent will be obtained from healthy donors, and personal data will be anonymised at the time of blood donation prior to the transfer of blood to the research laboratory. Qualitative variables will be expressed as count (percentage) while quantitative data will be expressed as median (IQR). The primary endpoint will be compared between V1 and V2, between V1 and V3 as well as between V1 and V4 regarding multiple variables related to haematological characteristics, treatment management, pattern of post-transplant immune recovery and transplant-related complications. Comparison will be performed using the Wilcoxon test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the χ 2 test or the Fisher exact test, where appropriate. For the GMT, means and 95% CI will be computed for the log10 transformed titres and then transformed back to the original units by exponentiation. For vaccine targets with low to moderate responder rates, the association between responders/non-responders endpoint and factor will be established using logistic regression. All factors associated with endpoint with a significance level p<0.15 will be kept for multivariate logistic regression models. These models will be adjusted with at most two or three confounding factors chosen according to evidence-based literature. In case of relapse of the haematological disease, in case of death during follow-up or in case of loss to follow-up, patients will be included in the analysis provided that there is at least the prevaccination and one or more postvaccination assessment available. Analyses will be based on two-sided p values, with statistical significance defined by p<0.05 and conducted with R V.3.4.4. Finally, appropriate multiple imputations (ie, at random or not) will be taken into consideration in the case of a relevant amount of missing values.
