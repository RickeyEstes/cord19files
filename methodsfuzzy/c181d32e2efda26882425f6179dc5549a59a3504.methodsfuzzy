In this section, we will illustrate the overall procedures of our method for analyzing protein sequences as follows at first. (1) Select the same 9 different properties for each amino acid and construct a 20 × 9 matrix as the input data of the PCA algorithm on the basis of total 20 different amino acids. (2) According to the PCA algorithm, we can obtain a unique feature for each amino acid. (3) For each protein sequence in the test data, we will replace each amino acid in the protein sequence with its corresponding unique feature, and then we can transform the protein sequence into a numerical sequence. (4) For any two numerical sequences, we can draw a graph, named ADLD, and then abstract some numerical characteristics of it, which can be utilized to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of these two sequences. Next, in Sections 2.2-2.6 we will introduce the details of constructing the ADLDs and obtaining some of the numerical characteristics of them. In Section 3.1, we will give the method for constructing the similarity/dissimilarity of our test sequence groups. Obviously, in an ASD, if keeping all of the SFs and FPs only and omitting all those other APs, then we will obtain a simplified variant diagram of the ASD, and, for convenience, we call it the Alignment Diagonal Line Diagram (ADLD). Apparently, if = 1, then an ADLD will degenerate into an ASD. Therefore, in actual applications, we suggest that will be no less than 2. And, particularly, in order to find more accurate SFs in the ADLD of a protein sequence pair, the longer the protein sequences in the protein sequence pair are the bigger the value of shall be. For convenience of analysis, in an ADLD, suppose that there are 1 different SFs and 2 different FPs on its AT, different BTs locating above its AT, and different BTs locating below its AT; then we get the following. (1) For these 1 different SFs and 2 different FPs on the AT of the ADLD, we will number these 1 SFs and 2 FPs from left to right and utilize {ASF 1 , ASF 2 , . . . , ASF 1 } and {FP 1 , FP 2 , . . . , FP 2 } to represent these 1 SFs and 2 FPs separately. And, in addition, we would also call these SFs on the AT of the ADLD the ASFs. (2) For these different BTs locating above the AT, we will number these BTs from down to up and utilize {BT 1 , BT 2 , . . . , BT } to represent these BTs separately, and, for these different BTs locating below the AT, we will number these BTs from up to down and utilize {BT −1 , BT −2 , . . . , BT − } to represent these BTs separately. (3) For each BT , where ∈ {1, 2, . . . , }, suppose that there are 3 different SFs on the BT ; then we will number these 3 SFs from left to right and utilize {BSF 1 , BSF 2 , . . . , BSF 3 } to represent these SFs separately. And, in addition, we would also call these SFs on the BTs of the ADLD the BSFs. According to the above assumptions, in Figure 2 , we show the two ADLDs corresponding to the ASDs illustrated in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) while letting = 3. And, in addition, to make the ADLDs more visual and intuitional, in Figure 2 , we use the red " * " to represent the FPs on the AT and the blue lines to represent the SFs on the AT or BTs. From Figure 2 (a), it is easy to see that there are two SFs in the ADLD of the sequence pair (chimpanzee, human); one is ASF 1 , that is, the line segment from the point (1, 1) to the point (32, 32) , and the other is BSF 1 −4 , that is, the line segment from the point (35, 31) to the point (125, 121) . And, in addition, there are totally 6 FPs in the ADLD, which are FP 1 (46, 46), FP 2 (66, 66), FP 3 (111, 111), FP 4 (114, 114), FP 5 (115, 115), and FP 6 (123, 123), respectively. Observing Figure 2 (b), we can easily find that there are also two SFs in the ADLD of the sequence pair (human, gorilla). But, different from that in Figure 2(a) , the two SFs in Figure 2 (b) are both ASFs; one is ASF 1 , that is, the line segment from the point (1, 1) to the point (104, 104) , and the other is ASF 2 , that is, the line segment from the point (106, 106) to the point (121, 121) . And, in addition, the two ASFs in Figure 2 (b) are separated by one gap, and there exist no FPs or BSFs on the AT or BTs. Through analysis, we can know that, for a given protein sequence pair, if there exist some deletions or insertions of amino acid segments between the two protein sequences, then there will exist some misalignments of SFs in their ADLD; that is, some ASFs on the AT will be transformed into BSFs on some BTs. And, in addition, if there exist some substitutions of the amino acids between the two protein sequences, then, in their ADLD, there will exist some gaps between two neighboring SFs or FPs on the AT. Furthermore, if there exist some insertions, deletions, or substitutions of the amino acid segments at the end of the two protein sequences, then, in their ADLD, there will exist no SFs or FPs on the AT or BTs. From the above descriptions, it is easy to know that the ADLD of any given protein sequence pair obtained by our above proposed method reflects some inner and specific differences between these two protein sequences in the given protein sequence pair, which may be useful in the similarity/dissimilarity analysis of protein sequence pairs. Sequences Based on the ADLDs. According to the above analysis, we have known that the ADLDs may be useful in analyzing the differences of the inner structures of protein sequence pairs. In this section, we will show how to utilize the ADLDs to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of a group of protein sequences. Generally, suppose that there are protein sequences {Ψ 1 , Ψ 2 , . . . , Ψ }; then while applying the ADLDs to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of these sequences, the similarity/dissimilarity matrix of these sequences can be obtained through the following steps. Step 1. According to the method given in Section 2.5, transform these protein sequences into numerical sequences { 1 , 2 , . . . , }. Step 2. For a given protein sequence pair {Ψ , Ψ }, ∈ {1, 2, . . . , }, ∈ {1, 2, . . . , }, we can obtain their ADLD through adopting the method proposed in Section 2.6, and then we can obtain all of the SFs (including ASFs and BSFs) and FPs in the ADLD. Hence, we can obtain the lengths of these ASFs, the lengths of these BSFs, and the number of these FPs, respectively. Step 3. Suppose that there are totally 1 And, therefore, according to these protein sequences {Ψ 1 , Ψ 2 , . . . , Ψ }, we can obtain an × matching matrix (MM) as follows:  Step 4. Based on the matching matrix MM and all of its components , where ∈ {1, 2, . . . , } and ∈ {1, 2, . . . , }, then we can obtain an × similarity/dissimilarity matrix (SM) of these protein sequences {Ψ 1 , Ψ 2 , . . . , Ψ } as follows:  According to the above steps, we present an example through implementing the ADLDs to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of 16 ND5 proteins (illustrated in Table 5 ) while letting = 3 and illustrate the results of similarity/dissimilarity matrix in Table 6 . Observing Table 6 , it is easy to find that there are some similar pairs such as (c-chim, pi-chim) with the distance 0.0510, (human, c-chim) with the distance 0.0814, (human, 8 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine pi-chim) with the distance 0.0720, (gorilla, c-chim) with the distance 0.0865, (gorilla, pi-chim) with the distance 0.0833, and (fin-whale, blue-whale) with the distance 0.0324. And, among them, the opossum seems to be a peculiar mammal, since the shortest distance between it and the remaining mammals is more than 0.4023. Obviously, the result is consistent with the fact that opossum is the most remote species from the remaining mammals. Additionally, gallus seems to be more peculiar than opossum, since the shortest distance between it and the remaining animals is more than 0.4423, which is bigger than 0.4023 (the shortest distance between Opossum and the remaining mammals). Obviously, the result is consistent with the fact that gallus is not a kind of mammal. Therefore, it is apparent that the results illustrated in Table 6 are wholly consistent with the results of the known fact of evolution. That is to say, our ADLDs based method can be utilized as an effective way to analyze the similarities/dissimilarities of protein sequences.
