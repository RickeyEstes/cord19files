Prior literature shows that LCCs can have a significant impact on the tourism demand and tourism growth of a county or city. As the case for other destinations, New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth may be affected by the factors and variables discussed in Section 2. Therefore, this study developed econometric models to investigate New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth. Following the demand function of Chi, Koo, and Lim (2010) , this study specified New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth as a function of the LCC's seat capacity (ASKs), GDP per capita, two RTIs (accommodation, food and beverage), transport costs (aviation fuel price and petrol price), the exchange rate, other exogenous variables (the global financial crisis of 2008/09 and the Christchurch earthquakes of 2011), and seasonal dummies. Importantly, the rapid development and expansion of the LCC's operations (Jetstar) within New Zealand's domestic aviation market and its impact on domestic tourism have been less studied than international tourism. This study aimed to fill this gap and used the LCC's seat capacity/per region panel dataset to investigate its impact on New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth, as well as identifying the variables that influenced tourism demand for the five key New Zealand regions and tourist destinations (i.e. Auckland, Canterbury/Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, and Wellington) for the period of June 2009eJuly 2015. Two panel data regression models were used to investigate the impact of LCC's services on New Zealand's domestic tourism demand and growth as specified as below: Model 1: Model 2: where i and t denote region i and month t, respectively; ln denotes the logarithm; b s indicates the coefficients to be estimated; Îµ it is the disturbance term. The statistical program of Eviews 8 was used for the estimation. It should be noted that the variable ln(Domestic guest nights) it in Model 1 represents the number of domestic guest nights (a proxy for the number of domestic tourists and holidaymakers) of region i at month t, and the variable (%) of Domestic guest nights it in Model 2 represents the share of domestic guest nights of the total guest nights of region i at month t. In addition, the variable (%) of LCC's ASK it in Model 2 indicates the share of the LCC's seat capacity (Jetstar) provided at an airport; this variable is a measure of dominance which is a percentage of the total LCC's ASK in a particular region (Vowles, 2000) , and also it indicates the LCC's position against the incumbent airline (Air New Zealand) in transporting domestic tourists and holidaymakers between New Zealand's regions and cities. Table 3 presents the estimation results of the panel data regression models and the two-stage least-square (2SLS) models: Model (1) -ln(Domestic guest nights) it and Model (2) -(%) of Domestic guest nights it . During the panel data regression analysis, the problem of endogeneity in Model 1A may provide inconsistent estimators or biased estimation results. Note that the endogeneity effect violates the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS), and thus the OLS estimator is biased, inconsistent and no longer the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) (Chi et al., 2010) . In this study, the variable ln(LCC's ASK) it in Model 1A can be endogenous, as an increase in airline seat capacity for an airport increases the number of tourists and holidaymakers using airline services to travel to the region where the airport is located, which, in turn, influences the total seat capacity scheduled by airlines. Thus this study used the instrumental variable (IV) technique to correct the problem of endogeneity (e.g. Borenstein, 1989; Hsiao, 2014; Tsui, Tan, & Shi, 2016; Wooldridge, 2002) .
