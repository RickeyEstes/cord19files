Peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized on 4-methyl benzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin by using the Fmoc strategy. They were cleaved from the resin by hydrogen fluoride. The N-termini of the peptides were acetylated, and their C-termini were amidated. All the peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to >90% homogeneity. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Autoflex III, Bruker Daltonics). HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion. HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion was determined by a dye transfer assay as previously described [10] using Calcein AM-labeled HIV-1 IIIB chronically infected H9 (H9/HIV-1 IIIB ) cells as effector cells and MT-2 cells as target cells. The % inhibition of cell fusion by the HR-peptides was calculated as previously described [10] , and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated using the CalcuSyn software [11] . Detection of HIV-1 replication. The inhibitory activity of the HR-peptides on HIV-1 IIIB replication was determined as previously described [12, 13] . Briefly, MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB in the presence or absence of the HR-peptides at graded concentrations. On the fourth day post-infection, culture supernatants were collected and assayed for p24 antigen using ELISA as previously described [13] . On the sixth day post-infection, an indicator XTT tetrazolium dye (PolySciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) was added to the cells for detection of cytopathic effect (CPE). ELISA for detection of the gp41 6-HB formation. The inhibitory activity of the designed HR-peptides on gp41 6-HB formation was determined by a sandwich ELISA as previously described [14] . Briefly, the peptide N36 (2 lM) was pre-incubated with an HR-peptide at graded concentrations at 37°C for 30 min, followed by addition of C34 (2 lM). After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the mixture was added to wells of ELISA plates pre-coated with purified rabbit anti-6-HB IgG. Murine anti-6-HB monoclonal antibody (mAb) NC-1, biotin-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG, Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP), and the substrate 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) were then added sequentially. Absorbance at 450 nm (A 450 ) was measured using an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan, Durham, NC). Prediction of the secondary and tertiary structures of the designed HR-peptides. Secondary structure prediction of designed HR-peptides was carried out on the NPS@ Web server (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/) using the HNN Secondary Structure Prediction Method [15] . According to the crystal structure of the gp41 core formed by the NHR-peptide N36 and CHR-peptide C34 [4] and the predicted tertiary structure of the designed HR-peptides, the interaction between the HR-peptides and N36 was modeled by using the PyMOL program (http://pymol.sourceforge.net).
