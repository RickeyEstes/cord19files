Virus and bacteria. Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 strain (PR8) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and propagated in embryonated eggs. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Serotypes 3 and 19F of S. pneumoniae were derived from clinical isolates in Singapore and cultured in brain heart infusion broth (Sigma 53286) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) under anaerobic conditions until the mid-logarithmic phase. Animals and infection. Female BALB/c mice (8 to 12 weeks old) were purchased from InVivos, Singapore, and kept at the biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) animal facility of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (A0321 and A0200AZ), and National University of Singapore (050/11). Mice were anesthetized using 80 mg/kg body weight ketamine and 10 mg/kg body weight xylazine and infected via intratracheal delivery with the PR8 virus at a sublethal dose of 10 PFU in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At day 7 post-influenza infection, 100 CFU of serotype 3 or 5,000 CFU of serotype 19F of S. pneumoniae in PBS was delivered intratracheally to the mice. Sham infections were performed using sterile PBS. Immediately after bacterial infection, mice were injected intraperitoneally with moxifloxacin (100 mg/kg body weight), anti-ANGPTL4 antibody (10 mg/kg body weight), antipneumolysin antibody (10 mg/kg body weight), or control IgG (10 mg/kg body weight) daily starting from day 7 post-influenza infection until harvest. The mice were euthanized at specified time points, and lung tissues were harvested. Lung lobes were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histologic analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at Ϫ80°C for subsequent assays. Antibodies. The anti-mouse cANGPTL4 antibody and anti-human cANGPTL4 antibody were produced in-house as described previously (52, 53) . The antipneumolysin antibody was prepared by culturing an MG12 hybridoma culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and purified from the culture medium using the IgG purification kit (Merck Millipore, no. LSK2ABG20). The anti-CD68 antibody was purchased from Abcam (no. 31630). Immunofluorescent staining of lung sections. Fixed mouse lungs were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were mounted on slides coated with Superfrost Plus (Thermal Scientific). Sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated in water. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as previously described (24) . Sections were mounted with an antifade reagent containing DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [Invitrogen]), and images were captured by Observer Z1 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for histopathologic analysis of the lung tissues. S. pneumoniae in the lung sections was detected by employing fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as described, with minor modifications (54) . Briefly, following the dehydration of fixed lung sections in an ethanol series (3 min each in 50, 80, and 98% ethanol), overnight hybridization to 16S rRNA of S. pneumoniae was performed with an Spn probe tagged with Cy5 in a hybridization buffer containing 30% formamide (55) . After the washing steps, the sections were mounted with an antifade reagent and imaged using the LSM780 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) fitted with a Plan Apochromat 100ϫ/1.4 oil lens objective, with excitation at 561 nm (autofluorescence) and 633 nm (Cy5). Microscopic images were processed using the Imaris software (version 8.2.0). S. pneumoniae was pseudocolored green. Sorting of immune cells. Immune cells were harvested from influenza virus-and S. pneumoniae serotype 3-coinfected mice at day 9 post-influenza virus infection by bronchoalveolar lavage. One milliliter of sterile PBS was injected into the mouse lung through the trachea and retrieved into the syringe. The BALF contained immune cells and damaged lung tissues. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ϫ g for 10 min, stained for flow cytometry, and sorted using a BD FACSAria. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as previously described (56, 57) . PCR was performed with the Bio-Rad CFX-96 real-time system using KAPA Sybr fast qPCR master mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (KAPA Biosystems). The primers used were mouse ANGPTL4 (forward, 5=-CCCCACGCACCTAGACAATG-3=; reverse, 5=-CCTCC ATCTGAAGTCATCTCA-3=) and housekeeping primer RPL27 (forward, 5=-CGCAAAGCTGTCATCGTG-3=; reverse, 5=-CGCAAAGCTGTCATCGTG-3=). Lung tissues were lysed with M-PER mammalian extraction buffer (Pierce), and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein samples were heated in 2ϫ Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to lowfluorescence polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (58) . RNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from frozen mouse lung tissues using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher). The integrity of the total RNA and the level of DNA contamination were assessed with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Library preparation was performed according to the mRNA-seq sample preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform with single-end 75-bp sequencing. Sequencing reads were mapped onto the viral, S. pneumoniae, and mouse genomes using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.0. Differential gene expression was determined using the R statistic package DESeq2 (59) . The following criteria were adopted to filter the unique sequence reads: maximum number of hits for a read of 1, minimum length fraction of 0.9, minimum similarity fraction of 0.8, and maximum number of two mismatches. A constant of 1 was added to the raw transcript count value to avoid any problems caused by 0. The DESeq2 package from R/Bioconductor was used for the statistical analysis of the transcript count table. The transcript counts were normalized to the effective library size. The differentially expressed genes were identified by performing a negative binomial test. Transcripts were determined as differentially expressed when they showed a Ͼ2-fold change with an adjusted P value of Ͻ0.05. Pathway analysis and data presentation were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen Bioinformatics). Measurement of cANGPTL4 in BALF and serum from lung disease patients. BALF samples were obtained from pneumonia patients who fulfilled the ARDS diagnostic criteria of the American European Consensus Conference (60) . Controls for BALF samples were obtained from healthy volunteers. BALF was collected with three instillations of sterile physiological saline (50 ml) through a flexible bronchoscope as previously described (61) . The collected lavage fluid was passed through two sheets of gauze and centrifuged at 400 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was stored at -20°C until use. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagasaki University Hospital, Japan. Serum samples were obtained from patients with diagnosed pneumonia before successful treatment with antibiotics from the Biological Resource Center Ferdinand Cabanne (BB-0033-00044; Dijon) and the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Dijon, France. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and all experiments conformed to the principles outlined in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human Services Belmont Report. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired t test using GraphPad Prism version 5.03 (GraphPad Software). Values are depicted as mean Ϯ standard error of mean (SEM). A P value of Ͻ0.05 was considered statistically significant. Accession number(s). RNA sequencing data have been submitted to the NCBI BioProject database under BioProject no. PRJNA394932 and SRA accession no. SRP113049.
