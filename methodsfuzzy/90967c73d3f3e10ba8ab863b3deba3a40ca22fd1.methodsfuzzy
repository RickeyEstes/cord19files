Cell lines, viruses, and stable cell line generation Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells were purchased from ATCC. They were cultured in MEM (Modified Eagle's medium) and DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 mg/ml). BSRT7 cells were described in our previous study [4] and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mg/ml G418. All cells were maintained at 37˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air. EV71 is a Fuyang strain (GenBank accession no. FJ439769.1) and was propagated in RD cells. RD cells stably expressing SHH, NHK, TTR D18G, and NS1 κ LC were obtained by transfecting RD cells with the corresponding plasmids followed by selection using 1 mg/ml G418.
