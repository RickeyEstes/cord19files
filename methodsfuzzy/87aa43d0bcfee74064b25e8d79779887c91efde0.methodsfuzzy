All echovirus and coxsackie A9 stocks were prepared by propagation in MRC-5 cells while those of coxsackie B viruses, polioviruses and coxsackie A7, AlO, A16, A21 and A24 were prepared in Ohio HeLa cells. The titres of stocks were estimated by titration in microtitre plates as described previously for rhinoviruses (Forsyth et al., in press) and were greater than lo4 TCID,dml. The coxsackie A viruses were a kind gift from Dr. Walker of the Public Health Laboratory at Epson. Echoviruses were obtained from the Public Health Laboratories at Colindale while the polioviruses were obtained from the Department of Microbiology at Odstock Hospital, Salisbury. Details of the coxsackie cDNA probes were as follows. The coxsackie A21 5' end probe is a PstI-BumHI fragment (genomic positions l-775) cloned into M13mp19. The 3' end probe is a EcoRV-PsfI fragment comprising the final 790 nucleotides (positions 6211-7401). This was cloned into SmaI-PstI M13mp18. On the other hand, coxsackie B4, 5' end probe consisted of a 531 base pair PsrI fragment of the CB4 genome derived from cDNA fragment extending from the PsrI site at the extreme 5' end of the genome to the PsfI site at position 531, subcloned into M13mp18. The 3' end probe consisted of a 590 base pair RstI-BcA fragment of the CB4 genome subcloned into M13mp18. The Bcl site is at position 6805 in the CB4 genome and the Pst site is after the GC tail at the extreme 3' end of the cDNA clone. The procedure for labelling these probes and conditions of hybridization employed in detecting enterovirus RNA using cDNA probes were the same as those recently described for rhinoviruses (Al-Nakib et al., 1986; Forsyth et al., in press) . Hybridization signals were recorded as very strong (+ + + +), strong (+ + +), good (+ +), positive (+), weak (?) or none. These were estimated visually by two observers in the laboratory.
