Children presenting to CHW with respiratory symptoms underwent the collection of a nasopharyngeal aspirate or a nose ⁄ throat swab according to the clinical judgement of the treating paediatrician; it was transported to the virology laboratory in viral transport medium at 4°C. Specimens were then batched and tested for respiratory viruses using Simulfluor Respiratory Screen (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA). Positive samples had influenza A confirmed with antibodies (Imagen; DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) using direct fluorescent microscopy. Samples that were negative for influenza A by direct immunofluorescence were cultured on R-Mix cells (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH, USA) at 37°C for 3 days and then labelled with antibodies to influenza A and influenza B (Imagen; DakoCytomation) using direct fluorescent microscopy. A laboratory diagnosis was defined by identification of a virus either by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or by culture fluorescence.
