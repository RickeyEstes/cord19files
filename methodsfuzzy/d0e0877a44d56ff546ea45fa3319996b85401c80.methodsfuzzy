Negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) is available only at a limited number of diagnostic laboratories and research facilities. It can be used to directly detect rotavirus or other viral particles. At least 105 virus particles/mL are required for detection by EM. If samples are to be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for EM testing, feces should be kept refrigerated, not frozen, because freezing may change morphologic characteristics of the virus.l1 Other techniques that are currently used to detect rotaviruses are cell culture and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For electrophoresis, the virus RNA is extracted from the feces and run on a gel, where an electric field causes the virus genes to migrate in characteristic patterns. PAGE is the principal technique used for serotyping rota viruses and is useful in epidemiologic studies.
