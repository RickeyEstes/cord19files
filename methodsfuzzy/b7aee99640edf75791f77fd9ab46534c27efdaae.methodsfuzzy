We used R software, version 3.4 (Foundation for Statistical Computing) to calculate frequencies and percentages for categorical trial characteristics and median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous characteristics. Disease prevalence and disease-specific DALYs were derived from the 2015 WHO global health estimates summary tables [13] . Actual enrollment or anticipated enrollment was reported and summary statistics were calculated by pooling across active and completed trials. Probable funding source (because ClinicalTrials.gov does not require funding source be reported) was attributed based on the lead sponsor and collaborator fields and reported as "industry, " "NIH" [National Institutes of Health], "U.S. federal (excluding NIH), " or "Other. " A trial was considered "industry-funded" if the lead sponsor was from industry, or if the NIH was neither a lead sponsor nor collaborator and â‰¥1 collaborator was from industry. An "NIH-funded" study required the NIH to be either a lead sponsor or a collaborator, and no industry as lead sponsor. "Other" was used to describe studies for which the lead sponsor and collaborator fields were nonmissing and did not meet criteria for either industry or NIH funding. Countries were grouped into 11 global regions to allow analysis of geographical regions.
