Plasmid DNA constructs P-encoding sequence from hPIV3 wild-type strain (DF042505) was amplified by RT-PCR (Titan One tube; Roche Applied Science) from total RNA purified from infected cells (RNeasy kit; Qiagen). Amplification was performed using the following hPIV3-P specific primers flanked with Gateway cloning sites: 59-gggga-caactttgtacaaaaaagttggcatgGAAAGCGATGCTAAAAACTATC-AAA and 59-ggggacaactttgtacaagaaagttggttaTTGGCAATTATT-GACATCTTCATTGAAC. PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) into TOPO vector. A total of 21 clones were analyzed to establish the sequence of hPIV3-P (GenBank ID: EU719627). Interestingly, 8 clones were not edited, 11 clones were edited by the addition of one G residue, and 2 clones were edited by the addition of 5 G residues. One of the plasmids containing the unedited sequence of hPIV3-P was selected and subsequently used as a template to clone hPIV3-C. DNA sequences encoding full-length hPIV3-C or fragments corresponding to AA 1-89 or 90-195 were amplified by PCR from p(hPIV3-P)-TOPO and cloned by in vitro recombination into pDONR207 (Gateway system; Invitrogen) as previously described [58] . Similarly, MV-C was amplified from p(+)MV323 that contains the full genome of measles virus wild-type strain Ichinose (kindly provided by Dr. K. Takeuchi, [59] ). Nipah-C was amplified from NiV-P plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. TF. Wild; [60] ). GRB2 coding sequence was amplified from the human spleen cDNA library used to perform the yeast two-hybrid screen (Invitrogen). The pDONR207 plasmid containing STAT1 was previously described [58] . Viral or cellular coding sequences were subsequently transferred by in vitro recombination from pDONR207 into different Gateway-compatible destination vectors (see below) following manufacturer's recommendation (LR cloning reaction, Invitrogen). To perform yeast two-hybrid experiments, coding sequences were recombined into pPC86 (Invitrogen) to be expressed in fusion downstream of the activation domain of Gal4 (Gal4-AD) or into pDEST32 to be expressed in fusion downstream of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB). In mammalian cells, GST-tag and 36FLAG-tag fusions were achieved using pDEST27 (Invitrogen) or pCI-neo-36FLAG vector, respectively [61] . We also used pCI-neo (Promega) and pmCherry-C1 (Clontech) to express proteins without a tag or in fusion downstream of Cherry, respectively. These two plasmids were made Gateway-compatible using the Gateway vector conversion system (Invitrogen).
