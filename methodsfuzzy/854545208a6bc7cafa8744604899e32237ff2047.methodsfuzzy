Construction of an NS1-expressing plasmid. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 (H5N1) viral RNA was extracted from supernatants of infected cell cultures for use as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) template for amplifying the NS1 gene. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysate using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length NS1 gene was amplified using the SuperScript III One-Step Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system with Platinum Taq High-Fidelity Polymerase (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) from H5N1 virus cDNA. The sense and antisense primers used for NS1 (EU434690) were 5'-GTG CTC GAG ATG GAT TCC AAC ACT GTG TCA-3' and 5'-CAC GGT ACC TCA AAC TTC TGA CTC AAT TGT-3', respectively. The PCR conditions were 95˚C for 15 min, followed by 34 cycles of 94˚C for 30 sec, 58˚C for 30 sec, and 72˚C for 30 sec. The cloning insert was ligated into the pMD18-T vector (D101A; Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) by quick ligase (M2200S; NEB Beijing Ltd., Beijing, China) incubating for 30 min at room temperature. pMD18-T-NS1 was subcloned into the expression plasmid pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA) (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using XhoI (D1094A) and KpnI (D1068A) (both from Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) sites to produce the recombinant HA-tagged construct, pXJ40-HA-NS1. The construction of plasmid pXJ40-HA-NS1 followed standard cloning procedures. Competent Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were transformed using pXJ40-HA-NS1 plasmids, and the plasmids were amplified and purified using a high-purity plasmid purification kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.). Clones were then screened by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence analysis using the version 3.1 BigDye Terminator ready reaction cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell line culture and transient transfection. Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H292 (Cell Bank; Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai China), were separately grown as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) at 37˚C and in a 5% CO 2 incubator. The two cell lines were used for different purposes, NCI-H1299 was used to observe the localization of the NS1 protein in the cell whereas NCI-H292 was used to confirm the extent of apoptosis induced by the NS1 protein. NCI-H1299 and NCI-H292 were transfected with pXJ40-HA-NS1 or control plasmids (pXJ40-HA-vector; Invi trogen; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc.) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc). After 4 h, Lipofectamine 2000-DNA complexes were removed, and the cell culture DMEM medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with or without 0.025 nM staurosporine (STS; Sigma-Aldrich; Merk KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37˚C for 24 h. Cells were collected after 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA solution. Immunofluorescence staining. NCI-H1299 cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and permeablized in 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature sequentially. Anti-HA serum (AH158; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) with 1:200 was used for the control and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, A-11017; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were used to probe for the NS1 protein at room temperature for 1 h. Following protein staining, anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, BD556432; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, A-21427; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were utilized to probe the NCI-H1299 cellular morphology. Finally, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, D1306; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to dye the cell nucleus at room temperature for 1 h. Triple-fluorescence stained cells were observed with a confocal microscope at a high-power magnification of x100 (FV10-ASW, version 01.07.03.00; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Cell viability assay. MTT cell viability assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Briefly, 20 µl 5 mg/ml MTT was added to the culture medium. Following incubation at 37˚C for 3 h, 100 µl acidic isopropanol (0.1 nM HCl in acidic isopropanol) was added to the NCI-H292 cells and then the absorbance of each sample was measured at 570 nm with an automated plate reader (SpectraMax Paradigm; Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) compared to the same number of control cells. Flow cytometric analysis. In order to determine the apoptotic rate, ~1x10 6 NCI-H292 cells/ml were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (556547, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, BD Pharmingen; BD Biosciences) in a volume of 100 µl on ice for 30 min in the dark. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Finally, 400 µl binding buffer was added to the cells. Additionally, the mixture was analyzed with a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer and the percentage of apoptosis of 10,000 cells was determined. The data were analyzed using BD CellQuest™ Pro software (version 5.2.1; BD Biosciences) and the percentage cells with apoptosis per group were calculated. Determination of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). At 24 h following transfection, the culture medium of the NCI-H292 cells was replaced with DMEM that did not include phenol red and was supplemented with 5 mg/l JC-1 dye (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) in the dark for 20 min at 37˚C. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in fresh medium without serum. Finally, MMP was analyzed by calculating the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 555-488 nm in triplicate. Mitochondria isolation and calculation of cytochrome c release. Cytosolic and mitochondrial isolation are performed as described by Cheng et al (16) . The percentage of cytochrome c release was calculated using the following formula: The percentage of cytochrome c release that is equal to the amount of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial supernatant/the total amount of cytochrome c in mitochondrial supernatant and pellet. Western blot analysis. Monolayers of cells transfected with DNA or untransfected cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 tablet Complete Mini protein inhibitor mixture/10 ml buffer and 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin), and the total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay. A total of 7 µl proteins with equivalent concentrations (1 µg/µl) were heated for 5 min at 100˚C in lysis buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and then resolved using 4-20% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 1% powdered skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-cytochrome c MAb mouse antibody (1:200, BD556432; BD Biosciences) was then used to probe for cytochrome c overnight at 4˚C. The membrane was also probed for GADPH (1:1,000, A2066; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was used as the loading control. Membranes were subsequently washed with 150 mM PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4˚C in 10% dried milk in PBS. Membranes were washed 5 times with PBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000, ZB2307; ZSGB BIO; OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA)., followed by visualization of positive bands with the Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) enhanced chemiluminescence procedure using Kodak BioMax film. Blots were scanned and the protein ratios were calculated using the PDQuest program (version 7.4.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The results shown are representative of 3independent experiments. Statistical analysis. In the cell viability assays and MMP experiments, all data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical significance among groups was assessed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Finally, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
