For the CRISPR-Cas system, as a large cassette of DNA/protein complex, the safety and efficiency of delivering reagents is another technical concern. The best method of delivery is transient expression of Cas protein:gRNAs or Cas mRNA:gRNA to cells. However, this method often relies on a highly technical electroporation machine and a large quantity of primary cells due to high voltage induced cell death. In addition, the in vitro expression of Cas protein and transcription of gRNA or synthesis of gRNA costs labor, work and money. Based on previous reports, the delivery vector for CRISPR-Cas contains adenoviral (AV), lentiviral (LV) and adeno associatedviral (AAV) plasmids. AV is suitable for all kinds of CRISPR-Cas systems because of its large incorporation capacity of the extra DNA fragment. It is easy to employ various engineered packaging cells to generate recombinant AV, however, the financial cost and labor intensive methods make it difficult to generate recombinant AV vector [227] . Moreover, the significant immunogenic effect in clinical usage has been addressed by the engineering of second and third generation of AV vectors [228] . On the other hand, lentiviral vector mediated CRISPR-Cas delivery has been widely used for gene targeting in both dividing and non-dividing cells, however, it still has a high risk of induction of tumorigenesis due to integration of host genome. An integrase-defective lentivirus could be a valuable choice because of the transient expression. In the case of AAV, because the packaging size is less than 4.7 kb of single-stranded DNA, it leaves little space for inserting other genetic elements when infusing SpCas9. The SaCas9 and CPF1 can be packaged into the AAV genome together with a sgRNA gene expression cassette. AAV-mediated SaCas9/sgRNA has shown to excise the integrated HIV-1 genome in vivo [23, 92] . Using AAV as a gene therapy vector has many advantages, such as low toxicity, sustained gene expression, safe and efficient delivery [22] . AAV6 was reported to transduce primary T cells and CD34 + hematopoietic cells [88] [89] [90] . In addition, AAV8 and 9 have been used to deliver Cas9/gRNAs to modify disease-causing mutations in mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suggesting the in vivo potential of Cas9 delivery by AAV. Because of the crystal structure of Cas have been explored, the subdomains of Cas could be assembled separately into AAV and reconstituted in cells. In order to deliver the CRISPR-Cas system to function in specific cells or organs, one should choose suitable inducible promoters to regulate Cas/gRNA expression in the target cells or organs.
