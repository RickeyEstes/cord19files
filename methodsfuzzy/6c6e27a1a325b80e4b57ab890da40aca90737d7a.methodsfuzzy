Experimental procedure Table 1 lists the five selected decontamination methods: (1) physical decontamination using a traditional electric rice cooker that was made in Taiwan to provide dry heat; (2) physical decontamination using an autoclave to provide moist heat, and lowtemperature chemical decontamination using (3) ethanol, (4) isopropanol and (5) bleach. All of these methods are frequently adopted in hospitals in Taiwan. In the particulate penetration test, particles were formed using a constant-output atomizer (Model 3075, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) to atomize potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (PST) solutions into polydispersed droplets [16] . The droplets were passed through a neutralizer that contained the radiation source Kr-85 (Model 3077, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN), which neutralized them to the Boltzmann equilibrium state. Finally, the neutralized aerosols were passed into a test chamber, and diluted in filtered air. The overall quality factor was calculated over a wide range of sizes from 14.6nm to 594 nm which include viral particle size range. To obtain this size range, a challenge aerosol size distribution was utilized with a CMD of 101 nm ±10 nm, and a GSD of 2.01±0.08.
