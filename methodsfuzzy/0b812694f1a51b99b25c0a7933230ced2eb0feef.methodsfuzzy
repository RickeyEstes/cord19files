We conducted a series of experiments to assess the duration of human rhinovirus infectiousness duration on fingers, as well as the impact of viral concentration on survival rates. Survival was defined as the ability of the virus to grow on HeLaOH cells after 7 days, confirmed by immunofluorescence. Experimental conditions aimed to reproduce natural conditions as far as possible.
