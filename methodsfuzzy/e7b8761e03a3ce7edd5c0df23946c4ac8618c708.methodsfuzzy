Primer and probe design: A total of 19 pathogens were selected as targets based on their virulence and prevalence on cattle. New primer-probe sets were designed for RVA, RVB, RVC, BToV, MRV, Eimeria zuernii and Eimeria bovis using the PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, U.S.A.) on the basis of consensus sequences of each pathogen obtained from the GenBank database. Primer and probe information and their target pathogens are summarized in Table 1 . Previously reported qPCR assays were used for 12 pathogen species, including RNA, DNA viruses and bacteria [7, 8, 10, 13, 15-17, 22, 23, 28, 29] . Furthermore, as an internal control within the Dembo-PCR reaction, primer-probe sets for β-actin were synthesized as previously reported [28] . All hydrolysis probes were labeled with the reporter dye FAM (6-carboxyfluorecein) at the 5′ end and the fluorescent dye TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) at the 3′ end. Primers and probes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), and probes containing a mixed base were produced at Integrated DNA Technologies (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Dembo-PCR workflow: Figure 1 depicts the Dembo-PCR workflow. After pathogen RNA and DNA were extracted, the sample, reagents, and each primer and probe were mixed in individual reaction tubes. Samples were applied at 2 µl per tube. Cycling conditions, reagents and nucleic acid extraction procedures are described below. To verify the absence of nucleic acid loss during the extraction step, the extraction liquids used in the QIAGEN and Roche kits were analyzed as samples using β-actin primer-probe sets. Furthermore, PCR products were used as β-actin positive controls, which were created from Mardin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells using conventional PCR primers (data not shown). Nuclease-free water was applied as a negative control sample, again using β-actin primer-probe sets. To prepare each sample for assay, 10% fecal suspensions were made in PBS (−). Then, 200 µl of a suspension was used directly for the extraction of bacteria and protozoa nucleic acids with a QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). For virus detection, 200 µl of a suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 rpm, and viral DNA and RNA were extracted from the supernatant of the 200 µl of suspension with a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Both nucleic acid extraction procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. A LightCycler Nano (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was used for all qPCR reactions performed in this study. A one step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real time) (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan) was used for amplification of extracts from RNA viruses, and Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real time) (TaKaRa Bio) was used for amplification of extracts from DNA viruses, bacteria and protozoa. All reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 µl, which contained the sample nucleic acid, primers, probes (the final concentration of all primers and probes was 0.2 µM) and all other components included in the kits, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 45°C for 5 min and 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 20 sec. Fluorescence data were analyzed automatically using The software excluded early cycle data up to 16, and the number of minimum relative amplifications was permuted at zero. Evaluation of real-time PCR performance using synthesized DNA: For the purpose of validation, real-time PCR reliability, sensitivity and linearity of standard curves were verified by testing tenfold serial dilutions of synthesized DNA, including each target genome sequence (1 × 10°-1 × 10 6 or 5 × 10°-5 × 10 6 copies/reaction). The synthesized DNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Pathogen dilutions were repeated twice in separate runs, and a standard curve was constructed from the Cq values. The PCR efficiency (E) was calculated using the standard curve slope according to the following formula: E=(10 -1/slope (−1)). The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) was also calculated. Sensitivity test on fecal samples: The fecal samples included some PCR inhibitors, such as sugars and bile acid [9, 21] . To evaluate the PCR sensitivity of this assay in fecal specimens, each pathogen was spiked into feces collected from healthy cattle and subsequently subjected to real-time PCR after DNA and RNA extraction. Feces collected from healthy cattle were used for a spike test. Bacteria (1.0 × 10 5 CFU/ml) were prepared by mixing with a fecal suspension, and viruses (1.0 × 10 5 TCID 50 or PFU/ml) were prepared by mixing with the supernatant after centrifugation of a fecal suspension. Tenfold serial dilutions of fecal suspension and supernatant spiked with viruses or bacteria, respectively, were made in PBS (−) within a range of 1.0 × 10 1 to 10 5 CFU, TCID 50 or PFU/ml. Pathogens were subjected to DNA and RNA extraction using a total elution volume of 25 µl with the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit and 20 µl with the QIAamp fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. Extracted DNA and RNA were analyzed by Dembo-PCR. The amounts of viruses and bacteria were 1.6 × 10 −1 to 10 3 TCID 50 (PFU)/reaction and 1.3 × 10 −1 to 10 3 CFU/reaction, respectively. MRV, BCoV, RVA, RVB, RVC, Salmonella Typhimurium and 2 species of protozoa could not be analyzed in regard to the sensitivity of fecal samples by Dembo-PCR, because pathogens or infectious materials were not available. In the case of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), provirus DNA extracted from BLV-infected lymphocytes was used in this study. To analyze the sensitivity of each primer and probe for these pathogens in fecal samples, synthesized DNA or BLV proviral DNA was spiked into nucleic acid solutions extracted from healthy feces. The final concentrations of synthesized DNA and BLV proviral DNA were 1.0 × 10° to 10 6 and 1.08 × 10° to 10 3 copies/reaction, respectively. The concentration of BLV proviral DNA was equivalent to the Tax gene copy number calculated using a commercial kit for quantification of the BLV Tax gene (TaKaRa Bio). The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest concentration at which a fluorescent signal could be detected in all reactions. Reproducibility (inter-assay variance) was assessed using the coefficient value (CV) calculated on the basis of Cq values. Clinical samples: In January 2014, an outbreak of diarrhea occurred on a dairy farm in Japan. Six adult cattle were affected by diarrhea and weak. To identify the cause of diarrhea, 6 diarrheal fecal samples and 1 healthy fecal sample, which was collected from a healthy cow at the same farm, were analyzed by Dembo-PCR. In addition, 1 calf was affected by diarrhea at the same farm in March 2014. A fecal sample was collected from this calf and was also analyzed.
