The epicentre in Wuhan is comprised of an urban area spanning 1,528 km 2 and exceeds 11 million residents. This area was quarantined on 23rd January 2020. Subsequent viral spread led to the imposition of a cordon sanitaire, restricting movement across Hubei Province in 16 cities, affecting 50 million people [42] . All forms of public transportation including long-distance bus routes, metros, express railways, and aviation were uncompromisingly sealed off -a process facilitated by China's mega city-region infrastructure [43] . In addition, Chinese New Year celebrations were subdued amid an unprecedented national lockdown to prevent the amplification of viral spread [44] . Despite the implementation of restrictions on trade and trading routes representing an effective method of curbing viral spread [45] , WHO recommendations continue to advise against the enforcement of restrictions to travel and trade [46] . To halt further viral spread, a Â¥1 billion fund from China's Finance Ministry was used to facilitate the construction of two new hospitals in under two weeks in Wuhan [47] . Outside of China, aviation restrictions are being employed. In Europe, the Czech Republic, Greece, and Italy have recently suspended visa issuance and all air traffic from mainland China [48] . US airlines have also suspended flights until early spring [49] . Local exit screening conducted by healthcare professionals at airports is currently recommended by WHO [46] , and multiple countries (Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, India, Italy, and Singapore) have initiated temperature and symptom screening protocols [50] . Several countries (UK, US, and Australia) are also quarantining citizens having recently been evacuated from Wuhan [51] [52] [53] . Notably, significant concerns are currently focused towards Africa which may be least prepared should an outbreak ensue [46] . Evidently, an exponential increase in case count may dampen concerted containment efforts.
