Strain SAG 1224-5/27 of Euglena gracilis obtained from the SAG Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen was maintained axenic in liquid culture medium Eg. Cultures were transferred weekly. Cells were kept in incubator at 15 • C at a light:dark cycle of 12:12 h under a cold white LED illumination with an irradiance of about 50 µmol · m −2 · s −1 . An Olympus IX 81 inverted microscope with motorized stage was employed in all the experiments. Experiments were performed at the Sensing and Moving Bioinspired Artifacts Laboratory of SISSA. The microscope was equipped with a LCAch 20X Phc objective (NA 0.40) for the imaging of cells trapped at the tip of a glass capillary using transmitted brightfield illumination. The intermediate magnification changer (1.6 X) of the microscope was exploited to achieve higher magnification. Micrographs were recorded at a frame rate of 1, 000 fps with a Photron FASTCAM Mini UX100 high-speed digital camera. Tapered capillaries of circular cross section were obtained from borosilicate glass tubes by employing a micropipette puller and subsequently fire polished. At each trial observation a glass capillary was filled with a diluted solution of cells and fixed to the microscope stage by means of a custom made, 3d-printed holder. The holder allowed for keeping the capillary in place and rotating it about its axis, so as to image a cell specimen from distinct viewpoints. Cells were immobilized at the tip of the capillary by applying a gentle suction pressure via a syringe connected to the capillary by plastic tubing.
