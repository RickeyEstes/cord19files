The methodological framework of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. The productivity of the cattle production system under "status quo" scenario was compared with the productivity under alternative scenarios corresponding to different levels of BRD incidence rate reduction (namely 20%, 50% and 100%) in different compartments of the cattle production system. Details of the productivity assessment are in Material and Methods part 2.1. The model used to estimate the productivity of the cattle production system is based on the Livestock Production Efficiency Calculator (LPEC) [17] . The productivity of the cattle industry, as measured by the model, is the ratio of the value of its production and the quantity of metabolizable energy (ME) it requires, the latter being a critical resource input to any livestock system and one that needs to be optimised in terms of environmental impact assessments as the energy source is a proxy for water and land use. A literature review was performed beforehand to (i) identify the cattle production parameters significantly affected by BRD, (ii) quantify the effect of BRD on the selected cattle production parameters and (iii) estimate the current BRD incidence rates, production parameters, market prices of cattle products, variable farming costs (apart from feed) and veterinary costs associated with BRD cases in the French cattle production system (Fig 1) . Details of the literature review are in Material and Methods part 1. Based on these data, production parameters of cattle affected and not affected by BRD during their production period were estimated, as described in Material and Methods part 2.2.
