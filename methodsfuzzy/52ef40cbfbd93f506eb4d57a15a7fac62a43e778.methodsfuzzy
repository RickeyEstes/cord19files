Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200 to 250 g (supplied by Experimental Animal Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University) were used. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). Experimental design. Rats were exposed to the whole smoke of 15 commercial, nonfilter cigarettes (Five Oxen, Chengdu Cigarette Factor, China, per cigarette contains nicotine 1 mg and tar 14 mg) in ventilated whole-body smoking chambers (70 cm× 50 cm × 50 cm) for 30 minutes each time, twice per day for up to 6 months as previously described ) with minor modifications. The smoke total particulate matter (TPM) concentration inside the exposure chambers was 250 ± 26 mg/m 3 , determined by gravimetric analysis of filters at the exhaust port for the duration of the exposure. The control groups were exposed to fresh air under similar conditions. All rats were treated once a day, by oral gavage, with either saline or 10 mg/kg losartan or 30 mg/kg losartan 0.5 hour before the first smoke exposure each day. Hemodynamic analysis. After an observation of 6 months, rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg i.p.) and were placed in a supine position, breathing room air. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was measured as previously described (Ferreira et al., 2009) . The cannula, filled with heparin-saline solution (50 U/ml), was gently introduced through the right external jugular vein down to the right ventricle. The RVSP was recorded using a miniature liquid pressure transducer (Biopac System Inc., USA) and a computerized data acquisition system (MP150, Biopac System Inc., USA). Data was obtained from steady-state waveform for 5 minutes. Histological analysis and tissue preparation. After the RVSP measurement, all rats were killed by exanguination via external iliac artery and the lungs were harvested. The right lung was fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde (pH 7.4) overnight for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and histological staining. The left lung was dissected, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80°C for biochemical analysis. The paraffin sections (4 µm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and van Gieson's elastic stain. Assessment of vascular morphology was carried out as previously described (Kishi et al., 2006) . Briefly, the medial wall thickness (MWT) in fully muscularized arteries with an external diameter of 50 to 100 µm was evaluated by calculating the percentage of medial wall thickness as (medial thickness × 2 / external diameter) × 100% along the shortest curvature. At least 10 muscular arteries per section were examined using Image Plus 5.0 System (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA) in a blinded fashion by a skilled investigator. For the immunohistochemical detection of ACE2, the sections were stained with anti-rat ACE2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Images were acquired by an optical microscope (H600, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a RT SPOT digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Western blotting analysis of ACE2 and ACE in lung homogenates. Lung homogenates were prepared in lysis buffer, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, USA) as previously described ). The protein concentration in the lung homogenate was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equivalent amounts of protein samples (30 µg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto 0.45 µM polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of ACE2 polyclonal antibody and a 1:1000 dilution of ACE polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Ang II levels. Tissue Ang II levels were measured by iodine-125 radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the Ang II RIA kit (Beijing North Institute of Biological Technology, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (Chen et al., 2002) . Briefly, lung tissue was washed with cold saline, minced and heated in 0.1 M HCl at 100°C for 10 minutes, and then homogenized. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 minutes, the supernatant was lyophilized and redissolved in 400 μl assay buffer, and the radioactivity was measured by a γ counter. Measurement of ACE2 levels and cell proliferation in cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from control and smoke-exposed rats. Segments of pulmonary arteries were obtained from lungs of SD rats exposed to fresh air or cigarette smoke for 3 months or 6 months. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were isolated and cultured as previously described (Ogawa et al., 2005) with minor modifications. The arteries were excised and isolated, cut into small pieces and immersed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1 mg of collagenase for 15 minutes. The endothelium and adventitia were gently removed. And the remainder of the vascular tissues was placed in culture plates. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. And cell immunostaining was performed to confirm that cells were smooth muscle cells with anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers, Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA). For the detection of ACE2 in PASMCs, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer as described above in the ACE2 and ACE assay in lung homogenates. Equivalent amounts of total protein (20 μg/sample) were analyzed by Western blot with ACE2 antibody. Cell proliferation was assessed by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation as previously reported (Ogawa et al., 2005) . When PASMCs were cultured to reach to 90% confluence, cells were detached, seeded and grown for 16 hours at a first density of 10 × 10 5 cells/ml. Subsequently, cells were incubated in low-serum culture media (DMEM, 0.1% FBS) to be kept quiescent for 24 hours. Then, DX600 (0.1 μM), an ACE2 inhibitor purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA, USA) was added to the culture media of the cells from cigarette smoke-exposed rats. In another 24 hours of incubation, cells were labeled with [ 3 H]-thymidine at 1 mCi/ml for the last 3 hours. Then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 5% trichloroacetic acid, and 95% ethanol, followed by lysis in 0.5 M NaOH. Finally, aliquots of cell lysates were neutralized with HCl, and the radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Measurement of cell proliferation and ACE2 levels in cigarette smoke extract-challenged rat PASMCs. An extract of cigarette smoke in DMEM was prepared freshly for each experiment. Commercial, nonfilter cigarettes (the same cigarettes as used in Experimental design) were used. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared as previously described (Oltmanns et al., 2005 ) with a few modifications. Briefly, cigarette smoke derived from one cigarette was drawn slowly into a 50-ml syringe and bubbled through 5 ml of DMEM. And one cigarette yielded 5 draws of 50 ml of the syringe, with each individual draw taking approximately 10 seconds to complete. The resulting solution, which represented "100%" strength, was then adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated NaOH and filtered before being diluted in DMEM to the required strength for application to PASMCs cultures. Cell growth was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan). PASMCs from control rats were plated in 96-well microplates at a first density of 2 × 10 4 cells/ml per well. Before experiment, cells were incubated in low-serum culture media (DMEM, 0.1% FBS) to be kept quiescent for 24 hours. Then cells were left untreated or pretreated with 1 μM or 10 μM losartan for 30 minutes before exposure to 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, or 8% CSE for 24 hours, respectively. After addition of 10 μl of the CCK-8 reagent and 2 hours of incubation, the plates were read at 450 nm in a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and each experimental condition was repeated at least in quintuplicate wells in each experiment. ACE2 levels were measured by Western blotting analysis as mentioned above. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using either Student's t test (for two-group comparison) or one-way ANOVA (for multiple-group comparison) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) test (SPSS for Windows version 13.0, Chicago, USA). A value of P b 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values were expressed as means ± SD.
