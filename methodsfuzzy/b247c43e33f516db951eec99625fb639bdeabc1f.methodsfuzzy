Viral nucleic acid was extracted using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A starting volume of 200 mL was used to elute 60 mL of viral RNA/DNA, and 5 mL of this eluate was used for each PCR reaction, with a 25 mL final reaction volume. PCR for respiratory viruses was performed using "in house" real-time Taqman PCR and RT-PCR. Briefly, four panels were used, a pentaplex and three additional multiplex real-time PCR assays: panel 1 (influenza A, A(H1), A(H3), B, internal control), panel 2 (RSV A/B, HPIVs types 1/3, adenovirus), panel 3 (HPIVs types 2/4, enterovirus, rhinovirus, HMPV), panel 4 (HCoVs group 1 (229E, NL63), HCoVs group 2 (OC43, HKU1)) (Ellis and Curran, 2011; Clark et al., 2014 Clark et al., , 2015 . Superscript TM III Platinum one-step enzyme (Invitrogen) was used for the reverse transcription. All assays shared identical amplification conditions (50 C for 30 min, 95 C for 2 min, 45 cycles at 95 C for 15 s, and 60 C for 1 min), allowing all four panels to run simultaneously on the same instrument. An additional monoplex assay specific for HBoV was also included in this study (Table 1) . Amplification and detection of PCR products were performed using the Rotorgene TM PCR system (Qiagen) acquiring the fluorescence on FAM, JOE, CY5, and ROX channels at each cycle. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water) were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4,600 pfu per extraction) prior to nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors. Positive controls for all panels were made from a combination of recombinant plasmids and from known positive specimens, diluted to give a cycle threshold value of 20-25. In a second phase of the study, "in house" TaqMan array cards (Steensels et al., 2015) were used for several respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria in severe cases. The cards included adenovirus, HBoV, influenza A(H1, H3, H7, H9) and B, HPIVs 1/4, RSV, enterovirus, rhinovirus, HMPV, HCoVs, Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Coxiella burnetii. To confirm the L. pneumophila cards results, an "in house" real-time PCR was also used (Welti et al., 2003) . Influenza positive samples were sent to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory for virus isolation and characterization. Virus isolation was performed in MDCK-Siat1 cell line (WHO, 2011) . Antigenic characterization was accomplished by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) using reference viruses and monoclonal antiserums gently provided by WHO (2014) collaborating for European region. HIA was performed with guinea pig red blood cells. Isolated viruses were compared with 2013/14 and 2014/15 A (H3) vaccine strains, genetic groups reference strains and circulating viruses (ECDC, 2014 (ECDC, , 2015 , genetic analysis was based on the HA1 subunit of the viral hemagglutinin gene. Nucleotide sequence assembly was carried out using the Seqman program (Lasergene99 package, DNASTAR) and for multiple alignments of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences the MEGA Software 6.0. Module (Tamura et al., 2013) .
