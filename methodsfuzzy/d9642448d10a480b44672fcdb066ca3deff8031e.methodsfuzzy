In this study, cervical cancer incidence and mortality data were derived from several national registries. Population numbers during 1991 -2007 were obtained from National Household Registry profiles (Department of Household Registration, 1991 -2007 ; this was found to be complete (99.3%) according to the 2000 census in Taiwan (Chen and Liu, 2002) . National Cancer Registry in Taiwan was launched in 1979 to collect information of all incident cancer cases from hospitals with 50 or more beds. It was considered a complete and accurate registry with a percentage of cases based on death certificate only (DCO) as low as 3.9% in 2000 and 1.8% in 2005. The DCO percentage for cervical cancer was o1% after 2000, and the percentage of morphological verification of cervical cancer was more than 90% after 2002 (Taiwan Cancer Registry Task Force, 1991 -2006 . The numbers of incident cases of cervical cancer The National Health Insurance was implemented in Taiwan in 1995, covering 90 -98% of the general population; it started to reimburse annual conventional Pap smear for women over 30 years of age in 1995. The National Cervical Cancer Screening Registry was also launched in 1995 to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the programme. All Pap smears were reviewed according to 2001 Bethesda system (Solomon et al, 2002) , and any high-grade lesion or worse detected was automatically referred to the follow-up system. Registration of the Pap test records was mandatory, and 24 million screening records were reported from 100 laboratories from 1995 to 2007. There were 5.6 million eligible women who participated in the screening programme at least once. Annual, triennial, and 5-year numbers of screening participants were derived from the NCCSR profiles during 1995 -2007.
