Mice . Weanling BALB/cAnNCr, A/JCr, C3H/HeJCr (Lps d ), C3H/HeNCr (Lps"), CBA/NCr (Xid), and CBA/JCr mice from the National Cancer Institute breeding facility at Frederick, Maryland, and 10-week-old A/J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) were received in filter-ported crates . BALB/cPt (/tysls) and 20th generation C .D2 ldh-1°-Pep3 b (/ty'"') mice' congenic for a portion of chromosome 1 known to include the /ty locus24 were bred from stock graciously provided by Dr Michael Potter . All mice were maintained in microisolator cages (Lab Products, Aberdeen, MD) with sterile food, water and bedding . Sera from mice of each strain were screened for antibodies to MHV, Sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse rotavirus, pneumonia virus of mice, Reovirus 3, Theiler's GD-VII virus, minute virus of mice, K virus, mouse pox virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis by Charles Rivers Professional Services (Wilmington, MA) to verify that they were free of these pathogens before experiments began . At the end of about every other experiment, sera from MHV-infected and control mice were screened as above to verify that MHV cross-contamination did not occur between experimental groups and that experiments were not compromised by other pathogens . Unless otherwise noted, mice were used at 9-16 weeks of age . Experimental groups contained five or six mice, except for the data presented in Figs 1, 2 and 7 in which three mice per group were used . Virus . Frozen aliquots (-70°C) of fourth passage mouse hepatitis virus strain UAB (MHV-UAB) were thawed just prior to use in all experiments . This murine coronavirus is a field strain whose isolation has been previously described . 25 Experimental mice were inoculated intranasally with virus . Titration studies in A/JCr mice indicate that 1 pfu of MHV-UAB is equivalent to 1000 Seroconversion 50 units (a 1 unit dose would cause seroconversion to MHV in 50% of mice) . Control mice received an equal volume of sterile medium intranasally in place of MHV . Salmonella . Virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SR-11 was used in all experiments . Frozen aliquots (-70'C) of bacteria from a single late log phase broth culture were thawed and suspended in sterile saline just prior to injection . Mice were injected with salmonella suspended in 200,ul of sterile saline via tail vein . Effect of MHV on resistance to salmonella . In experiments mice were divided into experimental groups which were infected first with MHV, then with salmonella, and control groups which were treated identically except sterile medium was substituted for MHV . The number of salmonella cfu in spleens and livers was individually determined . Each organ was homogenized in cold saline with a Stomacher tissue homogenizer (Tekmar Company, Cincinatti, OH), further diluted in cold saline, then plated on Brain-Heart Infusion agar on 5% sheep blood agar (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD) . The number of salmonella recovered from organs was expressed as a base ten logarithm .
