Satisfactory extraction efficiency was obtained by comparing water-refluxing, ultrasonic, and soxhlet extraction methods. Refluxing extraction was simpler and more effective for nucleosides and glucosinolates among the other methods. Therefore, this method was used in further experiments. In this study, different concentrations (0%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%) of ethanol solutions, sample-solvent ratios (1:10, 1:20, 1:50, and 1:100, w/v), and extraction times (20, 30, 45 , and 60 min) were used for the BLG extraction procedure (Batch No. 20101121). As a result, the best extraction condition was established as follows: the samples were extracted by refluxing extraction using 20 mL of water as the extraction solvent, and the duration was 30 min. The method was validated in terms of linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, reproducibility, stability, and recovery test. The method was validated for linearity, LOD, LOQ, precision, reproducibility, stability, and accuracy following the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline and several reports on determination analysis [36, 38] .
