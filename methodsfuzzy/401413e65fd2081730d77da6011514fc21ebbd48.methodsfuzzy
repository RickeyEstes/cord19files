2.1.1.2. FM019 and FM020. On 12 March 2009 two new Sand cats, a 1-year-old male FM019 and a 2-year-old female FM020, were acquired from a nearby collection where they had been born in captivity. The animals were quarantined at the BCEAW for 6 weeks during which they were observed for signs of illness and examined once under anesthesia. Hematologic and biochemical evaluations were done at that time but no abnormal blood values were seen, and viral testing for FeLV and FIV (SensPERT kits, Combined FeLV Antigen/FIV antibody test, Vet All Laboratories, Korea) were negative. They were also seronegative for T. gondii antibodies (see serology section) on blood samples drawn on 4 April 2009. After their quarantine period, the animals were moved to a display enclosure in the zoo. In this enclosure Gordon's wildcats of which several had antibodies to T. gondii (Pas and Dubey, 2008b) had previously been housed. Shortly after it was noticed that the female FM020 was not eating well, but this was attributed to the rather low temperatures in the cage, which is regulated with air-conditioning. The animal received a general examination and blood was collected under sedation with medetomidine (0.05 mg/kg, Domitor, Orion Pharma, Finland). Liver enzymes ALT and AST were slightly increased (AST 110.2 U/l and ALT 144.2 U/l) as well as urea (19 mmol/l) but with a normal creatinine (60 mol/l). All other hematology and biochemistry val- ues tested were in normal range. No further abnormalities could be detected during examination and her weight was as expected. Radiographs of the thorax and abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities either. Apart from some subcutaneous fluid during the procedure, no other treatment was indicated and since it was thought that the low temperature might have been the reason for the inappetance, only environmental changes were made. This cat is now apparently healthy. A blood sample was obtained from cat FM020 on 15 July 2009 for T. gondii antibodies. Four weeks later her male cage mate FM019 looked depressed and ate less than normal. He was hand caught to perform an examination but during normal restraint and handling to take radiographs he developed a severe dyspnoea, collapsed and died on 15 June 2009. A necropsy was performed on the same day. 2.1.1.3. FM002. Cat FM002 was imported from the USA in 1998 at the age of 3 years. In 2006 a blood sample was taken and the T. gondii antibody titer was determined with a latex agglutination test at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, using a commercial kit (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan), which showed a positive titer of >512. Testing for FIV, FeLV and FeCoV were negative at that time. In 2007 he started to show signs of ataxia in the hind legs and a slight head tilt. A full examination under sedation revealed no obvious abnormalities but hematology results revealed a severe increase in globulins (80 g/l) and proteinuria. Because of previous problems in the Sand cats with toxoplasmosis infection, the animal was started on clindamycin (Dalacin C TM , Pharmacia, Puurs, Belgium) at 20 mg/kg twice daily for 32 days. Clinical signs improved slowly but the animal never completely recovered and remained slightly ataxic. Behavioural changes indicated that he also might have had impaired vision and a full ophthalmological examination was performed which revealed an inactive chorioretinitis with partial degeneration of the retina. In February 2010 the condition of this cat deteriorated quickly. He was anorexic, had diarrhoea and had severe difficulties walking. A full examination revealed a severely extended bladder without obstruction and general mus- cle atrophy. A urine examination revealed proteinuria, but no bacterial growth. Blood samples revealed an increased urea (14.7 mmol/l) with a normal creatinine (95 mol/l). X-rays showed some consolidated areas in the frontal lung lobes, round shaped kidneys and a severe scoliosis of the thoracic vertebrae with bone demineralization. Because of the poor condition of the animal, and its old age, the cat was euthanized.
