Construction of plasmids. Two DNA fragments, corresponding to nt 1-1720 and 1626-2934 of SARS-CoV spike gene, were kindly pro-vided by Prof. Z.H. Yuan (Molecular Virology Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai). The DNA fragment encoding N-terminal amino acid residues 1-690 of S glycoprotein, flanked by the ÔKozakÕ consensus sequence, was amplified from the two DNA fragments with the approach of splice overlap extension-polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR), and inserted into the multi-cloning site of a eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) between its SalI and PstI sites. The resulting plasmid was named pEGFP-S, in which enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene was located downstream of S gene. Identity of S gene to the published sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY278554) was confirmed by sequencing (Bioasia, Shanghai). Some of the nucleotides encoding the amino acid residues 1-110 of S glycoprotein in the plasmid pEGFP-S were optimized utilizing mammalian preferred codons, creating the plasmid pEGFP-optS. Design and transcription of siRNAs. The siRNAs corresponding to SARS-CoV spike gene were designed according to AmbionÕs siRNA design guidelines. Scramble siRNA [17] and EGFP siRNA [18] were used as negative and positive controls for silencing, respectively. All sequences of the siRNAs were BLAST searched in the National Center for Biotechnology InformationÕs (NCBI) ''search for short nearly exact matches'' mode against all human sequences deposited in the GenBank and RefSeq databases, and were not found to have significant homology to genes other than the targets. The template deoxynucleotides (Table 1 ) used for siRNA transcription were synthesized by Bioasia, Shanghai. The oligonucleotide directed production of siRNAs with T7 RNA polymerase has been described previously [18] . For each transcription reaction, 300 lM of each oligonucleotide template and T7 promoter primer were mixed and denaturalized by heating at 95°C for 2 min. The mixture was then added with 10· Klenow reaction buffer, dNTP mix (Promega, USA), Exo-Klenow (TaKaRa, Dalian), and nuclease-free water, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The in vitro transcription was performed in 20 ll transcription mix: 6 ll hybridization solution, 4 ll of 5· T7 reaction buffer, 6 ll rNTP mix, 2 ll T7 RNA polymerase, and 2 ll nuclease-free water. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, sense and antisense RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both crude transcription reactions and incubating at 37°C overnight. The concentration of the generated dsRNA was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). S1 nuclease and RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 1 U/lg siRNA, respectively, for the digestion of ssRNA and dsDNA. SiRNAs were assessed by RNA gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose. Purification of siRNAs. The in vitro transcribed siRNA was added with one volume of TE-saturated (pH 4.5) phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and spun at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The upper, aqueous phase was collected to a fresh tube, mixed with one volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The upper, aqueous phase was then mixed with two volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 mmol/L sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and placed on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at Table 1 Sequences of template deoxynucleotides for siRNAs used for target genes 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol and suspended in nuclease-free water for further use. The purity and integrity of siRNAs were checked on an agarose gel. Cell culture and transfection. Human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK) 293T cells were grown at 37°C in DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium (DMEM) (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL, USA) supplemented with L L-glutamine (1 mM), streptomycin (100 lg/ml), and penicillin (100 U/ml). Twentyfour hours prior to transfection, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 0.5-2 · 10 5 cells/well with fresh medium (500 ll/ well) without antibiotics. For the transfection of adherent HEK 293T cells, a total of 0.8 lg of plasmid DNA or/and 2 ll of siRNA mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA, USA) were used according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. The cells were incubated at 37°C for various time lengths for gene transcription and expression. The expression of S-EGFP fusion protein was observed directly under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence and flow cytometry analysis. Expression of S-EGFP in transfected cells was examined with fluorescence microscope (Olympus CK40, Japan) at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection. For flow cytometry analysis of S-EGFP expression, the cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection and digested with 0.25% trypsin, washed with PBS twice, and then resuspended in PBS to measure the fluorescence using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with filters (emission, 507 nm; excitation, 488 nm). Samples (about 10 6 cells each) were counted and analyzed with CellQuest software, using nontransfected HEK 293T cells as control. The values were calculated as the percentage of the cell population that exceeded the fluorescence intensity of the control cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of this population. Reverse transcription-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA from the transfected or non-transfected cells was extracted at 48 h posttransfection using RNAex Reagent (Watson, Shanghai) and digested with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian). One microgram of the RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dT) 15 and the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase XL (TaKaRa, Dalian) according to manufacturerÕs recommendations. Reactions with no reverse transcriptase added were performed in parallel with most experiments and yielded no PCR products. 1 lM of forward primer (5 0 -CCCATGGGTACACAGACACA-3 0 ) and reverse primer (5 0 -AATAGGCTGCAGCTGACGTG-3 0 ) for SARS-CoV spike gene was used for semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with 20 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 55 s), annealing (56°C, 55 s), and extension (72°C, 1 min). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control, the primers (forward primer, 5 0 -TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3 0 ; reverse primer, 5 0 -AAGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAAT-3 0 ) were synthesized based on the human GAPDH mRNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. BC013310). Its reaction conditions were 25 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 50 s), annealing (60°C, 30 s), and extension (72°C, 30 s). Then real-time quantitative PCR (Lightcycler, Roche) was performed as described [19] using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian) with the following exceptions. Briefly, reactions were carried out in 20 ll volumes containing 2 ll reverse transcription product. To quantitate SARS-CoV spike gene transcript levels, dilutions of cDNA from the HEK 293T cells transfected with pEGFP-optS were always run in parallel with cDNA from the transfected HEK 293T cells for use as standard curve (dilutions ranged from 10 6 -10 0 copies of each plasmid). To perform analysis of relative expression of SARS-CoV spike gene using real-time PCR, we adopted the relative quantitative method [20] , by normalizing to GAPDH expression levels. Then the percentages of SARS-CoV spike mRNA in siRNAs co-transfected cells relative to that in mock-transfected cells were calculated. The primers for GAPDH were the same as described above. The primers used for the amplification of SARS-CoV spike gene were 5 0 -TCTGATGCCTTT TCGCTTGA-3 0 (forward primer) and 5 0 -GTGCCCCAAATGTCTT GAGC-3 0 (reverse primer). Western blotting. The transfected or non-transfected cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100, 1 lg/ml aprotinin, and 100 lg/ml PMSF). Equal amounts of total proteins were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, CA). After blocking non-specific-binding sites with 5% non-fat milk, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies used in this experiment were: anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:500 dilution) and anti-b-actin goat monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:500 dilution). After washing, the blot was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG, respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the 5-bromo-4-chioro-3-indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/ NBT) substrate (Sino-American, Shanghai) and the luminol/enhancer chemiluminescent substrate (ECL) kit (PFBIO, Shanghai), respectively.
