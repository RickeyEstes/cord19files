A total of 61 patients residing in China who agreed to participate in this study and who had not received androgen and radiation therapies were randomly selected. Ages of patients ranged from 55 to 76 years old with a mean of 62. All cases with symptomatic BPH, enlarged prostates and no evidence of prostate cancer were diagnosed by ultrasonography, history of dysuria, residual urine and urine flow ratio (UFR) measurements and urinary cystoscopy. All patients were investigated by the Institute of Basic Theory, Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and observed in randomised and controlled clinical trials with the scheme approved by the Medical Ethics Forum of China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
