Plasmids, cells and transfection. Human codon optimized Vpu genes derived from HIV-1 strain NL4-3 (P05923: MQPIQIAIAA 10 LVVAIIIAIV 20 VWSIVIIEYR 30 KILRQRKIDR 40 LIDRLIERAE 50 DSGNESEGEI 60 SALVEMGVEM 70 GHHAPWDIDD 80 L) were synthesized by multiple overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the expression vector pTT-strep-his8 harboring a thrombin cleavage site for removing the tags. The cytoplasm domain mutants of single mutated Vpu, Vpu-S52D and -S56D, as well as double mutated Vpu, Vpu-S52/56D and Vpu-S52/56N were generated by quick-change site-directed mutagenesis and overlapping PCR respectively, by standard methods using the Phusion-II polymerase (New England BioLabs). For the single mutants, the second serine site is still available for phosphorylation during protein expression. Vpu with the mutations was also expressed using the vector pTT-strep-his8. All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. The helix was bent around residues Glu-28 to Ile-32 so that the helical stretch from residues Leu-33 to Ser-52 aligned with the membrane surface as described earlier 30 . Asp-39 was pointing towards the bilayer surface and Arg-48 was pointing into the aqueous phase, according to experimental findings 43 Supplementary Fig. S2 ) was chosen to generate full-length Vpu 1-81 .
