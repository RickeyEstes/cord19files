In order to investigate the extent of bushmeat use, the contribution of the resource to human livelihoods, as well as the drivers and implications of overexploitation, a comprehensive review of the literature was conducted between August 2014 and February 2015, the process of which is mapped in Fig. 1 . Search terms and Boolean search operators were firstly used to explore published and peer-reviewed literature indexed in the bibliographic databases Science Direct, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, EBSCO Host and Web of Science. A general search ("bushmeat" OR "bush meat" OR "wild meat") was conducted at the outset, with the number of 'hits' in each database being recorded (Fig. 1) . Due to the unmanageable number of publications returned using this strategy, more targeted searches were conducted by modifying the search strings to include keywords associated with each of the five major themes addressed in the paper (Fig. 1) . The 'grey' literature was also explored using similar search terms in Google, so as to identify relevant theses and dissertations, working papers, project documents and other unpublished materials. The titles and keywords of the captured literature sources were evaluated to ascertain their relevance, where after the abstracts or executive summaries of those passing through this first review stage were further screened. More detailed review allowed refinement to 250 key literature sources, the findings of which are integrated throughout the current paper. It is important to note that, while a global outlook was sought throughout, the focus of the paper did inevitably fall on those regions in which bushmeat harvesting, consumption and trade are the highest, since this is where most research efforts have been placed to date.
