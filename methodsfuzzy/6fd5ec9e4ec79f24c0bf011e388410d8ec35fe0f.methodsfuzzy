We retrospectively studied 15 alloSCT patients treated with etanercept for SR-aGVHD at the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute between January 2009 and April 2013. The institutional review board approved the transplantation protocols, and all patients provided informed consent for stem cell transplantation and data collection. None of the transplant donors were form a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed consent that was freely given. According to underlying disease and age, patients received either myeloablative, non-myeloblative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (conditioning intensities according to Bacigalupo [11] ). Transplants were unmanipulated grafts form HLA-identical siblings (SIB) or at least 7/8 (A, B, C, DRB1) HLA-matched unrelated donors (MUD). Patients without a suitable SIB or MUD received an umbilical cord blood transplantation. In case of umbilical cord blood (UCB), a double UCB transplantation was performed using two at least 4/6 (A, B, DRB1) matched cord blood units. Acute GVHD: Prophylaxis, diagnosis, treatment and response criteria Standard aGVHD prophylaxis for all allograft recipients included cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) or its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). In case of a 7/8 HLA matched MUD, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was added to the conditioning regimen. Levels of CsA were measured by high performance liquid chromatography on whole blood samples and aimed at trough levels of 250-350 Î¼g/L. Acute GVHD was graded according to the modified Glucksberg criteria [12] , and the diagnosis of aGVHD was preferably confirmed by histology of involved tissues. First-line treatment for grade II to IV aGVHD consisted of prednisolone 2mg/kg/day and CsA or MPA/MMF. Grade I aGVHD was treated with topical steroids. Steroid refractoriness (SR) was defined as either progressive disease (PD) or mixed response (MR) after 7-14 days of first-line treatment, no response/stable disease (SD) after 10 days, or progression of initial partial response (PR) after 10 days of treatment.
