All commensal E. coli strains were cultured onto Mueller-Hinton agar after adjustment to 0.5 McFarland standards. Antimicrobial discs containing cefotaxime (30 μg), cefotaxime/clavulanic acid (30/10 μg), ceftazidime (30 μg) and ceftazidime/clavulanic acid (30/10 μg) were placed onto the agar plate so that the distances between them are approximately twice the radius of the inhibition zones, and the plate was incubated overnight at 35 °C. ESBL activity was indicated when a ≥5 mm increase in the inhibition zone diameter around either cephalosporin disc in combination with clavulanic acid as compared to the inhibition zone diameter of the cephalosporin when tested alone (CLSI 2012). The E. coli strain ATCC 25922 and Klebsiella pneumoniae strain ATCC 700603 were used as controls as per CLSI recommendation.
