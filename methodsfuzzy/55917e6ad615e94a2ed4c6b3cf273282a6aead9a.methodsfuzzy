Serum specimens collected from participants were kept in a refrigerated container at 2e8 C immediately after collection and delivered to the laboratory at the end of each working day for storage at e70 C prior to testing. Sera were tested for antibody responses to A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) by a viral microneutralisation (VN) assay using standard methods. 4, 7 Because the VN assay was found to have greater sensitivity for pH1N1 infection than haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) in our previous study 7 we used the VN assay as the primary serological test in this study. A titre of !1:40 was taken as the threshold for seropositivity because in a previous study conducted in the same laboratory around 90% of patients with confirmed infection reached a titre of !1:40 by VN at convalescence 8 whereas few individuals had a titre !1:40 by VN before the first pandemic wave. A randomly selected subset of specimens plus all specimens from participants who reported laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection were also tested by HAI using standard methods. 7
