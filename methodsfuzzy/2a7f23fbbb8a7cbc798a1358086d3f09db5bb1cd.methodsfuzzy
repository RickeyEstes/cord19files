Plasmids. HCV 1b-derived minigenome p1b-1b was previously referred to as pT7cRLNS5B1 [13] . For construction of chimeric minigenome p2a-1b, the first 376 nucelotides of HCV 2a cDNA with the T7 promoter directly coupled at the 5 0 -end were amplified by PCR with primers 5 0 -tataa gcttTAATACGACTCACTATAACCTGCCCCTAATAGGGGC-3 0 and 5 0 -tgcgcatgcTTTGGTTTTTCTTTGAGGTT-3 0 . The Renilla luciferase gene was amplified from pRL-TK (Promega) using primers 5 0 -ctctctagaA TGACTTCGAAAGTTTATGA-3 0 and 5 0 -tgcgcatgcTTATTGTTCATT TTTGAGAA-3 0 . The resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII-SphI and SphI-XbaI, respectively, and inserted into the HindIII/XbaI sites of p1b-1b. The 3 0 -part of the NS5B coding region fused 3 0 UTR of HCV 2a cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5 0 -ataggatccCCTCAGAA AACTTGGGG-3 0 and 5 0 -ataggcgccagcgaggaggctgggaccatgccggccACAT GATCTGCAGAGAGACC-3 0 , digested with BamHI and NarI, and cloned, along with the annealed oligonucleotides containing partial sequence of the HDV ribozyme [13] , into BamHI/EcoRI-cut p1b-1b or p2a-1b, creating p1b-2a and p2a-2a, respectively. To construct plasmid pNS3-51b expressing polyprotein from HCV 1b, a cDNA containing the ORF of NS3 to NS5B was amplified with primers 5 0 -atatctagaATGGGCCCATCACGGCTTA-3 0 and 5 0 -ataggcgcgccTCA CCGGTTGGGGAGCAGG-3 0 , digested with XbaI and AscI, and cloned, along with HindIII/XbaI-cut HCV sequence (1-341 nt), into pGEMEX-1 vector (Promega) which was modified by deletion of all of the T7 gene 10 and introduction of HindIII and AscI sites between T7 promoter and terminator [14] . pNS3-52a, which expresses the polyprotein from HCV 2a, was constructed similarly except with the primers of corresponding sequence from genotype 2a. The sequences of these constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Cells. The cell line Huh-7 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere. A Huh-7-derived cell line (Huh-NNRZ) stably replicating HCV subgenomic replicon was grown in DMEM containing 300 lg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) [15, 16] . Transfection. Huh-7 cells were seeded at 1 Â· 10 5 per well of 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, 0.5 lg EcoRI-linearized minigenome (p1b-1b, p1b-2a, p2a-1b, or p2a-2a), 0.5 lg pGEMEX-1, pNS3-51b, or pNS3-52a, 0.5 lg pAM8-1, and 0.1 lg pGL3-Control vector were cotransfected into cells with Fugene HD Transfection Reagent (Roche). The cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity as described below. Luciferase assay. Cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells, centrifuged briefly, and 20 ll of the supernatants was used for luciferase assays with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were measured using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Promega). Western blot analysis. Protein was electrophoresed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Hybond-P PVDV Membrane (Amersham). The blots were probed with Antiserum Product 2871 and 2881 (ViroStat) for detection of NS3 and NS4, rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab2594, Abcam Limited) for NS5A, and goat polyclonal antibody (sc-17532, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for NS5B. Signals were visualized with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham). Northern blot analysis. RNAs were isolated from transfected cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega). The purified RNAs were separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Northern blot using digoxigenin-labeled antisense Renilla luciferase sequence.
