The structures of all the systems studied were optimised using the ab initio methods at the RHF (Restricted Hartree Fock) and MP2 (Møller-Plesset) levels using the GAMESS program [33] . The optimisation was performed to a gradient of 0.0001 a.u. AE bohr À1 (approx. 0.42 kJ AE mol À1 AE Å À1 ). In the calculations, the 6-31++G ** basis set was used. Equation (3) defines the homoconjugation energy: where E BHB þ is the energy of a homocomplexed cation, E BH þ is the energy of proton donor and E B is the energy of proton acceptor. The energy of proton in vacuo equals to zero from the definition [34] . After optimisation, vibrational frequencies were computed and, based on their values, it was verified that the calculated structures were minima in the corresponding potential-energy surfaces. The translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions to the thermodynamic corrections to energies and to the Gibbs free energies were also computed. The energy of cationic homoconjugation, DG BHB þ , was calculated based on the following equation: where DE vib;BHB þ is a difference between the zero-point vibrational energy of the products and those of the substrates, respectively, p is the pressure, and V is the volume of a system under assumption that it satisfies ideal gas equation-of-state; S rot and S vib are the rotational and vibrational entropies, respectively, and the term 3R/2 refers For comparison calculated values are included. a N-oxide abbreviations 2,5Me 2 4ClPyO-2,5-dimethyl-4-chloropyridine N-oxide; 2,5Me 2 4BrPyO-2,5-dimethyl-4-bromopyridine N-oxide; 3,5Me 2 4Cl-PyO-3,5-dimethyl-4-chloropyridine N-oxide; 3,5Me 2 4BrPyO-3,5-dimethyl-4-bromopyridine N-oxide; 2,3,6Me 3 4ClPyO-2,3,6-trimethyl-4-chloropyridine N-oxide; 2,3,6Me 3 4BrPyO-2,3,6-trimethyl-4-bromopyridine N-oxide. to translational degrees of freedom of the system. A temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm were assumed in all calculations. In systems consisting of at least two monomers, the BSSE (Basis Superposition Set Error) has to be taken into account. To do this, the energy of each monomer should be computed in the basis set of the dimer to minimize the basis set superposition error (the well-known Boys-Bernardi counterpoise approach) [35] . The calculations were performed by using the following general scheme (they are analogous when calculating Gibbs free energies): where DE BSSE is the energy of a system under consideration of BSSE, DE complex is the energy without consideration of BSSE, and E A and E B are the energies of the A and B monomers, respectively. The E complex (A) and E complex (B) are the energies of complexes A and B, respectively, on assumption that the orbitals of molecules A and B are the so-called ''ghost'' orbitals [35] . The separate BSSE calculations in the RHF and a separate one in the MP2 scheme were done. To estimate solvation contributions to homoconjugation energies, the polarizable continuum model (PCM) was applied. The PCM model [36] employs a van der Waals surface type cavity and sets the parameters for the cavity/ dispersion contributions based on the surface area. In this model, the free energy of a solvated system is described by two terms where the first term represents the solute Hamiltonian, which is modified by the electric field of the solvent. The second term includes both the solvent-solute stabilization energy, as well as the reversible work needed to polarize the solvent. The second term is evaluated from the induced charges on the reaction field cavity surface. In this model the dielectric permittivity of acetonitrile was assigned a value [37] of 35.94. Calculations were carried out for fixed geometries corresponding to the structures optimised in vacuo.
