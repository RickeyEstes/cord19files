In January 2016, a farm housing 1442 fattening pigs in the Teramo province of the Abruzzi region (central Italy) reported acute diarrhoea in pigs of all age groups. The farm is composed by five independent barns, 10 km distant from one another, though they share workers, materials, equipment and feed. In one of the barns (barn 1), it is located a pen for gestation, farrowing and nursery, in addition to other five pens doomed to the growth and fattening of weaned piglets. The other barns (barn 2-5) have only growing-finishing pens. Pens are usually divided into an outdoor area with partially slatted floor and an indoor area equipped with concrete solid floor. According to the attending veterinary physician, approximately the 50% of the animals developed clinical signs. The affected pigs showed anorexia, depression of the sensorium, profuse yellow-greenish watery diarrhoea and varying degrees of weight loss and dehydration. Although the application of sanitary measures, within 1 week after the onset of the first clinical signs, the disease had spread to all age groups of pigs in all barns of the farm, but with major effects in piglets. Organic acids and electrolytes were administered to the animals in water. Very low mortality rates were observed. Indeed only 30 deaths occurred after 10 days since the initial onset of the disease, mainly in piglets and younger individuals. Clinical signs decreased within 1 week in the older pigs, but they persisted among the youngest individuals for approximately 4 weeks. Two faecal samples were sent to the laboratories of the IZSAM for official diagnosis on January 26th. A faecal suspension was prepared for each sample using 1 g of faeces in a total volume of 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline solution with antibiotics; 100 lL of the supernatants was used for RNA purification using BioSprint 96 One-For-All Vet Kit (Qiagen), following manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were tested by real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) using a commercial kit, ViroReal Ã¢ Kit PEDV & TGEV (Ingenetix). Whole-genome sequencing was performed by combination of sequence independent single primer amplification method (SISPA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) following guidelines previously described from our group straight from RNA purified from one of the infected faecal sample (Marcacci et al. 2016) . Deep sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500 using the NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Reagent Cartridge v2 (Illumina Inc.), 300 cycles and standard 150 bp paired-end reads. To determine the genetic relationships with extant global PEDV strains, representative full-length genome sequences of geographically and pathogenically distinct PEDV strains were retrieved from GenBank and aligned using MAFFT with default settings (Katoh et al. 2009) . A phylogenetic tree was inferred using MEGA 6 software through the neighbor-joining (NJ) distance method (TN93 model) performing bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates (Tamura et al. 2013) . Other treebuilding methods, including maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, were used to verify the topology of the NJ tree. To include all extant partial S protein CDS of Italian PEDV strains, an additional NJ was inferred through the same model and bootstrap analysis including a total of 27 sequences of 539 bp including the S1 hypervariable region of the S protein CDS.
