Glide calculations were performed with Maestro v7.5(Schrodinger, Inc.) [20] . Hydrogen atoms and charges were added during a brief relaxation performed using the Protein Preparation module in Maestro with the ''Preparation and refinement'' option, and a restrained partial minimization was terminated when the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) reached a maximum value of 0.3 Å in order to relieve steric clashes. The grid-enclosing box was centered on the Zn 2+ (I) and defined so as to enclose residues located within 10 Å , and a scaling factor of 1.0 was set to van der Waals (VDM) radii of those receptor atoms with the partial atomic charge less than 0.25. In the docking process, extra-precision (XP) docking was adopted to generate the minimized pose, and the Glide scoring function (G-Score) was used to select the final 20 poses for each antibiotic. Together with reported study, the reasonable poses were used for the binding mode analysis.
