We made four key decisions in determining how the lung aspirate and pleural fluid data were to be used in the analysis of determining the cause for the latent (unknown) cases: 1. Instead of using these silver standard measurements as direct inputs in the PIA model (where 97% of cases would have missing data), the positive results were used to 'update' the uniform aetiology prior values such that those pathogens detected on the silver standard measurement had a higher probability of being the cause. â€¢ This process was done on a site-specific basis, i.e., the distribution of pathogens found was only applied to other cases at the same site. 2. The updated aetiology priors were only applied to the subset of cases who were deemed representative of those with the corresponding specimen obtained (see next section). 3. Given the small number of cases with pleural effusion confirmed on chest x-ray (n=22, ranging from n=3 to n=7 across sites) who would be representative of those with pleural fluid specimens, we decided against using the pleural fluid data to update the aetiology priors, as done for the lung aspirate positive cases, because the analytical group to which these would be applied was too small for a robust analysis (i.e., requires stratified analysis). For these confirmed cases the pleural fluid results were used to inform their individual aetiology but not extrapolated to other cases. 4. For the cases with positive lung aspirate or pleural fluid results, those with more than one pathogen detected had aetiology apportioned equally across the pathogens. A partially latent class model (PERCH Integrated Analysis [PIA]), the BAKER method, was used to integrate the blood culture and induced sputum (TB only) results from the cases, and the NP/OP PCR and WB pneumococcal PCR results from both cases and controls to estimate the aetiology distribution for each individual case and for the population of cases, with the probability for each organism ranging from 0% to 100%. 24-26
