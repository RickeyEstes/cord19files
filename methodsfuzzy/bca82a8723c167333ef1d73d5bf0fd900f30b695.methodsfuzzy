All the ex vivo biological experiments described were conducted in a Biosafety Level 2 containment facility and were approved by the institutional biosafety committee of National University of Singapore. Animals. P. alecto bats used in this study were caught in Queensland (Australia) and transported to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), CSIRO (Victoria, Australia). Only bats testing negative by qPCR for Hendra virus (HeV) and Lyssavirus were included in the study. The procedures performed were in accordance with AAHL Animal Ethics guidelines and approved by the AAHL Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol No. 1557). Three to five bat specimens were used in this study. In silico analysis. Sequences from P. alecto were obtained from the current genome assembly in the Ensembl database and sequences from Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse) were obtained from the NCBI database. P. alecto nucleotide sequences were translated into protein sequences using the Expasy Translate Tool program (http://web.expasy.org/translate/) and protein sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Sample processing for FACS analysis. Single cell suspension from spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone marrow or blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) were stained with Fixable Viability Dye e780 (eBioscience) for 20 min at 4 째C, then 10% FBS was added and cells were incubated for another 10 min. For staining of surface markers, the cells were incubated first with primary antibodies (Table S2) including anti-mouse I-A/I-E MHC class II (clone 2G9, BD), polyclonal anti-bat IgG (Novus Biologicals, NB7237), anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70, eBioscience) and anti-mouse CD44 (clone IM7, BD) for 30 min at 4 째C. This was followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) for 30 min at 4 째C. For staining of intracellular proteins (including transcription factors and cytokines), the cells were first fixed and permeabilized using the Fix/Perm Foxp3-staining kit (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 째C. Staining was performed at room temperature in the dark with the following antibodies anti-CD3 (clone CD3-12, Abcam), anti-mouse Eomes (clone Dan11mag), anti-human/mouse Tbet (clone 4B10), and anti-human/mouse Gata3 (clone TWAJ) antibodies (Table S2 ). All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise stated. Samples were analyzed using LSR Fortessa X-20 (BD) and Flowjo software.
