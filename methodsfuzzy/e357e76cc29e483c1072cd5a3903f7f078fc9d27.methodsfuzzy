General procedures, materials, and reagents. LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI source or Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrapole mass spectrometer was used for ESI mass spectral analysis of the target lipids 1-3. Varian FT 300, 400 MHz, and 600 MHz NMR Spectrometers were used in running 1H NMR spectra of target lipids 1-3 and their synthetic intermediates. The quinic and shikimic acids used for synthesis of lipids 1 and 2 were from Fluka (Switzerland) and the d-Mannose used for synthesis of lipid 3 was from SD Fine Chemicals, Hyderabad, India. The EDCI and HOBT used for coupling qunic and shikimic acids to tertiary amine intermediate were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and the silica gel (60-120 mesh) used for performing column chromatography was purchased from Acme Synthetic Chemicals (Mumbai, India). Reversed phase analytical HPLC analysis using two different mobile phases (A: pure methanol and B: 95:5, v/v, methanol/water) were used in conforming more than 95% purities of the target lipids 1-3. p-CMV-MART1 plasmid DNA used in the present study was a kind gift from Dr. Van den Eynde, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium. Dr. Nalam Madhusudhana Rao kindly provided us with sample of p-CMV-SPORT-β-gal plasmid. The CTL assay kit and the ELISA kits for cytokine assays were procured from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA), and Promega (Madison, CA). Mouse FITC-conjugated CD11c, H2Kb, CD40, CD86, CD83, CD80, and mannose receptor antibodies were purchased from Bio-Legend (San Diego, CA). Mouse phycoerythrin-conjugated CD4 + and CD11c and FITC-conjugated CD8 + antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Mouse anti-MHC II monoclonal antibody used was from Chemicon (Billerica, MA). Anti-MART1 mAb was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, MA). IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF-α ELISA kits were procured from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) . Anti-CD11c antibody-labeled magnetic beads and Midimax columns were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cholesterol, cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and the FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse secondary antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NP-40, antibiotics, and agarose were obtained from Hi-media, India. B16F10 (murine melanoma cells) was procured from the National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune, India. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was used in culturing B16F10 cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 /95% air. C57BL/6 mice (each weighing 20-22 g and 6-8 weeks old) were obtained from National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India and all the in vivo experiments were done following Institutional Bio-Safety and Ethical Committee Guidelines using approved animal protocols.
