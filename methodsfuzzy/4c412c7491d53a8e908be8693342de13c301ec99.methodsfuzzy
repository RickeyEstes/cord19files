Normal pregnant rats, strain CHBB/THOM, were purchased from Thomae, Biberach, F.R.G. and used for the experiments. The animals were perfused by direct cannulation into the hearts on 1, 3, 5, 9 and 21 days after birth. Two animals were examined at each time. The perfusate consisted of 2.0 ~ glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 at room temperature. After perfusion the spines with spinal cord were dissected and they were cut horizontally through intervertebral discs. The divided blocks of the spinal cords which correspond to the 2nd and 4th cervical vertebral bodies were fixed overnight in the same fixative as the perfusate. After fixation the spinal cords were removed carefully from the spines and sliced horizontally into 1-mm thick sections. The sections were post-fixed in 1 ~ osmic acid, stained en bloc with 2 ~ uranyl acetate in 0.1 M sodium hydrogen maleate buffer (Karnowsky 1967) , dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections were prepared from the horizontally cut surfaces. Semi-thin sections were stained with 1 ~ toluidine blue. The ultra-thin sections from the selected areas were stained with lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss 10 B electron microscope.
