In this study, culturable bioaerosols were targeted with a focus on the infectivity of the bioaerosols (Toivola, Nevalainen & Alm, 2004) , which was consistent with the legal bioaerosol standard established by the Ministry of Environment of Korea (Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea, 2014). During the measurement campaigns, a Bio-Culture device (Buck Bio-Culture, Model B30120, A.P. Buck, Inc., Orlando, Florida, U.S.) was used to sample bioaerosols (Heo et al., 2014) . The Bio-Culture device is a multiple-jet impactor-type sampler for collecting airborne microorganisms. The sampling flow rate was 100 L/min and the sampling time was approximately 1 min per sample to prevent overcrowding of colonies. The measurement was replicated at least three times under individual sampling conditions. Nutrient agar plates (beef extract 3%, peptone 5%, and agar 15%; Difco; 25 mL of agar per 90 mm by 15 mm petri dish) were used in the Bio-Culture device to sample bacterial bioaerosols (Hinds, 1998) . Sampled bacterial aerosols were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. For the measurement of fungal bioaerosols, malt extract agar (MEA: maltose 12.75%, dextrin 2.75%, glycerol 2.35%, peptone 0.75%, and agar 15%; Difco; 25 mL of agar per 90 mm by 15 mm petri dish) was used. The sampled fungal bioaerosols were incubated at 25°C for 48 h. After the incubation of sampled bioaerosols, the number of colonies was enumerated and the concentration of culturable bioaerosols was determined. Data for the number of colonies were converted to the concentration of bioaerosols in the air, expressed as colony forming unit per unit volume (CFU/m 3 ). A positive-hole correction table was used to adjust colony counts from a 400-hole impactor to allow the collection of multiple particles through a single hole (Macher, 1989) .
