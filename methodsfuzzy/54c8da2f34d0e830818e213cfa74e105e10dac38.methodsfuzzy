Participants and study design ( Figure 1 ) Pilgrims travelling to Mecca, Saudi Arabia during the 2018 Hajj from Marseille, France, were recruited through a private specialized travel agency. Potential adult participants were invited to participate in the study. They were included and followed-up by two bilingual (Arabic and French) medical doctors who travelled with the group. All participants departed to KSA on the same date, were housed in the same accommodation during their stay and performed the rituals together. Upon inclusion, before departing from France, pilgrims were interviewed using a standardized pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected information about demographic characteristics, medical history and immunization status. Pilgrims were considered to have been immunized against influenza when they had been vaccinated within the past year and until before 10 days of the date of travel. Pilgrims were considered to be immune to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) when they had been vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) in the past five years [14, 15] . A post-Hajj questionnaire was completed two days before the pilgrims' return to France. Clinical data, antibiotic intake and information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, the use of hand gel disinfectant and disposable handkerchiefs was collected. To evaluate the dynamic and interaction of respiratory pathogens during the Hajj, all pilgrims underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs at different times: pre-travel, five to six days post arrival, 12-13 days post arrival and just prior to leaving KSA (post-Hajj). The Hajj rituals took place from 19-24 August. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the presence of cough, sore throat and subjective fever [16] . Possible LRTI was defined by presence of productive cough without nasal or throat symptoms; febrile productive cough; dyspnea or febrile dyspnea [17] . Based on the WHO classification, "underweight" was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5, "normal" corresponded to a BMI between 18.5 and 25, "overweight" corresponded to a BMI ≥25, and "obese" referred to those with a BMI ≥30 [18].
