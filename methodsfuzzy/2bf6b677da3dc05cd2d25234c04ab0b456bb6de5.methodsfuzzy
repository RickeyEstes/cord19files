Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats, 6 weeks old (Alab, Stockholm, Sweden), were injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. The strain, variable antigen type AnTat 1/1, derived from stabilate EATRO 1125, was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Nestor van Meirvenne, Laboratory of Serology, Institute of Tropical Medicine 'Prince Leopold', Antwerp, Belgium, and was passaged once in rats before use. Each animal was injected with 0.2 ml of a suspension of trypanosomes in a phosphatesaline-glucose buffer, pH 8.0, containing 3000-5000 parasites per /tl. 13, 22 and 30 days after injection the rats were killed, the brains dissected and snap frozen. Three uninfected rats were used as controls. Cryostat sections (8 #m thick) of the brain were fixed in cold acetone (-20 Â° C) and processed for immunohistochemistry. Endogenous peroxidase activity was extinguished by treatment with 0.3% H202 prior to incubation with antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: Ox18, which labels MHC class I (Fukumoto et al., 1982) ; Ox6, which labels MHC class II (McMaster and Williams, 1979) ; Ox19, which is a pan T cell marker (rat CD5) (Dallman et al., 1984) ; Ox8, which labels suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells (rat CD8) (Brideau et al., 1980) ; W3/25, a marker for T-helper cells (Williams et al., 1977) , and some macrophages (rat CD4) (Barclay, 1981) . Ox18 was purchased from SeraLab (Crawley Down, U.K.). The other antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants of hybridomas obtained from Dr. Allan Williams, Oxford, U.K. (Holmdahl et al., 1985) . After incubation with the primary antibodies at room temperature for 60 min, the sections were thoroughly rinsed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibodies (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1:30 in 0.2% normal rat serum. The sections were then exposed to an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Lab.) for 30 min at room temperature and reacted for peroxidase with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as a substrate (Kaplow, 1975) . The specificity of the staining and the optimal antibody concentrations to be used were tested on sections of lymphoid organs and brain. As controis, sections where the primary antibody was omitted, were used.
