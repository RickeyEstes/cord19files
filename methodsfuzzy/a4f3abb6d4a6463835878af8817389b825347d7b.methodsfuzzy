The study was undertaken in rural coastal Kenya within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) [8] . The study methods have been described elsewhere [7] . Briefly, a prospective cohort study was undertaken with a recruitment target of 50 RSV-naive infants and their household members. A household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with common cooking arrangements. Households were eligible if they contained a child born after the end of the 2008-2009 RSV epidemic, and one or more older siblings (aged <13 years). Sampling visits were timed to begin and end coincident with the start and finish of the expected RSV season of 2009-2010 [7] . Trained field assistants made twice weekly household visits, collecting deep nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) irrespective of symptoms and recording clinical illness data from all participants.
