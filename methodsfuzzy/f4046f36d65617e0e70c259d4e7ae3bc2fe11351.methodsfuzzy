A qualitative method was adopted, as it seeks to understand phenomena in context-specific settings and, in addition, seeks insights, understanding, and depth of knowledge (Hoepfl 1997; Walle 1997) . In order to capture the lived experience of participants, naturalistic inquiry using a series of semi-structured interviews was chosen, supplemented by site visits and field inspections. Interviews lasted from five minutes to more than one hour and were conducted in Cantonese. Notes were transcribed into English. Developing a relationship with study participants is essential in this type of study in order to break down barriers and gain deeper insights into lived experiences (Hannabuss 1996) . To this end, a total of six rounds of interviews were made by the second author between December, 2003 and August, 2004 . Sixteen individuals participated in the study. All were residents of the island and all were involved in tourism to some extent. The sample included the owners/managers of two restaurants, five grocery stalls, souvenir stall holders, and Tanka residents who operated water-taxis. The sample represents virtually all permanent residents who are involved in tourism and/or related retail and transport activities on the island. The respondents' pecuniary involvement means that the opinions expressed are likely biased in favor of this activity. Since the goal of the study was to examine residents involved in tourism, the authors purposefully did not interview any residents without an interest in visitation. Notably, the names of respondents have been changed to ensure confidentiality. Because qualitative research by nature involves an emergent structure, the research design and questions evolved as the study progressed (Hoepfl 1997) . Preliminary interviews sought to introduce the researchers to the residents, start to build a relationship, and gain broad background knowledge. The first round, for example, focused on gathering oral histories of the island, and understanding tourism activity and the individual's own involvement in this sector. Subsequent interviews sought clarification and additional details about why residents remained on the islands, their reasons for becoming involved, and other relevant information. This style of inquiry relies on the subjective evaluation of spoken words and not on the quantitative evaluation of numbers. As such, bias or errors can enter in three possible areas: the respondent misinterpreting the question and providing a different answer to the question asked; the researcher recording the answer inaccurately; and the 512 analyst misinterpreting the recorded response. In addition, there is a risk of cultural bias, especially when one of the authors comes from a different ethnic and cultural background than the study participants. Each of the authors analyzed the data set independently and then they compared notes to ensure consistency and accuracy of interpretation. Subsequent interviews also gave residents the opportunity to clarify certain points and to augment their statements. The third point in the triangulation process was provided by secondary data sources. Importantly, as well, the stories told by participants were largely consistent, enabling cross-verification of ideas. The inclusion of a local Hong Kong Chinese author helped minimize cultural bias.
