Initially, the LAMP method was carried out following the protocol and primer set described by Poon et al. (2006) , although pre-addition of 120 M HNB was introduced in the reaction mixture. 2 L of extracted DNA was used as the template for amplification. The tubes were heated at 60 • C for 60 min. A slightly different region in the 18S rRNA gene of P. falciparum 3D7 type was selected using the NCBI-BLAST tool. Primers were designed with Primer Explorer V4: an online primer-designing tool (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html) developed by Eiken Chemical Co. LTD, Japan. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . For the newly designed primer set, a 2X reaction mixture was prepared comprising 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 (pH 8.8), 20 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO 4 , 1 M betain, 2.4 mM each of the DNTPs, 120 M HNB, and 0.01% Tween 20. The primer mixture was prepared with 2.4 M of F1P and B1P, 0.6 M of LPF and LPB, and 0.2 M of F3C and B3 primers. All reactions were carried out in 25 L tubes using 2 L of template DNA, 12.5 L 2X reaction mixture, 9.5 L of primer mixture, and 1 L (8U) of Bst polymerase. All tubes were heated at 60 • C for 40 min in a heat block. Changes in the color of the reaction mixture for both LAMP methods were observed by the naked eye. The color of the mixture in the tubes containing detectable amount of P. falciparum DNA changed from violet to sky blue (Fig. 2) . In order to set the reaction time, initially LAMP was carried on serially diluted DNA samples with parasitemia of 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 5, and 1. Each sample was amplified for five rounds. In each round of assay, reactions with 5 parasites/L template DNA was amplified and changed the color within 30-32 min. Sometimes reactions with 1 parasite/L template DNA were amplified within approximately 35-36 min. Incubation for longer duration did not show any color change. Therefore, 40 min was chosen as the reaction time.
