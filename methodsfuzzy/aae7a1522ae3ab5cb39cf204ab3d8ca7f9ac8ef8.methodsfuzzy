Mice and cell lines. Bone marrow macrophages were derived from various mouse strains, including Mavs / (Sun et al., 2006) , Mda5 / (Gitlin et al., 2006) , and Zbp1 / (Ishii et al., 2008) . Wild-type C57BL/6 and Tnfr1 / mice were from the Jackson Laboratory. Myd88 / /Trif / mice were obtained from G. Barton (University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA). Irf1 / , Irf3 / , Irf5 / , and Irf 7 / mice were obtained from T. Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Tbk1 / /Tnfr1 / mice were generated by crossing Tbk1 / mice (provided by W.-C. Yeh, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) with Tnfr1 / mice. Rip2 / mice were obtained from R. Medzhitov (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Nod1 / /Nod2 / mice were obtained from D. Portnoy (University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA). Nalp3 / mice were obtained from V. Dixit (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). ISRE-L929 IFN reporter cells were obtained from
