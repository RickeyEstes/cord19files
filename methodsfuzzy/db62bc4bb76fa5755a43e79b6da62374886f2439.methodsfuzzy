Databases used. We ran BLAST (11) and PSI-BLAST (11) against the NCBI nonredundant (nr) database (1 April 2012 release). We ran HHsearch searches against version 26 of PFAM (21) and HHblits against its own database of UniProt sequence clusters, UniProt20 (22) (2 December 2011 release). We relied on the NCBI taxonomy (2/3 April 2012 release) to map UniProt identifiers (from the UniProt 21 March 2012 release) to the NCBI taxonomy. Sequence similarity searches. For homology searches, we ran BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HHblits, and HHsearch with the following parameters: BLAST, executable blastall, version 2.2.23, E value cutoff of 10 Ϫ3 , SEG low-complexity filtering enabled; PSI-BLAST, executable psiblast, version 2.2.26ϩ, E value cutoff of 10 Ϫ3 , low-complexity filtering enabled, 10 iterations maximum; HHblits and HHsearch, executable hhblits and hhsearch from HHsuite, version 2.0.13, E value of 10 Ϫ3 , realignment using local maximum-accuracy algorithm enabled with a default maximum accuracy threshold parameter value of 0.35, four iterations maximum. We used the A3M multiple-sequence alignment generated by HHblits to run HHsearch. ANNOTATOR environment. We used the ANNOTATOR web application (23) to run the search algorithms and calculate the raw taxonomy statistics. ANNOTATOR provides a convenient interface for running a comprehensive array of sequence analysis algorithms focused on protein function discovery. It is available at http://annotator.bii.a-star.edu.sg. The results were analyzed and tabulated by using a set of custom Perl scripts. Constitution of a data set of viral proteins classified by BLAST as genus restricted. We adapted a data set of viral "ORFan" genes (species restricted) generously provided by YanBin Yin (3) . To keep the size of the data set manageable, we focused on a subset composed of proteins from viruses with positive, single-stranded RNA viral genomes and for which BLAST detected no homologs in other genera by using the parameters and database described above. For the final data set, containing 351 sequences, see Table S1 in the supplemental material. Identifying the taxonomic distribution of homologs. For each query, we compiled the taxonomic distribution of the hits retrieved by the similarity detection tools as follows. First, we collected all of the hits that had statistically significant similarity (E values of Յ10 Ϫ3 ) to the query. For BLAST and PSI-BLAST, these hits correspond to single sequences and we retrieved their NCBI taxonomy. For HHblits, the hits correspond to clusters of protein sequences and we retrieved the NCBI taxonomy of all of the sequences listed in the clusters. For HHpred searches, the hits are "families" of protein sequences and we retrieved the taxonomy of all of the sequences from these families. Some PFAM families are grouped into "clans" (24) . We retrieved the taxonomic distribution of all of the sequences from these clans. We discarded any nonviral sequence, which would have complicated the analysis without any benefit for our study (see Discussion). Second, having collected the taxonomic distribution of hits for each software, we counted the distinct taxons that were retrieved at the species, genus, and family ranks. In some rare cases, virus species have no assigned genus or family. In these cases, we adjusted the taxonomic counts so that the counts for a particular query at a lower rank would be at least equal to the counts at a higher rank. For example, a query that had homologs in four viral families would also be counted as having homologs in four viral genera-even if the viral families in question did not have defined genera. In-depth manual homology detection incorporating contextual information. To identify remote homologs missed by automated searches, we exploited "contextual" information, such as taxonomy, genome organization, and domain organization (25) (26) (27) (28) . Our procedure is similar to that described previously (29) and consists of two steps, the detection of potential homologs and their validation. We first identified "straightforward" homologs of the query protein in the NCBI nr database (1 April 2012 release) by using HHpred (14) , HHblits (15) , and CSI-BLAST (30, 31) and selecting hits whose E values were below the cutoff of 10 Ϫ3 . We then examined subsignificant hits (i.e., those with E values of Ͼ10 Ϫ3 ) up to an E value of 2,000, looking for viral proteins or domains that came from a virus taxonomically related to the query (or infecting similar hosts) and/or that occurred in the same position of the genome or of the viral polyprotein. Such subsignificant hits, which have weak similarity to the query protein and occur in a similar genomic context, constitute potential homologs. To validate these candidates, we gathered homologs of these subsignificant hits (as described above, i.e., with E values of Յ10 Ϫ3 ) and used HHalign (32) to compare homologs of the query protein (obtained as described above) with homologs of the subsignificant hits. We considered an HHalign E value of Ͻ10 Ϫ5 to indicate homology between the subsignificant hit and the query. We performed additional checks, such as verifying that the secondary structure and function of the hits were compatible with those of the query. When we validated a potential homolog, we repeated the procedure after including it in query alignments (i.e., we performed iterative or "cascade" searches [33] [34] [35] until no new homologs were found). Detection of homologs of CBPV ORFs. To detect homologs of ORF1, we obtained the following tools from their web servers and used them with default parameters: HHpred (14) (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de /hhpred), FFAS (1) (http://ffas.sanfordburnham.org/ffas-cgi/cgi/ffas.pl), and WebPRC (16) (http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/prcwww). We used PROMALS (36) to compare the secondary structure of ORF1 with that of known methyltranferase-guanylyltransferases (MTase-GTases). We used contextual information coupled with sequence similarity searches as described above to detect homologs of ORF2 and ORF3. We obtained CSI-BLAST (30, 31) from its web server (http://toolkit .tuebingen.mpg.de/cs_blast#) and used it with five iterations and most of the default parameters (inclusion cutoff E value of 10 Ϫ3 , low-complexity filter not enabled, nr database). However, to examine as many subsignificant hits as possible, even extremely weak ones, we set the maximum E value reported to 2,000 (the default value is 10) and the maximum number of sequences reported to 2,000 (the default is 100). We used ANNIE (37; http://annie.bii.a-star.edu.sg) to predict the structural properties of all of the ORFs of CBPV; MetaPrDOS (38) for disorder prediction, respecting the principles described in reference 39; Composition Profiler (40) for sequence composition analyses; and LOMETS (41) for fold recognition. Prediction of TM segments in CBPV ORF2 and ORF3. To predict the number and locations of transmembrane (TM) segments of ORF2 and ORF3, we relied on two complementary approaches. On the one hand, for each virus, we compared the predictions of multiple programs for a single sequence (vertical approach). We considered the robustness of the prediction to be proportional to the number of predictors that detected a given TM segment. The predictors used were those applied and displayed by ANNIE (37) . On the other hand, we compared the prediction of a single program for several homologs (horizontal approach) by using TMcoffee (42) , which predicts TM segments in multiple sequences via HMMTOP (43) . We considered the robustness of the prediction to be proportional to the number of sequences that contained a given predicted TM segment. Finally, we used Phobius (44) to predict signal peptides and the topology of membrane proteins and TMSOC (45) to distinguish "complex" from "simple" anchor-type TM segments liable to give spurious hits in similarity searches.
