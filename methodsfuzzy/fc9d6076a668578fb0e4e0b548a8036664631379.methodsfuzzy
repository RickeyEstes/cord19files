Biosafety EBOZ and MARV are Risk Group 4, Category A biothreat agents. All experiments with this virus were performed within a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) facility by personnel in a biosafety suit at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute (San Antonio, TX). Both the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Institutional Biohazards Committee at Texas Biomed approved experimental protocols. Virus strains EBOV (Kikwit) and MARV Musoke were provided by Dr. Peter Jahrling (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, Maryland) . Stocks were used to infect tissue culture flasks containing Vero E6 cells at 90% confluency. The flasks were infected at an MOI of 0.01 then incubated until cytopathic effect greater than 80% was observed then harvested and stored in aliquots in an ultralow temperature freezer. Infectivity of virus stocks was determined by plaque titration (Moe et al., 1981) .
