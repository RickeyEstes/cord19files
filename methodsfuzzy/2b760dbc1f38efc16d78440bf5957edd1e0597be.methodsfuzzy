All individual calf data and all outcome data were stored in two computer record-keeping files, using a commercially available data management system, MABRA (Sharp, 1980 (Sharp, , 1981 . The 'birthday' file contained the individual calf birthday form data and the 'event' file contained the log-sheet events from both intensive and extensive farms. At the end of the study, 10 farms were randomly selected from the complete list of intensive and extensive farms and all paper records were checked against computer files. For intensive farms, the birthday and event files were linked, and checks were made for duplications, misspellings and other mismatches between the files. For each calf in the birthday file, where applicable, age (in days) at death, sale, and first treatment for all diseases (including scours and pneumonia), and specifically for scours and pneumonia, were calculated and recorded. In this study, the terms 'crude morbidity' and 'all diagnoses' are used inter-changeably to refer to a pooled morbidity category, which includes all calves treated therapeutically, for whatever reason. Preventive treatments were similarly recorded. Preventive treatments to calves, at both the farm and the individual animal level, were defined as treatments administered to calves in the absence of recognizable disease. Most of these preventive treatments were administered to calves at birth or shortly thereafter. The age of a calf less than or equal to one day old was considered to be one day, greater than one up to two, two days, and so on. Where possible, days to removal from dam, and days to weaning were also calculated. Any negative ages that resulted from these calculations were checked and corrected or deleted, as appropriate. Likewise, all deaths, sales and first treatments beyond the calculated age at weaning were corrected or deleted, as appropriate. All days to removal from dam beyond four days were checked against paper records and corrected if necessary. The number of days of treatment prior to weaning, and the drugs used at first treatment, were also recorded for each calf in the expanded birthday file. Questionnaire data were entered into fixed format computer files in the Conversational Monitor System (CMS) of IBM (1977) . At the end of the survey, these files were restructured to conform to the five, six-month seasonal time periods of the study. If a farmer had changed his management during a six-month period, his farm was classified according to the policy followed for the greatest proportion of the given season. Farm-level outcomes were calculated from the Event file for each of the five seasons. For each period, for each farm, the number of calves born, the number dead, and number treated (all diagnoses combined), and the number treated for scours and pneumonia separately, were calculated. This information was then combined with the appropriate questionnaire file. Finally, two large files were constructed: 'summer', containing all data pertaining to the two summer periods; and 'winter', containing all the data pertaining to the three winters. A variable called YEAR identified each block of information within each of the two files according to the year in which it occurred (80--81, 81--82, 82--83) . During each of the first two years of the study, field technicians of the Wintario Dairy Project were asked to rate all farmers on record keeping practices (i.e. completeness of records), and on this basis to place them into three categories: poor, good, excellent. This was repeated for intensive farms only in the final year of the study. These ratings, coded as one, two and three, respectively, were included in all multivariate farm-level analyses. Record keeping was also evaluated by comparing heifer calf treatment rates before, during and after the vaccine field trial on three groups of farms. Farms in Part A of the trial were subjected to intense scrutiny and veterinary visits every two weeks from late November of 1982 until early March, 1983. Farms in Part B of the trial were intensive farms, and hence kept individual calf records; they were visited about every five weeks during the period of II0 the field trial. Finally, an 'other' category included the extensive farms, none of them involved in the field trial. These farms were visited by the Wintario Dairy Project technicians on their regular rounds. These comparisons would be expected to give an indication of the effects of degree of supervision on intensity of record keeping and/or treatment, and the degree to which this might distort the estimation of true morbidity.
