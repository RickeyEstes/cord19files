Swine influenza A virus hemagglutinin H1 data set. All available swine IAV hemagglutinin (HA) H1 sequences from viruses in the IRD (30) were downloaded on 7 June 2016. Only H1N1 and H1N2 subtype viruses were included, and these sequences comprised 8,438 worldwide samples. To restrict our analyses to relevant field viruses, we excluded sequences with "lab" or "laboratory" host. Sequences were then aligned with MAFFT v 7.221 (50, 51) , with manual correction and curation in Mesquite (52) . The aligned sequences underwent a redundancy analysis within the program mothur v.1.36.0 (53), and sequences with 100% identity were removed. Our final filtering step was to remove poor-quality data using two criteria: sequences were removed if Ͼ50% of the HA gene sequence was missing and a sequence was removed if it had more than 5 nucleotide base ambiguities. This process resulted in a set of 6,298 nonidentical H1 HA swine IAV sequences that represent the full extent of published swine H1 HA genetic diversity worldwide. An additional 428 randomly sampled human seasonal H1 HA sequences and 344 randomly sampled avian H1 HA sequences that represented the entire time period (1918 to 2015) of the study were also included with the swine IAV, resulting in a final data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences. Phylogenetic methods, clade annotation, and clade comparisons. From these data, a maximum likelihood tree was inferred using RAxML (v8.2.4 [54] ) on the CIPRES Science Gateway (55) employing the rapid bootstrap algorithm, a general time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution, and ⌫-distributed rate variation among sites. The statistical support for individual branches was estimated by bootstrap analysis with the number of bootstrap replicates determined automatically using an extended majority-rule consensus tree criterion (56) . Using this phylogeny, we defined clades using quantifiable criteria that were applied collectively across the entire data set. Clades were defined based on sharing of a common node and monophyly, statistical support greater than 70% at the clade-defining node, and average percent pairwise nucleotide distances between and within clades of Ͼ7% and Ͻ7%, respectively, with certain minor exceptions (see Results). Given recent, relatively frequent, spillover of nonswine viruses without subsequent onward transmission in swine populations, we required a minimum of 10 viruses between 2010 and the present in a proposed clade before assigning a clade designation. Using this process, we identified three first-order lineages, seven second-order divisions, 13 third-order divisions, and eight fourth-order divisions ( Fig. 1 ; see also Data Set S1 in the supplemental material). Sampling and sequencing in the 1900s and early 2000s were not representative of the relative abundance of different swine IAV clades (see reference 10); consequently, in Results, we restrict comments on abundance and geographical dispersion to just those data from 2010 to the present. To validate tree topology, branch support, and the subsequent manual clade designations, we created three separate data sets by separating the 6,298 swine H1 sequences into the three first-order lineages and then randomly subsampling viruses from each second-order division. The first data set contained 750 sequences from the 1A lineage (classical swine lineage), the second data set contained 1,018 sequences from the 1B lineage (human seasonal lineage), and the third data set contained 760 sequences from the 1C lineage (Eurasian avian lineage). For each of the data sets, we inferred maximum likelihood trees according to the methods described above. In addition, we performed Bayesian analyses on each data set using mixed nucleotide models within MrBayes v 3.2.5 (57) with two parallel runs of four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each for 3 million generations, with subsampling every 100th generation. Independent replicates were conducted to determine that analyses were not trapped at local optima. We considered stationarity of molecular evolutionary parameters when effective sample sizes of Ͼ200 were reached or the potential scale reduction factor was at or near 1.0 (58) . Trees prior to stationarity were burned in, and the remaining trees were used to assess posterior probabilities for nodal support. These analyses used the computational resources of the USDA-ARS computational cluster Ceres on ARS SCINet. To quantify the within-and between-clade nucleotide distances for the H1 clade designations, the average pairwise distances (APDs) were calculated in MEGA-CC v 7.07 (59) using the p-distance calculation. Swine H1 clade classification tool. The H1 gene classification tool is based on a bifurcating scaffold phylogenetic tree inferred using maximum likelihood from 3 to 10 representatives of each wellsupported, named clade, to capture the evolutionary relationships among clades. To be included in this representative phylogeny, an H1 sequence was required to be at least 1,600 nucleotides (nt) long but was unrestricted with respect to host species. The classifier uses pplacer (60) to attach a query sequence to a branch in this tree, without reestimating the tree. Thus, the tree of representative sequences acts as a "scaffold" upon which the query sequence is placed. pplacer maximizes the likelihood of the placement by comparing the sequence of the query with the sequences in the tree, given the estimates of the evolutionary parameters underlying the inferred phylogeny. The classifier then assigns a clade to the query based on the clades represented in the local neighborhood of its placement (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), as follows: (i) if the query is attached to a terminal branch, then it is assigned the clade of the virus at the tip; (ii) if the query is attached to an internal branch, then it is assigned the clade of the node at the basal end of this branch. Internal nodes are assigned clades according to the rules in a parameter file. Nodes with "-like" classifications fall into internode regions joining subtrees of distinct clades. In our experience, viruses assigned "-like" classifications are often transitional, occurring prior to or during the emergence of a new clade that successfully expands onward. The "-like" designation attempts to capture the position intermediate between older and newer clades. The classifier is written in perl and is portable, fast, and accurate. Importantly, it is adaptable readily to other clade classification tasks, because it specifies the parameters relevant to a particular application in external files. To date, it has been applied successfully to classification of avian HA/H5 sequences, according to the nomenclature of the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Working Group (29) , to distinguishing new pandemic 2009 H1 viruses from earlier seasonal H1 viruses in humans and other hosts, and to classifying U.S. swine H1 HA phylogenetic clades. These three applications have been implemented on IRD (30, 31) .
