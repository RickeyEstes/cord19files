Plasmid construction. The cDNA of human USP2 (Gene ID: 9099) catalytic domain (residues 258 to 605) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the primers 5′-GGCGCTAGCATGAATTCTAAGAGTGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCGAGCATTCGGGAGGGCGGGC-3′, using pOTB7-USP2 (MGC premier cDNA clone ID: BC002854) as a template. The PCR product was digested by NheI-XhoI and then inserted into the vector pET-24d with a 6x-His tag at the C-terminus (Novagen). The primer sequences for site-directed mutagenesis of the USP2 C276S mutant were 5′-CGAAACCTTGGGAACACGAGCTTCATGAACTCAATTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAATTGAGTTCATGAAGCTCGTGTTCCCAAGGTTTCG-3′. The reading frames of the above plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of human USP2. In the present study, we used the catalytic domain (residues 258-605) since the full-length USP2 has not been obtained despite our effort to express the full-length protein by sumo-fusion strategy. The cloned plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen). Cultures of 0.8 l LB medium with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 17 μg/ml chloramphenicol were grown at 37 °C for 4 h and then incubated at 20 °C for 20 h after adding 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D -thiogalactopyranoside. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (βME)), sonicated and then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4 °C for βME and then eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 30 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole and 2 mM βME. Next, the protein was loaded onto an S-100 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) using running buffer (15 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol). The purity of the collected fraction was checked by SDS-PAGE and the protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 30 kDa filter (Millipore). The final purified protein at 15 mg/ml with 5% glycerol was flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The typical yield of protein was 15 mg for wild-type USP2 and 30 mg for C276S mutant per liter of cell culture. Deubiquitination assays and steady-state kinetic analyses. Deubiquitination assays were performed in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) at 30 °C. The concentration of the fluorogenic substrate ubiquitin -7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ub-AFC; Boston Biochem) was varied while the concentration of USP2 catalytic domain or its C276S mutant was held at 0.2 μM. Enzyme activity was measured by continuously monitoring the fluorescence emission increase at 485 nm upon substrate cleavage at excitation wavelength of 350 nm in a PerkinElmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. The increase in fluorescence was linear for the first 25 s. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial velocities (v i ) to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The program Sigmaplot 12 (Systat Software) was used for data analysis. For the inhibition assays, concentrations of the substrate Ub-AFC and an inhibitor, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) or 6TG, were varied while the concentration of the USP2 catalytic domain was held at 0.2 μM. The inhibition data for the inhibitors was found to best fit a noncompetitive inhibition model according to in which v s is the steady-state velocity, k inact is the apparent first-order rate constant for the interconversion between v i and v s and t is time.
