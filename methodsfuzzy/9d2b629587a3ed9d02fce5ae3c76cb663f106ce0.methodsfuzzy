Oligonucleotide primers MKCap8 (TCAT-CATCCTCTCACACTGG) and MKCap19 (AGCAGCAGTAGGTGGCAGTG), produce an 849 base pair (bp) amplicon from within the viral capsid gene (Fig. 1 ). Primers MKPol10 (TGGCG-GCGAACTCCTCAACA) and MKPol11 (AATAAGGTCTGCACAGGTCG), produce an 802 bp fragment overlapping the viral polymerase ORF (Fig. 1 ). Both primer sets were used in the RT-PCR detection of TAstV. Total RNA was isolated from the intestines of astrovirus inoculated and control specific pathogen free (SPF) turkey embryos, experimentally infected and sham infected turkey poult intestines, as well as the intestines and feces from commercial turkey flocks suffering from an enteric disease using the TRIzol ® total RNA isolation reagent (Life Technolo-gies™, Rockville, MD). First strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 1 mg of the extracted total RNA with 20 pmol of reverse primer (MK-CAP8 or MKPOL10) in a 20 ml reaction containing 15 units of SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies™), and 20 pmol of dNTPs at 42°C for 60 min. An aliquot (2 ml) of the first strand product was used as template for amplification in a 50 ml reaction containing, 10 pmol of primers (MKCAP8 and MKCAP19, Fig. 2A or MKPOL10 and MKPOL11, Fig. 2B ), 20 pmol of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies™). Amplification, performed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 DNA thermalcycler, involved an initial denaturing step at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1.75 min, and finished with a final extension set at 72°C for 2.5 min. PCR products were electrophoresised in a 1.1% agarose gel in TAE buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and ultra violet irradiation (Sambrook et al., 1989) . The PCR products were purified by Qiaquick ® PCR purification system (Qiagen ® , Valencia, CA) and sequenced (Smith et al., 1986 ) (Applied Biosystems) to confirm amplification of the intended gene (data not shown). Using primer pair MKCAP8 and MKCAP19 ( Fig. 2A) we amplified an 849 bp product from the total RNA of astrovirus-infected turkey poults from our laboratory model and from commercial an 802 bp amplicon in the astrovirus inoculated SPF embryo intestines, experimentally infected turkey poults, as well as from feces and intestines of commercial turkey flocks (Fig. 2B) . The amplified product from the field samples were determined to be 92% similar to the poults and SPF embryos infected experimentally (data not shown). Both of these primer sets were analyzed for their specificity to TAstV. Several viruses of enteric origin were used to examine cross-reactivity (Fig. 3) . RNA was isolated, as described above, from the intestines of coronavirus positive turkey poults (supplied by Dr H. John Barnes, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), and bovine enterovirus (supplied by National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA). In addition DNA was isolated from goose parvovirus infected cells (supplied by National Animal Disease Center) using DNAzol ® reagent genomic DNA isolation reagent (Life Technologies™, Rockville, MD). RT-PCR reactions were performed as described above, and PCR of goose parvovirus utilized the same conditions as the other viruses, however, 100 ng of total DNA was used as the template for these reactions. Fig. 3A shows that the primers MKCAP8 and MKCAP19 only produced the expected 849 bp amplicon with the astrovirus inoculated SPF embryo intestines RNA. The same is true with primers MKPOL10 and MKPOL11 (Fig. 3B) ; the 802 bp amplification product is only detected in the astrovirus inoculated SPF embryo intestines. These data show these primers specifically detect the presence of TAstV.
