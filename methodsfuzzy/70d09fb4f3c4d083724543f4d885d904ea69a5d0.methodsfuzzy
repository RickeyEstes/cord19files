From October 2013 to June 2016 pilgrims and people returning from the Middle East presented with respiratory symptoms and having an epidemiological link were enrolled through active screening at the point of entry. After risk assessment by the medical team, suspected patients were admitted to the Kurmitola General Hospital isolation unit. In addition, travelers arriving with no clinical presentation received a health card mentioning the sign and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection. Self reported cases who developed symptoms within 14 days of arrival were included in sample collection along with admitted patients. The health care providers were instructed to use WHO standard Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including N95 masks during handling of the patients.
