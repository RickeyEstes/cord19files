After aerosol sample collection, all samples were handled immediately in the BSL-2 laboratory of Wuhan University. The 25, 37mm and 80 mm filter samples were dissolved in deionized water, then TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) was added to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 viruses and extract RNA according to the manufacturer's instruction. First strand cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript RT kit (TakaRa). Optimized ddPCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses following our previous study. 10 Analysis of the ddPCR data was performed with QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad). The concentration reported by the procedure equals copies of template per microliter of the final 1x ddPCR reaction, which was normalized to copies m -3 in all the results, and hence the virus or viral RNA concentration in aerosol is expressed in copies m -3 hereafter. A detailed protocol is provided in Supplementary Appendix.
