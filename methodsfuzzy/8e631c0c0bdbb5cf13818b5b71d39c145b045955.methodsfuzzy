A number of high throughput technologies have been developed to study the epigenetic landscape and epigenetic modifications genome-wide and on sequence-specific levels ( Figure 3 ). control epigenetic pathways, like DNMTs and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), thus controlling chromatin structure by regulating by regulating histone modifier molecules. The expression of miRNAs on the other hand is regulated by histone modification and DNA methylation, forming an epigenetics-miRNA regulatory circuit [73] . A number of high throughput technologies have been developed to study the epigenetic landscape and epigenetic modifications genome-wide and on sequence-specific levels ( Figure 3 ). ) that are associated with functional gene components (dashed arrow ), like promoters, transcriptional start sites, enhancers, gene bodies, slicing sites, and transcriptional end sites [43] . TSS: transcription start site; TF: transcription factor; TFBS: transcription factor binding site; FAIRE: formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements; ChIP: chromatin immuno-precipitation; MeDIP: methylated DNA immunoprecipitation.
