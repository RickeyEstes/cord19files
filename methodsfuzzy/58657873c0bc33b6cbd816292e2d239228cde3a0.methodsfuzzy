Study cohort and sample collection. We collected respiratory samples from the clinical microbiology laboratory at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a large tertiary referral teaching hospital in Southeast England. We worked with anonymized residual material from throat and nose swabs generated as a result of routine clinical investigations between January and May 2018. Samples were collected using a sterile polyester swab inoculated into 1 to 3 ml of sterile viral transport medium (VTM), using a standard approach described on the CDC website (28) . During the study, respiratory samples submitted to the clinical diagnostic laboratory were routinely tested by a PCR-based test using the GeneXpert assay (Cepheid) to detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The workflow is shown in Fig. 1 . Samples from patients in designated high-risk locations (hematology, oncology, and critical care) were tested using the BioFire FilmArray (bioMérieux) to detect an expanded panel of bacterial and viral pathogens. Quantitative data (cycle threshold [C T ]) were generated by the GeneXpert assay, and we used the influenza virus C T value to estimate the viral titers in clinical samples. Using the GeneXpert assay, up to 40 PCR cycles are performed before a sample is called negative (i.e., positives have a C T value of Ͻ40). Quantification was not available for the BioFire results. For methodological assessment, we focused on four categories of samples, as follows: positive pool, negative pools, individual positive samples, and individual negative samples. For the positive pool, we pooled 19 throat swab samples that had tested positive for influenza A virus in the clinical diagnostic laboratory to provide a large enough sample to assess reproducibility (Fig. 1B) . For the negative pools, we generated three pools of throat swab samples that had tested negative for influenza virus (consisting of 24, 38, and 38 individual samples) (Fig. 1B) . For the individual positive samples, we included 40 individual samples (35 throat swabs and 5 nasal swabs) that had tested positive for influenza A or B virus, selected to represent the widest range of GeneXpert assay C T values (13.5 to 39.3; valid test result range, 12 to 40). For the individual negative samples, we selected 10 individual throat swab samples that were influenza virus negative. Quantification of viral RNA in samples. We quantified viral titers in Hazara virus stocks and pooled influenza A virus-positive throat swabs by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), using previously described assays and standards (29, 30) . Optimization of methods. Prior to establishing the protocol detailed in full below, we assessed the impact of two possible optimization steps, centrifugation versus filtration and reduced time for cDNA synthesis. For centrifugation versus filtration, we investigated two approaches to deplete human/ bacterial nucleic acid from our samples, i.e., filtration of the raw sample via a 0.4-m filter (Sartorius) before further processing versus using a hard spin (16,000 ϫ g for 2 min). cDNA libraries for this comparison were produced as described previously (20) . For the reduced time for cDNA synthesis, to assess the possibility of time saving in the cDNA synthesis steps, we compared performance of the previously described protocol (20) to that of a modified version with two alterations, first using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) in place of SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher) for reverse transcription, with the incubation time reduced from 60 min to 10 min at 42°C, and second, reducing the cDNA amplification PCR extension cycling time from 5 min to 2 min. Positive control. Prior to nucleic acid extraction, each sample was spiked with Hazara virus virions to a final concentration of 10 4 genome copies per ml as a positive internal control. This is an enveloped negative-stranded RNA virus (genus Orthonairovirus, order Bunyavirales) with a trisegmented genome of 11,980, 4,575, and 1,677 nucleotides in length (GenBank accession numbers KP406723 to KP406725). It is nonpathogenic in humans and would therefore not be anticipated to arise in any of our clinical samples. Cultured virions from an SW13 cell line were provided by the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV; catalog no. 0408084v). Nucleic acid extraction. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 ϫ g for 2 min. The supernatant was eluted without disturbing the pelleted material and was used in nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 100 l of supernatant using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) eluting in 50 l of H 2 O, followed by a DNase treatment with Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was purified and concentrated to 6 l using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research), following the manufacturer's instructions. Randomly amplified cDNA was prepared for each sample using a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach, adapted from our previously described workflow (20) , based on the round A/B methodology (23) . For reverse transcription, 4 l of RNA and 1 l of primer A (5=-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3=, 40 pmol/l) (23) were mixed and incubated for 5 min at 65°C and then cooled to room temperature. First-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 2 l SuperScript IV first-strand buffer, 1 l of 12.5 mM dinucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.5 l of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 l H 2 O, and 0.5 l SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher) before incubation for 10 min at 42°C. Second-strand synthesis was performed by the addition of 1 l Sequenase buffer, Clinical sample collection (orange), clinical diagnostic testing (yellow), sample processing and sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (blue), and processing of sequence data (purple). (B) Outline of pooled influenza virus-positive samples into an influenza virus-negative background to generate various titers of influenza virus (from 0 to 10 6 genome copies/ml), undertaken in triplicate, and spiked with a standard titer of Hazara virus control at 10 4 genome copies/ml. FluA, influenza A virus. 3.85 l H 2 O, and 0.15 l Sequenase (Affymetrix) prior to incubation for 8 min at 37°C, followed by the addition of 0.45 l Sequenase dilution buffer and 0.15 l Sequenase and a further incubation at 37°C for 8 min. Amplification of cDNA was performed in triplicate using 5 l of the reaction mixture as input to a 50-l AccuTaq LA (Sigma) reaction mixture, according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 1 l primer B (5=-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-3=) (23) , with PCR cycling conditions of 98°C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 50°C for 20 s, and 68°C for 2 min, followed by 68°C for 10 min. Amplified cDNA was pooled from the triplicate reaction mixtures, purified using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and quantified using a Qubit high-sensitivity double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) kit (Thermo Fisher), both according to the manufacturers' instructions. Nanopore library preparation and sequencing. Multiplex sequencing libraries were prepared using 250 ng of cDNA from up to 12 samples as input to the SQK-LSK108 or SQK-LSK109 kit and barcoded individually using the EXP-NBD103 Native barcodes (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and a modified One-pot protocol (https://www.protocols.io/view/one-pot-ligation-protocol-for-oxford-nanopore-libr -k9acz2e). Libraries were sequenced on FLO-MIN106 flow cells on the MinION Mk1b or GridION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), with sequencing proceeding for 48 h. Samples were batched according to the GeneXpert C T value (see File S1 in the supplemental material). Illumina methods. Nextera XT V2 kit (Illumina) sequencing libraries were prepared using 1.5 ng of amplified cDNA, as per the manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced on a 2 ϫ 150-bp paired-end Illumina MiSeq run by the Genomics Services Development Unit of Public Health England. Bioinformatic analysis. Nanopore reads were base called using Guppy (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Output base called fastq files were demultiplexed using Porechop v0.2.3 (https:// github.com/rrwick/Porechop). The reads were first taxonomically classified against the RefSeq database using Centrifuge v1.0.3 (31) . The reads were then mapped against the reference sequence selected from the Centrifuge report using Minimap2 v2.9 (31, 32) . A draft consensus sequence was generated by using a majority voting approach to determine the nucleotide at each position. The resulting draft consensus sequences were subjected to a BLAST search against an influenza virus sequence database that included Ͼ2,000 H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza virus sequences between 2018 and 2019 and were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database (33) . The reads were again mapped against the reference sequence using Minimap2 v2.9, and the number of mapped reads was calculated using SAMtools v1.5 (34) and Pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam). The subtype of the influenza A virus derived from each clinical sample was determined by the subtypes of the HA and NA reference sequences. A consensus sequence was built using Nanopolish v0.11.0 (35, 36) and the margin_cons.py script (37) (https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline). For the Illumina data, reads were quality trimmed to a minimum score of Q30 across the read with Trimmomatic (38) . BWA-MEM v0.7.15 (39) was used to align the reads to reference genomes using MEM defaults. SAMtools v1.4 was used to compute the percent reads mapped and coverage depth (34) . Mapping consensuses for Illumina sequencing were generated using QuasiBam (40) . Maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated for the HA gene segment using RAxML v8.2.10 (41), in which a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution and a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites were applied. Sequence alignments were performed by using MUSCLE v3.8 (42) . Ferret study. We applied our sequencing approach to residual samples collected in a previous time course experiment undertaken in a controlled laboratory environment (43) . We tested ferret nasal saline wash samples from three independent animals over an 8-day time course, from 3 days prior to first exposure with influenza H1N1pdm09 virus and at days 1, 2, 3, and 5 postinfection. Sampling and plaque assays of the viral titer were described previously (43) . Ethics approval. The study of anonymized discarded clinical samples was approved by the London-Queen Square Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/1420). Ferret samples were residual samples from an existing study (43) for which the project license was reviewed by the local Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board of Public Health England (Porton) and subsequently granted by the Home Office. Data availability. Following the removal of human reads, our sequence data have been uploaded to the European Bioinformatics Institute (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) under BioProject number PRJEB32861.
