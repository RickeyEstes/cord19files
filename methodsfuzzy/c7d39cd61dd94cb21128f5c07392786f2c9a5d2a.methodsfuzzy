Antibody: Antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine group A rotavirus (pGARV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were kindly provided by the Division of Swine Infectious Diseases, National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Monoclonal antibodies against histidine (His) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags were obtained from Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Synthesis and expression of the PDCoV N gene: The nucleotide sequence of the entire N gene of PDCoV was obtained from the GenBank database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (accession no. JQ065043). The nucleotide sequence of the PDCoV N gene containing 5′ and 3′ BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, was synthesized based on the codon usage bias of Escherichia coli. The synthesized PDCoV N gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vectors pET-32a and pGEX-6P-1 so that it was tagged with His and GST, respectively. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and then, N gene expression was induced using 1.0 mM/l isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside at 37°C for 4 hr. Protein expression was analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Moreover, recombinant N proteins were purified according to the method described by Zhu et al. [24] . The recombinant N proteins of PDCoV were named rPDCoV-N. Western blotting of the rPDCoV-N protein: Purified rPD-CoV-N proteins with His or GST-tags were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). The NC membrane was blocked using 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C for 1 hr and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the His-tag (1:1,000 dilution in PBS) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the GST-tag (1:1,000 dilution in PBS) at 37°C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS, the membrane was incubated in PBS containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution) at 37°C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the membrane was incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Biotopped, Beijing, China) at room temperature for 3 min, and peroxidase-mediated luminescence was digitally captured using the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad) and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Screening of PDCoV-positive and PDCoV-negative sera: To collect PDCoV-negative and PDCoV-positive serum samples, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect PDCoV in pig farms in Heilongjiang province. Briefly, rectal swab samples were collected from sows and piglets in diarrhea-affected and non-affected pig farms in Heilongjiang province from September 2014 to December 2014. Viral RNA in each sample was extracted using the TIANamp Virus RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.). The cDNA was synthesized by (RNase H-) Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR amplifications were conducted using primers specific for the PDCoV M gene (67F, 5′-ATCCTCCAAGGAGGCTATGC-3′ and 560R, 5′-GCGAATTCTGGATCGTTGTT-3′) according to the protocol described by Wang et al. [20] . Moreover, the serum samples, which were collected from PDCoV-positive and PDCoV-negative farms, were tested by western blot using rPDCoV-N proteins with His-tag and GST-tag, respectively. Briefly, purified rPDCoV-N proteins with a His-tag and GST-tag were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, respectively, and then transferred to an NC membrane. After blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, the NC membrane was incubated with pig serum samples (1:200 dilution in PBS) at 37°C for 1 hr. After washing three times with PBS, the membrane was incubated in PBS containing HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG (1:5,000 dilution) at 37°C for 1 hr. The peroxidase-mediated luminescence was digitally captured using the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad) and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). The serum sample, which was collected from a PDCoV-positive and diarrheaaffected farm and can recognize purified rPDCoV-N proteins with either a His-tag and GST-tag, was used as a positive control in the ELISAs. In addition, a total of 56 serum samples, which were collected from piglets before eating colostra in a PDCoV-negative and diarrhea-unaffected pig farm and can not recognize purified rPDCoV-N proteins with either a His-tag and GST-tag, were used as negative sera in ELISAs. rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures: The conditions of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, including the concentrations of coated antigen, blocking solution, sera and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG, as well as their incubation times, were optimized according to the P/N value (the OD 450 value of the PDCoV-positive serum/the OD 450 value of the PDCoV-negative serum). The best reaction conditions for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA were as follows. ELISA plate (Costar, Corning, NY, U.S.A.) wells were coated with 1 µg/ml of purified Histagged rPDCoV-N in 0.05 mol/l carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C for 12 hr and blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 37°C for 2 hr. After washing four times with PBST, 100 µl of the test antisera, diluted 1:200, was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The plates were washed four times and incubated with 100 µl of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG diluted 1:5,000 in PBST at 37°C for 1 hr. After adding 100 µl of a 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution and incubating at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µl of 2 M H 2 SO 4 , and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Determination of the cut-off value for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: The 56 PDCoV-negative serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions were the same as those described for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. Each sample was tested three times, and the mean OD 450 value was used for analysis. The result for each sample was converted into a percent reactivity (PR) value based on the formula: PR value=[(the |OD 450 value of the tested sample−the OD 450 value of the negative control)|/(the OD 450 value of the positive control−the OD 450 value of the negative control)] × 100%. The PR cut-off value was determined as the mean PR value of the 56 PDCoV-negative sera + 2 × the standard deviation. Specificity test: To evaluate the specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, antisera against PEDV, TGEV, PRoV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions were the same as those used for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. The PR value of the test samples was calculated. Each sample was tested three times, and the mean PR value was used to determine whether the sample was positive or negative. Validation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA: To evaluate the feasibility of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA method, a total of 62 serum samples were randomly selected from six pig farms in Heilongjiang Province; 30 serum samples were collected from three diarrhea-free pig farms, and 32 serum samples were collected from three diarrhea-affected farms. These serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. Each sample was tested three times, and the mean PR value was used to determine whether samples were positive or negative. Meanwhile, 62 serum samples were subjected to western blotting using purified, GST-tagged rPDCoV-N. The western blotting procedure was the same as described above. To evaluate the cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated using the results of the western blotting as the standard for negative and positive determination. The statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS software (Version 11.5 for windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Detection of PDCoV in field samples by the PDCoV-N-ELISA: A total of 319 serum samples were collected from sows in 15 farms in Heilongjiang province from January 2014 to June 2015, of which 210 serum samples were collected from 9 farms without occurrence of diarrhea, and 109 serum samples were collected from 6 farms with occurrence of diarrhea. All serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. The reaction conditions were the same as those used for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. In the rPDCoV-N-ELISA, each sample was tested three times, and the mean PR value was used to determine whether a sample was positive or negative.
