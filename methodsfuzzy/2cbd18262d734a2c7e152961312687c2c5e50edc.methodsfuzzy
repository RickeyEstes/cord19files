Patients, specimen collection and titration for specific antibodies. Forty-six patients visiting this outpatient clinic for the acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media were studied. They experienced sudden appearance of otorrhea from the middle ear cavity having been dry or suddenly increased otorrhea. Peripheral blood samples were collected and titrated for specific antibodies to such viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) that were suspected of infecting the respiratory system. Blood was sampled again three to four weeks later from 26 cases. Blood sampling was repeated at intervals of a month whenever possible. The first and the subsequent samples were examined in the same way. From the other 20 cases, paired samples were not obtainable. When blood samples were collected for the first titration of the specific antibodies, it was attempted to isolate the same viruses and M. pneumoniae and also other bacteria from otorrhea and pharyngeal mucous scraping. Ten patients with chronic otitis media with little otorrhea or with the dry tympanic cavity served as controls. The serum samples were titrated with the following viruses and M. pneumoniae by the method indicated: Complement fixation test (CF): Influenza virus A, B. Adenovirus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Hemagglutination inhibition test (HI): Parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, 4. Neutralization test (NT): Echovirus 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 23. Reovirus. Coxsackievirus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Mycoplasma pneumonia: CF. The titrations of serum samples for specific antibodies to viruses and Mycoplasma and isolation of bacteria were performed at the Central Laboratory of this Hospital. Isolation and identification of viruses. To isolate virus and bacteria, otorrhea specimens were collected by the aspiration technique detailed elsewhere (SUGIYAMA, TANABE, CHANG, and NAKAI, 1981) and specimens from the pharynx were taken with swabs. These specimens were each inoculated into HEK and MK tubes, which were immediately sent to Special Reference Laboratory, Tokyo for virus isolation. At this laboratory, small aliquots of each medium were inoculated without delay into tubes of MA104, WI38, Vero and Hep-2. All cell cultures (HEK, MK, MA104, WI38, Vero and Hep-2) were incubated at 33°C on a roller drum and examined every day for the cytopathic effect (CPE). The virus multiplication was confirmed by CPE and haemadsorption. Haemadsorption, using guinea pig erythrocytes incubated at 4°C for 20 min and at room temperature for an hour, was performed on all cell cultures before passaging into fresh cells. Cultures were considered to be negative when there was no evidence for CPE and for haemadsorption after three blind passages. The isolates were identified by the neutralization, hemagglutination-inhibition, and complement fixation tests.
