General PCR products were prepared using proofreading Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) and oligonucleotide primers from Integrated DNA Technologies, unless otherwise stated. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. PCR products were purified and gel-extracted using kits from either Qiagen or Geneaid. DNA sequences of all constructs were verified using an Applied Biosystems Model 3100 DNA sequencer. E. coli strain DH5 alpha was used as host for molecular cloning. Yeast strains S. cerevisiae YVH10 or P. pastoris SuperMan5 (Research Corporation Technologies) were used as hosts for soluble protein secretion and S. cerevisiae EBY100 for cell surface display.
