We retrospectively analyzed 109 patients who were admitted to Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center from January 2010 to December 2017, and whose differential diagnosis included acute progressive (! 30 days) ILDs and pneumonia. All patients had been provided with a diagnosis on discharge. During the hospitalization period, respiratory physicians licensed by the Japanese Respiratory Society performed BAL according to conventional methods (2) on these patients for differential diagnosis. The obtained BALF was transported on dry ice, stored at -70ÂºC, and used for the detection of respiratory pathogens on a Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a multiplex, realtime PCR (RT-PCR) using an FTD Resp 21 Kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta). The kit detects the following respiratory pathogens: influenza A and B viruses; coronaviruses (CoV) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A/B (hMPV); rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B; adenovirus; enterovirus; human parechovirus (HPeV); bocavirus; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. An EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 was used for nucleic acid extraction (Quiagen). A threshold cycle value of <33 was considered to be a positive result in the RT-PCR, as indicated in the instruction manual. Two experienced radiologists (N. T. and T. K.) who were blinded to all clinical information independently reviewed the high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans. These observers were asked about the presence of 17 findings: consolidation and GGOs (and their distribution), halo sign, inverted halo sign, cavitation, centrilobular nodules, mass, tree-in-bud sign, intralobular reticulation, honeycombing, diffuse bronchial wall thickening, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (minimal diameter " 10 mm), and cardiomegaly. The pathological findings were reviewed by a pathologist (Y. S). Then, in November 2018, a multidisciplinary diagnosis (final diagnosis) was established based on the laboratory, pathological and radiological findings, PCR results, and the clinical course by a review panel composed of pulmonary physicians (N. T and N. K), radiologists (T. K and N. T), and a pathologist (Y. S). A multidisciplinary diagnosis of viral pneumonia was made based on a positive virus PCR result, a compatible clinical course, and histological and radiological findings. In contrast, we considered that virus colonization had occurred if patients showed findings that were unlikely to indicate viral pneumonia, and an alternative diagnosis was made by a review panel. In the present study, patients with a diagnosis of AFOP, COP, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) were classified into the same category because of their overlapping histological patterns (3) . The diagnostic criteria of the established guidelines (3) (4) (5) were also considered in the multidisciplinary diagnosis. Causative microorganisms of pneumonia were defined using conventional methods that have been reported previously (6) . As a control, BALF samples of 40 patients with chronic pulmonary diseases [more than several months (or years) from the onset], such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (n=3), sarcoidosis (n=8), fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (IP) (n=7), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (n=1), connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) (n= 7), recurrent relapse of COP (n=13), or radiation-primed organizing pneumonia (OP) (n=1) without any acute symptoms were analyzed with the virus PCR test. Virus colonization was defined when the result of a virus PCR test was positive in patients with diseases other than viral pneumonia, as diagnosed by a multidisciplinary diagnosis. Treatment failure was defined as persistence/reappearance of fever and symptoms or hemodynamic instability, the development or worsening of respiratory failure (PaO2<60 Torr or saturation <90% at an FIO2 of 0.21), radiographic progression, or the appearance of new infectious foci, as described in a previous report (7) , whereas treatment was considered effective based on the improvement of subjective feelings, oxygenation, and chest imaging findings in cases that did not satisfy the definitions of treatment failure. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center.
