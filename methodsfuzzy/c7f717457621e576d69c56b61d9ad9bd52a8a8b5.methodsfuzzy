Total nucleic acid was extracted from respiratory specimens using QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Crawley, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out in order to detect influenza A (a generic assay and a H1N1/2009 specific assay [7] ), B and C, RSV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus (229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43), adenovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The oligonucleotide primers and probe (TIB-MOL-BIOL, Berlin, Germany) are outlined in Table 3 . The primers and probes for the influenza A generic assay and the H1N1/2009 specific assay are described elsewhere [7] . These assays have been developed by the WOSSVC and used as the frontline test for respiratory samples since 2005. All assays have been shown to be sensitive and specific by in-house development procedures and via participation in numerous external quality assessment schemes (EQA), including those provided by the WHO, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), and Quality Controls for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD). All assays used the primers at a final concentration of 0.4 μM and the probe at 0.2 μM in a 15 μl reaction volume. One-step rtRT-PCR was performed on 6 μl of RNA extract with the Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen life technologies, Paisley, UK) on an ABI Prism 7500 SDS real-time platform (Applied Biosystems). The following thermal profile was used: a single cycle of reverse transcription for 15 min at 50°C, 2 min at 95°C for reverse transcriptase inactivation and DNA polymerase activation followed by 40 amplification cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 34 secs at 60°C each (annealing-extension step). Data acquisition occurred at the annealing step of each cycle, and the threshold cycle (Ct) for each sample was calculated by determining the point at which the fluorescence exceeded the threshold limit.
