To investigate the spatial associations of urban tourism phenomena, a set of logistic models is used with the assistance of ArcGIS 9.0. We selected Hong Kong as an example because Hong Kong is a typical urban tourism destination. Tourism in Hong Kong has developed dramatically since 1957, when the Hong Kong Tourist Association (now known as the Hong Kong Tourism Board) was constituted, and the city has now established itself as an internationally renowned destination. According to the most recent statistics released by Euro monitor International (2013)the world's leading independent provider of business intelligence on industries, countries, and consumers -Hong Kong was ranked as the top city tourism destination in 2011. One of the major characteristics of tourism in urban areas is that it is only one of many functions fulfilled by a city. Tourists share or compete with local residents for many spaces and services (Hammes, 1994) and the competition is particularly intense in Hong Kong which has scarce resources. Unlike many other urban tourism destinations, Hong Kong's compact nature restricts its capacity to expand to suburban areas, and all development is confined to the limited land available. This makes Hong Kong a suitable place to conduct the study as the spatial and functional association between tourism-related phenomena and their surrounding environment is more evident and intense.
