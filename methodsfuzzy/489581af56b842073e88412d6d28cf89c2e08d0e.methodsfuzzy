Weekly case reports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were digitized from the WHO situation report dated from 1 October 2014 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/) (figure 3). To compare our predictions to those of previous reports [16] , we also aggregated those data to form a regional epidemic curve for 'West Africa'. In Guinea, this outbreak was taken to have started in the week ending 5 January 2014 and in Sierra Leone in that ending 8 June 2014. In Liberia, the outbreak was who.int/ en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-andresponse/outbreak-news/4072-ebola-virus-disease-liberia.html), but few cases were reported until June; therefore, the week ending 1 June was deemed the start of the Liberian outbreak for simulation purposes. The data in figure 4 was downloaded from the repository maintained by C. M. Rivers (https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola) and ultimately derived from reports by the health ministries of the republics of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
