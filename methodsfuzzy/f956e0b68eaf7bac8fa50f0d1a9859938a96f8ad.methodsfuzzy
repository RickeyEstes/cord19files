At present, a reliable diagnosis of prion disease is possible only through autopsy since there is no approved method for detecting prion levels, which are too low to be detected by any test, in the peripheral nervous systems of live animals or humans. Thus, tissues of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, obtained at autopsy are used for prion diagnostic tests using immunology-based techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting; a histopathological test is then performed for confirmation. However, the final confirmation is obtained by performing a bioassay to assess the infectivity of the pathogen; this is the most sensitive test and uses a transgenic mouse with the human prion gene to detect pathogenic PrP d by observing the infection. Moreover, DNA sequencing for determination of genetic variations is also considered. The standard diagnosis procedures for BSE suggested by the OIE include ELISA, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical methods to test brain tissues (Table 4 ). However, simple immunological tests to detect BSE cannot distinguish PrP Sc from PrP C . Therefore, the target specimen should be processed by proteinase K (PK) first, and then the remaining PK-resistant prions such as PrP Sc are detected. For rapid testing, 15 rapid diagnosis kits are available; the tests most frequently used around the world are shown in Table 5 . However, authorized tests that use antigeneantibody reactions are good for highly concentrated specimens, such as the brain and spinal cord, since the amount detectable by ELISA-based procedures is so low that they cannot be applied to actual blood specimens, through which the disease can be transmitted. Therefore, many scientific efforts have been made to overcome this shortcoming, such as protein misfolding cyclic amplification, which uses the replication of the conformation of a protein [65] , and real-time immuno-polymerase chain Formalin-fixed brain tissue Spongiform in brain tissue Immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed brain tissue PrP Sc antigen Western blot Fresh brain tissue PrP Sc antigen Electron microscopy Fresh brain tissue Scrapie-associated fibril Bioassay Fresh tissue PrP Sc and infectivity BSE Z bovine spongiform encephalopathy; ELISA Z enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. reaction (PCR), which utilizes a combination of antibody features and the sensitivity of PCR. Recently, realtime quaking-induced conversion has been developed for an assay in which disease-associated prion protein initiates a rapid conformational transition in recombinant prion protein, resulting in the formation of amyloid that can be monitored in real time [66] . Nevertheless, although these new diagnostic methods have more than 100 times the sensitivity of the conventional ELISA method, they still have unstable backgrounds or give false positives, making it difficult to use them as authorized tests. However, diagnostic methods to determine pathogenic PrP d based on PK resistance are limited, since PKsensitive prions with pathogenic characteristics have been found [67] . Conventional tests for BSE or vCJD cannot detect PK-sensitive prions. Furthermore, some cases diagnosed as dementia may actually be cases of vCJD [68] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel diagnostic tests that are faster and more accurate in detecting new types of prions [69] .
