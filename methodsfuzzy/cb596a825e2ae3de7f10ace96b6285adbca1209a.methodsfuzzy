During the period July to November 1991, diarrheal stools of 233 children and 172 adults who were hospitalized at the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore, were examined for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens and for yeasts. Formed stools of 86 subjects hospitalized for non-diarrheal causes were also examined for yeasts. Histories accompanying specimens were not adequate to distinguish between community acquired and hospital acquired diarrhea. Between November 1992 and mid January 1993, 460 diarrheal stools were examined for Blastocystis hominis employing a simple sedimentation method only, as no positives were found when wet mounts were examined between July and November 1991. At the Department of Microbiology, NUH, bacterial pathogens were cultured on media from Oxoid Ltd (Basingstoke, UK) by direct plating on MacConkey agar (MA), Desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA), Thiosulphate citrate bile salt sucrose agar (TCBS), Campylobacter blood free selective agar (CBS) as well as sub cultured from Selenite-F broth and Alkaline peptone water onto DCA and TCBS respectively. CBS was incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 42°C for 48 hrs and other media at 37°C overnight. Pathogens were identified by conventional biochemical and serological tests. Yersinia enterocolitica was not tested for as previous studies have not shown it to be an important diarrheal pathogen in Singapore. Tests for rotavirus by latex agglutination (LA,-Rotalex, Orion Diagnostics, Espoo, Finland) and for Clostridium difficile toxin 2 were done only on request. Test for rotavirus is requested in the case of most pediatric diarrheas. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were sought only in stools of infants, using antisera from Wellcome Diagnostics (Dartford, UK). Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (0157: H7) was not looked for. The simple sedimentation method for B. hominis was also done at NUH. Briefly, one part of stool in 3 parts of eosin formalin fixative was mixed, filtered through wet gauze and allowed to stand for one hour. Material from the surface of fecal sediment was mixed with a drop of 20070 iodine solution, on a microscope slide, covered with a cover slip and examined under low (lOX) and high (40X) power objectives. Tests for labile toxin producing E.coli (LT -ETEC) were performed at the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo. Stools of 98 children and 70 adults which gave 5 well separated E. coli colonies on MA were selected. Each colony was picked onto a soft agar slant in a screw capped bottle for storale and transport. They were tested for (LT) by a GM-1-ELISA. 3 . Antisera to ETEC-LT was raised in rabbits by immunizing with cholera toxin (Sigma, USA, C 3012). Control ETEC-L T kindly supplied by Dr Peter Echeverria of the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science in Bangkok were used in the test. Microscopy for parasites, yeasts (Light microscope) and viruses (Electronmicroscope (EM) on specimens collected between July and November 1991 were conducted at the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS). For detecting Cryptosporidium oocysts, stools were concentrated by the Sheather's sugar flotation methodS and stained by the modified acid fast stain. 6 A cryptosporidium positive stool was used to establish the technique. Between July and November 1991 B. hominis and helminthic ova were examined for in a wet mount which was scanned sequentially under low power (10x) and high power (40x) objectives. The presence of red cells and/or pus cells was noted but has not been included in this paper. Due to limited time, it was possible to examine only 85 randomly selected diarrheal stools of children for viruses by EM. 7 These included only 3 specimens positive for rotavirus by LA. Dr. E.O. Caul, Public Health Laboratories, Bristol UK, kindly supplied fecal specimens positive for viruses associated with diarrhea, and commented on electronmicrographs. Yeasts were detected by Gram stain of stool smears. The approximate number of yeasts observed per high power (40X) field was noted. A random sample of 57 yeast positive stools which included those with high and low counts were cultured on Sabourad's agar. Isolates were speciated at NUH. 8 Of the tests described above, those for B. hominis, Cryptosporidium, LT-ETEC, EM for viruses and Gram stain for yeasts are not done routinely. Table 1 shows the microorganisms sought and detected in diarrheal stools of children and adults which were collected between July and November 1991.
