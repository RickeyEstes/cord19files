A retrospective chart review study of all confirmed MERS-CoV cases recorded by two tertiary hospitals from the Madinah region from March 2014 to May 2014. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for our study from authorities of both hospitals. A case was confirmed as having infection if MERS-CoV real-time polymerase chain reaction was positive, using the recommended sampling technique (nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients). Extraction of RNA was performed with Roche MagNa Pure LC (RNA viral isolation Kit). Samples were pretreated with lysis according to the manufacturer's instructions [15] . We obtained data about demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory results, diagnosis, incubation period, smoking history, comorbidities, and history of contact with camels or MERS-CoV positive patients in regions within the Madinah area. We recorded the duration of the patient's illness, microbiological test results, and reviewed imaging and treatments received. We also recorded the following outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and survival during hospitalization until the patient is discharged from hospital.
