As summarised above, the various real-time PCR assays provide powerful novel means for the very rapid detection and quantitation of targeted viral nucleic acids in clinical specimens. The real-time PCR assays have opened a new area of molecular diagnosis. However, although it has many advantages, a vulnerable side of the PCR-based diagnostic assays is that the detection efficiency is decreased by the high nucleotide sequence variability (mismatches) in the genomes of the various variants of the targeted virus(es). The increasing numbers of mismatches between target and primer sequences result in decreased amplification or even in negative PCR results. The variability of the target nucleotide sequences might be associated with various phenomena, such as mutations, deletions or duplications in the genomes of the sought viruses. Similarly, weaker or negative PCR results may occur when trying to amplify the genomes of newly emerging genomic variants of a virus genus. The PCR analysis of emerging new viruses may yield negative results, due to the novel nucleotide sequences in these viral genomes. Considering these vulnerable sides of the PCR-based diagnostic assays, there is a high need to develop further approaches of molecular diagnosis. There is a strong tendency today to further increase the number of various methods, in order to strengthen the molecular diagnosis, to reduce the diagnosis time and to improve the diagnostic complexity. We list several examples here, including the development processes of our group and its partners.
