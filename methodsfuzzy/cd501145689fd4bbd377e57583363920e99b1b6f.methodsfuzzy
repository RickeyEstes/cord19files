The information retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan was fully representative of all population groups, as over 99% of the population of Taiwan is included in the government-run health insurance program (National Health Research Institutes, ROC, 2011). We analyzed data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) from 1996 to 2010 released by the National Health Research Institutes for public research purposes. We used the administrative claims data from the NHI form 1996 to 2010 for our analysis. In this study, we analyzed data for all patients who received a primary TKR procedure (ICD-9-CM) procedure code 81.54 from 1996 to 2010. All TKR procedures performed for the treatment of chronic or complicated diseases and traffic accidents were excluded from the analysis. We analyzed 154,453 TKR procedures. Research variables in this study also included sex (male and female), age (5 groups: <50 years old, 50-59 years old, 60-69 years old, 70-79 years old, and â‰¥80 years old) and primary diagnoses (4 groups categorized as: OA, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], avascular necrosis [AVN] , and other; the ICD-9-CM codes for primary diagnoses of OA, RA, and AVN were 715.00 to 715.98; 714 and 714.0; and 733.40, 733.42, and 733.49 and other ICD-9CM codes, respectively), cost, average length of stay (ALOS), total charge (million USDs), and expenditure rates of NHI (permillage). To reflect real dollar values, all dollar values at the end of each year were adjusted to 2011 Taiwan currency values. All hospital charges were then converted from Taiwan dollars to US dollars using an exchange rate of 30:1, based on the average exchange rate over the 1996 to 2010 period. For factoring of inflation, the price index has a base year of 2010 (Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, ROC [Taiwan]), previous prices are being compared to prices in that time period. The influences of population characteristics, characteristics of places of care, disease patterns of medical resource utilization (in-hospital medical cost and length of hospital stay), and quality of care (in-hospital mortality and postoperative infections) are described by the number of cases or means with standard deviation. To compare the rates of TKR between covariables, we calculated TKR risk ratios and 95% CIs of these variables (gender, age, age group, and primary diagnoses). Statistical analyzes were conducted using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All tests were 2-sided, and Pvalues of <.05 were considered statistically significant.
