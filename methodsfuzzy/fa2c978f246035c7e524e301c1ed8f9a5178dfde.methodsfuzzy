This method ( Figure 3 ) takes advantage of the fluorescence pattern that is obtained upon incubating cells with DAPI. The procedure includes the following steps: (1) Nuclear DNA is stained with DAPI; within the brightly stained nucleoplasm nucleoli are identified as dark holes where fluorescence intensities are low [11] ( Figure 3a ). The molecule of interest is visualized with a probe that can be distinguished from the DAPI stain. This can be achieved with fluorescent antibodies, tags or any other suitable molecule whose fluorescence does not overlap with the DAPI signal. (2) Images are acquired by techniques that are compatible with computer-based image analyses, such as confocal microscopy or high throughput widefield image acquisition. (3) Images are analyzed with software that can be adapted to the rapid and reliable quantification of pixel intensities in the nucleolus. In Figure 3 , we applied these steps to measure nucleolar pixel intensities in transiently transfected HeLa cells that synthesized a GFP-tagged protein which is located in nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. To measure nucleolar fluorescence, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy [23, 24] and then analyzed with MetaXpress software (see Methods). We combined several functions of this software in an ordered fashion to delimit the nucleolar compartment. In Figure 3a , nucleoli can be discriminated from the surrounding bright nucleoplasm by the decline in DAPI fluorescence (DAPI image). Using this information, dark "holes" are identified within the nucleoplasm by applying the morphology filter Detect dark holes. The Median filter is then applied to the Holes image to reduce noise and false positives (Figure 3b , Additional file 1). As an alternative to the Median filter, the Erode/dilate function can also be used to decrease noise and false positives (see Methods). Once the nucleolar compartments are identified, the software creates segments that represent nucleoli. The generation of segments is based on the size constraints and pixel intensity above background as they are provided by the researcher; this step is carried out for all of the methods illustrated here. The nucleolar segments are overlaid with the DAPI image ( Figure 3c ) and with the probe image after it has undergone statistical correction for background fluorescence (Figure 3c , Stat. correction; see Methods). After this step, fluorescence intensities are measured for the statistical correction image. The table in Figure 3d shows some of the raw data (nucleolar area and pixel intensity) that were obtained after completion of the analysis. Specifically, results for nucleoli labeled in red (2, 4, 5, 9) are displayed in Figure 3d . Applying the same principle as described for Method 1, the distribution of Pol II, or any other marker that is of low abundance in nucleoli, can also be used to identify nucleoli (Additional file 2). This method provides an alternative solution when multiple fluorochromes are used simultaneously and their emission overlaps with the DAPI signal. Under some experimental conditions, reliance on a single nuclear marker may not be sufficient to identify nucleoli with high confidence. Furthermore, visual inspection to exclude false positives is not always feasible, in particular when large numbers of images are generated. To address this problem, we designed an alternative method that combines information from the DAPI as well as Pol II images to identify nucleoli (Figure 4 and Additional file 2). To this end, the arithmetic Add function is applied to DAPI and Pol II images (Methods, Figure 4b ). In the resulting image (Add image) the difference in fluorescence intensity between nucleoli and the surrounding nucleoplasm is greatly enhanced, thereby improving the subsequent detection of nucleoli by the Detect dark holes filter. As shown in Additional file 2, the identification of nucleoli is more accurate for Method 3 when compared to Method 1 or 2. In additional measurements, carried out with more than 20 cells under nonstress conditions, we used DAPI combined with Pol II staining to quantify the pixel intensities for the nucleolar protein RPA194 (a subunit of RNA polymerase I). We chose RPA194 for the quantification, because it is not uniformly distributed in nucleoli and therefore particularly challenging to locate and quantify. For this experiment, the pixel intensities/area obtained for RPA194 with the Detect light holes filter operation was defined as 100%. Using DAPI and the Detect dark holes filter, 67% of the pixel intensities were measured, whereas the quantification based on Pol II and the Detect dark holes filter measured 74% of the fluorescence signal. The combination of the DAPI and Pol II images improved the detection of the RNA polymerase I subunit RPA194 to 80%. Taken together, Method 3 provides an improvement in the signal detection; however, one of the drawbacks of Method 3 is that it reduces the number of additional fluorochromes that can be employed in the same experiment. When the fluorescence in nucleoli is dimmer than in the adjacent nucleoplasm, nucleoli can be delimited with the probe image (Additional file 2). In principle, this is the same procedure as described for Figure 3 . However, the probe image, rather than the DAPI image, defines the nucleolar compartment. If the fluorescence in nucleoli is brighter than in the adjacent nucleoplasm, nucleoli can be identified with the Detect light holes filter (Methods). Once nucleoli have been delimited, the fluorescence intensity in the defined area will be measured. We used this method to identify nucleoli based on their transcriptional activity (see below). In light of the different strategies that can quantify pixel intensities in nucleoli, it was important to compare these methods. In Figure 9 , the same image was used to identify nucleoli based on the DAPI staining. However, different filters were employed to demarcate the nucleolar region. The raw data are depicted for five nucleoli which are numbered in the images. Measurements of pixel intensity/area (Figure 9c ) reveal that similar values are obtained with both protocols for each nucleolus, indicating that these processing operations generate comparable data.
