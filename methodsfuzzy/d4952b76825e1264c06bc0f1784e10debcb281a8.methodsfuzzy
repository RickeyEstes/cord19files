This investigation was conducted for 120 d beginning December 12, 1989 at a commercial calf ranch in southern California. Sixty 1-d-old Holstein bull calves from local dairy farms were assembled at the calf ranch and allocated randomly to five treatment groups of 12 calves each. Each treatment provided the calves with an 18% protein starter ration that was fed for ad libitum intake during the entire investigation from d 1 to 120. The final calculated FG content for each of the treatments was 0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm. The control ration (0 ppm) lacked any cottonseed product. All rations were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. During the investigation, the calves were not fed any hay or ferrous salt supplementation. The total CSM content for rations containing 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm of FG was 31 %. The control ration contained soybean meal (SBM) as the main protein source (Table 1) . Graded Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 75, No. 10, 1992 concentrations of FG for the treatment rations were obtained by mixing two sources of CSM that contained 3850 and 230 ppm as reported by the feed mill. A third source of a 250-ppm CSM was added to balance the total CSM percentage in the rations. The three sources of CSM were analyzed for FG content prior to ration mixing and before the meals were pelleted. Mixed rations containing the CSM pellets and the other feed ingredients were analyzed for FG content three times during the study. The composition of the trace mineral mix and vitamin supplement used in the rations is shown in Table 2 . Feed consumption was measured at five intervals by measuring the total amount fed to all calves of each group. The average daily feed consumption per calf per each group for each time period was determined using the following formula (feed consumed per time period divided by calf days per time period) for each group. Using that formula, multiplied by the calculated FG in each group (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm), an estimate of the accumulated FO intake per group was determined. Feed consumption periods wereÂ°to 36, 37 to 59, 60 to 82, 83 to 93, and 94 to 120 d. Calf days per group was defined as the number of live calves times the number of days that each calf was alive. This calculation equalized and removed any bias of reduced calf numbers occurring during the study. For 3 d after arrival, calves were fed 4 L of colostrum containing >80 mg/ml of Ig measured by colostrometer. At d 4 of age, all calves were switched to 4 Ud of a commercial milk replacer containing .454 kg of replacer in 4 L of water. The calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer twice a day in individual bottles until weaning at d 60. Calves were kept in individual hutches for 1 wk after weaning at which time they were moved by treatment groups to five separate 700-m 2 pens until the completion of the study at 120 d of age. All calves had access to their respective treatment ration from 1 d of age, which was the start of each calf's experimental period. All calves were weighed, and blood was collected at 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 d of age. Hematological (EDTA vacutainers) and serum chemistry (serum from plain vacutainers) tests were conducted on all samples collected. All chemistry tests were conducted on a commer- morbidity and mortality, and 5) tissue gossypol concentrations.
