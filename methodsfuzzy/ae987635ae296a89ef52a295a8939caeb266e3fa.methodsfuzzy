Ideally, in-depth qualitative interviews would be effective in teasing out the nuances in public opinion on SARS. However, there was the ethical issue of exposing interviewers to infection and time and money constraints which prevented us from conducting in-depth interviews over the telephone. Taking into account all these considerations, we opted for the telephone questionnaire survey as this would give us a good overview of public opinion which formed the beginnings of a more in-depth study currently underway (and incomplete) in 2004. After an initial pilot study in early June 2003, the actual telephone survey was conducted in mid-June to end-July 2003 on Singaporeans and permanent residents. A sample frame could not be purchased from Department of Statistics as telephone numbers were required and this would infringe upon the privacy of individuals. We also did not generate a sample frame based on random telephone numbers as the misses would be too problematic given the time and costs constraints faced. We compromised on the snowball method to construct the sample. A team of 69 trained surveyors were asked to use their contacts to get the sample profile assigned to them. Concern about possible biases arising from the use of the snowball method was minimised because the surveyors were instructed to fill their quota according to the sample profile (varying by gender, age, educational background and ethnicity) we gave them. We were also careful in ensuring that the surveyor team was itself diverse. We purposely selected university students of different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. The questionnaire was translated into Mandarin and Malay and the interviews were conducted in these languages and English. Dialect was sometimes used. Indian respondents mostly spoke English or Malay, a common phenomenon in multilingual Singapore. The questionnaire survey comprised 19 questions in total with sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents; the implications of SARS on Singapore's open economy and society; surveillance and control as preventive measures taken to curb SARS; and the spatial avoidance behaviour of the public. Respondents were asked whether they agreed with the measures that were implemented and if they avoided certain places. Many of the issues addressed in the questionnaire are reflective of forum discussions and other reports in the local newspapers. As the study was conducted close to the height of the SARS outbreak, we did not find statistically significant variations across socio-demographic variables. This tallies with the findings of Quah and Lee [39] who reported variations only for the preventive measure of washing hands. More women and people aged above 35 took this preventive measure. A total of 650 surveys were completed of which 634 were successful. The profile of the respondents closely reflects that of the total national population ( Table 2) . Some amount of subjectivity was expected as the respondents knew the interviewers but proper training ensured that objectivity was adhered to as far as possible and the interviewers did not detract from the questionnaire, accounting somewhat for the low rejection rate. This method was advantageous because the interviewers could reconfirm or clarify where inconsistencies crept up. The data were entered into SPSS for analysis. In addition, secondary sources of information were also used. Newspaper reports and public inputs in the form of letters to the press provided valuable sources of information on public discourse.
