Coronaviruses including HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 were tested in NP swabs, stool samples, and whole blood samples (blood was examined for the presence of HCoVs only in children with positive NP swabs and/or stool results) by molecular methods using primers and probes as described by Kuypers et al. [4] . For amplification of 85-100 bp fragments of the coronaviruses' polymerase 1b gene, a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was used in a StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 5 μL of total nucleic acid was added to 15 μL of reaction mixture including 2 × Reaction Mix, SuperScript 1 III RT/Platinum 1 Taq Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an additional 6 mM M g SO 4 . The cycling conditions were universal for all respiratory viruses tested: 20 min at 50°C, 2 min at 95°C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 45 s at 60°C. All NP swabs and stool samples in which HCoVs were established were also tested for the presence of several other viruses. In NP swabs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (Inf A-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV 1-3), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoVs), adenovirus (AdV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) were searched for by real-time RT-PCR [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Stool samples from patients with AGE were tested for the presence of noroviruses of genogroups I and II, human astroviruses, HBoV and AdV using molecular methods as described previously [27, 28, 30, 31] , whereas group A rotavirus and adenovirus type 40/41 were detected by antigen-ELISA Premier Rotaclone and Premier Adenoclone (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH).
