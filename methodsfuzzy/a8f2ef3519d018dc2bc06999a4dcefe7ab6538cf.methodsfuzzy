We conducted the study at the Navajo Nation Animal Control Facility on the Navajo Nation, AZ. All dogs were either surrendered by owners to the Animal Control facility or were captured as feral dogs by Animal Control Officers. A licensed veterinarian (SB) performed a physical examination of all dogs before selection. The first 13 healthy dogs (7 males, 5 females, and 1 unrecorded) that became available were included in the study. Any overtly aggressive dog or a dog with medical issues requiring extensive treatment (i.e., tumors and so on) was excluded. Any dog showing overt symptoms of disease (i.e., symptoms compatible with canine parvovirus infection, canine distemper, tumors, fever, injuries, and so on) were excluded from participation in the study. No advanced diagnostics (i.e., complete blood count and so on) were performed as the objective of the study was to be representative of the free-roaming population. All dogs accepted into the study were vaccinated for canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, adenovirus type 2, coronavirus, and parainfluenza. Testing for heartworm was not necessary as it is not present in the Navajo Nation. All dogs received a broad-spectrum deworming treatment and treatment specifically for tapeworm infection. Because only approximately 50% of the dogs were accustomed to human handling, dogs were grouped (no more than 2 per group) and kenneled by behavior toward the other dogs for 2 weeks to acclimate to other dogs and the presence of humans. Dogs ranged in age from 6 months to 4 years, based strictly on dental wear and condition and body condition score (BCS) ranged from 2 to 5 (maximum: 10). No dog was excluded owing to low BCS. Dogs were housed in kennels consisting of an indoor and outdoor section that were joined by a sliding door used to separate co-kenneled dogs during individual bait trials. Kennel dimensions (length Â width Â height) were 2.0 Â 1.0 Â 1.5 m 3 and 1.8 Â 1.0 Â 2.2 m 3 for the indoor and outdoor sections, respectively. Dogs were fed a daily ration of commercial dog food ("Ol' Roy, Adult;" Wal-Mart, Bentonville, AR), with water available ad libitum. Dogs were housed at the shelter for total of 6 weeks. The bait matrix consisted of food-grade partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening, Microbond Ò wax (International Group, Inc.), stearine, vegetable oil, a food dye, and flavor ingredients (Rosatte et al., 2009) . Commercially produced food-derived products were used to formulate the bait flavors as such products were readily available. All bait flavors were manufactured by Artemis Technologies, Inc., and the recipes are proprietary. A total of 7 flavors were evaluated: bacon, cheese, dog food flavor, hazelnut, sugar-vanilla, peanut butter, and sardine. Sugar-vanilla flavor was selected as the a priori reference bait because it is the standard flavor used for oral rabies vaccination of wildlife in Canada (Rosatte et al., 2009 ). We offered baits as 1.0 Â 1.0 Â 0.5 cm 3 cubes, each weighing 1.0 g. Baits were paired so that each possible combination was represented resulting in 21 pairs of baits with each bait flavor introduced to each dog 6 times. Pairs were randomly assigned to individual dogs and offered at 2 pairs per day (3 pairs on the final study day) for 10 consecutive days. Baits were offered at 09:00 and 15:00 hours with an additional offering at 12:00 hours on the final trial day. Dogs were fed their daily ration 1 hour after the final bait trial, which corresponded to the normal daily feeding schedule. Dogs were exposed to each bait pair until at least 1 of the baits was consumed with a 2-minute time limit. Baits not consumed within the time limit were removed and classified as "not eaten" for that trial. Fresh baits were used for each trial. All dogs were exposed to all bait combinations in a randomized block design with baits as treatments and individual dogs as blocks. The proportion of times each bait flavor was consumed first was calculated and compared using the MIXED procedure with pairwise comparisons using "contrast" statements in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We accepted statistical significance at P value lower than 0.05.
