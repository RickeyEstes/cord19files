-Study design and participants A cross-sectional survey was conducted for three months from April-June 2013, in various dental care facilities in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. Sampling was carried out in two stages-first stage list of dental care facilities (Private, government military and university) in Riyadh city was prepared, second stage DHPs working in these facilities were then selected into the study. List of private hospitals and polyclinics providing dental care in Riyadh city was obtained by using health insurance provider network, and the list of universities providing dental care was obtained by visiting ministry of higher education website of Saudi Arabia. Similarly, list of government armed forces dental care facilities in Riyadh city was also prepared. From among the above mentioned dental care facilities few dental centers were selected randomly by applying lottery method. DHPs including clinical level dental students, interns, dental practitioners and dental auxiliaries working in these facilities were invited to participate in the study. A convenience sampling methodology was utilized to recruit DHPs based on ease of availability during survey period. Trained dental in-terns approached DHPs in their work place and distributed the questionnaires along with required instructions. Confidentiality of the data was assured to DHPs. All the participants were informed about the purpose and scope of the study and those who agreed to sign the consent form were considered in this study. Sample size was determined by using G* power statistical power analysis program 3.1.1 (8) . A sample size of 452 was determined by considering an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.85, and effect size of ρ = 0.14 for a two-tailed Spearman correlation test -Questionnaire design: Instrument developed by Askerian et al. (9) and Jain et al. (10) in line with the CDC guidelines for evaluating awareness of droplet and airborne isolation precautions among dental students and faculty was slightly modified and validated in two steps. Firstly, the study instrument was sent to professionals from public health and dental public health background to give their expert opinion with regards to its ease, relativity and importance. Secondly, pretesting of the questionnaire was carried out by choosing a small sample of DHPs (n=20), who provided their views on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter. Amendments from the participants were considered and incorporated into the questionnaire. After in-depth discussion, questionnaire was finalized by the authors and subsequently a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 50 DHPs by using modified version of the questionnaire to ensuring comprehensibility and reliability. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.80 was obtained which was deemed satisfactory for conducting this study. Questionnaire was divided into four parts. The first part included demographic information of the respondents. Second, third and fourth parts evaluated Knowledge, attitude and practice of DHPs regarding the droplet and airborne isolation precautions by eliciting responses on 11 questions in each section. The knowledge was assessed at three different levels (yes, no, I do not know), and a score of 1 was allocated when the answers to questions were in agreement with the CDC guidelines. Therefore, the score for knowledge ranged between 0 (all wrong answers) to 11 (all correct answers). A cut off level of <7 were set for poor knowledge and ≥7 for good knowledge. Attitude was assessed at three possible levels (very strong, strong and null). The responses very strong and strong were assigned a score of 5 and null response was scored at 1 point. Thus, the aggregate score ranged between 11(all null score) to 55 (all questions responded as strong or very strong). A cut off level of <35 was set for negative attitude and ≥35 for positive attitude. In practice section, four levels of responses (always, often, sometimes and never) were utilized by assigning score of 1 for correct answer and a score of 0 for all other responses. Hence the total practice score ranged 0 to 11. Similarly, A cut off level of <7 were set for poor practice level and ≥7 for good practice. Ethical clearance: Research center of Riyadh Colleges of dentistry and pharmacy formally approved the study. -Statistical Analysis Normality distribution of the data was checked by applying Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests. Both these tests showed significant p value (p<0.05) indicating non-normal distribution of the data. Hence nonparametric tests for inferential statistics were applied. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out by using SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics was performed and data reported as percentage and frequency. Means and standard deviations for the knowledge, attitude and practice scores were computed. Inferential statistics of Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests were applied to study variables. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to compute the correlation between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice and attitude-practice. A two tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical purposes.
