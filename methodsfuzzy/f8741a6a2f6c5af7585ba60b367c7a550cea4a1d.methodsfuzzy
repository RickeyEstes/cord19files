Primer sequences and PCR conditions were obtained for the analysis from the VirOligo database on February 6, 2002. On that date, the VirOligo database covered a total of 1685 articles whose abstracts appeared in PubMed before December 19, 2001. The articles contained 3985 published virus-specific oligonucleotide sequences and 2300 PCR and hybridization conditions for detection of the viruses for alcelaphine herpesvirus, bovine adenovirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus (BHV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMV), variola (smallpox) virus, cowpox virus, and human adenovirus. Duplicated primer sequences were eliminated from the analyzed set. The frequencies of occurrence of each of the 64 possible 3 0 end triplets, defined as the number of occurrences of a triplet divided by the total number of primers!100 (%), were calculated. For selected viruses, the frequency distributions of overlapping triplets in the genome sequences were calculated for comparison with the triplet frequencies of the 3 0 ends of primers specific for those viruses. The viruses were BHV-1 (GenBank Accession No. AJ004801; genome size 135 kb), BVDV (AF220247; 12 kb) and FMV (AF377945; 8 kb). Statistical analyses were performed by Analysis ToolPak provided by Microsoft Excel 2000.
