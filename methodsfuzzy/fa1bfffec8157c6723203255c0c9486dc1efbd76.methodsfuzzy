Two-tailed Student's t-test, ANOVA test (oneway) and Bonferroni test evaluated differences between means. In particular, Bonferroni test was also used to simultaneously compare all experimental groups before and after treatments. Correlations were determined by linear regression analysis by the least square method. Differences were evaluated by analysis of covariance. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. Differences were significant when PB 0.05.
