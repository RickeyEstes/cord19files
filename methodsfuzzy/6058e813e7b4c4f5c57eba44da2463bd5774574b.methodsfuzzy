Cell and virus strains. Mouse cell lines, L-2 (Rothfels et aL, 1959) , LM (Merchant and Hellman, 1962) , and 17CL-1 (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972) were used for studies of virus growth. Virus was propagated and plaque assayed (Lucas et ak, 1977) in L-2 cells. Virus strains MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-S, A59, and JHM were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Assags of virus growth. Confluent monolayer cultures of L-2, LM, and 17CL-1 cells in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Falcon) were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5 with one of the five MHV strains. After 1 hr adsorption at 37", monolayers were freed from residual inocula by thrice rinsing with minimal essential medium (MEM) and subsequently incubated at 37" with 5 ml of MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Aliquots were removed from the supernatant media at 4-hourly intervals and quantitated for infectious virus by plaque assay. Isolation of S2P-lubeled A59-infected cell RNA and the preparation of complementav DNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared against isolated 0.8 X 106dalton, A59-virus-specific, nucleocapsid protein messenger RNA (mRNA) as previously described . Hybridization kinetic experiments and analysis using gel electrophoresis and RNA transfer procedures. For the preparation of infected cell RNA, monolayer cultures (approximately 108 cells) of L-2 cells were infected at a m.o.i. of 0.5-l with MHV. Actinomycin D (1 pg/ml) was present in the culture medium from 1 hr postinfection (p.i.) until harvesting (9-10 hr p.i.) at which time the cell monolayers were completely fused. Infected and uninfected cell RNA were isolated as described . For the analysis of hybridization kinetics (Varmus et u& 1973; , the percentage of singlestranded cDNA remaining in aliquots of the annealing mixture was determined with S-l nuclease (Calbiochem) according to the procedure of Leong et al. (1972) . RNA was denatured with glyoxal, subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM)-paper, and hybridized with [%P]-cDNA as previously described (Coulter-Mackie et a& 1980; . [35SjMethionine labeling of viral polgpep tides. Confluent cultures of L-2 cells in 60mm petri dishes were inoculated at an m.o.i. of 5 each with one of the five MHV strains. Cultures were incubated at 37" for 6-9 hr until virus-induced fusion was evident in virtually all cells; cultures were subsequently incubated for 30 min with [%S]methionine (100 &i/ml) in 1 ml methionine-free MEM. Cells were harvested by scraping, spun into pellets at 650~ for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as previously described . Peptide mapping & high-pfmance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Each of the five [36S]methionine-labeled nucleocapsid (N) proteins were excised as slices from dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels after visualization by autoradiography. Proteins were eluted from gel slices with (1 ml) immunoprecipitation (I.P.) buffer (Nusse et aL, 1978, but containing 0.2% instead of 0.1% SDS) for 8 hr at room temperature with periodic mixing. Solubilized protein was freed from gel debris by centrifugation at 60,000~ for 1 hr in a Beckman SW56 rotor. Supernatants were diluted with 1 vol of I.P. buffer lacking SDS in order to attain a final SDS concentration of 0.1% and mixed with 50 ~1 of anti-MHV antiserum. Immune precipitates were pelleted at 60,OOOg and digested for 24 hr at room temperature with 1 ml of 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate containing chymotrypsin (25 pg/ml; Worthington). The resulting peptides were lyophilized, dissolved in application buffer (pyridine:acetic acid:water, 1:1:31, and stored at -20" under a nitrogen atmosphere prior to analysis. For peptide mapping, a Waters Associates (Milford, Mass.) liquid chromatograph equipped with a Model U6K injector and a Model 6000A solvent delivery system was used. Peptides were eluted from a C1sp Bondapak reversed phase column (10 pm, 4 mm X 30 cm) using a phosphoric acid-acetonitrile solvent system (Fullmer and Wasserman, 1979) . A linear gradient of 14-36s acetonitrile in 0.1% orthophosphoric acid was found to provide optimal resolution of peptides. Constant flow gradient elution (2 ml/min) was controlled with a Waters Model 720 solvent programmer. Column effluent was fraction collected in volumes of 0.8 ml and radioactivities quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry after the addition of Atomlight (New England Nuclear).
