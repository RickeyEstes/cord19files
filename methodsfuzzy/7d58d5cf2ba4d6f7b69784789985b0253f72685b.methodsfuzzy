TB reference laboratories were selected in four urban centres: Cape Town in South Africa, Lima in Peru, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The reference laboratories selected were enrolled in national or international quality assurance programmes and had each undergone a laboratory assessment by FIND prior to selection. The study was approved by the institutional review boards in all countries. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Additionally, while participants may have received better than standard diagnostic care through the use of additional cultures, clinicians were blinded to the results of TB-LAMP so as not to impact patient care. Adults (!18 years) with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB, as defined by national TB programmes, were enrolled consecutively if they were able to provide two sputum samples of at least 1.5 ml and had not received TB treatment in the preceding 60 days. Each of the two sputum samples obtained had 60 ml removed for TB-LAMP and approximately 10 ml for direct Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) and/or light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy (FM) smear ( Figure 1 ). The TB-LAMP technician was blinded to the smear results and vice versa. The remaining sputum was then processed with n-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALCÀ ÀNaOH) and used for solid culture (Löwenstein-Jensen medium) and MGIT liquid culture (WHO, 1998; Siddiqi and Ruesch-Gerdes, 2006 ). The first positive culture from the two performed per sample (two samples per individual) underwent confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex by MPT64 antigen detection (Capilia TB; Tauns Laboratories) (Hillemann et al., 2005) . A scanty positive culture was defined as a positive MGIT at >28 days from inoculation or a Löwenstein-Jensen with <20 colonies. A culture-positive TB case was diagnosed if a participant had either two scanty or any non-scanty positive MTB culture result, consistent with previous analysis of molecular TB diagnostics (Boehme et al., 2010 (Boehme et al., , 2011 . Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) or mixed cases were analyzed separately. Samples from culture-positive TB cases were further classified as smear-positive or smear-negative based on a single smear test performed on that sputum. A smear-positive TB sample required one or more acid-fast bacilli per 100 fields for ZN or per 400 fields for FM (scanty grade or higher) following WHO recommendations (World Health Organization, 2007) . A smear-negative TB sample had no acid-fast bacilli detected by ZN or FM whatsoever, but was found through culture testing to be a culture-positive TB case. Samples from participants with all cultures negative and any positive smear were analyzed separately. Any participant with all smear results negative and all four cultures negative (or up to two cultures contaminated and the remaining negative), was considered bacteriologically negative for TB. Bacteriologically negative participants found to be TB-LAMPpositive on either sputum specimen were sought for clinical and laboratory follow-up after 8 weeks. Bacteriologically negative participants found to be TB-LAMP-negative were also followed up wherever programmatically possible. A non-TB case was defined as a participant who was bacteriologically negative and for whom no TB treatment was prescribed (based on adjunct diagnostics such as chest X-ray and/ or symptoms) at enrolment or during follow-up after 8 weeks. Bacteriologically negative participants who were treated empirically at enrolment or follow-up were considered to have clinically diagnosed TB. Such decisions were at the discretion of each physician and were subject to local variation. Those initially bacteriologically negative with any positive culture at follow-up were reclassified as culture-positive TB. Those with no laboratory confirmation but either unimproved chest Xray (i.e., physician compared a follow-up chest X-ray to the initial chest X-ray and found it to be 'same abnormal' or 'worse') or nonremitting symptoms (i.e., physician described symptoms as 'same' or 'worse') at follow-up were reclassified as possible TB and analyzed separately. If the TB-LAMP technician could not determine from the fluorescent read-out whether TB-LAMP was positive or negative, a second reader was asked to make the determination. If the second read was also indeterminate, a second TB-LAMP test was repeated on the same sputum sample wherever possible. Each run of up to 14 TB-LAMP tests at one time included a negative and a positive control. If the negative control is positive, this indicates potential DNA contamination and all tests in that run must be repeated after decontamination procedures. If the positive control is negative, this indicates probable reagent degradation and all tests in that run must be repeated with new reagents. The overall indeterminate rate indicates the lack of a clear result and the need for a repetition of the test from any of these causes. The performance of TB-LAMP on a single raw sputum sample was evaluated against the reference standard of two direct ZN smears, two direct FM smears, and four cultures per patient. Because a TB-LAMP test was performed on each of the two samples submitted per participant, correlations in the results were accounted for by using bootstrapping with sampling by cluster, where each set of two samples was the cluster, to obtain exact standard errors to calculate correct 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for a single raw sample. The performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was evaluated as a molecular test comparison to TB-LAMP. In Peru and South Africa, where the assay was already available and in use, the Xpert MTB/ RIF assay was performed on freshly concentrated sputum, whereas in Brazil and Vietnam, the Xpert assay was performed on sputum that had been frozen for 2-6 months. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was performed after NALCÀ ÀNaOH concentration from the first sputum sample collected, according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Figure 1 ). In Peru, the assay was performed from a third sputum sample if provided and from the first sputum sample if not. This third sample underwent only direct ZN and FM smears before concentration with NALCÀ ÀNaOH then Xpert MTB/RIF testing. In Brazil and Vietnam, after NALCÀ ÀNaOH concentration, >0.5 ml of the remainder of the first sample collected was frozen at À70 C and tested by Xpert MTB/RIF after 2-6 months. Any sample reported as positive for MTB by the automated output from the Xpert MTB/RIF was considered positive, while samples reported as MTB-negative were considered negative. Any error, invalid, or no result value was considered indeterminate and ineligible for sensitivity/specificity analysis. 95% CI were obtained using the binomial distribution. Blinding was deemed unnecessary given the automated nature of the test.
