Delphi is a group communication technique designed to obtain opinions from a panel of selected experts on specifi c issues through the sending of questionnaires to be completed within a specifi ed time. The experts are contacted individually and they do not know other group participants and their opinions-the aim is to submit the group participants to the same conditions. Participants do not meet personally, thereby avoiding undue infl uence. The process foresees the following points: The process is repeated a number of times, until a convergence of all group members is obtained. The process ends with analysis of the answers and formulation of the fi nal report. (Adapted from http://www.bigproject. org/dephi.htm) Thomas E. Novotny*, Emilio Mordini, Ruth Chadwick, J.
