Herds concerned. In ten herds from central and western areas of Japan, 150 of 200 adult cows developed diarrhoea during the winter of 1976--1977. Milk production declined by an average 20% during the outbreak and for 3--4 weeks during recovery periods. Serology. Paired serum samples were taken during the acute and convalescent stages of the syndrome, and were tested for haemaggiutination-inhibiting (HI) or neutralizing (NT) antibodies again §t reference strains of bovine coronavirus (BVC) using techniques described by Sharpee et al. (1976) and Stair et al. (1972) , of calf rotavirus (NCDV, Fernelius et ai., 1972) , of bovine adenovirus type 7 (BAV-7 -- Inaba et al., 1968) , of parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PIV-3 -- Inaba et ah, 1963) and of bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus (BVD-MD -- Omori et al. 1967 ). Electron microscopy (EM). A faeces sample taken during the acute phase was homogenised at 5% v/v in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min, and the supernatant fluid was again centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min. A final centrifugation of the resulting supernatant fluid was made at 100,000 g for 2 h, and the pellet was resuspended in 1/50 original volume of PBS, and clarified at 20,000 g for 10 min. A drop of the supernatant fluid was examined by the phosphotungstic acid negative staining technique. Virus isolation and immunofluorescence. Primary bovine kidney (BK) cell cultures were prepared in 100 X 11 mm tubes (Sato et al., 1978) , and monolayers were infected with 0.1 ml of faeces extract prepared as above. After an adsorption period of 2 h at 37°C, infected cultures were washed 3 X with Earle's solution, fed with 0.5 ml of maintenance medium, and incubated at 37°C in a roller drum. Cultures were routinely checked for immunofluorescence at each passage, using a rabbit antiserum to bovine coronavirus (kindly supplied by Dr. C.A. Mebus, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A.) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate as described by Sato et al. (1978) . Serial ten-fold dilutions of the supernatant fluids were passaged weekly to fresh BK monolayers which were checked for cytopathic effect and immuno-fluorescence. Table I , 59% of 100 paired sera showed significant seroconversion between acute and convalescent sera, as measured by the HI technique for antibody to BCV. Only a low percentage showed sero conversions to other viruses tested. Of 210 cattle tested for coronavirus antibody from 8 of the farms concerned, 139 (66.2%) showed levels of HI antibody to coronavirus greater than titre of 160 (Table I) .
