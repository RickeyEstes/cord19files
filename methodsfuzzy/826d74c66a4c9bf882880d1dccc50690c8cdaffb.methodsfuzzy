This study was approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee and the University Hospital of the West Indies Investigation Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians on behalf of the minors/ children participants involved in the study. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Hospital of the West Indies, located in Kingston, Jamaica from June 23, 2009 to August 10, 2009 . Jamaica is a developing country with a population of 2.7 million, gross national income per captia of 4,870 USD's and infant mortality rate of 28 per 1000 live births [22] . The University Hospital of the West Indies is the only academic medical center in Jamaica, and serves as the primary public tertiary care center in Jamaica. Inclusion criteria for the study included all pediatric patients aged 0-18 years of age presenting for care at the university hospital. 287 total serum samples were collected from the pediatric patient population. 118 (41%) samples were collected via fingerstick method, with the use of the Stat Sampler TM collecting system, from children presenting for routine care and vaccination in well child clinics. The remaining samples were collected from the hospital's clinical chemistry laboratory from left-over venipuncture clinical sampling; including 77 (27%) from inpatient pediatric units, 37 (12%) from pediatric subspecialty clinics, 25 (9%) from the neonatal intensive care, 25 (9%) from pediatric trauma, and 5 (2%) from newborn special care. At the time of collection no information on any symptomatology was collected, as the purpose of the study was to screen for HBoV-specific IgG-antibody representative of previous viral exposure. Both finger stick and venous blood sampling was used as both have been shown to have similar IgG rates in ELISAs, as shown by Vejtorp and Leerhoy [23] . After collection, all blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes, and blood serum was collected and stored. Samples were stored at the University Hospital of the West Indies at 220 degrees Celsius, prior to being shipped to Yale University School of Medicine. Detection of HBoV-specific antibodies in human serum by HBoV Virus Like Particle-based ELISA An ELISA developed by Kahn et al. was used to detect HBoVspecific antibodies, a detailed description of which can be found elsewhere [21] . Briefly, the ELISA uses virus like particles (VLPs) composed of the VP2 gene of HBoV. The VLPs created by Kahn et al. have shown high reactivity with human antibodies to HBoV, and therefore are optimal for use in ELISAs. HBoV VLPs were obtained from Dr. Peter Tattersall at Yale University School of Medicine. The Kahn et al. ELISA protocol was optimized for use with the given study samples. First, samples were run at various dilutions to determine the adequate dilution to use in the assay. A dilution of 1:40 was chosen for its optimal reactivity with HBoV VLPs in the given ELISA. Next, positive and negative controls were identified and compared to samples with known HBoV infection. The identified positive and negative controls were used in each assay. Finally, all 287 samples were run at a 1:40 dilution and read on an optical reader at an optical density of 450 nm. In order to determine a cut-off point to classify samples as seropositive or seronegative all OD450 ELISA values were taken and operationally separated into 2 groups by means of a cutoff of 0.150, as previously published by Kahn et al. [21] Next, the mean and standard deviation of all values OD450,0.150 were calculated. The cut off point to classify samples as seropositive or seronegative was calculated as the mean of all OD450,0.150 plus three standard deviations. For this calculation, negative OD450 values were set to zero. Based on these calculations, a serum specimen negative for HBoV was defined as having an OD450#0.234 (at dilution of 1:40).
