Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  Soluble fraction, MV and sEV isolation All cells were maintained in sEV-depleted FBS. FBS was depleted of sEV by overnight (ON) ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g at 4 C (Sorvall 100SE Ultracentrifuge). The supernatant was removed and stored in 50 mL falcons at À20 C until required. CM was collected after 72h incubation with cells, unless specified otherwise. To isolate the different EV fractions, the protocol of differential ultracentrifugation (Thé ry et al., 2006 (Thé ry et al., , 2018 was modified and adapted. Whole CM was centrifuged at low speed (2,000 g for 20min) to eliminate dead cells and cellular debris prior to use. MV were collected after the 10,000 g centrifugation step for 1h, washed with PBS and spun down again at 10,000 g for 1h. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22mm filter prior to the 100,000 g centrifugation step and also after in some cases (for the Cre-LoxP experiments). The supernatant was collected after a 1h and 20min 100,000 g centrifugation step and concentrated using a 10K column (Amicon Ultra-0.5 Filter) at 14,000 g for 10min obtaining a concentration factor 10X. The final 100,000 g pellet was washed once in 15ml of PBS and resuspended in 100 mL of 10% FBS-depleted media for the functional cell culture experiments. For the MCF7 functional experiments the pellet was resuspended in 0.5% FBS-depleted media. Alternatively, for Western Blot analysis, sEV pellet was re-suspended in protein lysis buffer. A Sorvall 100SE Ultra Centrifuge, with a Beckmann Fixed Angle T865 rotor was used for all sEV isolations. The k-factor of the rotor is 2,08. We have submitted all relevant data of our experiments to the EV-TRACK knowledgebase (EV-TRACK ID: EV190024). Density gradient sEV isolation sEV isolated by serial ultracentrifugation were re-suspended in 1.5 mL of suspension buffer (0.25M sucrose, 10mM Tris pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA (pH 7.4) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Next, sEV were mixed 1:1 with 60% stock solution of iodixanol/Optiprep (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Then, 1.4ml 40% iodixanol, 1.3ml 20% iodixanol and 1.2ml 10% iodixanol were successively layered on top of the sEV suspension and tubes were centrifuged at 100,000 g ON, stopping without break. After centrifugation, ten fractions of 700ml were collected from the top of the tube. Fractions were washed with 15ml PBS at 100,000 g for 1h 20 min. The fractions were re-suspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer. Size exclusion sEV isolation CM was centrifuged at 350 g for 15min at 4 C to pellet cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 20min at 4 C and filtered with a 0.22mm filter. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using qEV columns (Izon Science, USA) was used to the isolate sEV. Twelve eluted fractions were collected in sequential fractions of 1ml according to the manufacturer's instructions. The particle and protein concentration of each fraction was then measured by NTA and MicroBCA. The fractions enriched in particles and lacking protein contaminants were pooled, centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1h 20 min and used for functional assays. Treatment of cells with CM or isolated sEV HFFF2 fibroblasts were plated in a 100mm dish at 1x10 6 cells. After 24h, iC and iRAS cells were treated with 200nM 4OHT for 48h in 10% media, washed, incubated with 0.5% media and allowed to produce new CM for 72h. The sEV obtained from these cells were used to treat 10-12 wells of a 96-well plate. Young HFFF2 were treated with the CM from several experiments previously centrifuged at low speed to discard dead cells and supplemented with FBS to reach 10% in the final volume. HFFF2 treated with isolated sEV were also supplemented with media containing 10% FBS, while in the experiments performed with MCF7, the cells were incubated with isolated exosomes resuspended in 0.5% FBS media. CM with siRNA and inhibitors functional experiments 24h after plating HFFF2 in 96-well plates, senescence was induced by adding 200nM 4OHT. 48h after the cells were washed and supplemented with 0.5% FBS and the indicated inhibitors for 2-3 days, after which plates were washed again to remove the inhibitors from the media and supplemented with fresh media (0.5% FBS) for further 72h. For the experiments with the siRNA, reverse transfection with 50nM siRNA was performed and the media replenished (10% FBS) with 4OHT after 2 days and left for an additional 48h. After, the cells were washed to remove all siRNA from the media and incubated with 0.5% FBS fresh media for an additional 72h.
