. . Sample. Musk of muskrat was bought from Muskland Co. (Jochiwon, Korea) and was kept in refrigerator as oil form for being used at this research. Muskland collected scent bag of muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus, and found that it contained 8.46% moisture, 87.0% crude fat, 0.01% ash, 0.024% total carbohydrate, and 1% protein. . . Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 ± 10 g) were obtained from Samtako Co. (Osan, Korea). Rats were housed under consistent temperature (23 ± 1 ∘ C) and humidity (55 ± 10%) on a 12-h light/dark cycle (light on at 07:00). Food and water were available ad libitum. The experiments were carried out in accordance with the Principle of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication #85-23, revised 1985) and Kyung Hee University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. . . Surgery. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient MCAo [11] . Briefly, rats were anesthetized under 2% isoflurane in a mixture of N 2 O/O 2 (7:3) throughout the surgery. Left branch of carotid artery was exposed through a midline incision. The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated and cut near the junction of the proximal ECA junction. The common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were temporarily blocked by vascular clips. A 4-0 nylon monofilament (diameter 370 ± 5 m) with a round silicone head was inserted into the ECA. Exact location of the suture was determined when the suture was inserted at a minimum of 18 mm from the CCA/ ICA junction. After 90 minutes of MCAo, the suture was removed to allow reperfusion. Rats in the sham operated group received the same surgical procedure except for a probe insertion. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ∘ C until 6 hours after ischemia with a heating lamp and blanket system (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Occlusion of the MCA was confirmed by the presence of characteristic behavioural deficits, such as paralyzed forelimb flexion, torso twist, and spontaneous circling after reperfusion. Rats that failed to meet these criteria were excluded from the study. . . Sample Treatment. Musk of muskrat was dissolved in aqueous solution of tween 20 (5%, w/v) and administered orally twice at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg at 0 and 90 min after occlusion. The rats in the vehicle-treated group were given aqueous solution of tween 20 (5%, w/v). Treatment was blinded. . . Balance Beam Test. The balance beam test was performed at 22 hours after ischemia by modifying the previously described [12] . The rats were placed in the middle of a wooden square bar (width 2.5 cm, length 122 cm, and height 42 cm) and scored as follows: 0 = the rat was not able to stay on the beam; 1 = the rat did not move, but was able to stay on the beam; 2 = the rat tried to traverse the beam, but fell; 3 = the rat traversed the beam with more than 50% footslips of the affected hindlimb; 4 = the rat traversed the beam with more than one footslip, but less than 50%; 5 = the rat had only one slip of the hindlimb; and 6 = the rat traversed the beam without any slips of the hindlimb. . . Rotarod Test. The rotarod test was performed at 22 hours after ischemia. Rats were placed onto an accelerating rotarod (from 0 to 40 rpm; Ugo Basile, Milan, Italy) and the time from when the rats fell of the rotarod was measured. For each rat, latency times were recorded in five separate trials. The highest and lowest values were excluded and the mean of the remaining three trial results was used for the analysis. . . Tissue Preparation. Twenty-four hours after MCAo, the rats were anesthetized and decapitated. For measuring infarct volume, the decapitated rat brain was carefully removed and cut into 6 coronal sections of 2 mm thickness. The sections were stained with 2% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride; Sigma, USA) in saline at 37 ∘ C for 30 minutes. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde after 24 hours of ischemia and heparinized 5% sodium nitrite saline solution. The brain was removed and cut into 4 m sections using a cryocut (3050s; Leica, Germany). . . Measurement of Infarct Volume. TTC-stained sections were analysed for infarct volume using a computerized image analysis system (Image ProPlus, Media Cybernetics, USA). Correlated infarct volume (mm3) was calculated from the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere minus the unimpaired volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The infarct volume (%) was calculated by dividing the correlated infarct volume with the total volume of the opposite hemisphere. . . Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed by modifying the previously described [13] . Brains were removed, fixed, and cut into 40-m sections . . Statistics. Statistical difference between three groups was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. Difference between two groups was analysed using independent t-test (GraphPad Prism 5.0, GraphPad Software, USA). Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05 in Dunnett's test. Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.
