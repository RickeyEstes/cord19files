We reviewed the clinical records of prospectively enrolled consecutive full-term young infants with a diagnosis of acute viral moderate-severe bronchiolitis, hospitalized in the Pediatric Emergency Department, "Sapienza" University, Rome, Italy during 10 annual seasonal epidemics (October-May) from 2004 to 2014 (Cangiano et al., 2016) . The University Hospital of the "Sapienza" University is a tertiary care and teaching center and is the second major Pediatric hospital in Rome, Italy. It covers about 1/3 of roman children, in particular those who live in the center-and northern-east areas of the city. Bronchiolitis was defined as the first acute lower-airway infection in children < 1 year old, with a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset respiratory distress with cough, tachypnea, chest retractions and diffuse crackles on auscultation (Midulla et al., 2010) . Exclusion criteria were underlying chronic diseases (including cystic fibrosis, chronic pulmonary diseases, congenital heart diseases and immunodeficiency) and prematurity. Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected through the clinical records and from a structured questionnaire filled in by parents on enrollment. The research and ethics committee of the Hospital Policlinico "Umberto I" approved the study protocol and the written informed consent that was acquired from parents of each child at admission in the study.
