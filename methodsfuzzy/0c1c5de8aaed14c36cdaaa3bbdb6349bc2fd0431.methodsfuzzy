To better understand the qualities of the automated text mining and clustering methods, this section explores features of each research methodology and connects these to several keywords in the clusters. Compared to the other methods, this group of computational approaches has a stronger emphasis on design support instead of product development and analysis (Loonen et al., 2014) , as it is able to predict the dynamic performance of proposed buildings considering occupant behavior, indoor comfort conditions and meteorological boundary conditions (Clarke and Hensen, 2015) . Another characteristic feature of this group of methods is the fact that thermal considerations, instead of aerodynamic effects, can easily be taken into account in the analysis. It is for this reason that, key words such as "conduction", "temperature" and "radiation" are strongly correlated to BPS, AFN and analytical methods. Fig. 4 shows a breakdown of research methodologies that were applied in the wind catcher database in relation to the publication life-cycle (Fig.3) . The trends that can be observed in this figure are used to assist in the identification of knowledge gaps, as described in the next section.
