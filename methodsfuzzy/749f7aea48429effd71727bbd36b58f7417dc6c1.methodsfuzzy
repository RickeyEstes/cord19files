The CFD numerical simulation is a useful tool for investigating gas convection and diffusion. An alternative tool is the tracer containment test, for practical measurement within a ready-made isolation room. Numerical simulation is performed on computers and therefore is a less expensive way to study airflow patterns resulting from various ventilation configurations. The simulations in the current study used the FLUENT 9 commercial CFD program with the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equation) numerical method. The computational cells were mapped within the simulated isolation room with a total number of 460 948 cells, which were analysed by grid independence to ensure both computational accuracy and efficiency. In the present investigation, steady-state ventilation flows were computed and a time-accurate algorithm was used to obtain the region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion 5 s after the occurrence of a cough. In determining the critical region of droplet fallout and virus diffusion, it was assumed that the mole fraction of the coughed gas was more than 0.01. Meanwhile, the convergence criterion of the numerical computations was that the residuals of the variables were less than 10 K3 .
