The PCR technique has proven highly adaptable, enabling a wide range of clinical and research applications. Blot hybridization. Dot blot hybridization can be used to confirm PCR amplicon identity. in this example, samples that tested human papillomavirus (HPv) positive by GP5+/6 + PCR were spotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with a biotin-labelled HPv16 probe. After hybridization, the biotin label was detected with streptavidin-alkaline phospatase conjugate and nitroblue tetrazolium/ 5-bromo-4-cloro-3-indolyl-phosphate substrate.
