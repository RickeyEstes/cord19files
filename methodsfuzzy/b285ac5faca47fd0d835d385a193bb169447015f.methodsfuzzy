Cell lines, antibodies, virus and plasmids. IPEC-J2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (1:1) (Hyclone, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. TGEV strain WH-1 (GenBank accession no. HQ462571), which was isolated in China, was propagated in PK-15 cells. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-cytoplasmic tail of porcine FcRn (anti-pFcRn-CT) polyclonal antibody was prepared in our laboratory. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce (USA). Mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody was purchased from BOSTER (China). p65-EGFP fusion expression plasmid was prepared in our laboratory, p65 gene was PCR subcloned into pEGFP-C2 vector. p65-Tag2B plasmid encoding p65 was prepared in our laboratory, p65 gene was PCR subcloned into pCMV-Tag 2B vector. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Confluent monolayers of IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 8, 12, 24, 30, 36, and 48 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted from IPEC-J2 cells with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Then, total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, China). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate in three separate experiments using pFcRn primers (5′ -GGCGACGAGCACCACTACTG-3′ and 5′ -AGCCGACCATGATTCCAACC-3′ ) and GAPDH primers (5′ -ACATGGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGA-3′ and 5′ -GATCGAGTTGGGGCTGTGACT-3′ ) and the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, China). All reactions were performed for 40 cycles: 5s at 95 °C and 30s at 60 °C. pFcRn expression was calculated following normalization to GAPDH levels by the comparative delta delta threshold cycle (Δ Δ C T ) method. The specific amplification reactions were confirmed by melt curve analysis.
