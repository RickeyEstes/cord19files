The positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the software at http://vassarstats.net/clin1.html. Overall agreement between the FA RP assay and either NxTAG RPP or consensus result was measured by the kappa statistic (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ kappa2). Differences between test performances were assessed using McNemar's 2-tailed P values (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ mcNemar1). All websites were accessed in February 2019.
