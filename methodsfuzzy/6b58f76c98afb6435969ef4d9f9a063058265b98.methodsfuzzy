RNA sequencing and analysis of the MVI-it cell line. Cell line CRL-6012 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and passaged until cells reached a confluent monolayer in a 75-centimeter flask. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen), and mRNA was subjected to next-generation sequencing on the Genome Analyzer II (42-bp single-read data). De novo assembly of raw read data generated 5,818 contigs, labeled as BatA1 to BatA5818. Nucleotide sequences from each contig were translated into protein space, and protein sequences were subjected to BLAST search against both the human and nonredundant protein databases, uncovering contigs with homology to herpesvirus protein sequences. For RNA-seq analysis, sequencing reads were mapped against each BGHV8 coding sequence (CDS) and in CLC Genomics Workbench (version 8.5) using the CLC RNA-seq tool. Total reads and the RPKM for each CDS were determined. Isolation and propagation of BGHV8 virions. Strict biosafety level 2 precautions were followed for all studies involving live virus. Supernatant obtained from a confluent 75-centimeter flask of MVI-it cells was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 20 min. Supernatant was transferred to uninfected Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) seeded in 6-well plates. At either 18 or 42 h after supernatant transfer, supernatant was harvested and stored and cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Phase-contrast images captured evidence of cytopathic effect, and Hoechst staining (Thermo Fisher) captured evidence of syncytium formation. To generate working stocks of BGHV8, MVI-it supernatant was passaged onto confluent flasks of Vero cells, and supernatant was harvested once complete CPE was apparent. Viral titers of BGHV8 were calculated by either plaque assay or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay on Vero cells. For plaque assay, serial dilutions of clarified supernatant were used to infect fresh Vero cells in 6-well plates for 2 h. Infection medium was removed, and cells were overlaid with Avicel-591. Briefly, a 2.4% Avicel solution was mixed 1:1 with 2ϫ DMEM and 4 ml of this mixture was added to each well of a 6-well plate. Three to 4 days postinfection, the Avicel overlay was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% PFA, and stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. For TCID 50 studies, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Serial 10-fold dilutions of BGHV8 stocks were added in replicates of 7 adjacent columns. When complete CPE was visible at lower dilutions, cells were fixed with PFA and stained with crystal violet. BGHV8 infection of cell lines. Both TCID 50 and plaque assays were used to calculate viral stock titers. BGHV8 stocks were used to infect target cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.5 PFU/cell. Cell lines tested included mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Hepa1.6, Huh7, MRC, A549, HeLa, and Vero. Both uninfected cells and cells at days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection were collected for total RNA. Corresponding supernatant from each sample was also harvested, and DNA from supernatants was isolated (QIAamp blood kit). From total RNA, cDNA was generated using oligo(dT) primers (Superscript III; Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR primers designed against a BGHV8 capsid mRNA sequence identified in the initial RNA-seq study were used to measure BGHV8 RNA in cells. The forward primer sequence is 5= ACACCAACAGAGACCCCGCC 3=, and the reverse primer sequence is 5= AGCACGGTCTGGCTTACTTTG CG 3=. To measure particle release from infected cell supernatants, quantitative PCR from isolated DNA was performed with the same primer set. Transmission electron microscopy. For ultrastructural analysis in ultrathin sections, Myotis bat cells were fixed for at least 1 h in a mixture of 2.5% formaldehyde prepared from paraformaldehyde powder and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) to which 0.03% picric acid and 0.03% CaCl 2 were added. The monolayers were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and cells were scraped off and processed further as a pellet. The pellets were postfixed in 1% OsO 4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h, washed with distilled water, and en bloc stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 20 min at 60°C. The pellets were dehydrated in ethanol, processed through propylene oxide, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), stained with lead citrate, and examined in a Philips 201 transmission electron microscope at 60 kV. BGHV8 genome construction and annotation. Extracted DNA from BGHV8-infected Vero cells was sheared (Covaris), and a library was generated for sequencing by Illumina HiSeq2500 to generate 100-bp reads. A second library from viral genomic DNA was generated by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) as previously described (23) and was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform to generate trimmed sequencing reads approximately 270 bp in length. De novo assembly in CLC Genomics Workbench resulted in several contigs. Using the CLC genome finishing tool, longer MiSeq reads were used to join the contigs generated from the HiSeq data into a single sequence of approximately 130 kb. To annotate the assembled genome, we developed gammaherpesvirus-specific annotation software called Viral Genome ORF Reader (VIGOR) (24) , with very relaxed parameters on the percent similarity cutoff to accommodate the variation in herpesvirus genomes. VIGOR was used to predict genes, perform alignments, ensure the fidelity of open reading frames, and detect any potential sequencing or assembly errors. The annotation was manually verified and edited as required, according to the gene and protein naming convention of the Equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2) reference genome (NC_001650.2). We analyzed the assembled BGHV8 sequence in a tandem repeat finder program (http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html) which was previously used to identify repeat regions in a mouse gammaherpesvirus genome (25) .
