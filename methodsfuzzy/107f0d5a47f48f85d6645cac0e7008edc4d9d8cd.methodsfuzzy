Regardless of sampling method, each captured bat was placed into a porous cotton holding bag. Individuals were identified to species following Gannon et al. (2005) , and a clean cotton-tipped swab was used to collect saliva from the bat's mouth. Swabs were placed in individual cryovials containing viral transport medium and sent to Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, in a dry shipper, and stored at -80Â°C. All methods were approved by the University of Connecticut Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol A15-032). Viral Screening: Total nucleic acids were extracted from each swab using the EasyMag platform (bioMerieux, Inc.), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen). Nested consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) was performed twice on each sample, targeting a region of the highly conserved catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase gene (Van deVanter et al. 1996) . cPCR is a broadly reactive method that allows detection of novel viruses by using nonspecific primers targeted at viral families or genera (Anthony et al. 2013 (Anthony et al. , 2015 . A constructed synthetic plasmid was used as a positive control to confirm effective implementation of the assay and to detect possible contamination. PCR gel products (1% agarose) of expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector, and twelve colonies were sequenced to confirm identity and detection of co-occurring viruses. Each clone was cross-referenced using the GenBank nucleotide database to confirm that sequences were indeed herpesviruses. Sequence data will be available at github.com/ARSjodin upon publication. OTU Delineation: A nucleotide alignment of 3,131 herpesvirus clones was conducted using the ClustalW alignment in Geneious version 11.0.5, and a pairwise percent identity (PID) matrix was calculated based on percent similarity of nucleotides in each sequence pair. A PID histogram was then generated (Maes et al. 2009 ). To evaluate the robustness of cutoffs to errors in alignment, the R package Biostrings (Pages et al. 2017 ) was used to conduct pairwise alignments of clones. A second PID histogram was generated, and frequency clusters were compared between the two PIDs. The number of OTUs was estimated using the cutoff extremes for each level of classification, based on total alignment and pairwise alignment (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs, see Results and Figure 1 ). To statistically support which OTU cutoff to use in subsequent analyses, the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011 ) was used to perform affinity propagation on the PID matrix of the total clone alignment. Affinity propagation is an algorithm that examines all data points in a similarity matrix to identify exemplars (Frey and Dueck 2007). The algorithm then clusters remaining data around an optimum number of exemplars by iteratively exchanging two types of "messages" between data points. In the context of viral sequences, the first type of message accumulates evidence for sequence k as an exemplar for sequence i, based on genetic distance between k and i (Frey and Dueck 2007). The second type of message reflects how many sequences besides i support k as the best choice of exemplar (Frey and Dueck 2007). When inputting the PID matrix of all clones, the number of clusters identified through affinity propagation can be interpreted as an optimal number of viral OTUs. Although this method has been used to define clusters of a single viral species (Fischer et al. 2017) , this is the first instance in which it has been used to delineate viral "species" for the purpose of communitylevel analyses. To conduct affinity propagation analyses, the apcluster() command was run using the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011) , with default values of input parameters (input data = NA, input preference = NA, q = 0.5, convits = 100, maxits = 1000, lam = 0.9). Finally, OTUs were refined manually based on PID and affinity (see Results). Finally, sequences representing the polymerase gene of formally described beta-and gammaherpesvirus species, as defined by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of .

It Matrices comparing PID of defined viral species were calculated for comparison to empirical values. For ease of exposition, "species" will be used moving forward to reference host taxa or formally described viral taxa, whereas "OTU" will be used to reference empirical viral taxa.
