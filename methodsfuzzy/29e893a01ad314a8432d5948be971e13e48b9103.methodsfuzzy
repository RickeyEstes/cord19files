The National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Taiwan was launched in 1995. It covered 93% of population in Taiwan in 1997 and kept increasing thereafter to 99% by the end of 2010. The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) is a nationwide database extracted from the claim data of the NHI program for research purposes [11] . This anonymous database contains information regarding inpatient and outpatient medical claims, including prescription records. In this study, we used a longitudinal cohort dataset (Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, LHID2005) that contains claim data of one million randomly sampled individuals who were insured in 2005 [12] . This dataset has been confirmed as having no significant differences in either age, gender or health care costs from its whole population composed of all beneficiaries under the NHI program. In this study, we used inpatient claim data retrieved between 1998 and 2003 from LHID2005. Inpatient records comprise administrative information including admission month, year, admission type, and various demographic information such as age, gender, and medical costs as well as medical information such as diagnosis and procedure carried out. ICD9-CM procedure codes are used to code procedures and surgery in this database. The first two digits represent general procedures, followed by two digits that describe in more detail the specific subtype of the general procedure. For example, ICD9-CM procedure codes 47.0, 47.01 and 47.02 represent appendectomies, laparoscopic appendectomies and other appendectomies, respectively. Thus the last two codes provide detailed information about the specific surgical technique employed. Based on our research purpose, we used the first three digits of the ICD9-CM procedure codes only; thus in the example above, 47.01 and 47.02 were represented in our study by 47.0X. We conducted ARIMA analysis to estimate the demand elasticity of various selected major surgery categories performed by obstetricians, urologists, orthopedists, gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, neurosurgeons and general surgeons as listed in Table 1 . For each surgery type, we first used the monthly surgical volume from 1998 to 2001 as time series data to identify the best ARIMA model, namely the one with the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion). Then, a Q-test was performed to see if the error was autocorrelated. Next the dataset for 2002 was used as an out-of-sample dataset for model selection and evaluation, and MAPE was used to estimate the prediction power. MAPE is the average difference between observed volume and predicted volume, divided by observed volume. For all out-of-sample evaluations, the MAPE values for all models were less than 25%. The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a unit root test performed to examine whether the data were stationary. Lastly, after model evaluation, the time series data from 1998 to 2002 were used to forecast surgical volume in 2003. The observed data and expected data were plotted along with their 95% confidence intervals. The SARS epidemic in Taiwan started in March 2003 and lasted until July 2003. During this period, the needs for medical services decreased dramatically, particularly in May [10] . Therefore, we defined the MAPE value for May 2003 as an index of demand elasticity. All p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All claim data in the research database, which we applied for this study, were anonymized and de-identified before its release. According to the local regulations, informed consent is not required in this situation. This study was reviewed and exempted from full review by the institutional review board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.
