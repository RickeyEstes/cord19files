The MERS-CoV miRNA prediction was carried out using the complete genome sequence of MERS-CoV (GB: KJ156952.1) obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the computational prediction process [27] . Briefly, the viral genome was scanned for hairpin-structured miRNA precursors using a VMir Analyzer program [28, 29] . VMir is an ab initio prediction program which was designed specifically to identify pre-miRNA in viral genome. The scanned hairpins were visualized in VMir viewer where 74 sequences with potential hairpin like structures were extracted as candidate miRNA precursor. Each of the sequences of the candidate miRNA precursors was searched for nucleotide similarity with all human microRNAs by using SEARCH menu of the miRBase database (http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml) [17] . Then 11 sequences were identified as candidate miRNA precursor based on significant sequence similarity with human miRNAs. The hybridization between the viral precursor miRNAs and complementary template of the potential human miRNAs were analyzed by RNA hybrid web server (http://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/) [30] . Finally, the RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac .at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi) was used to predict the secondary structure of pre-miRNA [31] .
