Located in the Hong Kong Island, both a TB hospital GH and an outpatient clinic SYP with naturally ventilated wards were selected for the study. Hospital GH, the only one existing naturally ventilated TB hospital in Hong Kong, is located on a hillside surrounded by green environments. Various design alternations were done since then to cater for the hot and humid summer, e.g. installing spot air cooling when needed. There were exhaust fans installed in the doorway between the corridor and the ward, between the ward and the balcony, and also between the toilet and the ambient. One exhaust fan between the corridor and the ward was installed above the doorway and two exhaust fans were installed at the top of the windows to exhaust air from the ward to the outdoor. Outpatient clinic SYP is located in the Western District of Hong Kong Island surrounded by high buildings. The outpatient clinic includes consultation rooms and a waiting area. Each consultation room has exterior windows and a door connected to the corridor. A window air conditioner was installed in the windows in each consultation room. We measured the waiting area and a consultation room. During our measurement, a tested ward was first vacated by the hospital. Thermal manikins were used to simulate thermal buoyancy flows of the inpatients. The heat generation of each thermal manikin was 76 W corresponding to an adult at rest. The field measurement was carried out in four TB wards in Hospital GH on 9-10 November 2005 and 28 August 2006, and in the outpatient clinic SYP on 5 November 2005. Literature shows that short-term airing by natural ventilation shows high ventilation efficiency, especially for the first 10 min [23] . In this study, it needs more than half an hour to dose and mix the tracer gas in the ward in each test. So in spite of that the short period of measurement in this study may not reflect the average yearly or monthly natural ventilation rate accurately. But it still can indicate the performance of natural ventilation in typical weather conditions and evaluate the influence of size of openings, wind speed, and direction. Pressure difference, airflow direction through doorways and windows, and air change rate were measured. Pressure difference and air velocity was measured by VELOCICAL Plus air velocity meter (8386A) (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). A small hand-hold smoke generator (CH25301) (Drager, Germany) was used to visualize the local airflow direction. A hood flow rate meter (APM 150) (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) was used to measure the airflow rate of the exhaust fans. The decay method was employed to measure the air change rate. A tracer gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) was injected continually in the ward until the concentration of the tracer gas became steady, then the injecting was stopped, and the concentration decay was measured. Two electrical fans were used to make the air mixed in the ward during the measurement, one of the mixing fans was placed behind the doser and the other one, an oscillating fan, on top of the ceiling. The injection of SF 6 was controlled by multi-gas sampler and doser type 1303 (Bruel&Kjar, Denmark), and the concentration of SF 6 was measured by the single-gas monitor 3425 (Bruel&Kjar, Denmark). Those two machines were controlled by a laptop through software 7620 (Bruel&Kjar, Denmark). The concentration of the tracer gas was measured continuously. According to the concentration decay curve, the ventilation rate can be determined according to the following equation: where C(s) is the tracer gas concentration at s time and n is the air change rate (ACH). Table 1 summarizes the measured results of ventilation rates for different situations including the situations when the doors and the windows were closed or not, and the exhaust fans were turned on or off.
