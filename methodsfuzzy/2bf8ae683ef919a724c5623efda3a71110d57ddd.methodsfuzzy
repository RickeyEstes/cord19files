For crystallization, all constructs were cloned into a modified pet28a vector containing an Nterminal, Ulp1-cleavable, 6xHis-SUMO tag 27 and expressed in E. coli. Proteins were purified using standard Ni-affinity, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. PPP-RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription. Crystals of nIFIT1, IFIT5, and IFIT5 with PPP-RNA were grown from a sparse matrix screen (see online methods). The structures of nIFIT1 and IFIT5 were solved by SAD phasing of Seleno-Methionine derivatized protein, and the complexes with PPP-RNA were solved by molecular replacement using apo-IFIT5 as a search model. Pull-downs with PPP-RNA and functional assays with HEK Flp-in cells are described elsewhere 2 . Full methods can be found online in the Supplementary file.
