Animals. The present study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Shanghai, China), and all procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health's guidelines (14) . A total of 46 male 8-week-old Wistar rats with a mean weight of 200±10 g were provided by the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Rats were raised in an environment of 22±0.5˚C and 40-70% relative humidity under a 12 h light/dark cycle, with food and water freely available. Following 1-week habituation, the rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. The normal diet (ND) group, (n=10) were fed a regular chow diet containing 5.4% fat and the HFD group, (n=36) were fed a HFD containing 45% fat. After 3 weeks, rats in the HFD group were ranked according to weight gain, and rats in the lower third (n=12) were excluded from the study as they were deemed to be obesity resistant. The remaining 24 rats in the HFD group were randomly divided into 2 sub-groups: i) A HFD group (n=12); and ii) a HFD+CQR (n=12) group. CQR treatment consisted of 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol (purity, ≥98%; Hangzhou Great Forest Biomedical Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China) and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin (purity ≥98; Nanjing Zelang Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) The body weight and food intake of the rats was recorded each week. After 11 weeks, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed following a 12 h fast. Blood was extracted from the abdominal aorta and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 15 min at 4˚C. The serum was separated and stored at -80˚C prior to analysis. Following blood collection, subcutaneous adipose tissues (SATs), epididymis adipose tissues (EATs) and perinephric adipose tissues were promptly removed, rinsed, weighed on ice and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚C. Biochemical parameters. Total cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) in the serum were measured and quantified using a Hitachi 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with the corresponding kits as follows: Quick Auto Neo T-CHOLII assay reagent and Quick Auto Neo TGII assay reagent, manufactured by Shino-Test Corporation (Tokyo, Japan); L-type HDL-C reagent 1 (cat no. 998-09011), reagent 2 (cat no. 994-09111); and L-type LDL-C reagent 1 (cat no. 997-39893) and reagent 2, (cat no. 993-39993), manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Cytokine quantification. Levels of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in the serum were quantified using the corresponding commercial rat ELISA kits as follows: Rat leptin, LEP ELISA kit (cat no. CSB-E07433r); rat adiponectin, ADP ELISA kit, (cat no. CSB-E07271r); rat insulin, INS ELISA kit (CSB-E05070r); rat IL-6, IL-6 ELISA kit (cat no. CSB-E04640r); rat TNF-α ELISA kit (cat no. CSB-E11987r); and rat MCP-1/monocyte chemotactic and activating factor, MCP-1/MCAF ELISA kit (cat no. CSB-E07429r; Cusabio Biotech Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Histopathology. Adipose tissues were collected at 11 weeks and fixed in 4% formalin at room temperature for 24 h, embedded in paraffin and sliced serially into sections 5-µm thick. To determine adipocyte size, hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted on EATs at room temperature for 30 min. Five visual fields were randomly selected from each section with an Olympus BX51 light microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and examined using Image-Pro Plus version 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) to determine the average adipocyte diameter. Toluidine blue staining was also performed on EATs for 1 h by briefly submerging tissue sections in 0.1% aqueous toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) at room temperature, the histological images were used to quantify the number of mast cells present, as previously described (15) . Mast cell numbers were counted using a light microscope and were presented as cell numbers/mm 2 . Protein extraction and western blot analysis. Plasma membrane proteins were extracted from adipose tissues using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (cat no. 89900, Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), total protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor, as described previously (16) . Protein concentration was measured using a commercial bicinchoninic acid assay kit and a microplate reader at 570 nm. Subsequently protein (40 µg/lane) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. For multiple comparisons, differences were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. All statistics were analyzed using Graphpad Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
