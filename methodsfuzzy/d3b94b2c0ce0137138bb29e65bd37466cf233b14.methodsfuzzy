We have selected four papers from our review to illustrate how the methodological metaphor of triangulation (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) can be applied to mixed methods studies. Each of these studies has been used to illustrate how the metaphor of triangulation can be applied to studies producing: (i) complementary findings, (ii) convergent findings, and (iii) divergent findings. In the following section, we demonstrate how the application of the metaphor can be used as a framework both to develop theory and to facilitate the interpretation of the findings from mixed methods studies and their conclusions in each of these scenarios, and how using the metaphor can help to promote greater clarity of the study's purpose, its theoretical propositions, and the links between data sets.
