Bacteriological cultures were performed on respiratory specimens in the referring hospitals. In the reference laboratory, serological testing for antibodies against SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was carried out, and virus culture was performed in a category 3 biological safety laboratory facility, where the samples were also prepared for PCR testing. Serology Acute sera and, where possible, convalescent sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV. The method used was an indirect immunofluorescence assay in which SARS-CoV-infected Vero 118 cells that had developed a cytopathic effect were used to coat microscope slides. Serum was diluted in serial two-fold steps from 1:10 to 1:40 in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with dilutions of the serum for 30 min at 37Â°C, the slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with rabbit antihuman IgG, IgA and IgM conjugated with fluorescein thiocyanate (Dako, Heverlee, Belgium). After washing and drying, the slides were examined with a fluorescence microscope [15] . The titre was defined as the highest dilution giving a 1+ or 2+ reaction.
