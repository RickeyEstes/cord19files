We used a previously published dataset from the GD1 mouse, in which the GBA1 gene was deleted in cells of the hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineage [10] . GD1 mice exhibited differences in phenotypic severity, and were classified as severe or mild/moderate based on the fold-increase in spleen size compared with control unaffected mice [10] . Fig. 1 shows our overall approach for selecting affected genes, filtering, and connectivity mapping. Gene expression patterns in the liver and spleen were profiled using the GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and analyzed with the Bioconductor GeneChip Robust Multi-array Average (GC-RMA) package. The dataset is available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession number GSE23086). Genes that satisfied the following criteria were selected as query for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA): (1) their expression pattern followed a progressive change, i.e. severe > mild/moderate > control; and (2) the upor down-regulated genes in the severe GD1 mouse showed more than a 2-fold change compared with control. After IPA pathway analysis, genes that constituted the most significant network, i.e. having the lowest p-value, were selected. However, not all selected genes were present in the original query as some were merely connecting molecules within the network. We therefore used more stringent filtering criteria for the IPA-analyzed genes, namely that (1) their expression pattern must follow a progressive change, and (2) the up-or down-regulated genes in the mild/moderate GD1 mouse must show a >2-fold change compared with control mice. Note that these criteria are more stringent in that the latter comparisons are being made between control and mildly/moderately affected mice (spleen size <6 multiples of normal), whereas in the initial screen control mice were being compared against severely affected animals (spleen size >6 multiples of normal). These sets of genes, namely liver up-regulated, liver down-regulated, spleen up-regulated, and spleen down-regulated, were translated to their respective Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133 probe set names and used as the ''query signature'' for analysis with CMAP (Connectivity Map; build 02; http://broadinstitute.org/cmap/) [11] . Results of the CMAP analysis were ranked first by enrichment and then by percent non-null after discarding hits with p-value > 0.05 and hits with number of instances (n) smaller than 2.
