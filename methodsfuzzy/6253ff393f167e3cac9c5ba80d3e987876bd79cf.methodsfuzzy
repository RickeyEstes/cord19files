The conventional methods of producing CNTs involve high heating of carbon black and graphites at specified temperature conditions. However, CNTs produced by this method posses uneven physical properties such as irregular shape and size, mechanical strength, quality and purity, ostensibly owing to the uncontrollable natural environment . The advanced methods for CNTs have now been reported in literature, viz. chemical vapor deposition (CVD), EAD, and laser ablation (LA) methods. Such techniques rely on high frequency electric and laser sources, with fine control on their reactivity with carbon material. Among these, the CVD technique is used as the most sought after technique for the laboratory scale and bulk industrial production of diverse types of CNTs. It produces CNTs by catalysis of carbonaceous materials at very high temperature (700 C) in a hot furnace (Kumar and Ando, 2010) . This technique has an advantage of being economical in nature for bulk production of CNTs. Fig. 4 .2 depicts the process of synthesis of CNTs using CVD technique. Recent literature instances have shown the utility of several advanced CVD techniques viz. plasma-enhanced CVD, thermal CVD, laser-assisted CVD, Flow layout of carbon vapor deposition method of preparation of CNTs. and high pressure CVD for effective manufacturing of CNTs (Nessim, 2010) . In the EAD technique, the CNTs are prepared by electric discharge of a high voltage beam (100 A) on graphite, used as feed material, as shown pictographically in Fig. 4 .3. This method has the advantage of producing CNTs of superior quality with very high tensile strength (Sharma et al., 2015) . However, in the LA technique the CNTs are produced by hitting a graphitic object with a high-speed laser beam, as shown in Fig. 4 .4. It produces CNTs of very narrow diameter and suitable for laboratory production of both SWCNTs and MWCNTs (Hornbostel et al., 2006) . Lately, other important techniques are being used for industrial and bulk scale production and manufacturing of CNTs, including cobalt-molybdenum catalytic (CoMoCat) process, high pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation technique, fluidized-bed synthesis (Dasgupta et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2008) , flame synthesis (Wal et al., 2000) , and solar energy√Äbased techniques (Dasgupta et al., 2011) .
