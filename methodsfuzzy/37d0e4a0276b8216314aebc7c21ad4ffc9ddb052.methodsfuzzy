Kinetic analysis was performed at 22 C by using an Ultra microtiter plate reader (TECAN) with a 360 nm/465 nm filter pair. In a typical experiment, 10 ml assay buffer was transferred to a 384-well plate (Cliniplate black, Labsystems) and mixed with 10 ml of enzyme and 10 ml of substrate solution. The final buffer was 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTE, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. The enzyme concentration was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm. Previous titration experiments with ubiquitin-aldehyde (Boston Biochem) have shown that our enzyme preparations were >95% active. Data analysis was done with Origin 6.1 (Microcal). Kinetic parameters were determined for the fluorogenic substrates ubiquitin-AMC (ubiquitin C-terminally derivatized with fluorogenic 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, Boston Biochem), RLRGG-AMC, and HLVLRLRGG-AMC (both Biosyntan). Initial velocities in triplicates were plotted versus substrate concentration ranging from 0 to 20 mM, and K M and v max were calculated in a nonlinear regression fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation v = (v max 3 [S])/([S] + K M ). The k cat was obtained from the equation is the total enzyme concentration. In these assays, the final enzyme concentration was 3 pM for UCH-L3 and 1.5 nM for USP2. For determination of the inhibition constants K i , UCH-L3 (1 pM enzyme) or USP2 (0.5 nM enzyme) were incubated with varying concentrations (0-100 mM) of inhibitor (ubiquitin, ubiquitin truncation mutants, and C-terminal peptide Ac-HLVLRLRGG-OH) in the assay buffer for 60 min at 22 C. Residual enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis ubiquitin-AMC by USP2 (5 mM substrate) and UCH-L3 (0.5 mM substrate) in triplicate. The apparent inhibition constant for each enzyme-inhibitor pair was determined from the uninhibited rate (v o ) and inhibited rates (v i ) by plotting v i /v o versus the inhibitor concentration. In such a plot, the slope equals 1/K i(apparent) . For competitive inhibition, the inhibition constant is defined as K i = K i (apparent) /(1 + [S]/K M ), where [S] is the concentration of ubiquitin-AMC. Please note that the competitive mechanism of inhibition has not been shown experimentally. In a competitive mechanism, inhibitor and substrate compete for the same binding site, which is most likely the case as ubiquitin-AMC and the inhibitor, ubiquitin and its deletion mutants, are almost identical molecules.
