Direct overt monitoring of individual EVS workers as they clean with or without some form of testing, such as fluorescent marking or an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) Fig. 3 . Improving disinfection cleaning to decrease environmental surface contamination. Various culture methods have been used to study microbial contamination of environmental surfaces. Swab cultures or replicate organism direct agar contact (RODAC) contact plates are often used for such assessments. Recently, sterile sponge cultures as well as Petrifilm have shown a potential for increasing the sensitivity of such cultures. 58 No matter which system is used, cultures are most helpful when it is necessary to identify specific pathogens during epidemiologic investigations of outbreaks. Unfortunately all these basic culture methods are difficult to use for programmatically monitoring cleaning practice because of the need to determine precleaning levels of contamination for each object evaluated to accurately assess cleaning practice due to the intrinsically low bioburden of health care environmental surfaces. 10 For this reason, swab system cultures are used primarily to identify specific pathogens to help clarify the epidemiology of possible environmental hygiene-related outbreaks or hyperendemic transmission problems. 46 Agar slide cultures Agar-coated glass slides, initially developed to simplify quantitative cultures of liquids, have been used to evaluate the cleanliness of environmental surfaces in health care settings. 53, 59, 60 Although the ability of the fixed surface area of the slide to quantify viable bioburden (expressed as aerobic colony counts/cm 2 ), is useful, any culturebased system to evaluate the environmental cleaning practice has the same limitations noted for swab cultures, necessitating the comparison of precleaning cultures with postcleaning, as discussed previously. A recent study confirmed the ability of such a process to evaluate thoroughness of cleaning practice. 61 In the study, 10.5% of precleaning cultures were without measureable bioburden using this system before cleaning. This decreased the sensitivity of this form of monitoring, which necessitated the monitoring of a greater number of objects to develop an accurate analysis of cleaning practice.
