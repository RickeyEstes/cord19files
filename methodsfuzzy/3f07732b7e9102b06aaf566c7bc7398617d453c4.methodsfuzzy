Isolation and culture of alveolar epithelial cells Alveolar type II cells were isolated from 6-8-week-old, specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (Dobbs and Mason, 1979; Manzer et al., 2006) . Briefly, type II cells were dissociated from rat lung with porcine pancreatic elastase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and were partially purified on discontinuous Optiprep (Axis-Shield Poc As, Oslo, Norway) density gradients. Cells were plated on plastic tissue culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 2.5 ug/ml amphotericin B, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, and 100 ug/ml penicillin G, and incubated at 37°C and 10% CO 2 . Culture of type II cells on plastic in DMEM containing 5% FBS for 3-5 days results in trans-differentiation into the type I cell phenotype, characterized by loss of expression of surfactant proteins, gain of expression of T1α and aquaporin V, and changes in morphology and lectin-binding specificities (Borok et al., 1998a (Borok et al., , 1998b Danto et al., 1995; Dobbs et al., 1985; Manzer et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006) .
