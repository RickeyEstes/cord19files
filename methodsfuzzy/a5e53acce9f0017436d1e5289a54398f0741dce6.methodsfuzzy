This report includes all data collected through 24 months of follow-up. Three study groups were defined in the protocol (infants who received palivizumab prophylaxis, controls not prophylaxed with palivizumab with a history of RSV hospitalization, and unprophylaxed controls without RSV hospitalization). Analyses compared the prophylaxed group with the combined untreated groups and the nonhospitalized untreated group. Post hoc subgroups of infants were determined on the basis of whether the following were present at baseline: family history of asthma and family history of atopy (asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Family was defined as anyone in the immediate family. Analyses were performed within these subgroups. A sample size of 200 infants per group would provide approximately 80% power for a 2-sided, .05-level test to detect as statistically significant a difference in physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing rates when the true rates were 3% for the prophylaxed group and 10% for the untreated controls. This study was not powered to test for differences within the subgroups previously specified. Demographics and baseline characteristics were analyzed for quantitative variables by using 1-way ANOVA and for categorical variables by using the Fisher exact test. Comparisons between the treated and untreated groups in incidence of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing were performed by using the Fisher exact test; the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI for the RR were calculated. The potential influence of baseline characteristics was explored with multiple logistic regression with covariates for RSV hospitalization history, sex, age at enrollment, gestational age at birth, birth weight, multiple birth status, baseline RSV-neutralizing antibody titers (log 2 RSV antibody level), day care attendance, numbers of adults and siblings in the home, number of siblings in day care, presence of a wood-burning stove in the home, and family history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or food allergies. Time to third physician-diagnosed wheezing episode was analyzed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models including the covariates listed. For each logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analysis, a forward stepwise selection method was used to determine factors significant at the .15 level; these factors were included in the final model. Only factors significant at the .05 level in the final model were displayed. Comparisons between the treated and untreated groups in time to third physician-diagnosed wheezing episode were performed by using the log-rank test, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were computed and displayed graphically.
