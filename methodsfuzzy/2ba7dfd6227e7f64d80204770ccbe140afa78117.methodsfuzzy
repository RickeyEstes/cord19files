Genome sequence dataset in this study 90 Full-length protein sequences of S protein RBD were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank 91 Database, China analyzed by DnaSP6 (version 6.12.03) 19 . Analyses were conducted using the Nei-Gojobori model 20 . 105 All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Evolutionary analyses were 106 conducted in Mega X(version 10.0.2) 21 . 107 . 108 Molecular dynamics simulation 109 The complex structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and human ACE2 was obtained 110 from Nation Microbiology Data Center (ID: NMDCS0000001) (PDB ID: 6LZG) 9 . Mutated amino 111 acids of the nCoV RBD mutants were directly replaced in the model, and the bat/pangolin CoV 112 RBD domain was modelled using SWISS-MODEL 22 . Molecular dynamics simulation was 113 performed using GROMACS 2019 with the following options and parameters: explicit solvent 114 model, system temperature 37Â°C, OPLS/AA all-atoms force field, LINCS restraints. With 2fs steps, 115 each simulation was performed 10ns, and each model was simulated 3 times to generate 3 116 independent trajectory replications. Binding free energy was calculated using MM-PBSA method 117 (software downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/Jerkwin/gmxtool) with the trajectories after 118 structural equilibrium assessed using RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) 23 . 119 120 Results
