The method for estimating the age-specific effective reproduction numbers suggested by White et al. [10] , which is a modification of the Wallinga and Teunis approach [21] , was adopted. Let p d denote the probability of a serial interval of length d, (d = 1,2,. . .,D where D be the maximum serial interval length), n t;g i denote the frequency of symptom onset in age group g i (i = 1,2,. . .,G where G is the total number of age groups) on day t (t = 1,2,. . .,T where T is the length of the study period), r g i !g j denote the contact rate between two individuals from age group g i and age group g j (j = 1,2,. . .,G). The effective reproduction number of age group g i on day t, R t;g i , can be calculated by summing the expected number of individuals in each age group from t+1 to t+D infected by an individual in age group g i whose symptom onset was on day t: denote the relative probability that an individual in group g j on day t+d was infected by an individual in group g i on day t. In this study, there were 7 age groups (i.e., G = 7) and the maximum serial interval length D was set at 20. p d was generated from a gamma distribution with a mean of 7 days and standard deviation of 3 days [14] . r g i !g j was estimated by using the contact matrix of China, projected by the Bayesian hierarchical model in Prem et al [22] . The estimation formulas were implemented in Microsoft Excel.
