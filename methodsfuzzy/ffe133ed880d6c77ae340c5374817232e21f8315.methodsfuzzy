database. In this work, L1 being the major component of the capsid assembly and the focus of HPV vaccine development, we restrict our approach to consideration of the L1 protein only and postpone consideration of the other capsid assembly component, the L2 protein, to a future work. We have downloaded 222 sequences of the L1 capsid gene of various HPV types from GenBank, updated till March 22, 2016 . Table 1 lists the number of sequences of the different HPV types forming the dataset we have used for the purposes of the present exercise. Annotated HPV data are also available through the specialized Papillomavirus Episteme database maintained by the National Institute for Allergic and Infectious Diseases. Given the high incidence of papillomavirus infections, one could expect more data to accumulate over time. Method of analysis. The method of analysis has been described in detail in our previous papers, especially in the study by Ghosh et al. 20 Initially, we scan a library of sequences of the designated protein to determine segments that are unchanged or least changed among the various strains, and then, couple these with average solvent accessibility (ASA) profiles of the sequences to select those segments that are most conserved and having highest solvent accessibility profile. We then determine epitope regions within these segments with acceptable binding affinity to human leukocyte antigens and finally select those peptides that poses no autoimmune threat; in the process, the 3D crystal structure of the surface protein is also utilized to ensure that the selected peptide regions are not covered against solvent accessibility due to neighboring proteins that together constitute the quaternary structure. As an optional step, the process may start with observations from graphical representations of DNA/RNA sequences in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system to determine similarities between the selected gene sequences or conserved segments within the selected sequences. In this system, a sequence is represented by a point for each nucleotide in succession plotted in a series of steps with one step in the negative x-direction for an adenine, positive y-direction for a cytosine, in the positive x-direction for a guanine, and in the negative y-direction for a thymine. 22 This generates a plot of the sequence that reflects the base distribution in the sequence. For a quantitative measure, we take the weighted center of mass (µ x , µ y ) of the points and the distance of the centre of mass (c.m.) from the center as a graph radius g R , which is considered as the characteristic of the sequence. 23 For protein sequences, this concept is extended to a rectangular coordinate system of 20 dimensions, where each amino acid (aa) is associated with a particular direction and the protein sequence is plotted by taking successive steps in the directions dictated by the aa sequence. 24 The plot is in abstract space, but we can again define a weighted center of mass and a protein graph radius, p R , just as for g R . The special property of g R and p R is that in each case when two sequences result in the same graph radius, albeit with some adjustments for p R as specified in the study by Ghosh et al. 20 , the sequences are found to be identical. 25 This property has been used in several instances previously 19, 20, 26 and is used in the current work to determine protein sequence segment varieties by determining the number of instances where the p R 's are identical (see more details below). To determine the target peptides that can be considered to elicit immune response, the steps in the process are, briefly: Global view of L1 gene sequences to determine similar and dissimilar sequences. 2D graphical representation plots are generated for the L1 gene sequences of different HPV types and visually inspected to determine those that appear similar and can be clubbed together for analysis. Identification of protein conserved segments. Viruses generally have high mutation rates, more for RNA viruses than for DNA viruses. The mutation rates for the dsDNA HPVs are very low, but nevertheless, mutations do occur leading to the various strains that populate the papillomavirus database -higher differences between types and smaller differences within each type; a phylogenetic tree of the protein sequences of the primary HPV types we are interested in this work, with five strains from each type, brings out this feature explicitly (Fig. 1) . Now, given the strict type specificity of the neutralizing antibodies and the mutations in aa composition, deletions, and insertions that may take place, 27 this implies that in specific cases neutralizing antibodies raised against one strain may not be viable against another strain, although the success of the current HPV vaccines show that this may happen seldom. Our interest is to identify those peptide segments that change the least between strains to reduce the possibility of such instances and examine whether one or more of such segments could form the basis for peptide vaccines. The methodology we follow for the purpose is to map the protein sequence using a window of 12-14 aas and sliding in increments of one aa at a time; ie, compute p R for the segment with aa nos. 1-12, say, for a chosen window size of 12 aa, then another p R for the stretch between aa nos. 2-13 and so on, until the end of the aa sequence is reached. At each stage, the peptide graph radius, p R , is computed and stored (see Refs. 19 and 20 for details). This is then repeated for each protein sequence of the selected group of sequences and then the entire lot is scanned at each mapped aa position to determine the number of different p R -values, among all the sequences. Since each p R value represents a particular peptide sequence, the number of values of the p R at each aa position map out a protein variety profile of the aas covered by the sliding window. The minima of the profile indicate regions where variety, and by inference changes in aas, are relatively least, indicating most conserved regions. The size of the window covering a number of aas needs careful consideration. In our previous analysis of the neuraminidase protein, 19 we had considered peptide lengths of 8, 10, and 12 aas; for rotavirus where mutational changes occur very frequently, it was considered prudent to consider window sizes of 12-14 aas 20 ; 14 residue peptides were found to be more potent antigenically compared with smaller peptides, 28 and we had used that size for the analysis of influenza hemagglutinin. 21 It may be noted that while peptide lengths of 6-20 aas are used in scanning for B-cell epitopes, peptides of 10+ residues may contain overlapping linear B-cell epitopes 29 ; cytotoxic T-cell epitopes have a limited length (8-11 residues), whereas for helper T-cells, longer peptide lengths are used. 30 Considering these issues and the fact that the HPV viruses are dsDNA type, which therefore are comparatively more stable, we fixed window length for this exercise at 12 aas. Solvent accessibility profile. The protein sequences are next mapped for solvent accessibility by subjecting them to an ASA server such as ITASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich. edu/I-TASSER/) or SABLE (http://sable.cchmc.org/) or any other suitable web-based server. Taking an average over 12 aas of solvent accessibility index at each aa position, and averaging over several sequences for each HPV type, this is mapped out to reveal the most solvent accessible regions by the maxima of the graph. First cut peptide segments. Mapping both the graphs, namely, peptide variability profile and solvent accessibility profile, together, we scan for those regions where the protein variability is least and solvent accessibility is among the highest. These are the first list of conserved solvent accessible segments of the protein. Confirmation from 3D structures and second cut choice. To confirm that the regions identified in the previous step are indeed surface situated, we examine the identified regions in a protein 3D structure, eg, as shown through a software such as Cn3D4.3 available at NIH website. 31 Marking out the identified segments on one protein of the 3D structure will reveal how much of the segments lie on the surface. If composite structures of this protein with the other proteins are available, then we can further fine-tune the selection process to identify those segments that really lie on an exposed surface of the capsid protein and not get covered by a neighboring protein of the virion. Determination of epitope segments. Next, we consider which of the segments from the second-stage choice contains epitope regions to elicit necessary immune response. For this, we use two epitope-prediction tools, viz., the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and Analysis Resource server [32] [33] [34] [35] and ABCpred server, 36, 37 which, as mentioned earlier, 21 have given good results. These tools indicate binding affinities of T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes (with 66% accuracy), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, and also of discontinuous epitopes through Ellipro. Autoimmune test. Finally, we test the peptides that have remained after the third stage above to ensure that they do not possess any autoimmune threats and are unique peptides by themselves. Each peptide segment is subjected to a proteinprotein BLAST to ensure that the selected peptides are not homologous to human proteins to cause autoimmune threats. These segments then become our recommendations for peptide vaccines subject to final verification in wet laboratories. That autoimmune threat can be a potential hazard has been explored in one of our earlier reports. 38
