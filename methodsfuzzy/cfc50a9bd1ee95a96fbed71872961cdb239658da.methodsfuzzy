CAD plays a significant role in the analysis of IR images. Human examination of IR images is often imperfect, because it is influenced by various factors like fatigue, being careless, and sensory overload by the sheer volume of information from this medical imaging modality. Making the right diagnosis is also constrained by the limits of human visual perception. For example, optical illusions have a detrimental impact on the diagnostic accuracy [25] . Furthermore, there is a shortage of qualified radiologists [26] . These facts manifest an urgent need to develop CAD technologies. Current research aims to improve the detection accuracy of IR image processing algorithms from three perspectives: asymmetry analysis of the thermogram including automatic segmentation approaches, smart image enhancement and restoration algorithms, and feature extraction and classification [27] [28] [29] [30] . To design such CAD systems, a clear understanding of design patterns and system structure is needed. To explain the system structure, we have adopted a top down approach which introduces the individual design steps necessary to create a generic thermography based CAD system. The block diagram, shown in Fig. 1 , introduces these design steps and the logical connection between them. The diagram is divided into offline and online systems. In the offline system, all the IR images will be pre-processed and their greyscale features may be extracted using various techniques. Subsequently, the extracted greyscale features will be analyzed with statistical methods to identify which features are significant enough to be used in the classification step. The significant features, together with the ground truth of each image class, will then be used to train a classifier. The result from this offline system is a set of classifier parameters that relates the significant features to the ground truth. The online system has a pre-processing stage as well and thereafter only those greyscale features, that were found to be significant in the offline system, are computed for the testing set of images.
