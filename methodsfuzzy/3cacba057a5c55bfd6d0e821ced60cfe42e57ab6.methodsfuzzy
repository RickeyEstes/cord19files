The model is implemented as a system of ordinary differential equations: We also model an exponentially growing reservoir ( ) for imported lineages in to Weifang. The equation governing this population isÌ‡ substitution model and a time-scaled tree was estimated using treedater 0.5.0 (Volz and Frost, 2017) . 176 Two outliers according to the molecular clock model were identified and removed using 'treedater' 177 which was also used to compute the root to tip regression. 178 Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out using BEAST 2.6.1 (Bouckaert et al., 2019) .
