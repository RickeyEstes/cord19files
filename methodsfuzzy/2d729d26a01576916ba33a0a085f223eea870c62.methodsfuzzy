Concentrations of neutral red from 2-10% added to a second agarose overlay were tested for enhancement of plaque visualization. Three days after virus inoculation, a volume of neutral redcontaining agarose overlay equal to the initial overlay volume was added and allowed to cool. Cell monolayers were also fixed and stained with Giemsa as described above, for comparison.
