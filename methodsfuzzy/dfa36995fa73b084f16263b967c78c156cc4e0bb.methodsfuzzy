Animals. Female BALB/c mice 4-6 weeks old were purchased from Beijing Vital Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing, China), randomly divided into groups at 10 per group, and received pathogen-free water and food for maintenance. Virus isolation. A 35-year-old female patient was hospitalized and confirmed with diagnosis as infected with SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV isolation was established by infecting Vero cells with the filtered stool sample from this patient under BSL-3 condition. Cytopathic effects were observed after 3-day cultures. cDNA was generated from the RNA isolated from the supernatant of the culture and used for the sequence analysis to confirm its SARS-CoV identity. Plasmid constructs for immunization. All DNA vaccine constructs, encoding the E protein, the M glycoprotein, and the N protein of SARS-CoV, were obtained as follows: these genes were amplified from the cDNA by PCR amplifications using each set of specific primers, respectively. For the N gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA-GAATTCGCCATGTCTGATAATGGACCC-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AAGAATTCGTTTATGCCTGAGTTG AATC-3 0 ; for the M gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA GAATTCGCCATGGCA GACAACGGTACTAT-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AATCT AGATTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCAAT AT-3 0 ; and for the E gene, the upstream primer is 5 0 -AA GAATTCGCCATGTACTCATT CGTTTCG-3 0 and the downstream one is 5 0 -AATCTAGATTA GACCAGAAGATCAG-3 0 . To express the three genes in eukaryotic cells, the sequences containing an ATG start codon and a Kozak consensus sequence, GCC, were incorporated into 5 0 end of each upstream primer. A restriction digestion site was also incorporated into each primer indicated as underlined. All the amplified products were first cloned into pDM18-T vectors and confirmed by the sequence analysis, respectively. The three products were, respectively, subcloned into appropriate sites of pcD3d, a 3.4 kb eukaryotic expression vector derived from the pcD3d vector (Invitrogen) by a deletion of the regions for the SV40 promoter, neomycin ORF, and SV40 poly(A). The final products were designated as the pcD3d/E, pcD3d/M, and pcD3d/N, respectively. All three DNA vaccines were transformed into the Esch-erichia coli strain Top10 (Invitrogen), extracted and purified by PEG8000 precipitation [16] . The final products were dissolved by saline solution and stored at 4°C until immunization. Determination of expression of DNA construct. HeLa cells were seeded at 4 · 10 5 cells per plate in a 6 cm 2 plate containing a complete DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL). The cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 until 80% confluent. The three constructs were transfected into the HeLa cells using the Lipofectamine according to the manufac-turerÕs instruction (Invitrogen, CA, USA), respectively. Each total cellular RNA was extracted from the harvested cells using an extraction kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China) 24 h after the transfection. The cDNA was synthesized from 2 ll of the total RNA in a 20 ll reaction system consisting of 4 ll reverse transcriptase buffers (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl 2 , and 50 mM DTT), 50 pmol oligo(dT) 18 primer, 0.5 mM dNTP, 10 U AMV reverse transcriptase, and 20 U RNase inhibitor. The reaction was performed at 42°C for 30 min and 99°C for 5 min. RNAs derived from HeLa cells that were transfected with a control vector were processed in parallel as a negative control. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR with each pair of SARS-CoV-specific primers described above for 30 cycles (94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 50 s) and with an extension for 7 min at 72°C in the last cycle. The PCR products were loaded on the 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under a 302 nm UV light. Immunizations. For immunization, the DNA constructs were mixed with 1% levamisole (LMS) as an adjuvant for the final injection according to our previous study [17] . Each mouse was injected with 100 lg/100 ll DNA vaccine intramuscularly twice at a biweekly interval. Mice sera were collected regularly on day 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56, and stored at À20°C for later use. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV antibody. Serum anti-SARS-CoV antibody levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [18] . Ninety-six wells of microtiter plates were coated with 2 lg/ml of a chemically killed SARS-CoV antigen per well diluted in 100 ll of 0.05 M bicarbonate buffers (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. Following the blocking of each well with 3% BSA-PBST at 37°C for 1 h, the mouse serum with a serial dilution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. A secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, IL) at 1:1000 was added into each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. To develop the ELISA, 10 mg TMB tablet (Sigma, St. Louis) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.025 M phosphate-citrate buffer and 50 ll of the resulting solution was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 M H 2 SO 4 and the resulting optical density (OD) at 450/ 620 nm was analyzed with a plate reader (Magellan, Tecan Austria GmbH). Titer values were assigned as the highest dilution at which the optical density was 2 SDs higher than the OD produced by the serum of pre-immune mice at equivalent dilution. T cell proliferation activity. On the 14th day after the second injection, the mice were sacrificed and single-cell suspension was prepared from spleens for each group as described previously [17] . The splenocytes were cultured in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates at 5 · 10 4 cells per well in RPMI-10. The cultures were, respectively, stimulated for 24 h with each of the following: 5 lg/ml Con A (positive control), 2 lg/ml of the chemically killed SARS-CoV as the specific antigen, 2 lg/ml BSA (irrelevant antigen), or none (negative control). The cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for 48 h. The colorimetric reaction was performed according to ''Cell Titer 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay'' protocol (Promega, USA). Briefly, the cells were mixed with a mixture of MTS/PMS (20 ll each well) and further cultured for 4 h. The OD value was quantitatively read by absorbance at 490 nm with the plate reader (Magellan, Tecan Austria GmbH). The stimulation indexes (SI) were determined by mean OD 492 reading of triplicate antigen containing wells divided by mean OD 492 reading of triplicate wells without antigen. Antigen-specific DTH. Five mice from each group were tested for DTH response. Seven days after the second immunization, all mice were challenged with the chemically killed SARS-CoV in the right footpad and also received injections with saline solution at the left footpad as the control. The thickness of the footpad was measured at 24, 48, and 72 h later with an engineerÕs micrometer. In vivo CTL assay. In vivo cytotoxicity assay has been recently documented [19, 20] . Briefly, to prepare target cells for the detection of in vivo cytotoxic activity, splenocytes were isolated from naïve BALB/c spleen after erythrocytes were removed. The single suspension cells were then washed and equally split into two parts, one of which was pulsed with the chemically killed SARS-CoV (50 lg/ml) at 37°C for 4 h and labeled with a high concentration of CFSE (2.5 lM, Molecular Probe, Portland, USA) designated as the CFSE high cells; while the other, as a control target, was only labeled with a low concentration of CFSE (0.25 lM) designated as the CFSE low cells. The two populations of cells were mixed together and injected intravenously at 2 · 10 7 cells into each mouse, which was previously immunized with E, M, N or control DNA constructs 7 days earlier. The mouse was sacrificed 4 h later to isolate lymph nodes. Cell suspensions from the lymph nodes were analyzed on a FACSCalibur analyzer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA), and each population was detected via its differential CFSE fluorescent intensities. To calculate specific lysis, the following formula was used: ratio = (percentage CFSE low /percentage CFSE high ). Percentage-specific lysis = [1 À (ratio unprimed/ratio primed) · 100]. Cytokine assay. Relative amounts of cytokine levels were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with a known amount of competitor, pQRS, as previously described [21] . An extraction kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China) was used to extract total RNA. The cDNA was synthesized by AMV reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) 18 primer. Each PCR was optimized with specific primers for the housekeeping or cytokine genes as described previously [17] . The amounts of specific competitor products of each reaction were assessed from scanned images of ethidium bromide-stained gels using Bio-Rad Image software (Quantity One 4.2.0). The total volume (intensity/area) of the specific product was determined and the statistical analysis was performed. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using StudentÕs t test, one-sided. Differences were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05.
