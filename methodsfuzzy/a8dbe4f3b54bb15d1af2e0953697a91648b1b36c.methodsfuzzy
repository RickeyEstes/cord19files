Evidence of computational drug design success in the field of drug development is reflected in a significant number of new drug entities that are currently in clinical evaluation. Computational drug design has emerged to harness different sources of information to facilitate the development of new drugs that modulate the behavior of therapeutically interesting protein targets. These computational approaches are classified mainly into two families: ligandand structure-based methods. Ligand-based methods use the existing knowledge of active compounds against the target to predict new chemical entities that present similar behavior. 12 Given a single known active molecule, a library of molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model to define the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target of interest. Comparison of the active molecule against the library is often performed via fingerprint-based similarity searching, where the molecules are represented as bit strings, indicating the presence/absence of predefined structural descriptors. 13 In contrast, structure-based methods rely on targeting structural information to determine whether a new compound is likely to bind and interact with a receptor. One of the advantages of the structure-based drug design method is that no prior knowledge of active ligands is required. 14 From a drug 3D structure it is possible to design new ligands that can elicit a therapeutic effect. Therefore, structurebased approaches contribute to the development of new drugs through the discovery and optimization of the initial lead compound. Currently, the combination of ligand-and structurebased methods has become a common approach in virtual screening since it has been hypothesized that their integration can enhance the strengths and reduce the drawbacks of each method. In this section, some of the most representative computational approaches used to design, optimize and develop a new drug are described. Although there are remarkable differences among them, they share a common goal: harvesting potential ligands or hits with the capability to bind to the target from an extensive database of generic small chemical compounds ( Figure 1 ). To achieve this goal, many essential Data preparation structure generation conformational analysis Figure 1 Workflow for hit identification: from data preparation to finding new leads. (A) Standard in silico drug design cycle consists of docking, scoring and ranking initial hits based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site, which is commonly referred to as virtual screening. Generally, in the absence of structural information of a receptor, and when one or more bioactive compounds are available, ligand-based virtual prescreening is utilized. This prescreening method is carried out by similarity search. The basic principle behind similarity searching is to screen databases for similar compounds with the backbone of the lead molecule. (B) In many situations, 2D similarity searches of databases are performed using chemical information from the first generation hits. (C) One alternative approach employs a ligand-based pharmacophore strategy that is often partnered with structure-based docking that uses a more stringent scoring matrix to determine the relative score made by matching two characters in a sequence alignment. This enhances the enrichment of initial hits and identifies the best compounds for computational evaluation, which are the second generation hits. (D) In the second phase, the molecular interactions between the target and the hits often identify ligand-based sites for optimizing these metrics for a unique molecular chemotype. (E) Computer algorithms, compounds or fragments of compounds from a database are positioned into a selected region of the structure (docking). These compounds are scored and ranked based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site. (F) Structure determination of the target in complex with a promising lead from the first cycle reveals sites on the compound that can be optimized to increase potency. steps and decisions have to be made in order to eliminate from irrelevant compounds at the beginning, to end up with those that show better potential activity or have side effects and show interaction with other drugs. This process performed with the assistance of computational algorithms is called virtual screening. Lately, pharmacophore approaches have become a quite important tool in drug discovery due to the absence of 3D structures of potential targets. Methods such as Pharmacophore Modeling and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) can give useful insights into the nature of target-ligand interactions, which in consequence result in predictive models that can be suitable for lead discovery and optimization. 15 Ligand-based designing approaches rely on the knowledge of the structure of active ligands that interact with the target of interest to predict new chemical entities with similar behavior. The argument to justify the success of a new drug design is based on the features of preexisting ligands, a concept known as molecular similarity; compounds with high structural similarity are more likely to have similar activity profiles. 12 This methodology is considered an indirect approach to drug discovery, and it is usually used when the 3D structure of the target is unknown or cannot be predicted. There are several ways to use a known active molecule or a set of them as a key pattern to screen a small molecule library. The first and simplest approach is the use of molecular descriptors or features. 13 Physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, volume, geometry, surface areas, atom types, dipole moment, polarizability, molar refractivity, octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), planar structures, electronegativity, or solvation properties----obtained from experimental measurements or theoretical models----are used as descriptors to compare the reference molecule or set of molecules with a large library of compounds at a very low cost. This task can be done efficiently using a symbolic representation of the molecule. These descriptors are encoded as bit strings indicating the presence or absence of the predefined properties, or can be further classified according to the different types of molecular representation: constitutional descriptors, count descriptors, list of structural fragments, fingerprints, graph invariants, quantum-chemical descriptors, and surface and volume descriptors. 16 Another ligand-based approach, which is more precise than molecular descriptors, is the use of a pharmacophore modeled with ligands (ligand-based pharmacophore modeling). Given the set of known active compounds as a reference, the next step to the use of molecular descriptors is the addition of the 2D or 3D structure of these molecules to build what is called a pharmacophore model. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), a pharmacophore is defined as ''the ensemble of steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target, and to trigger (or block) its biological response.'' 17 Therefore, structurally overlapping in space features, such as steric interactions, positively and negatively charged groups, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, or hydrophobic regions and aromatic rings----a pattern (not a molecule) representing the most probable characteristics and their geometrical constraints is used as a consensus model for the screening of small molecule library. Those new compounds show a high degree of complementarity with the pharmacophore, and are likely to be active against the protein target of interest; thus, they require a detailed and more fine study. This approach has been used extensively in de novo design, virtual screening, lead optimization and multitarget drug design, becoming a key computational strategy for facilitating drug discovery in the absence of a macromolecular target structure. 18 QSAR method consists of finding a simple equation that can be used to calculate some property from the molecular structure of a compound. In QSAR modeling, the predictors include physicochemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals. As a result, a simple mathematical relationship is established. Applications of QSAR can be extended to any molecular design purpose, including prediction of different kinds of biological activities, lead compound optimization and prediction of new structural leads in drug discovery. The process of building a QSAR model is similar, apart from what type of property is being predicted. It consists of several steps, which lead to the design of new compounds with the desired activity profile. 19 The first step involves the selection of a training set of compounds with their experimental activities to build a QSAR model. Ideally, each of these activities should cover the range of possible values for that activity. The next step is to compute descriptors that contain sufficient relevant information about the biological phenomenon. Despite the initial difficulty to predict in advance which descriptor variables will be valuable once descriptors have been calculated, one of them should be included in the QSAR model. A correlation coefficient gives a quantitative measure of how well each descriptor describes the activity. Thus, the descriptor with the highest correlation coefficient can be picked. Next, data analysis is needed to calculate the best mathematical expression linking together the descriptors and biological activities, in which information relating the essential features of the chemical and biological data structure is obtained. In the final step, validation and predictions for non-tested compounds will take place. An experimental validation of the model needs to be done, for example, by verifying already biologically tested compounds (test-set). If the QSAR predicts within acceptable restrictions, it may be used for a more extensive prediction of more compounds. Results should be interpreted for the proposal and design of new compounds with the desired activity outline. In contrast to ligand-based methods, structure-based methods work directly with the 3D structure of a macromolecular target or a macromolecule-ligand complex. Both approaches rely on structural target information to determine whether a new compound is likely to bind with high affinity in the region where the interaction modifies the behavior of the protein with a following therapeutic effect. In this way, the target is used as a mold, where the interaction with any of the small molecules in the chemical library is computationally simulated. Subsequently, only those that showed a better fit in the binding site are selected. These strategies are often used to improve the effect of known ligands using the biochemical information of the ligand-receptor interaction in order to postulate ligand refinements with small chemical modifications. If the information regarding the binding site exists, the steric complementarity of the ligand can be improved to increase the affinity for its receptor. Indeed, using the crystal structure of the complex, specific regions of the ligand that fit poorly within the active site can be targeted, and some chemical modifications to lower the energetic potential by making van der Waals interactions more negative may be postulated, improving the complementarity with the receptor. In a similar fashion, functional groups on the ligand can be changed in order to augment electrostatic complementarity with the receptor. 18 Recently, there has been a trend towards integrating both structureand ligand-based methods, which use information on the structure of the protein or the biological and physicochemical properties of bound ligands, respectively. The aim is to enhance the reliability of computer-aided drug design approaches by combining relevant information from the ligand and the protein. At the simplest, building a 3D pharmacophore to find potential ligands and performing further docking studies on the target constitutes a combined approach. These integrated approaches fall into two classes: interaction-based and docking similarity-based methods. Interaction-based methods focus on identifying the key interactions between the protein and ligand using available physicochemical data. These interactions are then used to screen small molecule libraries for compounds capable of producing such an interaction profile. In contrast, docking similarity-based methods merge structure-based docking methods with ligand similarity methods. With these combinations, virtual screening becomes very efficient and allows exploring libraries of up to 10 6 small molecules. 37---41
