A 10-ml reaction mix is normally prepared for each panel. It contains 16 TaqMan Universal master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 16 RNase P-VIC TaqMan assay, 16 TaqMan assay for the target gene (900 nM primers and 200 nM FAMlabeled probe), 16 sample loading reagent (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) and DNA with about 1,100-1,300 copies of the RNase P gene. 4.59 ml of the 10-ml reaction mix was uniformly partitioned into the 765 reaction chambers of each panel and the digital array was thermocycled on the BioMark system. Thermocycling conditions included a 95uC, 10 minute hot start followed by 40 cycles of two-step PCR: 15 seconds at 95uC for denaturing and 1 minute at 60uC for annealing and extension. Molecules of the two genes were independently amplified. FAM and VIC signals of all chambers were recorded at the end of each PCR cycle. After the reaction was completed, Digital PCR Analysis software (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) was used to process the data and count the numbers of both FAM-positive chambers (target gene) and VIC-positive chambers (RNase P) in each panel. A spike-in experiment was performed using a synthetic construct to explore the digital array's feasibility as a robust platform for the CNV study. A 65-base oligonucleotide was ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) that is identical to a fragment of the human RPP30 gene. The sequences of the primers and FAM-BHQ probe used to amplify this construct are from Emery et al [22] . The primers and probe were ordered from Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA). Both RPP30 synthetic construct and human genomic DNA NA10860 (Coriell Cell Repositories Camden, NJ) were quantitated using the RPP30 assay on a digital array. Different amounts of RPP30 synthetic construct was then added into the genomic DNA so that mixtures with ratios of RPP30 to RNase P of 1:1 (no spikein), 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, and 1:3.5 were made simulating DNA samples containing 2 to 7 copies of the RPP30 gene per diploid cell. These DNA mixtures were analyzed on the digital arrays as described above. Five panels were used for each mixture and 400-500 RNase P molecules were present in each panel. The ratios of RPP30/RNase P of all samples were calculated using the techniques developed in this paper. For each ratio, we did pooled analysis by adding the numbers of positive chambers in the first P = 1,2,3,4,5 panels. The results are summarized in the previous section and in Figure 8 .
