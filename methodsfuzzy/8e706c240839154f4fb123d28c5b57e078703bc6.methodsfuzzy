Post-infection hyperimmune SARS antiserum was generated in BALB/c mice following both intranasal (i.n.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of SARS-CoV (Urbani). The efficacy of passive transfer was tested in 12-monthold mice, in groups of 12, that received antiserum by i.p. injection. The negative control group received normal (nonimmune) BALB/c mouse sera (Harlan, Indianapolis, IA); the experimental groups received either undiluted post-infection hyperimmune SARS antiserum or a 1:4 dilution (in PBS) of the antiserum. Sera from the recipient mice were collected 24 h after i.p. injection, to determine the neutralizing antibody level achieved. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by a micro-neutralization assay in Vero cell monolayers [8] . Mice were then challenged i.n. with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV (Urbani). On day 2 post-infection (p.i.), when virus titer in the lungs is expected to peak, four mice per group were sacrificed and lungs were harvested to determine levels of virus present [7] . Briefly, lungs were homogenized as a 10% (w/v) suspension, clarified by low speed centrifu-gation, and titered on Vero monolayers in 24-and 96-well plates [8] . Because infectious virus can be neutralized ex vivo in lung homogenates and this can affect virus titers, we confirmed the presence of virus in lung homogenates by quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated and purified from 10% (w/v) lung homogenates using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with an on-column DNase digestion, as per manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was determined and 1 g was reverse transcribed using random primers included in the Stratascript First-Strand Synthesis System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR reactions were performed at 59 • C for a total of 40 cycles using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) on an Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene). SARS genomic RNA was amplified using forward primer 28411F (GGTGACGGCAAAATGAAAGAGC) and reverse primer 28725R (GGAGAATTTCCCCTACTG). 18S rRNA was amplified from each sample as an internal control using 18SF (GGTACAGTGAAACTGCGAAT) and 18SR (CAGT-TATCCAAGTAGGAGAG). C T is the cycle number when double stranded DNA was detected above background levels. Four mice per group were sacrificed on days 3 and 8 p.i. for evaluation of histopathologic changes. These time points were selected because at day 3 p.i., viral antigen and focal interstitial inflammation should be present and clearance of antigen accompanied by histopathologic changes indicative of lung repair should be visible by day 8 p.i. [7] . The lungs were inflated with 10% formalin and processed for histopathological examination. Pulmonary histopathology was evaluated and the distribution of SARS-CoV antigens was determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining [8] . In the vaccine study, mice received one of the three following interventions by i.n. inoculation: 1.4 × 10 4 pfu rVSV-S (the vaccine), 1.6 × 10 4 pfu rVSV (vector without a foreign gene, as a negative control) [9] or 10 4 TCID 50 SARS-CoV (Urbani) as a positive control for protection from subsequent challenge. Sera were collected on day 30 post-vaccination or post-infection to determine neutralizing antibody titers achieved. Mice were then challenged 3 days later with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV (Urbani) to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. Four mice per vaccine group were weighed daily for a week. On day 2 post-challenge, four mice per group were sacrificed and the lungs harvested to determine titers of infectious virus.
