SELEX, an interactive in vitro selection procedure, is the basic method used to engineer aptamers, which was first reported for screening of RNA aptamers independently by Ellington's and Tuerk's groups 25 years ago [1, 2] . SELEX was then adapted to generate DNA aptamers [3, 4] . In principle, aptamers are selected from an initial random ssDNA pool based on the binding of the oligonucleotides to the target molecules under optimal conditions. The ssDNA pool contains 10 14 -10 15 random sequences of synthetic DNA (the typical length is 15-70 nucleotides, flanked by two constant regions with primer sites for polymerase chain reaction [PCR] amplification). The unbound sequences are separated from the bound molecules, and the target-bound sequences are amplified by PCR. The amplified products (double stranded DNA) are converted to ssDNA through various ways [25] and then used as a new aptamer pool for the next selection round. Enriched aptamer sequences are finally cloned and identified by sequencing. Usually after 10-20 rounds of selection, the specific aptamers with the strongest affinity for the target molecules are obtained. The conventional SELEX procedure is time-consuming and requires several steps to obtain a specific DNA aptamer. To effectively generate highly specific aptamers, several novel methods using different selection approaches have been developed. Combining SELEX with other method is one of the most effective ways to further improve the selection efficiency and binding affinity of DNA aptamers. For example, cell-SELEX coupled with in silico maturation was developed to improve aptamer specificity [31] . The method consists of cell-SELEX, a post-SELEX in silico process and in vitro screening. After the normal cell-SELEX, an extra in silico process was performed to further evolve improved aptamers from the SELEX-selected sequences through successive rounds of sequence shuffling and random mutation based on a genetic algorithm. This is followed by in vitro functional screening and selection of enhanced aptamers from the shuffling and mutated sequences. This method permits the evolution of functionally enhanced aptamer sequences recognizing targets of interest. In addition to SELEX-like methods, other methods have also been developed; magnetic-assisted rapid aptamer selection (MARAS) is a method that uses magnetic beads and an externally applied rotating magnetic field to provide the competitive mechanism for the rapid selection of aptamers with different affinity to the molecular target as summarized in Figure 1B [32, 33] . This method uses biofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles to separate target-bound DNA oligonucleotides from a library, selecting those interactions that survive a disruptive force generated by the movement of the particles in an externally applied rotating magnetic field. It abandons the multi-cycle evolutionary process used in conventional SELEX and thus can achieve rapid selection (completed in less than one hour). A one-step selection approach is another promising way to increase the rate of aptamer generation. Recently, this rapid one-step selection method was developed to select specific DNA aptamers using only one PCR step as summarized in Figure 1C [34] . In this method, a target immobilized on a glass coverslip was subjected to carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled nucleic acid pool binding, extensive washing and microscopy examination, followed by PCR enrichment of the selected aptamers. A control experiment used a labeled target and a labeled DNA library was used to make sure the specificity of the selection. In the overlay image of the immobilized target labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (red color) and target bound FAM-labeled DNA aptamer (green fluorescence), an orange color is observed for target-specific selection. Although the binding affinity of aptamers selected with the current version of the one-step method was in the low micromolar range, it was believed that it can be further improved by using larger targets, increasing the stringency of selection, and by combining it with a capillary electrophoresis separation. This method was described as a user-friendly, low-cost and easy way to select DNA aptamers. In particular, this method allows the use of a chemically modified nucleic acid library directly as it requires only one PCR step. Moreover, a DNA microarray has been utilized to achieve one-step aptamer identification, in which the sequences of interest can be produced on the arrays for selection and PCR, cloning and sequencing are not required [35, 36] . Molecules 2015, 20, page-page 4 selected with the current version of the one-step method was in the low micromolar range, it was believed that it can be further improved by using larger targets, increasing the stringency of selection, and by combining it with a capillary electrophoresis separation.

Moreover, a DNA microarray has been utilized to achieve one-step aptamer identification, in which the sequences of interest can be produced on the arrays for selection and PCR, cloning and sequencing are not required [35, 36] . The target-coated magnetic beads are incubated with the ssDNA pool. The beads with bound sequences are then separated from the unbound sequences with a U-shaped magnet or magnetic stand. After re-dispersion, the beads are put in an externally applied rotating or alternating magnetic field. During this process, the weak and non-specific binding sequences are released and separated. The strong-binding sequences are finally released from the beads by heating and then incubated with the beads without a target for the negative selection. The selected sequences are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual; (C) One-step Selection: A FAM-labeled oligonucleotide library is incubated with a target immobilized on a glass coverslip that was coated with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG). Unbound sequences are discarded by extensive washing followed by monitoring with fluorescence microscopy. The coverslip is later crushed and the bound sequences are eluted by heating in water. The selected aptamers are amplified, cloned and sequenced as usual.
