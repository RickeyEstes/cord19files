The main design problem that drive the research questions and issues investigated, is anchored in the following question: Fhow can a designer generate and evaluate design options and choose a set of design construction specifications to effectively implement national sustainability strategies and objectives at the infrastructure project level?_ The research framework and methodology consisted of the following key stages: (i) review of existing literature, (ii) development and validation of key performance indicators (KPI) using various instruments such as survey and interviews with stakeholders, (iii) developing a structured methodology and formulating an analytical model for the multi-criteria decision-making problem domain, and (iv) application in a case study megainfrastructure project using a PC-based spreadsheet application (discussed in Part 2 [48] ). There are several dictionary definitions of the word strategy most of which relate to military planning and operations. However, two related definitions considered contextually suitable for the purpose of this paper define it as ''a plan of action or policy to achieve something'' [11] , and ''skilful management in attaining an end . . . the method of conducting operations. . .'' [12] . These definitions indicate that there are several key elements required to develop effective strategies for sustainable construction environment. Three of these critical elements include (i) clear formulation and setting of objectives; (ii) identifying and evaluating alternatives in quantitative and/or qualitative terms; and (iii) effective implementation of a selected/ chosen alternative. In the broader context of sustainability of infrastructure systems, which is the focus of this paper, the strategic objectives are articulated at the macro-level to underpin national frameworks for achieving broader sustainable development including sustainable construction environment. The alternatives in (ii) are design options, while the implementation in (iii) translates to choosing appropriate construction methods and techniques including effective management processes to transform abstract designs, concepts, and specifications into concrete sustainable physical artefacts. The research was conducted using a combination of structured interviews with industry professionals, case study project data, existing government guidelines on environmental impact assessments and sustainable construction environment, literature on sustainability research, and questionnaire-based survey for indicator validation. Fig. 1 captures the methodology for indicators development. The survey was conducted over a 1.5-month period from 1 August to 15 September 2003. A total of 134 questionnaires were sent to senior personnel in consultant, client, contractor and supplier organisations in Hong Kong. In order to achieve the above outlined objectives, the questionnaire was divided into two parts. The questionnaire was very detailed and outlined the specific contexts of the research to the respondents. Part I elicited respondents' background information (i.e., demographic data), while Part II focused on obtaining ideas on the suitability of various proposed sustainability indicators for use in assessing infrastructure projects. The questionnaires were distributed using a combination of post, internal circulation through contact persons working in the identified companies, fax, and by email. In Part I, personal background questions include information on respondent's awareness of sustainability appraisal instruments such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), and the level of use of such programs in practice. It revealed that although sustainability has been widely addressed in Hong Kong over the past 10 years, systematic appraisal tools are still not popular in practice. Personal background information elicited also include the respondent's experience and participation in sustainability-driven infrastructure project(s). Part II of the questionnaire asked respondents to give a score from 1 to 5 against each of the selected indicators to determine their suitability in assessing sustainability of typical infrastructure projects. This trans-lates as follows on the Likert scale 1 = not suitable, 5 = very suitable, with 3 being the average value for acceptance of an indicator suitability. A total of 33 valid questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of approximately 24.6%. Clients and Consultants gave higher response rates. This could be because they are generally the people who make design decisions and are, therefore, mostly confronted with the realties of making judgment on the sustainability of projects. Two invalid responses were also received from a contractor and a supplier company, who both left Part II blank. Interestingly, they noted that they are not in a suitable position in the field to make judgment on whether a design decision is ''sustainable'' or not, and further commented that it should be client, consultants or endusers' responsibility. However, this raises significant issues on sharing joint responsibility for infrastructure sustainability. Table 1 summarises key demographic information on the respondents. Evaluating the sustainability of different design concepts/ alternatives using numerical analysis involves three main steps. The process steps include (i) determining the relevant applicable criteria and alternative design options, (ii) assigning numerical values (i.e., weights) to measure the relative importance of these criteria for a given project and Table 4 Additional indicators suggested by stakeholders
