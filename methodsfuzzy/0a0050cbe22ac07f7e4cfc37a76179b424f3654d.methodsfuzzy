All human coronaviruses (HCoV) spike proteins were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 24 . Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of all of the sequences was performed using the Clustal Omega web server of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) 25 . ESpript 3 software was used to represent the MSA 26 . The pairwise sequence identity between COVID-19 spike protein and each of the other HCoV spike proteins was calculated using the same method. A model was built for the COVID-19 spike using the SWISS-MODEL web server 27 found in the PDB database is 5E84 30, 31 . The coordinates of 5E84 were downloaded and prepared for the docking experiment by removing water ions and the ligand. The solvated docking software, HADDOCK, was used in this study to dock the four regions of the spike model for COVID-19 against the solved structure of GRP78 32 . The easy interface was utilized since no restraints are defined 33 . GRP78 active residues (I426, T428, V429, V432, T434, F451, S452, V457, and I459) were retrieved from the literature 30 . The active residues from the COVID-19 spike protein were chosen for each region of the spike to be the hydrophobic residues. In both proteins, the residues surrounding the active residues were selected as passive in HADDOCK. Active residues are the amino acid residues from the two interacting proteins' binding sites that take part in direct interaction with the other protein partner while passive residues are the residues that can interact indirectly in HADDOCK [33] [34] [35] [36] . Furthermore, Pep42 is tested against the GRP78 solved structure to compare its binding affinity to that of the four regions of the spike protein. The Pep42 3D structure was generated using the I-Tasser web server 37 . Pep42 was treated as cyclic during the docking experiment (a distance restraint is added to HADDOCK) since the cyclic form of Pep42 is the selectivity determinant against GRP78 recognition 38, 39 .
