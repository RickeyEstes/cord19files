The data used were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [14] , accession number GSE2228. The array platform for this data is GEO accession GPL1834, and includes over 11,000 oligos representing over 1,000 viral and bacterial species [4] . The dataset itself consists of 56 arrays including 15 independent HeLa RNA hybridizations, 10 independent nasal lavage samples positive for respiratory syncytial virus, 7 independent nasal lavage samples positive for influenza A virus, a serum sample positive for hepatitis B virus, a nasal lavage sample positive for both influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, and culture samples of 11 distinct human rhinovirus serotypes. Both DetectiV and E-Predict [9] have been used to analyze the data. For DetectiV, the data were not corrected for local background. Missing, negative and zero values were set to a nominal value of 0.5. Intensities were averaged across replicate probes. Median normalization was then carried out, followed by a t-test grouping the data by virus species. Probes representing actin, GAPDH and Line_Sine were filtered from Table 1 DetectiV normalization methods Median Where is the value for probe i on array j and is the median value for all probes on array j
