During infection of murine cells, coronavirus MHV-A59 generates at least four viral nonstructural proteins (Spaan et al., 1988) . These proteins, present at low levels in infected cells, are difficult to detect against the background of cellular proteins. Some of these proteins have been detected in infected cells and in the products of cell-free translation of viral mRNAs (Leibowitz et al., 1982; 1988; Skinner et al., 1985) . We have previously used a vector generating a tripartite protein containing RecA-viral-fiGal aa sequences to generate antisera against a nonstructural protein encoded in gene E of MHV-A59 (Leibowitz et al., 1988) . The MHV-A59 RNAdependent RNA polymerase is presumed to be encoded in gene A, the approx. 23-kb sequence at the 5' end of the genome RNA (Pachuk et al., 1989) . Cell-free translation of genome RNA has allowed the identification of a group of proteins, 28-and 200-to 250-kDa (Denison and Perlman, 1986) , which are probably encoded in the 5' portion of gene A (Soe et al., 1987) . The protein products of the rest of gene A have yet to be identified. We demonstrate here a method for the generation of antisera against the polypeptides encoded in the viral polymerase-encoding gene using a vector in which the viral segment is randomized by homopolymer addition (Uhich et al., 1982) and inserted between a truncated recA and the lucZ gene, to generate B/V fusion proteins as immunogens. Unique to our work is a method to verify the viral specificity of these antisera using second fusion proteins. The viral segments are inserted into a second plasmid in which the cut gene is upstream from the viral sequences and provides the ATG for initiation of translation. RNA transcripts are generated in vitro from a T7 bacteriophage promoter and translated in a reticulocyte-free system. These viral/CAT fusion proteins were used to verify the viral specificity of the sera raised against the RecA/viral/j?Gal B/V proteins. In this way, we have been able to verify the viral specificities of the antisera without knowing the identity of the polypeptides encoded in this gene. This method of veritication of the specificities of antisera will be applicable to other systems in which the protein product of an ORF has not been identified.
