Mice C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), IL-10-deficient (Il10 2/2 ) (40), IL-27Ra-deficient (Tccr 2/2 , referred to as Il27ra 2/2 in this article; from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) (41), type I IFN receptor-deficient (Ifnar1 2/2 ) (42) mice, and "Il10 BAC-in transgene" (10BiT) IL-10 reporter mice (43) were bred and housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory (London, U.K.). Il10 flox/flox (Il10 fl/fl ) mice, which have loxP sites flanking exon 1 of Il10 (44), crossed with CD4-Cre (44, 45) , LysM-Cre (46, 47) , CD11c-Cre (48) , and CD19-Cre (49) mice and backcrossed for 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background (50) , were also bred and housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory. Littermate control (Il10 fl/fl Cre 2 ) mice were used in all experiments. Female mice were used between 8 and 16 wk of age. All protocols for breeding and experiments were performed in accordance with Home Office (U.K.) requirements and the Animal Scientific Procedures Act, 1986.
