We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess secular trends in the incidence of childhood AOM and tympanostomy tube insertion in each influenza season before and after the introduction of the TIV in Taiwan, by using the NHIRD. The influenza season is considered to run from October through March, as suggested by the Taiwan CDC [17] . The tympanostomy tube insertion procedure is considered a surrogate of refractory and recurrent AOM with OME. The data underlying this study is from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which has been transferred to the Health and Welfare Data Science Center (HWDC). Interested researchers can obtain the data through formal application to the HWDC, Department of Statistics, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan (http://dep.mohw. gov.tw/DOS/np-2497-113.html). The NHIRD includes no personal information, and this study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We included the NHIRD data of all children younger than 10 years. We stratified these children into three age groups: < 2 years old, 2-4 years old, and 5-9 years old. We used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to distinguish AOM-related medical utilization. We identified children with AOM episodes by searching for the relevant ICD-9-CM codes (3810, 38100, 38101, 38102, 38103, 3820, 38200, 38201, 38202) in each outpatient visit. We identified children with tympanostomy tube insertion by searching for the procedure codes for myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion under a microscope (84015B). To avoid confounding by PCV, which was not popular in Taiwan before 2007 [18] , our study period included only seven influenza seasons, between October 2000 and March 2007. The incidence of AOM was defined as the total number of outpatient visits during the influenza season, divided by the total person-season of the study population during the time period. The incidence of tympanostomy tube insertion was defined as the total number of operative procedures performed during the influenza season, divided by the total person-season of the study population during the study period. A 3-month screening period was set from the first operative procedure and any subsequent operation during the screening period was considered as a revision operation for the same episode. Age-specific incidence was calculated for the following age groups: < 2 years old, 2-4 years old, and 5-9 years old. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regression models. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
