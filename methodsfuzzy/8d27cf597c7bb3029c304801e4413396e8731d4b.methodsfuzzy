Suspected outbreaks of rabies were reported by farmers to one of the 103 satellite offices of National Service of Agrarian Health of Peru (SENASA) for sample collection and laboratory testing for rabies infection (n Â¼ 2269, see Data accessibility section). Because we focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of VBR rather than the intensity of outbreaks, we analysed data as outbreaks (defined as one or more laboratory-confirmed rabies infection on a farm) rather than as individual cases; however, most outbreaks (83%) involved only a single sick or dead animal.
