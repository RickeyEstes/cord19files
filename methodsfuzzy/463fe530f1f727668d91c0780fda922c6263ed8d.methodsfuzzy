A retrospective cohort study was carried out exclusively focusing on white veal calves in the Netherlands. White veal calves mainly consists of superfluous dairy calves (sometimes calves from suckler herds) that are transported to veal herds at an age of on average eighteen days. First, the calves are housed individually until an age of eight weeks after which they are held in group housing. Milk is the most important nutrition throughout the calves' life and at the age of approximately six months the white veal calves are slaughtered.
