Unpublished data from our group reveal that the optimal pH of the enzyme is around 8, but lower pHs, such as pH 7.4, have also been used with good results [13] . The redox conditions are very important for the optimal activity of the enzyme, 2 mM DTT is recommended as the minimal concentration of reducing agent to be added to the reaction buffer. These conditions are necessary for the reduction of the cysteine in the active site (corresponding to Cys40 in CCHFV-OTU). Multiple experiments have been done to elucidate the CCHFV-OTU's deubiquitinating activity towards K63and K48-linked poly-Ub. The results indicate that there are no major differences in CCHFV-OTU's activity towards the two types of Ub linkage. The CCHFV-OTU enzymatic activity was markedly decreased by mutating amino acid Cys40, indicating that this residue is required for optimal protease activity [6] . Atkin et al. [12] showed that CCHFV-OTU cleaves also K6-and K11-Ub linkages, but it is not able to cleave K29-linked and linear diUb. CCHFV-OTU is inhibited by general inhibitors of cysteine proteases, such as sulfhydryl alkylating agent NEM and the peptide aldehyde antipain [14] . Also as expected, CCHFV-OTU is inhibited by specific inhibitors of DUB enzymes corresponding to ubiquitin and ISG15 derivates coupled to aldehyde or vinyl sulfone [15Ã€18]. So far there have been no reports of specific inhibitors for the nairovirus proteases.
