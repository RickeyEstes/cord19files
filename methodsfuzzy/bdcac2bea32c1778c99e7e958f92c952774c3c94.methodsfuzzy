Patients: 8 Between July 2006 and December 2017, all patients with NHL having undergone ASCT with TBC conditioning regimen at the University of California, Los Angeles were retrospectively reviewed. Three groups of patients were included: PCNSL defined as lymphoma confined to the CNS including intraocular lymphoma; SCNSL defined as lymphoma with systemic disease and CNS involvement; or CNS relapse defined as initial diagnosis of systemic lymphoma followed by relapse in the CNS with or without systemic involvement at the time of relapse. The SCNSL and CNS relapse patients were grouped together as patients with systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement, whether that be at initial diagnosis or upon relapse. The primary analysis included patients who underwent ASCT in first complete remission (CR1). Patients with SCNSL or with CNS involvement at relapse of disease were analyzed separately.
