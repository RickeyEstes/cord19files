One of the criticisms of tourism crisis management literature is that it does not provide enough detail on the background context of case studies (Ritchie, 2009 ). Yet the broader social, economic and political context is also important. It can help understand the underlying vulnerabilities of the sector or country, the impact of a crisis and explain why certain strategies were implemented. Drawing upon evidence emerging from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in The Gambia over 21 monthsbetween November 2014 and July 2016, this paper reports on fieldwork undertaken in informal settings using a Rapid Situation Analysis (RSA) as the research methodology. The RSA is "a hybrid, participatory, bottom-up [qualitative and interpretative] research approach" (Koutra, 2010 (Koutra, , pp.1016 . Typically, the analysis of those on the ground allows for a more in-depth and defined understanding of the crisis and opportunities in relation to destination recovery and tourism development. RSA interprets and consolidates the feedback from local participants which, when shared back with the community, allows for reflection, ownership and transformation (Koutra, 2010) . As a result, the trustworthiness, representation and reliability of the research increased; as data is reviewed through probing questions with those providing the information. The RSA consisted of five stages: • Desk research (i.e. government statements, GTB and tourism providers' website, press releases) • Retrospective analysis of field diary entries • Semi-structured interviews with identified research partners in The Gambia and UK • Overt participant observations during public and private sector workshops and meetings • Feedback through probing informal discussion and study refinement The intention was to use this participatory research method to explore perceptions and practices of tourism stakeholders, and cocreate knowledge and understanding with the research partners based in The Gambia and the UK. This was then consolidated through feedback received during the meeting held in the last stage of the field research (July 2016). It was deemed important to include stakeholders with differing levels of influence and interest, and geographical spread from the capital Banjul to the peripheral areas of Kartong. Fieldwork in The Gambia commenced in November 2014 (the beginning of the high-season), and in December 2014 and December 2015 (the peak of the high-season). The research continued in the UK between May and August 2015, with follow up fieldwork occurring twelve months later in July 2016 to further assess the post-EITC situation. While field diary entries and participant observation records served as framing evidence of the EITC during the period under investigation; nineteen in-depth semistructured interviews (see Table 3 ) allowed respondents to provide insights into their experience with the EITC. This facilitated data triangulation with field diary entries and participant's observational findings. This study focuses on research questions that contribute to understanding how and why things happened, rather than testing a hypothesis with theory derived from generated data (Hart, 1998; Robson, 2011) . As the aim of this study is to understand how people construct reality as they engage with their world (Ritchie, Burns, Palmer, & NetLibrary (Eds), 2005; Robson, 2011); the social interpretation of recovery and repositioning of The Gambia following the crisis lends itself to a holistic inductive RSA approach, focusing on the entirety of destination recovery, as a series of complex inter-related pieces, rather than assessing individual parts (Armstrong, 2008) . Identified research partners were approached by email for a phone, Skype or Facetime interview with twenty questions grouped according to Ritchie's framework (Fig. 1) , which would drive the conversations and provide insight into their experiences (England, 1994) . Open conversation was encouraged to establish rapport, which proved invaluable when analyzing and contextualizing the interview transcripts, in conjunction with retrospective diary entries and field notes. The interviews lasted between one to two hours and were conducted in English, largely in the research partner's working environment (in The Gambia) and by Skype/Facetime (from the UK). They were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis to "identify core consistencies and meanings" which structured the analysis themes (Patton, 2002, p. 453) . In order to maintain anonymity, research partners were coded as indicated in Table 3 . Photographic evidences supplemented the interviews.
