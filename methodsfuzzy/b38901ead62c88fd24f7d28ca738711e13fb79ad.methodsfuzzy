For this review, we adapted the PRISMA methodology (Moher et al., 2009) to identify quantitative modeling studies of the 2013-present West Africa EVD epidemic. We searched PubMed on September 24, 2015, for publications in English since December 1, 2013, using the term 'Ebola' in any field. We reviewed all returned abstracts and selected ones for confirmatory, full-text review that mentioned use of quantitative models to characterize or predict epidemic dynamics or evaluate interventions. We included studies that met this criterion in full-text review. We excluded studies of clinical prediction models, viral or physiological function models, ecological niche models, animal reservoir models, and publications that did not use data from the 2013present West Africa EVD epidemic. For included publications, we recorded the geographic settings, date of most recent EVD data used and date of publication, type of EVD data used, questions the models addressed, modeling approaches, and key results, including estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and forecasts of future EVD incidence provided in the main text of the publications. To assess forecast accuracy, we compared predictions of models made under 'status quo' assumptions (i.e., without explicit inclusion of additional interventions or behavioral changes) to EVD incidence data subsequently released by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2016), using the WHO figures dated soonest after the forecast target date. . Accuracy of cumulative incidence forecasts. Accuracy is shown as the ratio of predicted incidence to incidence subsequently reported by the WHO. 'Dampening' refers to various approaches to restrict the growth of forecasted incidence over time. Top row: Accuracy by date of forecast. Bottom row: Accuracy by forecast lead time ('Horizon'). The Figure excludes one forecast with horizon > 1 year
