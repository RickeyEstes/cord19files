In the spirit of traditional event studies, we begin our analysis by computing cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around DRNs. The abnormal returns are defined as the difference between the observed rate of return of a pharmaceutical portfolio and its ex-post expected rate of return over the whole length of the event window. The expected rate of return is estimated based on the Fama-French three-factor model. 13 We choose an event window length to cover 14 days prior and 14 days after DRNs. The estimation window for the model is 252 days long. In our sample, we observe temporal clustering of DRNs. This means that if all DRNs were taken into account, the CARs would 12 Despite the well-documented first-mover advantage in the pharmaceutical industry, "under the current law, the chemical formula and the efficacy of the cure as established by clinical trials are made available for competitors essentially for free" (Boldrin and Levine, 2013, p. 13) . When patents expire, low-cost generics are immediately introduced into the market. 13 The daily data for the factors SMB, HML, and the excess return on the market were obtained from Kenneth French's website (http://mba.tuck. dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french). suffer from overlapping event windows. For this reason, our CAR calculations include only a subset of all available DRNs. The DRNs are selected according to the following two criteria. In the first selection procedure, Last event, we choose the DRNs only if it is not followed by other DRNs within 28 days after its occurrence. For First event, on the other hand, we select the DRNs in a chronological order. We start with the first DRNs in the sample, ignore all DRNs showing up in the proximate 28 days, take the next DRNs in succession, ignore the following 28 days, and so on. This iteration proceeds until the whole sample is exhausted. For illustration, assume there are five DRNs taking place at dates τ 0 , τ 1 , τ 2 , τ 3 , and τ 4 , where τ 1 , τ 2 , and τ 3 are temporally clustered. Then, for Last event, we use DRNs for CAR calculation occurring on days τ 0 , τ 3 , and τ 4 ; for First event, we choose τ 0 , τ 1 , and τ 4 . Panels A and B in Fig. 2 illustrate these two simple examples. We follow existing empirical studies (Kamstra et al., 2003; Edmans et al., 2007; Kaplanski and Levy, 2010a,b; Curatola et al., 2016) to evaluate the impact of DRNs on pharmaceutical stock returns, and to identify the negative fear effect. We thus implement the following regression model: where R p t , is the daily rate of return on a pharmaceutical stock portfolio p at time t, β 0 is the regression intercept, and − are lagged dependent variables. D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , and D 4 are dummy variables for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, respectively, and D TAX t is a dummy variable for the first five days of the taxation year. Further, E t represents the DRNs effect variable, FI t denotes a fear index, and u p t , is an error term. In line with existing studies, the VIX is used to proxy the investment fear index also known as "investor fear gauge" (Whaley, 2009 ). 14 Specifically, in the spirit of Bloom (2009) Notes: This figure depicts the average cumulative residuals around the event date (t¼ 0) for pharmaceutical portfolios EW, VW, TOP, and BOTTOM. The residual on day t is calculated as the difference between observed rate of return and the ex-post expected rate of return on day t. The three-factor model is , where r t is the pharmaceutical portfolio return and − r r m t f , , smb t and hml t are Fama-French factors. The estimation window is 252 days. The solid (dashed) line represents the Last (First) event approach when estimating the CARs. This ensures that event windows are non-overlapping. Panels A and B illustrate the two different estimation procedures graphically. The Last (First) event approach includes event days τ 0 , τ 3 and τ 4 (τ 0 , τ 1 and τ 4 ) in the estimation procedure. The events occurred during a 12-year period (March 2003-December 2014) which includes 33 event days with non-overlapping event windows. 14 We consider the VIX an adequate proxy as the correlation between the 252-day rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500 Index (S&P 500) and the pharma portfolios is rather high (average correlations are reported in parentheses): EW (0.79), VW (0.72), TOP (0.82), and BOTTOM (0.78). 15 The fear effect FI t overlaps with the sentiment effect generated by DRNs in 119 out of 146 cases. variables are embedded in our main regression to account for possible serial correlation. We choose five lagged returns to be sure that all serial correlations have been accounted for. The dummy variables for the days of the week are employed to account for the so-called "Monday effect." To account for a possible positive sentiment effect on the days following DRNs, or differently, for a possible reversal effect, we run also the following regression: approach. The Last event approach gives rise to positive abnormal returns following the event day for the EW and BOTTOM portfolios. The increase prior to the event can be attributed to the sensitivity of the Last event approach to the contiguous (preceding) events in the overlapping window. The First event approach points to an increase in returns of the EW and BOTTOM portfolios on the event day. This increase is rather persistent on the days following the event, thus, confirming that those DRNs that were discarded in the CAR calculation had a positive impact on pharmaceutical stock returns. The results are less supportive for the VW and TOP portfolios. The event study results are weaker than the regression results reported in the next section due to the fact that only 33 out of 146 DRNs were employed in the CAR analysis. In general, EW Last/First (VW, TOP, and BOTTOM) experienced in 27%/30.7% (34.6%/42.3%, 38.4%/42.3%, and 53.8%/50%) of all event cases a significant CAR at the 10% level. The CAR analysis provides evidence supporting the persistent (positive) sentiment effect hypothesis (Hypothesis 3). One could anticipate that the SMB factor in the three-factor Fama-French model already captures some of the effect of investment sentiment, biasing the estimate of CARs. Indeed, if investors holding smaller cap stocks become more optimistic, then the SMB factor increases, and the CAR decreases. We also compute the CARs by employing the excess return on the market in a one-factor model. 16 The unreported results suggest more pronounced CARs for the BOTTOM portfolio. Overall, our event study analysis reveals a positive and persistent effect of DRNs on the stock returns of pharmaceutical companies.
