PDCoV diagnostic methods can be divided into two categories: virological and serological methods. Virological methods include detection of virus particles (electron microscopy), detection of viral nucleic acid (various RT-PCRs and in situ hybridization), detection of viral antigen (immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry), and detection of viable virus (virus isolation and swine bioassay). Serological assays can be used to determine previous exposure to a virus, to determine kinetics of antibody response to virus infection, and to evaluate efficacy of vaccines. The most commonly used serological assays include indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, virus neutralization (VN) test or fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) test, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) although some of these assays have not been well validated for the detection of PDCoV antibodies. Table 1 summarizes the current virological and serological methods for PDCoV detection.
