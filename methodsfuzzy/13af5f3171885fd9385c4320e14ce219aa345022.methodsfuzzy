We searched the literature for studies reporting epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, including the reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, infectious period, generation time, latent period, and the fatality rate of hospitalized cases. The Korean Society of Epidemiology 2019-nCoV Task Force Team (KSE 2019-nCoV TFT) searched for peer-reviewed articles pub-terval [CI], 1.3 to 3.2) [10] . Three other studies estimated the mean reproductive number as 0.3, 2.2, and 2.68, respectively [8, 11, 12] . A study reported the mean incubation period to be 6.1 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 9.7), and the mean serial interval to be 7.7 days (95% CI, 4.9 to 13.0) [10] . Two studies predicted the mean doubling time to be between 6.4 days and 8.7 days [10, 11] . Three studies estimated the fatality rate of hospitalized cases as 14-15% [2, 8, 9] . We could not identify any studies that reported the infectious and latent periods.
