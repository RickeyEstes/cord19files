Isolation of DNA from fecal contents was performed by adding the cotton head of each sample swab to 1.5 mL of nuclease-free water (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and vortexing for 2 min. The swab was then removed and the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,200 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet was used for total metagenomic DNA extraction using the E.Z.N.A Stool DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Concentration and purity of the DNA were evaluated by optical density using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland, DE), and approximately 350 ng of DNA was used for PCR. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from individual metagenomic DNA samples from the fecal content using barcoded primers. For amplification of the V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA gene, primers 515F and 806R were used according to previously described methods and optimized for the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA; Caporaso et al., 2012) . The earth microbiome project (www.earthmicrobiome.org) was used to select 280 different 12-bp barcodes for the 16S rRNA PCR, as previously described (Caporaso et al., 2012) . The 5′-barcoded amplicons were generated in triplicate using 300 ng of template DNA, a master mix (Lucigen, Middleton, WI), and 10 µM each primer. The PCR conditions for the 16S rRNA gene included an initial denaturing step of 94°C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 90 s, and a final elongation step of 72°C for 10 min. Replicate amplicons were pooled and purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and visualized by electrophoresis through 1.2% (wt/vol) agarose gels stained with 0.5 mg/mL ethidium bromide before sequencing.
