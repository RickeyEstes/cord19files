Ethics statement. Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee [approval no. SYXK (Hei) 2011022] of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), and they were performed in accordance with ethics guidelines using approved protocols. Experimental animals. The allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specificpathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos was inoculated with 100 l of virus specimens at 1 ϫ 10 4 or 1 ϫ 10 5 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) per ml, as indicated below, as well as 25 to 250 ng of SU6656 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA), 250 ng of PF573228 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All chicken embryos were incubated at 37°C and examined daily over 5 days. The chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs), allantoic fluids, and livers were then harvested, homogenized, and subjected to three cycles of freezethawing. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on sections of liver samples fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as previously described (36) . Virus strain and cell line. The LJS09 strain of ILTV (GenBank accession no. JX458822) (15) is a virulent strain of ILTV that was isolated in China, and its genome has been sequenced. It was isolated in 2009 from 6-week-old Yellow-Foot layers housed on a farm in Jiangsu Province, China, which had not been vaccinated against ILTV, and it was stored at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the CAAS. This strain can be propagated in a chemically immortalized LMH cell line, in which clear cytopathic effects (CPEs) have been observed (37, 38) . LMH cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . The Src inhibitor SU6656 and the FAK inhibitor PF573228 were used at 1 and 10 M, respectively, for in vitro experiments. Control groups were treated with DMSO at the same concentrations. RNA interference and transfection. Two short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that specifically recognize different sequences of the SRC mRNA (GenBank accession no. NM_205457.2; siSRC #1, 5=-CCA AAC ACG CUG AUG GCU U-3=; siSRC #2, 5=-GCC UCC UGG AUU UCC UGA A-3=) and a control siRNA (siControl; 5=-GCA CUU GAU ACA CGU GUA A-3=), which does not have a specific target site in chickens, were used. Transfection of siRNAs was conducted using an N-TER nanoparticle siRNA transfection system (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plaque assay. Liquid medium-based plaque assays were performed as previously described (39) , with minor modifications. Briefly, LMH cells were exposed to virus that was diluted in serum-free DMEM for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were subsequently covered with DMEM containing 10% FBS, fixed with 70% ethanol at each time point postinfection indicated below, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Quantitation of virus. LMH cells were infected with LJS09 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The indicated MOI was obtained according to the number of cells to be infected and the number of infectious particles, which were estimated on the basis of the numbers of PFU, which were calculated using the following formula: TCID 50 ϫ 0.59 Ϸ PFU [1 TCID 50 is equal to Ϫln(0.5) PFU and is approximately 0.59 PFU] (40). Levels of virus replication were determined using TCID 50 assays (40) on LMH cells and ILTV-specific qPCR assays (38) as previously described. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. We conducted fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses using a BD FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (version 4.0.2; BD, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cell death was assayed by examining cells in the sub-G 1 phase of the cell cycle via propidium iodide (PI) staining of permeabilized cells as previously described (41) . Apoptosis and necrosis were assayed with annexin V-PI using an annexin V-PI staining kit (Biyuntian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescent detection of ILTV-positive cells was conducted on cells that had been fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Fixed cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ILTV glycoprotein I (gI), followed by a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). A polyclonal antibody against the gI of ILTV was produced in a rabbit. Briefly, the rabbit was first immunized with the pCAGGS-gI vector via intramuscular injection, followed by boosting with inactivated ILTV and recombinant gI protein via intramuscular injection. The background level of reactivity was determined using control serum from nonimmunized SPF rabbits. Protein extraction and Western blotting. Western blotting was performed under reduced denaturing conditions according to previously described procedures (42) . Antibodies against Src (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), phosphorylated Src Tyr416 (EMD Millipore), FAK (Santa Cruz, Shanghai, China), phosphorylated FAK Tyr397 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. [CST], Shanghai, China), phosphorylated FAK Tyr576/577 (CST), ␤-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and ␤-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The intensity of the bands was measured using ImageJ software (43) .
