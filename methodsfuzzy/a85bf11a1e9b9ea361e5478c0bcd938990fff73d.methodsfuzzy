At Vanderbilt. PCR testing-Nucleic acid extraction and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) testing. RNA was extracted from thawed specimens according to the manufacturer's protocols for the MagMAX-96 TM Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies). Primers and probes were synthesized by a commercial supplier (Eurofins MWG Operon, Huntsville, AL, USA) based on previously described sequences [11] . rRT-PCR assays were designed to target the upE and ORF1b regions of the MERS-CoV genome. As a positive control, the target sequence of the upE assay and flanking nucleotides (c. 400 bp total) were synthesized by a commercial source (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and cloned into plasmid pUC57. One-step rRT-PCR reactions were prepared using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 400 nM forward and reverse primers and 200 nM probe. Cycling parameters were 50°C 9 30 min, 95°C 9 10 min and 45 cycles of 95°C 9 15 s and 58°C 9 30 s, with fluorescence data collected during the 60°C annealing/extension step. Specimens were tested first by the upE assay using 5 lL of RNA. Potential positives were then retested using the ORF1b assay and the upE assay was repeated, both with 10 lL of RNA. Culture-Cells and viruses. Vero and LLC-MK2 cells were maintained in OptiMEM â (Life Technologies) media supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, gentamicin, amphotericin B, glutamine and tylosin. All virus work was performed in a biosafety level (BSL) three laboratory following IBC-approved BSL-3 procedures. Virus recovery. Vero and LLC-MK2 cells were plated in 25-cm 2 flasks. The next day, media was removed and then 1 ml was added back. Frozen specimen aliquots were thawed on ice and 75-100 lL of specimen or PBS (mock) were added to the flasks. Flasks were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 30 min, with rocking every 10 min, and then 2 mL of Opti-MEM was added to each flask and flasks were returned to the incubator. Flasks were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) every 24-48 h. At CDC. PCR testing-Briefly, total nucleic acids (TNAs) were extracted from 200 lL of the swab specimens using the NucliSENS â easyMAG â (bioM erieux, Durham, NC, USA). All specimens were tested by three discrete rRT-PCR assays: the upE assay as described above and two in-house developed assays targeting the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid gene. All assays were performed in 25 lL final reaction volumes containing 5 lL of sample TNA extract using the Invitrogen SuperScript â III Platinum â One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Life Technologies) on an Applied Biosystems â 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument (Life Technologies). Positive test results were assigned to samples generating well-defined fluorescent curves that crossed the threshold within 45 cycles for any assay and were further investigated. Positive (MERS-CoV RNA transcript template) and negative (nuclease-free water) controls were included in all runs to monitor assay performance. All samples were also tested by rRT-PCR for the presence of the human ribonuclease P gene as a control for specimen quality.
