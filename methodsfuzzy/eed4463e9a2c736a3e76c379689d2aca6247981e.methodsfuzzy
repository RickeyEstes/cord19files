Alberta is a province in Canada with a publicly funded universal healthcare system; each of the 4.25 million residents is assigned a unique personal health number (PHN) at birth or on immigration to the province. 15 The PHN is recorded each time a person accesses the healthcare system, allowing for deterministic linkage across multiple administrative data sets held by the Ministry of Health. In 2009, influenza vaccination became universally available to all Albertans aged â‰¥6 months, regardless of comorbidities or other risk conditions. 16 Influenza vaccines are available at no cost to the patient at public health clinics, pharmacies, physician offices, long-term care facilities, university health centres, and workplaces. Annual vaccine campaigns begin in October, with approximately 60% of all influenza vaccinations given by the end of the second week of the campaign. While the peak of influenza activity has varied widely since 2010, the median influenza peak in Alberta is in mid-January, approximately 3 months after the vaccination campaigns begin. laboratory methods for influenza A and b detection and influenza A subtyping All influenza testing in Alberta is performed at a single diagnostic lab, the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) and stored in a single laboratory information system, along with test and patient identifiers. Clinical specimens (eg, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavages) are processed at ProvLab using previously published protocols. Nucleic acid extraction utilises the easyMAG extractor and reagents (bioMerieux). 17 Nucleic acid from clinical specimens is then tested using a series of respiratory detection assays as described below. Prior to May 2017, a real-time influenza A/B reverse-transcriptase PCR was used to diagnose influenza using a protocol previously described. 18 19 After May 2017, ProvLab has been using a Luminex respiratory pathogen panel for the identification of influenza A (including subtype), influenza B and other respiratory viruses (eg, coronavirus and parainfluenza). 15 Results of the laboratory testing were imported into specific laboratory information systems depending on the testing time period.
