Physician concerns and coping methods regarding SARS are presented in Table 2 and Table 3 , respectively. As shown, physicians who self-reported psychological distress were significantly more likely to cope by talking to others and avoiding travel than were physicians without distress. Principal components analysis with varimax ro- tation was conducted on the 11 Likert-type coping items to determine the number and nature of methods utilized by physicians. Upon examination of the scree plot and the rotated component matrix, three factors were extracted. Table 4 presents the resulting solution. The first factor appears to reflect psychosocial coping techniques such as enlisting social support and engaging in positive health behaviors. The second factor appears to reflect active coping based on the best available scientific evidence. The third factor appears to reflect avoidant strategies to impede contracting or spreading the infection.
