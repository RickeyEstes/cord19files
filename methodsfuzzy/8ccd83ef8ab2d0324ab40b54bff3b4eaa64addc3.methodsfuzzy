Under normal conditions, with an intact immune system and normal ecology of the gut, a high diversity of bacterial species is observed in the intestine. Most of these bacteria are permanent inhabitants of the GI-tract. They are mostly strict anaerobes and difficult to cultivate. Traditional cultivation techniques separate about 30âˆ’40 species from any individual (Moore and Holdeman, 1974; Drasar and Barrow, 1985) . Yet, owing to the complexity of this flora, not all of them can be fully investigated. In this section we will briefly evaluate some of the available quantitative and qualitative methods for sampling in order to understand the present limitations for analysing the intestinal microfloras in animals.
