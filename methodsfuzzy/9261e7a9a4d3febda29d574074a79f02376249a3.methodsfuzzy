RPE1-hTERT cells, 293T and NHF1-hTERT cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma Aldrich) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Seradigm) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Wi38 cells (ATCC) were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% FBS (Seradigm), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and Minimum Essential Medium non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every three days with trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) and not allowed to reach confluency. To synchronize RPE1 cells in G0 by contact inhibition, cells were grown to 100% confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2 mM Lglutamine for 48 hours. To release cells into the first or second cell cycles, G0 cells were re-stimulated by passaging 1:10 for the first cycle, harvesting 24 hours later or 1:20 for the second cycle, harvesting 48 hours later, in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. To synchronize RPE1 cells in G0 by serum starvation, cells were plated sub-confluent, washed 3 times with PBS, and starved in DMEM with 0% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine for 72 hours. To release cells into the first or second cell cycles, cells were washed with PBS and re-stimulated by washing once with PBS and adding DMEM with 10% FBS and 2mM L-glutamine for 24 hours (first cycle) or 48 hours (second cycle). To synchronize NHF1-hTERT cells in G0, cells were grown to 100% confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM with 0.1% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine for 72 hours. To release cells into the first or second cell cycles, G0 cells were re-stimulated by passaging 1:4 for first cycle, harvesting 24 hours later or 1:8 for second cycle, .

To synchronize Wi38 cells in G0, cells were grown to 100% confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated in MEM with 0.1% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and NEAA for 72 hours.

To synchronize RPE1 in 3 repeated G0s, cells were synchronized in G0 by contact inhibition (above), re-stimulated into the cell cycle by passaging 1:6 in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine, and grown to 100% confluency within 48-72 hours to start the second G0 by contact inhibition for 48 hours. Cells were re-stimulated as before and grown to 100% confluency to start the 3 rd G0 for 48 hours. To release cells for the experiment, G0 cells were re-stimulated by passaging 1:10 in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine, harvesting the first cell cycle at 24 hours after restimulation.
