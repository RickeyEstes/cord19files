Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:  Selection and Analysis of G2-Escape Variants A P0 stock of recombinant MERS-CoV EMC/2012 recovered from an infectious clone (Scobey et al., 2013) was serially passaged in Vero 81 cells supplemented with increasing concentrations of G2. Three parallel passage series were performed. Passages were initiated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.001 PFU per cell and G2 concentration = 0.43 mg/ml, corresponding to 0.75x G2 IC80 versus MERS-CoV in a plaque-reduction neutralization assay. Culture supernatants were passed onto fresh cells when 50%-60% of the monolayer displayed viral CPE. Viral inoculum volume and G2 concentrations were empirically co-adjusted between passage steps to produce the target CPE level at approximately 48 hours-post-infection (hpi). The G2 concentration at terminal passage, P10, was 0.65 mg/ml, corresponding to 11.2x IC80. 15 clonal escape mutant viruses (five from each passage) were isolated from P10 cultures via plaque purification on Vero 81 cells in the presence of 0.65 mg/ml G2. Viral plaques were expanded in Vero 81 cells, and total RNA was harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RT-PCR to generate overlapping cDNA amplicons spanning the entire S gene open reading frame. PCR products were subjected to dideoxy sequencing, and reads were aligned to the native EMC/2012 S gene sequence (GenBank accession number JX869059.2) to identify differences. In a separate virus passage experiment, three parallel lineages of antibody-free P10 EMC/2012 cultures were examined for S mutations to identify cell culture-adaptive changes resulting from serial MERS-CoV passage. These substitutions were excluded from analysis of changes in S identified in G2 escape mutant isolates.
