In our research, we classified the largest 10,000 unique domestic U.S. OD markets according to three dimensions, passenger volume, yield, and market concentration, intending to increase the level of detail in understanding OD market structure as compared to Belobaba and Van Acker (1994) who employ only market concentration (HHI) and the number of competitors to classify markets. Passenger volume and yield describe the demographics of the OD market. A change in these characteristics occurs over a long timeframe and is not highly variable given an airline's decision to enter or exit the market. To perform this segmentation, we used statistical cluster analysis to classify OD markets into natural "peer groups" with the greatest intrinsic similarities. Subsequently, we model the year over year growth and volatility of OD markets within each peer group to estimate the risk and return properties of the OD markets. Lastly, we present two financial portfolio concepts and their application to airline network planning to illustrate that analysis of all the U.S. OD markets does not provide a one-size-fitsall solution for airline network planning.
