Participants 120 individuals with chronic (>6 months) single-event left hemisphere stroke were retrospectively included in this study. These participants were recruited as part of larger studies conducted to evaluate treated aphasia recovery and lesion-deficit relationships. Participants were recruited between 2007 and 2017 at the University of South Carolina or Medical University of South Carolina, where all studies had IRB approval. Inclusion parameters for our studies include a single left hemisphere stroke, at least six months post-stroke and an age limit of 18 -85 years. Exclusion parameters for our studies include bilateral stroke; right hemisphere stroke; brainstem stroke; non-proficiency in English and pre-morbid left handedness. All participants gave written consent for study inclusion. Language evaluations were conducted within a week of neuroimaging evaluations. As this was a retrospective study, no part of the study procedures or analyses was preregistered prior to the research being undertaken. Participants were from different studies done within our lab and therefore completed a variety of language assessments. In this case, participants had either a naming assessment, a connected speech assessment or both assessments. In the following section, we will describe these participants as belonging to the CS task group (connected speech) or the PNT task group (naming). We originally identified 114 participants with a naming assessment and 63 with a connected speech assessment; 36 participants had both assessments. To create two mutually exclusive groups with which to compare lesion data, we matched participants with a naming assessment to those with a connected speech assessment using case-control matching in SPSS 25. We matched on aphasia severity (from the Western Aphasia Battery [WAB] Aphasia Quotient [AQ] from Kertesz, 2007) using a FUZZY interval of one standard deviation of the CS task group's AQ. This resulted in two mutually exclusive groups: a connected speech task group of N=63 (CS task group) and a naming task group of N=57 (PNT task group). .

This task group included those participants who completed a visual confrontation naming task involving the naming of objects, the Philadelphia Naming Test (Roach et al., 1996) , described below in Behavior Tasks. There were 57 participants (32 males; age, M=61.68±12.02 yrs; months post-stroke, M=31.91±37.16) included in this subset with the following aphasia types: anomic, 25;
