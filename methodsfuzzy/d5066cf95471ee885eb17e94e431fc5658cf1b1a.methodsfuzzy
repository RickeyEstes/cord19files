Ethics statement. The Ethics Review Committee, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), approved this study [project approval number IVDC2014(005)]. All of the subjects provided written informed consent for the studies performed on their samples and publication of their cases. The donors were identified anonymously as donor 1 to donor 35. Animals and eggs used in this study (6-to-8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice and 9-to-11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs) were bought from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Animal experiments were approved by Animal Experimental Ethics Board, China CDC (approval number 20140225011). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the standards of good clinical practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization). Subjects and samples. A total of 35 healthy volunteers were recruited from November 2013 to April 2014. Serum samples were collected from coagulation-promoting tubes (BD Vacutainer) from all donors, and PBMCs were isolated from anticoagulant blood by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation from 30 of the samples (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Volunteers were given questionnaires to confirm whether they had received influenza vaccination or had caught cold. None of the subjects had previously received influenza vaccines. And no symptoms of influenza virus infection were reported during the sampling period. HLA class I genotyping of the donors was performed using LABType SSO (One Lambda). (52) . The peptides with substitutions within these viruses were divided into corresponding pools (see Table S5 ). Overlapping peptides covering NPs of A(H1N1)/California/4/2009 and A(H7N9)/Anhui/1/2013 were synthesized according to a similar strategy. Heterosubtypic Protections to AIVs and T-Cell Immunity Â®
