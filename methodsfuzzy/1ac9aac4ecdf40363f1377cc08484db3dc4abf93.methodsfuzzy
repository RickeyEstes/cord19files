Experimental design. "Known-status" serum samples (n ϭ 528) collected from pigs experimentally inoculated with TGEV Purdue (n ϭ 12), TGEV Miller (n ϭ 12), PRCV (n ϭ 12), or with culture medium (minimum essential medium [MEM] Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) (negative control; n ϭ 12) were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance (diagnostic sensitivity and specificity) and antibody crossreactivity (analytical specificity) of the following three commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs: . At 100% confluence of the cell monolayer, the maintenance medium was decanted, and the monolayer was washed twice with maintenance medium. Thereafter, each flask of cells was inoculated with 500 l of each virus mixed with postinoculation medium, i.e., MEM supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02% yeast extract (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 2 h to allow virus adsorption. After incubation, 5 ml of postinoculation medium was added to each flask without removing viral inoculum. The flasks were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle at Ϫ80°C when 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the virus content was harvested by collecting the supernatant. Virus titration was performed on confluent ST cell monolayers grown in 96-well plates (Costar; Corning) using a method described elsewhere (37) . Animals. The animal study was conducted at the Iowa State University (ISU) Livestock Infection Disease Isolation Facility (LIDIF) with the approval of the Iowa State University Office for Responsible Research. Forty-eight 7-week-old conventional pigs were acquired from a commercial wean-to-finish farm with no history of porcine coronavirus infection. During the herd prescreening process and prior to the beginning of the study, fecal and nasal swabs from all animals were tested for TGEV, PRCV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. Serum samples were tested for all of the pathogens listed above using antibody-based methods, as described elsewhere (38) (39) (40) . Upon arrival, all animals were ear-tagged and randomly assigned to one of four inoculation groups (n ϭ 12 per group in the TGEV Miller, TGEV Purdue, PRCV, and negative-control groups). Pigs within each group were housed in pens of 2 pigs in the same room. Each pen was equipped with nipple drinkers, and pigs were fed twice daily with an antibiotic-free commercial diet (Heartland Co-op, West Des Moines, IA, USA). Details regarding viral dose and route of inoculation for each group are presented in Table 2 . The infectious dose used for each virus was previously determined in a pilot study (data not shown) with the objective of stimulating a humoral response effectively. Pigs were evaluated clinically twice daily throughout the study. The TGEV and PRCV infectious status of every pig was established and monitored throughout the study by rRT-PCR tests on fecal and oral fluid samples and ELISA-based tests on serum samples. Sample collection. Blood samples were collected on Ϫ7, 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35 , and 42 days postinoculation (dpi) from the jugular vein or cranial vena cava using a single-use blood collection system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and serum separation tubes (Kendall, Mansfield, MA). Serum was separated by centrifugation at 1,500 ϫ g for 5 min, aliquoted into 2-ml cryogenic tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany), and stored at Ϫ80°C until use. Floor fecal samples were collected daily from each pen (2 pigs per pen) within each inoculation group (6 pens per group) from Ϫ7 to 42 dpi. Approximately 2 ml of feces was placed in a 2-ml cryogenic tube (BD Falcon). Fecal samples (100 l) from each group on the same day postinoculation were pooled into a 2-ml cryogenic tube (BD Falcon) at the end of the study for rRT-PCR testing. Oral fluid samples were collected from each pen within each inoculation group twice a day (7:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.) from Ϫ7 to 42 dpi. In brief, 3-strand 1.6-cm 100% cotton rope (Web Rigging Supply, Inc., Carrollton, GA) was hung from a bracket fixed to one side of each pen for 30 min, during which time the pigs chewed on and interacted with the rope. After 30 min, the wet end of the rope was severed, sealed in a plastic bag, and then passed through a clothes wringer (Dyna-Jet, Overland Park, KS). The oral fluid accumulated in the bottom of the bag was decanted into 50-ml conical tubes (Corning), aliquoted into 2-ml cryogenic tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH), and stored at Ϫ80°C. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Feces and oral fluid samples were submitted to the ISU Veterinary Diagnostic Library (VDL) for porcine coronavirus screening by rRT-PCR. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific spike (S) and TGEV/PRCV-specific nucleocapsid (N) genes were targeted and amplified by dually labeled probe-based rRT-PCR. In brief, sample RNA was extracted and eluted using the Ambion MagMAX viral RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and a KingFisher 96 magnetic particle processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the procedures provided by the manufacturers. The TGEV S gene and the TGEV/PRCV N gene-based rRT-PCR were modified from previous procedures (40) and performed routinely at the ISU-VDL using the TaqMan Fast 1-step mastermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RT-PCRs were conducted on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Life Technologies) as follows: 50°C for 5 min, 95°C for 20 s, 95°C for 3 s (40 cycles), and 60°C for 30 s. The rRT-PCR results were analyzed using an automatic baseline, with a threshold value of 0.1. A quantification cycle (C T ) value of Ͻ35 was considered positive for both S and N gene-based rRT-PCR. Samples were considered positive for TGEV when both S and N genes were rRT-PCR positive. For PRCV, samples were considered positive when the S gene rRT-PCR was negative and the N gene rRT-PCR was positive. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus and PRCV C T data were reported as "adjusted C T ," calculated as shown in the following equation: Adjusted C T ϭ ͑ cutoff C T value Ϫ sample C T value ͒ TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISAs. Serum samples were tested for TGEV-and PRCV-specific antibodies using the following three commercially available TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISA kits: (i) Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant (Biovet, Canada), (ii) INgezim Corona Diferencial (Ingenasa, Spain), and (iii) Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab (Svanova, Sweden). All assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The pig serum samples and controls were first added to the TGEV antigencoated wells for the first incubation step. In the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA, plate wells are coated with a recombinant TGEV S protein which is captured by a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb). The Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA is also based on a recombinant TGEV S protein but directly coated on plate wells, while the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA uses noninfectious TGEV antigen (source unknown) as a coating antigen. If anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are present in the test sample, they will bind to the viral (TGEV) antigen in the wells and block the antigenic sites. In contrast, if anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. Then, after a washing step to eliminate unbound antibodies, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mouse anti-TGEV MAb targeting the N-terminal region of the S glycoprotein that is deleted in PRCV, or an anti-TGEV/PRCV MAb that binds to conserved regions of both TGEV and PRCV, is added into the first well (odd column) or second well (even column), respectively, and attaches to specific free sites of the virus. Thus, when antibodies in the test sample occupy the binding sites on the antigen, the binding of the conjugated MAbs is blocked. If anti-TGEV or anti-PRCV antibodies are absent in the test sample, these sites will remain free. The amount of antibody in the test sample that is bound to the TGEV antigen is inversely proportional to the intensity of the color. Antibody ELISA results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition (Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV and Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab) or optical density (INgezim Corona Diferencial) and interpreted (positive, negative, or suspect/inconclusive) for TGEV and PRCV according to the manufacturers' instructions. The diagnostic sensitivity, diagnostic specificity, and analytical specificity of the three commercial ELISAs were calculated based on the true status of the samples compared to the specific detection of TGEV (Miller and/or Purdue) and/or PRCV antibodies. Specifically, porcine coronavirus-negative serum samples (n ϭ 204) were used to estimate diagnostic specificity for the three ELISA kits. Serum samples positive for TGEV (Purdue and Miller strains) (n ϭ 144) collected between 14 and 42 dpi and PRCV-positive samples (n ϭ 72) collected between 14 and 42 dpi were used to calculate the time of detection, antibody detection over time, and the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the three ELISA kits for TGEV and PRCV Ab detection, respectively.
