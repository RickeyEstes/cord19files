Cell culture and transfection HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells, Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and COS-7 (African green monkey kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagel medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 -C in a incubator supplied with 5% CO 2 . When cell density in a culture plate reached 70% confluence, the cells were transfected with different plasmid DNA using Lipofecta-mine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In brief, total amount of DNA transfected into the cells in each well was adjusted to 1.5 Ag/ml by using empty pCMV-myc vector. Cells were incubated with transfection mixtures for 5 h and then replaced with the fresh medium.
