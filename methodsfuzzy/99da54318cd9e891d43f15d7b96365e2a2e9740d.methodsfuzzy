All procedures were performed according to approved protocols, and consent was obtained from all patients (or guardians). study design and site description This multicentre, cross-sectional study was designed to provide information on active surveillance of influenza in hospitalised patients. Data were collected in 2015 from three participating hospitals located in distinct cities and regions of Brazil: Curitiba (south), Fortaleza (north-east) and Rio de Janeiro (south-east) (figure 1). In Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, patient recruitment and data collection occurred from April to September, coinciding with the period of influenza seasonality in south and south-east Brazil. In Fortaleza, the study spanned all of 2015, because, despite a previous study showing influenza circulation between January and April, 14 the seasonality of influenza in this region is not well established. In Curitiba, the study was performed at Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná (HC/UFPR), a 310-bed, tertiary care, academic centre, with 47 beds in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is also among the sentinel hospitals for influenza and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in the region. Curitiba is located at 25° 25′ S, 49° 15′ W, 924 m (3031 ft) and has a mild marine west coast climate, with no dry season and warm summers. Seasonality is moderate, with heavy precipitation during mild winters and a mean temperature of 16.5°C. The city population numbered ~1879 355 people in 2015. In Fortaleza, this study was conducted at Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin, a public health institution of 270 beds. Fortaleza is a city of 2 500 000 inhabitants and is located at sea level, 4° south of the equator. Its tropical climate is characterised by two distinct seasons: a rainy one occurring between January and May, and a dry one occurring during the rest of the year. There is high relative humidity (79%) and little variation in the average temperature (26.4°C). In Rio de Janeiro, this study was conducted at Hospital Quinta D'Or, which is a private hospital with 350 beds for general admission and 150 beds in the ICU. Rio de Janeiro is located at 22° 54′S, 43° 12′W, and its climate is classified as tropical Atlantic. The year comprises two seasons: a hot and relatively humid one and another with mild temperatures and less rainfall.
