2.1. Preparation of strains, media and inocula and whole genome sequencing Three E. coli strains (12-246, 12-269 and 13-220) from our previously characterized collection of mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates from diseased pigs were selected on the basis of their resistances, serogroups and virulence genes as detected by high-throughput real-time PCR microarray technology (Delannoy et al., 2017) . The intent was to choose strains representative of CST-resistant isolates obtained from piglets with PWD. All three strains were hemolytic. Strains 12-246, 12-269, and 13-220 belonged to phylogenetic groups (PGG) A, A, and E, and had markers O141-F18, O149-F4, and O139-F18 respectively. All three strains were resistant to colistin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, and ampicillin. Strains 12-246 and 12-269 were also resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol. A rifampicin-resistant mutant (12-246 M, 12-269 M, and 13-220 M) was prepared from each strain by culturing a large amount of inoculum on rifampicin-supplemented media (250 mg/L). DNA from the three mutants was prepared using QIAmp DNA mini kits (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole genome sequencing was performed with the ion proton system (Ion Torrent™, Thermofisher, Villebon sur Yvette, France). We cleaned reads with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) , then used BWA-MEM (Li, 2013) to align them with the E. coli E455 strain (NCBI Reference Sequence NZ_JEND02000001.1) to obtain an estimated coverage depth of 80. We next performed SPAdes assemblies on cleaned reads (Bankevich et al., 2012) and MIRA assemblies (Chevreux et al., 1999) on related raw reads. Contigs were identified using Megablast on a local nt database (Chen et al., 2015) , and those corresponding to "Uncultured soil fungus" were deleted. Sequences were analyzed using a web tool (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/ services) to detect antimicrobial resistance genes and verotoxin virulence genes, and to determine the ST of each strain (Thomsen et al., 2016) . Other virulence genes, including paa, sfpC, cnf2, AIDA-I, ecf1-1, stcE, and eibG (Tseng et al., 2014), sitA-D, iucA-D, iutA, hlyF, ompT, etsA-C, iss, iroB-E, iroN, cvaA-C, cvi, tsh, and eitA-D (Touzain et al., 2018) , terE, ureD, and esc1763 (AE005174.2), hlyA (FM180012.1), orfA and orfB (GU810159), were sought using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/Blast.cgi). To prepare the inocula, each mutant was cultured in Mueller Hinton (MH) broth containing colistin (2 mg/L) for 18 h at 37°C, under gentle agitation. Each bacterial pellet obtained after centrifugation (5180 g, 5 min) was re-suspended in peptone buffered solution in order to obtain a titer of 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL.
