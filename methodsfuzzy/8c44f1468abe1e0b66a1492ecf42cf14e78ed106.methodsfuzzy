Extracts were analyzed using the RespiFinder Â® 15 assay (PathoFinder TM , Maastricht, Netherlands), a multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology [3] . This assay can detect 15 viruses: influenza viruses (IV) types A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4 (PiV), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronaviruses 229E, OC43 and NL63 (CoV), human metapneumovirus (MPV) and adenovirus (ADV). The test also includes a probe for detecting the avian Influenza virus A H5N1. An internal control for PCR inhibitors detection was included in each test. A positive Flu A sample and a negative sample were used as controls.
