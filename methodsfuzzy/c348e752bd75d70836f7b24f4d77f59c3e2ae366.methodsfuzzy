Primary culture of human airway epithelia. Primary cultures of human airway epithelia were prepared from bronchi by enzymatic dispersion according to established methods (18, 22) . Briefly, epithelial cells were disassociated and seeded onto collagen-coated, semipermeable membranes with a 0.4-m pore size (Millicell-HA; surface area, 0.6 cm 2 ; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Millicell inserts were placed into 24-well plastic cell culture cluster (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Twenty-four hours after seeding, the mucosal medium was removed and the cells were allowed to grow at the air-liquid interface as reported previously (21) . The culture medium, which consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and Ham's F-12 with 2% Ultroser G (Sepracor, Inc., Marlborough, MA), 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 g of streptomycin/ml, was added to the wells to feed cells from the basolateral surface. Only well-differentiated cultures Ͼ2 weeks old were used in these studies, with approximately 4 ϫ 10 5 cells/Millicell. The presence of tight junctions was confirmed by transepithelial resistance measurements (resistance Ͼ500 ⍀ ⅐ cm 2 ). Influenza viruses. Influenza virus preparations were purchased from Spafas Laboratory (Storrs, CT). Preparations were provided as concentrated and partially sucrose-gradient-purified preparations. Three strains of influenza A virus were used in this study: A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), A/Japan/ 305/57 (H2N2) (Japan), and X31 (H3N2). The latter strain is a reassortment with surface glycoprotein genes from A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) and internal genes from A/PR/8/34 (25) . The total protein concentration of each virus preparation was 2 mg/ml. Viruses were titrated by serial dilutions on MDCK cells in the presence of 2 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (26) . Infected wells were determined by the presence of hemagglutination activity in the culture medium. The tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50 ) was calculated using previously described methods (27) .
