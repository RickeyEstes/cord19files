Following approval by the FD McMaster Laboratory, Chiswick, Animal Ethics Committee, at weaning, 132 Merino wethers (castrated rams) were brought into CSIRO Livestock Industries animal house where faecal samples were analysed using a modified McMaster technique (as in [34] ) to diagnose any helminth infection. Animals were then treated with a mixture of Abamectin and Praziquantel, Levamisole and Benzimidazole, using the manufacturers' recommended doses. Twelve days later a second faecal screen for helminth infection was performed to confirm that animals were helminth-free. All animals were blood-sampled via jugular venepuncture to provide a pre-infection baseline immune and health status measure. Animals were then assigned to one of four treatment groups using a stratified random assignment (where groups were balanced for body mass, body condition and original faecal egg count). The four treatment groups were:
