Primary Astrocyte Cultures. Astrocytes were isolated from mixed glial cell cultures prepared from the brains of newborn C57B1/6 mice (Bantin and Kingman, Fremont, CA) at postnatal day 0-3 according to McCarthy and deVellis (48) . Briefly, single cell suspensions were prepared from cerebri dissected free of brain stems and cerebelli, plated at 3-5 brains per T-75 flask and allowed to grow to confluence at 12-15 d in vitro. Culture medium consisted of DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1; JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gemini Bioproducts, Inc., Calabasas, CA), 15 mM Hepes, 2.5 mM t-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml-100 ~g/ml). At confluence the cultures were mechanically shaken to dislodge microglia and oligodendroglia, resulting in preparations enriched 95% or greater for cells staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescent staining (described below) revealed that the cell preparations contained ,-2-4% of cells of microglia/macrophage lineage, expressing F4/80, T-200, the mouse equivalent of human common leukocyte antigen (CD45), and/or Mac-1 surface markers. Coronavirus Strains and Infection. Table 1 presents a summary of the MHV strains used and the principal types of diseases they cause in mice. The derivation, propagation, and sources of MHV-A-59, JHM-DL, JHM-DS, MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-Nuu have been described (12) . The neutralization-resistant MHV-4 strains 2.2-V-1 and 2.2/7.2-V-2 (28, 29) were the kind gift of Dr. John Fleming (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The development and properties of JHM-X and the JHM/A59 recombinant MHV strains have been reviewed (49) . All virus strains were propagated using the murine astrocytoma DBT as previously described (6) . Virus titers were determined for each virus preparation using DBT as indicator cells. Infectious Center Assays. The number of infected astrocytes was determined on day 3 p.i. to provide a measure of the relative efficiency of infection by several MHV strains. Briefly, astrocytes were trypsinized into single cell suspensions and, after washing, were plated on DBT cell monolayers at 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 cells/60 mm petri dish. Cells were allowed to attach for 1 h at 37~ before the addition of agarose at 0.6% in IkPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS, 20 mM Hepes, and penicillin/streptomycin. Plaques were counted after 48 h incubation at 37~ Virus Inactivation by Exposure to Ultraviolet Light. Inactivation of virus was accomplished by exposure to UV light under a UVP transilluminator (UVP Inc.,; San Gabriel, CA) at 7 mW/cm Z for The possible presence of oligodendrocytes was identified using polyclonal rabbit antigalactocerebroside (Gal C, a gift from M. Smith, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Finally, viral antigen was identified using J.3.3, a mAb specific for the N protein of JHMV that crossreacts with all of the MHV strains used in this study (12) . RtA. The expression of class I molecules was measured in astrocytes cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at a density of 10 4 cells/well and infected with various virus strains at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1-2. Mock infected cells served as controls. On day 3 or 5 p.i., cells were washed twice using a wash buffer of 0.3% BSA in 0.1 M PBS before the addition of 50/A of the appropriate mAbs in triplicate. After a 60 rain incubation at room temperature, cells were washed three times, followed by the addition of 20,000 cpm/well of 12SI-labeled protein A (30 /~Ci//zg; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). At the end of a second 60min incubation, cells were extensively washed in PBS to remove unbound radiolabeled protein A and detached with 0.5% trypsin-0.2% EDTA (JRH Biosciences). Data are presented as cpm bound radioactivity + SD, or percent increase in class I expression in infected cells compared with that in uninfected controls, corrected for background binding in the absence of antibody. A result was considered positive when the percent increase in expression was 100% or greater. Nonspecific staining was identified by the inclusion of Kd-specific mAb SF1-1.1.1. In some experiments, supernatants from infected cells were substituted for virus and RIA performed to detect class I 3 d later. Immunoperoxidase and Immunofluorescent Staining. Cell phenotypes and the number of infected ceUs were determined by immunoperoxidase staining in astrocytes cultured in tissue culture chamber slides. Avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining kits (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (21) . Cells were infected with virus 1 d after plating and fixed on day 3 or 5 p.i. in acetone/methanol (1:1). The number of positively stained cells in each well was determined in three fields/well at a magnification of 20x and reported as the percentage of the number of total cells in the same fields. Background staining was determined in cells stained in the absence of primary antibody. Class I expression was also evaluated by FACS | using an indirect immunoftuorescent staining procedure. Briefly, single cell suspensions of astrocytes were adjusted to 105 to 106 cells/tube before the addition of class 1-specific primary antibodies. FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2 was used as secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Fluorescence data were collected on 3 x 103 to 104 viable cells, indicated by forward light scatter intensity, using a FACStar cell sorter (Becton Dickinson & Co.). Again, background fluorescence was determined in cells stained in the absence of primary antibody. Detection oflnterferons. The possible presence oflFN in the supernatants of infected astrocytes was determined by bioassay in a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) neutralization assay using vital dye uptake as a spectrophotometrically measured endpoint in L929 cells (50, 51) . Supernatants were collected from infected and control uninfected astrocytes on day 3 and 7 p.i., UV irradiated, and added in triplicate to L929 cells plated at 10 s cells/well in 96-well plates. After a 24-h incubation at 37~ and 7% CO2, supernatants were aspirated and cells infected with VSV (Indiana strain) at approximately 10 tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDs0)/well. Control wells included uninfected L929 cells (cell control) and VSV-infected L929 cells cultured in the absence of interferon (virus control). At 24-36 h p.i., when CPE was maximum in the control wells, cells were stained for 2 h at 37~ with 0.004% neutral red. They were then lysed to release retained dye using 0.01 M HC1 in 30% ethanol, and ODs measured at 540 nm in an automated microELISA reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA). IFN concentrations were deduced by comparison of sample ODs with those of standard concentrations of recombinant mouse IFN-3' (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) and murine IFN-c~//3 (Lee Biomolecular, San Diego, CA). Immunoneutralization was also used to identify the possible presence of IFN in UV-irradiated supernatants of A59qnfected astrocytes. For this purpose, rat monoclonal anti-mouse IFN-3' antibody (hybridoma R4-6A2; ATCC HB 170) or rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IFN-a/3 (Lee Biomolecular) was added to the astrocytes before the addition of A59, and class I expression measured by RIA on day 3 p.i. Anti-IFN-3' (20-60/zg/ml) completely inhibited the protective activity of 10 U/ml of recombinant mouse IFN-3', whereas 10-30 U/ml anti-IFN-a/r effective in neutralizing 20 U/ml purified mouse IFN-c~//~. Detection of TNE TNF activity was measured in a cytotoxicity assay using actinomycin D-treated L929 fibroblasts as targets, again with vital dye uptake as a spectrophotometric endpoint. Serial 2-fold dilutions of UV-irradiated supernatants, or 10-fold dilutions of murine recombinant TNF-ot (Genzyme Corp.), as a standard were added to L929 monolayers in 96-well plates in the presence of actinomycin D (8 #g/ml; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After an 18-h incubation at 37~ 7% CO2, neutral red was added as described for the IFN assay, and OD read at 540 nm.
