Cell Line, Virus and Monoclonal Antibodies 293 T cells were used for infection and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) in a humidified incubator at 37uC under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Genotype VII NDV strain (isolated in our lab) was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9-to 10-day old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and kept at 220uC for RNA extraction and neutralization assay. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HN and F were a kind gift from Dr. Shunlin Hu (the University of Yang Zhou).
