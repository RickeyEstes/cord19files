Studies published in English in the last 10 years were searched. OVID-MEDLINE and OVID-EMBASE were used to search for foreign studies, and KMBase and KoreaMed were used to search domestic studies. Clinical practice guidelines were searched on NGC, G-I-N, and KoMGI. The search date is February 10th, 2017. When treating outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia of low severity, tests are selectively performed according to age, underlying diseases, severity markers, epidemiological factors, and current history of antibiotic use. Sputum gram smear and culture may be performed when antibiotic-resistant bacteria or bacteria that are difficult to treat with common empirical antibiotics are suspected. If tuberculosis is suspected based on clinical or radiographic findings, a sputum stain and tuberculosis test are performed. It is also recommended to perform diagnostic tests when Legionella infection or influenza are suspected based on clinical and epidemiological findings. For inpatients with pneumonia, it is advisable to perform blood culture, and sputum gram smear and culture tests before antibiotic administration as long as they are indicated. Sputum tests must be done using sputum samples obtained before antibiotic administration, and should only be performed when sufficient amounts of sputum are released, collected, transferred, and treated [76] . For patients with moderate community-acquired pneumonia, a blood culture, Legionella, S. pneumoniae urinary antigen test, and sputum gram smear and culture must be performed [77] [78] [79] . For patients with airway intubation, a test using trans-tracheal aspi-rate samples must be performed. For immunodeficient patients, or patients for whom common treatments have failed, invasive tests such as airway endoscopy and percutaneous pulmonary aspiration are useful [80, 81] .
