Special emphasis was given to include organised kennels located in different states of the country having different climatic conditions such as tropical humid, tropical dry, tropical semiarid and temperate zones. Samples from tropical humid conditions in northeast part of India included states of West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland and samples from temperate Northern India conditions were collected from the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Central Indian state, Uttar Pradesh was chosen for sampling from sub tropical humid conditions while samples from tropical semiarid regions were collected from western state of Maharashtra. Three hundred and thirty working dogs suspected for canine babesiosis along with in-contact and apparently healthy dogs from these organised kennels at various locations as mentioned were included in the present study. These organised kennels have been meticulously following recommended vaccination, acaricide and deworming schedules in their dogs. Moreover, these organized kennels especially maintained Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd breeds of working dogs as these two breeds of the dogs form the major corpus of working dogs/security dogs not only in this country but also globally. The clinical samples were collected over a period of three years from Jan, 2012 to Dec, 2014. Details of the age, breed, sex and clinical manifestations of disease among 51 nested PCR positive cases have been recorded and summarized in Table 1 . Collected blood or serum samples and necropsy tissue samples were transported under cold chain to Central Military Veterinary Laboratory (CMVL), Meerut, India for further processing. Differential diagnosis of Babesia spp. from various viral, bacterial, rickettsial and parasitic infectious agents such as, canine parvo virus (CPV), canine adeno virus-1 (CAV-1), canine adeno virus-2 (CAV-2), canine corona virus (CCV), canine distemper virus (CDV), rabies, Leptospira species, Mycoplasma, Streptococcus canis, Trypanosoma evansi, canine heart worm (Dirofilaria immmitis), canine Anaplasma, canine Ehrlichia and Borrelia burgdorferi were also carried out with suitable panel of serology and PCR based assays. These tests were carried out to ensure that canine samples being included in the present study are solely infected with Babesia spp. and are free of other concomitant viral, bacterial or parasitic infections/infestations. Fresh blood drops from ear tip puncture were drawn into thin smears, air dried and methanol fixed for microscopic examination and estimation of differential leukocyte count (DLC). Whole bloods collected in BD® Vacutainer (containing EDTA as anticoagulant) from cephalic vein were used for haematological analysis and for DNA extraction for PCR assays. Blood for biochemical studies were collected in BD ® Vacutainer (containing clot activator) and sera was subsequently harvested. Necropsy samples from spleen, lung, liver, heart and kidney M. Mittal, et al. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 169 (2019) 104696 from the dead dogs suspected for babesiosis were collected in 10% formal saline solution and 50% glycerol saline, respectively. These clinical samples were then transported to CMVL for further analysis.
