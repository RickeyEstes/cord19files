Fecal RT-PCR was performed separately by using primer pair p290 (5′-GATTACTCCAAGTGGGACTCCAC-3′) (15) and p110 (5′-ACDATYTCATCATCACCATA-3′) (16) as previously described (15) but at 48°C for annealing (317 bp for NoV or 329 bp for sapovirus). To amplify the 3-kb 3′ end fragment, cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript III First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with primer VN 3 T 20 (5′-GAGTGACCGCGGCCGCT 20 -3′). PCR was then performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA) with primers p290 and VN 3 T 20 . Quantitative (endpoint titration) RT-PCR (17) was performed with primer pair PNV7 (5′-AGGTGGTGGCC-GAGGAYCTCCT-3′) and PNV8 (5′-TCACCATAGAAG-GARAAGCA-3′) targeting the RdRp (211 bp) of QW101 strain. RT-PCR products were purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) before cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO (T/A) or PCR XL cloning kit (Invitrogen). Five clones of each sample were sequenced. DNA sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator Cycle and 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence editing was performed by Lasergene software package (v5, DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) was used to find homologous hits. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW (v1.83) at DNA Data Bank of Japan (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp). Phylogenetic and bootstrap (1,000 replicates) analyses were conducted by using MEGA (v2.1) (18) . Identification of recombinants was performed by using the Recombinant Identification Program (RIP, http://hivweb.lanl.gov/RIP/RIPsubmit.html) (19) . The classification and GenBank accession numbers of NoVs are listed in Table 1 . Four gnotobiotic pigs were maintained and euthanized as previously described (25, 26) . The inoculate was a 20% fecal filtrate (0.2 µm) in EMEM of the QW126 or QW144 (QW101-like, GII-18) strains or EMEM only (2 negative control pigs). One pig was inoculated with QW126 orally and intranasally at 9 days of age, and convalescent-phase antiserum LL616 was collected at postinoculation day (PID) 26. A second pig was inoculated with QW144 orally at 35 days of age and euthanized at PID 5. Immune electron microscopy (IEM) was performed as described previously (27) . For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the recombinant baculovirusexpressed human NoV VLPs and rotavirus VP2 and VP6 (2/6)-VLPs (negative control) (28) were CsCl-gradients purified. We coated 96-well microplates with VLPs (200 ng/well) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Tween 20 (0.05%). Serially diluted serum samples that included positive and negative controls were added to duplicate positive-and negative-coated wells, and the plates were incubated. After washing, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)labeled goat anti-pig immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H + L) for pig sera or goat anti-human IgG + IgA + IgM (H + L) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for human serum was added. After incubation and washing, the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added. The cutoff value was the mean absorbance of the negative coatings multiplied by 2. Western blot was performed as described previously (29) . Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with pig convalescent-phase antiserum LL616 against porcine GII-18 NoV or negative control serum in PBS containing 4% nonfat dry milk followed by goat anti-pig IgG (H + L)-HRP conjugate.
