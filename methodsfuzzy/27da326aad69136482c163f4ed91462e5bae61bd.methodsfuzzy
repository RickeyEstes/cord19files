Prior to testing the BSL-3 lab was in normal operation as described in Section 2.9 for at least 1 h. The test rig is shown schematically in Fig. 4 . Before testing, the air in the BSL-3 lab and exhaust from the HEPA filters were collected by the Andersen samplers as control samples. The sampler flow was 28.3 L/min and the collection time was 10 min. If no S. marcescens was found on the control agar plates then the testing began. The DV40 nebulizer was filled with 30 mL of S. marcescens suspension. The test bacterial aerosol was aerosolized by applying clean compressed air using a GAST pump to the nebulizer at 10 L/min. The DV40 nebulizer position was 80 cm before the filter and the height was 100 cm from the lab floor. The aerosolized microbes were generated before the first stage HEPA filter in the BSL-3 lab for 10 min. At the upstream and downstream sides of the first stage HEPA filter and the second stage HEPA filter, microbiological air samplers were used to sample the air to detect the model microorganism aerosol concentration. Before the first HEPA filter, an AGI-30 sampler was used at a central position 10 cm before the filter, with a collection flow of 12.5 L/min and time of 10 min. In a previous study, a Merck Mas-100 sampler (Merck, Germany) had a collection efficiency that was higher than the AGI-30 air sampler when the concentration of the microorganisms was low ). Therefore, a Merck Mas-100 air sampler was used to collect air after the first and second stage HEPA filters at a central position 30 cm behind the filter and a flow Fig. 4 . Test rig of BSL-3 lab HEPA air filtration system filtration efficiency against bacterial aerosol. rate of 100 L/min. The sampling time was set at 10 min because the prolonged nature of the tests may have caused excessive drying of the agar and loss of microbial viability. Each filter was tested three times. After testing the equipment and the air of the BSL-3 lab were disinfected using aerosolized 1.5% hydrogen peroxide. The collected samples were incubated at 30 â€¢ C for 24-48 h and the red colonies of S. marcescens on the collecting agar plates were counted and their concentrations converted to cfu/m 3 . By taking pre-and post-HEPA filter air samples with a sampling device, this method allowed the simultaneous measurement of bacterial aerosol concentrations before and after filtration. The percentage efficiency of the HEPA filter system was calculated using Eq. (1), where A was the concentration of bacterial aerosol challenging the HEPA filter system and B was the concentration after filtration: The Merck Mas-100 sampler flow rate was 100 L/min and the sampling time was 10 min, so the testing limit was 0.001 cfu/L (1 cfu/m 3 ). The AGI-30 sampler testing limit was 0.008 cfu/L (8 cfu/m 3 ).
