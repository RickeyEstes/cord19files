During January 2012 to December 2013, an attempt was made to reveal the role of IBVs in broiler chickens of Ahvaz which suffered from severe respiratory distress, including nasal discharge, coughing, wet rale, lacrimation, gasping, and high mortality. Twenty five broiler flocks aged 2 -5 weeks old, some of which had a history of live vaccination against IBV were selected from different geographical parts of Ahvaz (north, east, south and west). Samples including trachea, lung, kidney, liver and cecal tonsil were obtained from dead birds, transferred in cold chain system to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz and stored at -70 ËšC until used.
