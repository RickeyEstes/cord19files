(a) l'iruses wnd cells Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 and its host cell line, the 17 clone 1 line of spontaneously transformed BalbC3T3 cells, were obtained from Dr L. S. Sturman, Albany, N.Y. The bovine coronavirus LQ was grown in primary bovine fetal t)hyroid cells as described by Storz et al. (1981~) . Virus was purified according to Sturman et al. (1980) . Virus titers were determined by plaque assays with 09% (w/v) agar in the overlay medium. (b) Labeling of viral polypeptides To obtain radioactive virus particles, [6-3H]glucosamine (25 Ci/mmol ; Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, F.R.G.), [ l-3H]galactose (40 Ci/mmol), [l-3H]fucose (46 Ci/mmol) or [2-3H]mannose (16 Ci/mmol) was added to the growth medium at a final concentration of 2 pCi/ml after the 1 h adsorption period of the virus. i4C-labeled protein hydrolysate (55 mCi/matom) was used at @5 &i/ml. (9, 10(n))-[3H]palmitic acid was used at 50&i/ml (Schmidt & Schlesinger, 1980) . To analyze intracellular synthesis of viral polypeptides, monolayers of 17Cll cells on 5 cm Petri dishes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. At 16 h post infection, the medium was replaced by medium without leucine. After 2 h leucine starvation, the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min by the addition of 300 &i ['H]leucine/ml, and were either lysed directly for immunoprecipitation or were chased in medium containing unlabeled leucine for the times indicated. In experiments where tunicamycin was used, the antibiotic (1 pg/ml; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis) was added at the beginning of the starvation period and was present throughout the rest of the experiment. Purified virus (5 x 109 p.f.u.t) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected intradermally into a New Zealand white rabbit. Five weeks later, the rabbit was boosted by subcutaneous injection of a virus suspension (10' p.f.u.) in saline. One week later, the rabbit was bled and the virus neutralization titer of the serum determined by plaque inhibition tests. The serum titer (500/, reduction of plaques) was 1 : 7000. For immunoprecipitation, the serum was purified from host cell-specific antibodies by passage over a Sepharose 4B-affinit)y column, to which cell extract from non-infected 17CLl rells was c.ovalently coupled. (d) Immunoprecipitation Labeled cells were lysed at 0°C in RIPA buffer (50 mlcr-Tris. HCl (pH 7.2), 10 rnM-EDTA. lo, (v/v) Triton X-100, l"& (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, Old/, (w/v) SDS, and 59; (v/v) Trasylol, Bayer AG, Germany) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 4 min : 100 ~1 of the supernatant were incubated for 60 min on ice with 10 ~1 of rabbit antiserum. The immune complexes were adsorbed to a suspension of protein A-bearing Staphyloccus aureus (Kessler, 1975) in RIPA buffer containing 10 y/, (v/v) fetal calf serum, and the mixture was \vashed 4 times with wash buffer (10 mM-sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mw-EDTA. 1 M-IVaCl. l(+b (v/v) Triton X-100, 50/o (v/v) Trasylol). The final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and subject)ed to electrophoresis as described below. (e) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isolatiorl of viral glycopeptides Xnalyt~ical5~, to 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient slab gels containing @lo/, (w/v) SDS and 4 M-urea were used (Laemmli. 1970) . Samples were heated to 100°C for 2 min in 80 mM-Tris. HCl (pH 6%), @I% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS and 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The resolved radiolabeled protein bands were localized by fluorography (Laskey & Mills, 1975) . using Kodak XAR-5 film. For preparative isolation of viral glycoproteins, cylindrical lo%<, polpacrylamide gels (7 mm x 100 mm) were used. They were sliced and t,he radioactivity of sister gels was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Schwarz & Klenk, 1974) . Viral glycoprot'eins were recovered by freezing and thawing, elution wit,h @lo, (w/v) SDS in water, filtration through 045 pm Millipore filter units and repeated precipitation in 900,, (v/v) aqueous acetone at 0°C. Preparations were then dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. Radiolabeled glycopeptides were obtained by digestion with 19, (w/v) Pronasr at .iO"C in 1 M-Tris. HCl (pH !+O), 10m4 M-CaCl, for 48 h with a second addition of Pronase after 24 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v). The upper phase containing essentially all the radiolabel was lyophilized, and desalted on a Biogel P2 column (1 cm x 35 cm). Further fractionation of El glycopeptides was obtained by affinity chromatography on a column (lcm x 10 cm) of wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Desalted glgropeptldes were applied in 5 m&l-sodium acetate buffer (pH 52) to the column eyuilibrat'ed with the same buffer. The column was washed with this buffer, and adsorbed material was eluted with buffer containing @I M-S-acetylglucosamine. Both the unbound and the bound fraction were desalted and freed from ,V-acetylglucosamine bJ chromatography on Biogel P2 as described above, using distilled water as an eluent. Binding studies of E2 glycopeptides to concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) were performed as desc~ribrd b,v Krusius 8: Finne (1977) . (f) Digestion with glycxxidases Glycopeptides were treated with 5 units of neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerup (Behringwerke) in 92 ml of 10 mM-Tris-acetate (pH 68). 2 mmC&l, at 37°C for 24 h. The incubation mixture was applied to a Biogel P6 column (1 cm x 150 cm) and eluted with 61 M-pyridine acetate (pH 5.2). Endo-/3-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii was a kind gift from Dr M. N. Fukuda (Seattle). El glycopeptides were incubat'ed at, 37°C with 25 milliunits of enzyme in 0.2 ml of 61 M-sodium acetate (pH 5.8) for 18 h. Samples were analyzed on a column of Biogel P4 (minus 400 mesh; 1 cm x 150 cm). Endo-/?-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Streptomyces griseus) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan. E2 glycopeptides were incubated with 25 milliunits of the enzyme in 005 ml of 905 M-citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 55). Incubations were for 18 h at 37°C under a toluene atmosphere. The enzyme-treated glycopeptides were then analyzed on a Biogel P4 (minus 400 mesh) column as described above. (g) Alkali borohydride treatmenf For the analysis of amino acids, radiolabeled glycoproteins E 1 (& 23,000) and E2 (iw, 90,060) were subjected to p-elimination conditions according to Pigman & Downs (1977) , using porcine submaxillary gland protein as a control. Amino acid analyses were performed on a Biotronic LCBOOO amino acid analyzer as described by Spackman et al. (1958) . For the preparation of reduced oligosaccharides, t,he method of Carlson (1974) was applied with the following modifications : samples were kept at 45°C for 10 h in 0.1 iv-NaOH, containing 1 M-NaBH, and Olq6 (w/v) SDS. After cooling to 0°C the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5.0 by the addition of 4 M-aqueous acetic acid, and samples were psssed over a Dowex 50 WX 2 (200 to 400 mesh : H + form ; SERVA) column (1 cm x 8 cm) and washed with l($, (v/v) acetic acid. The eluted material was lyophilized and boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with methanol at 30°C. High-voltage paper electrophoresis of released oligosaccharides was conducted on Whatman no. 3MM paper in pyridine/acetic acid/water (10 : 4 : 86. by vol.), pH 53, at 25 V/cm for 6 h. The paper was then cut into 95 cm strips and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation count,ing. Molecular weights of the released oligosaccharides were determined on a calibrated Biogel P4 (minus 460 mesh, batch no. 163034) column (1 cm x 150 cm) in 0.1 M-pyridine acetate (pH 5.3). Fractions of 043 ml were taken and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. (h) Carbohydratr mcxstituent analysis All reagents were of ultrapure grade or freshly distilled. Desalted glycopeptides containing 5 to 10 pg of total sugar were hydrolyzed in 0.25 M-H,SO, in 900/, (v/v) aqueous acetic acid at 80°C for 8 h, reduced and peracetylated as described by Stellner & Hakomori (1974) . Peracetylated alditol acetates were analyzed on a Finnigan model 4021 combined gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using a 25 m fused silica capillary column with Dexsil 410 as the wall coating phase. Sugar ratios were calculated on the basis of the total reconstructed ion chromatograms, applying response factors t,hat were determined with corresponding commercial standards. Paper chromatography of re-5-acetylated hydrolysates was carried out on Whatman 3MM paper sheets in t,he descending manner using ethyl acetate/pyridine/water (4 : 1 : 1, by vol.) as the solvent.
