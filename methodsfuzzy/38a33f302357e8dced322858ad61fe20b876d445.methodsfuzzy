A sample of 351 EVD survivors was determined using a sample size formula for cross-sectional studies (N = z2 pq/ d 2 ). We increased our sample to 400 to make up nonresponses. Multistage sampling method was used to recruit participants across the country. Data was collected from the four geographic regions of Sierra Leone (Western Area, Northern province, Southern province and Eastern province). Five districts were purposefully selected to cover all four geographic regions of the country. The location of the five districts in Sierra Leone are shown in Fig. 1 . The five districts are western area urban and western area rural districts (both in the Western area), Bo district (Southern province), Kenema district (Eastern province) and Bombali district (Northern province). These five districts were chosen based on the epidemiological profile of the total confirmed Ebola cases and because they are host to the highest number of Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. We randomly sampled the required number of EVD survivors in all five districts based on proportional representation using the national list of registered Ebola survivors obtained from the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola survivors (SLAES). Survivors who were randomly chosen were invited to participate in the study via telephone.
