An SKC button sampler with gel filters, powered by an AirChek XR5000 pump and calibrated by a rotameter (all supplied by SKC Ltd., Blandford Forum, UK) was used for all the air sampling. This sampler was used in one of three ways: it was worn by ward-based staff (nurses, physiotherapists, or education and play assistants), held approximately 0.2-0.3 m away from the patient's nose and mouth, or carefully mounted and left standing overnight in a fixed location near the patient, to sample ambient air in the vicinity. The air was drawn through the dissolvable gel filter at an airflow rate of 4 L/min. The pump was calibrated to 4 L/min with the rotameter prior to each sampling session (Figure 1 ). Local room temperature and relative humidity was also measured at the start of each air sampling session (ThermoPro TP50, My iTronics, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China). At the end of the sampling period, the gel filter was carefully extracted from the filter, dissolved in 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM), extracted (QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit, Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and run on the AusDiagnostics (Respiratory Viruses 16-WELL, cat. 20602, AusDiagnostics UK Ltd., Chesham, UK) assay. This commercial assay has a claimed lower limit of detection of 1075 AdV DNA copies/mL. This same assay was also used for the weekly testing of NPAs and endotracheal tube aspirates (ETAs) from this same patient to monitor the progress of the chronic AdV infection. All positive AdV NPA samples were sent to a commercial laboratory for AdV typing and quantification (Micropathology Ltd., Coventry, UK). Various positions (most commonly frequented by staff during routine care duties) around the patient were sampled for varying durations, multiple times, over 3-4 weeks, to check for the presence of airborne AdV (Figure 2 ). The air sampling sessions were coordinated to coincide with the days on which routine NPAs were taken from the patient for monitoring the AdV levels. In addition to the NPAs, ETAs were also routinely taken for respiratory virus PCR testing to check for the presence of any AdV in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). At the end of the sampling period, the gel filter was carefully extracted from the filter, dissolved in 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM), extracted (QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit, Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and run on the AusDiagnostics (Respiratory Viruses 16-WELL, cat. 20602, AusDiagnostics UK Ltd., Chesham, UK) assay.

In addition to the NPAs, ETAs were also routinely taken for respiratory virus PCR testing to check for the presence of any AdV in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Between each air sampling session, the button sampler and accompanying tubing were thoroughly washed with warm soapy water, rinsed, then air-dried to physically remove any respiratory virus nucleic acid that might be present on the inside surfaces. 'Dry' runs using just the gel filter dissolved in VTM failed to detect any AdV DNA. This VTM was also used on the wards for daily routine clinical sampling, and as a negative extraction and PCR control during normal diagnostic testing, so any potential for viral contamination was monitored on a daily basis. After discussion with our local institutional review board (IRB) it was agreed that this air sampling constituted environmental sampling and therefore did not require a formal ethics approval.
