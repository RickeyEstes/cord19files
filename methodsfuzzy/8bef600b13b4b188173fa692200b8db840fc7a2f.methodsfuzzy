Other in vivo tests may be useful in assessing the production and composition of tears. Chemical composition of the tear film is one common approach. Proteins like lactoferrin and epidermal growth factor (EGF), pro-inflammatory FIGURE 53.7 Normal architecture of the nasolacrimal duct. Decalcified section of the nasal cavity of a rabbit showing the position of the nasolacrimal duct (arrows) as it nears its orifice in the ventral wall of the rostral nasal passages. The ducts are on the lateral wall opposite the vomeronasal organs (at the base of the nasal septum). The inset is from the same animal but taken at a different (more caudal) plane of section. H&E, 12.5Â, or inset, 200Â.
