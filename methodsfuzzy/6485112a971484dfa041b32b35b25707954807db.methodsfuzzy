Linear Intercept Method for Estimating Nuclear Volume. Gundersen and Jensen (1985) have recently developed a new method for estimating the volume density or volume-weighted mean volume (Vv) of discrete particles. This method depends on making isotropic random sections through the particles and then to sample the sections with a series of points. Each time a point hits the particle the intercept across the particle at that point is measured (1) in a direction which systematically varies from one picture to the next. The formula Vv = 7r X 7/3, where ~ is the mean of all values 13, is then an unbiased estimator of Vv (see also Cruz-Orive and Hunziker, 1986; Cruz-Orive, 1987 for more details). For BHK cells ,~0.5-/~m cryosections were prepared which were stained for 4 min with Hoechst dye for DNA. Using uv-light fluorescence, light micrographs were taken at random using a 40x lens. These were enlarged photographically â€¢20 times. A' system of parallel lines containing a regularly spaced system of points was used as described by Cruz-Orive and Hunziker (1986; see their Fig. 10 b) . The positioning of the grid over The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 108, 1989 278 the micrograph was done as described by Cruz-Orive and Hunziker (1986; see their Fig. 10) . When the test points hit the nuclei the intercepts were estimated using a ruler. The intercepts_ were classified into a histogram of different size classes. The parameter 13 was estimated as described in formula 7.1 of C raz-Orive and Hunziker (1986) and Table I of Gundersen and Jensen (1985) . The coefficient of error was determined according to the formula where P (nuclei) is the number of points hitting nuclei (Gunderson and Jenson, 1985) . As described by Gundersen and Jensen 1985 (see their Fig. 1 ) the estimations of the volume-weighted mean volume can produce a bias with respect to the number-weighted mean volume. The amount of this bias depends on the amount of variation between particles (see Cruz-Orive, 1987) . By this method, once we have an estimate of nuclear volume, we can estimate cell volume simply by multiplying it by the ratio of cytoplasmic volume to nuclear volume as estimated by point counting (see below).
