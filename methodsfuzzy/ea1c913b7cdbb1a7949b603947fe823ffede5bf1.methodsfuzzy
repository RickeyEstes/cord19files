Understanding the differences between male and female workers requires an appreciation of the distinction between sex and gender. Generally, ''sex'' refers to the primary and secondary sex characteristics, including anatomy and physiology, that distinguish male and female organisms from each other [4] . ''Gender'' is considered to be the result of the environmental, individual, societal, or cultural influences that allows an individual to identify themselves as either male or female. Therefore, gender is relational and its influences differ depending on the person, the place, or the time (eg, era) There is evidence that there are sex differences in lung anatomy and physiology that may influence the development of lung disease. Over a lifetime, the female lung tends to be smaller than the male lung in individuals of the same height. On average, vital capacity and total lung capacity are greater in adult males, yet female lungs have higher forced expiratory flow rates and forced expiratory volume in 1 second:forced vital capacity (FEV 1 :FVC) ratios, even after standardizing for differences in body size [5] . Despite this evidence, we continue to have little understanding as to how physical and physiologic sex differences might impact overall susceptibility to occupational disease. In addition, any measurement of occupational disease susceptibility must include accurate exposure measurement, yet we have little understanding regarding the influence gender may have on the exposure to, and measurement of, various occupational toxins and agents. Research that investigates women's health and occupational lung disease must consider possible sex differences in susceptibility to various exposures and development of occupational lung disease (ie, there may be differential rates of absorption of toxins in men or women). There also are likely to be gender influences on the occupational environment that will impact the investigation process. Gender differences in occupation: same title, different job Sex segregation in the workforce is commonplace but varies throughout the world. In Canada and the United States, men continue to hold most positions in the primary and secondary industries, such as logging, fishing, and manufacturing, whereas women hold most of the jobs in the service industries, including health care, retail, and clerical sectors [6, 7] . Although it may be assumed that this segregation in the workplace clusters men in ''high-risk'' jobs such as mining and smelting, in actuality, women are exposed routinely to hazardous materials on the job, even in those industries that are considered to be ''safe.'' Stellman [8] reported that women commonly are exposed to a large number of carcinogenic substances in the workplace. She identified 46 different carcinogens that were used commonly in industries that employed a minimum of 25,000 women in the United States in 1992, including the service and the health care industries. Many other hazardous chemicals and agents have been found in other occupational environments where a large proportion of women are employed ( Table 1 ). The workplace environment continues to change for women, as there has been a shift toward more women being employed in traditionally ''male'' occupations and vice versa. Although it is recognized that men and women are exposed to different occupational hazards because of their segregation in the workforce, less attention has been paid to differing exposures between men and women who have the same job title. Segregation of task by gender can occur in the workplace which results in differing exposures between men and women with the same job title [9] . For example, Messing and colleagues [10] reported that male cleaners who worked in the railway industry often were assigned different tasks than female cleaners. Female cleaners consistently were assigned to toilet-cleaning tasks, whereas male cleaners were responsible for floor mopping. The women worked in closer proximity to the cleaning fumes compared to men, resulting in different levels of exposure. In a different study, Messing et al [11] reported that male and female gardeners who were employed by city hall in a Quebec municipality were assigned different tasks, either because of personal choice or the lack of appropriate-sized equipment for women. In a recent study of university employees, women reported more physical and malaise symptoms than their male counterparts in the same job [12] . There were no gender differences after controlling for occupation grade, perceived working conditions, and orientation to gender roles. The investigators concluded that differential exposure, rather than differential vulnerability, influenced the gender differences in health. These studies show that job classification alone often is a poor proxy for exposure. A woman may be assigned to different tasks with different exposures compared with men, or her work environment may differ from other workers in different industries that have the same job title. For example, a woman whose job is classified as ''secretary'' may be employed in a sawmill and be exposed to levels of wood dust or wood antigens that are sufficiently high to elicit a lung response. Gender differences in exposure, exposure measurement, and resulting pathology Exposure assessment is an important component of occupational lung disease research. The measurement of occupational exposures is integral to the understanding of how exposures impact health and the development of appropriate preventative guidelines [13] . The goal of exposure measurement is to ''define and quantify an individual's dose of a specific agent'' [13] ; specifically, the biologically effective dose that is capable of causing disease. One rarely can measure the actual biologically effective dose; instead, an estimate of the effective dose is calculated based on the amount of agent that is present in the work environment and the amount of time that a worker is exposed. Although men and women may have the same job title and perform identical tasks, they may have different occupational exposures and differing resultant body burdens of environmental toxins. The model presented in Fig. 1 illustrates the pathway that a toxin can take from the environment to the lung and how sex and gender may impact the process at several steps. Toxins that are implicated in lung disease are present in the unprotected work environment. The dose of toxin from the work environment is variable and dependent on many factors, several of which are impacted by gender differences in the workplace. There may be gender differences in the actual tasks assigned. This may result in different exposures to toxic substances despite similar job descriptions. Finally, differences in the size, surface area, and design of equipment and machinery may have an impact on exposure levels, particularly if the breathing zone is in close proximity to the sources of exposure. The impact of sex differences in ergonomics was demonstrated in musculoskeletal injury research [14 -16] but its importance in the development of occupational lung disease is not known. To prevent toxins and other occupational hazards from being inhaled by the worker, personal protective equipment or other barriers often are required for use in the workplace. Nevertheless, gender can impact how much of the toxin passes the protective equipment barrier and enters the protected environment. Personal protective equipment, such as gloves or respirators, may not be designed to fit a woman's body; this may result in an increased exposure. Greenberg and Dement [1] identified this problem as a potential confounder in occupational health research and noted that although it was recognized as a problem as early as 1942 [17] , little research has been done to determine the impact of improperly-fitting protective equipment on women's occupational health. A Korean study of three commonly-used respirators found decreased fit factors (indicating less protection) among women compared with men, even after taking differences in facial dimensions into account [18] . In addition, the education on, and use of, protective equipment or other safety training may be impacted by gender. Women are more likely to be employed on a part-time or temporary basis [19, 20] , which may result in fewer opportunities for adequate training in personal protective practices. It also may be more physically demanding for women to wear protective equipment compared with men. Murphy et al [21] reported that compared with men, women experienced a greater increase in percent of VO2 max and rating of perceived exertion while wearing chemical protective clothing (compared with wearing regular clothing) and engaging in continuous activity. This greater increase in energy cost while wearing protective clothing may provide a disincentive to women, especially if it affects a woman's capacity to perform in a male-dominated work environment. After a toxic substance passes through the protective equipment into the protected environment, it has access to the upper airway by way of the nose and mouth. The crude mass of a toxin in this applied dose may be lower on average in women as a result of the lesser volume of air exchanged (2900 L versus 3600 L over an 8-hour period for a reference woman and man, respectively) [22] . Aerosol deposition, however, may be enhanced on average in women because of higher airway flow rates [23] . It also is possible that sex differences in clearance mechanisms may exist and result in differing levels of applied dose; however, these do not seem to have been well explored. Table 2 identifies sex differences in the pulmonary system that could impact how much of the applied dose is absorbed into the body. After the toxin passes into the lungs and becomes the internal dose, numerous gender and sex-related factors can impact how much is absorbed into the body, how the dose is metabolized, or how the toxin activates the various inflammatory and other physiologic responses. Differences in pre-existing lung conditions, current or past smoking behavior, nutritional status, stress level, sex hormone actions, and various metabolic processes can be affected by sex and gender differences and ultimately can determine if the toxin is a biologically effective dose and will result in lung disease.
