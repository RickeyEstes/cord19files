Virus filters were shipped on ice overnight to the analytical laboratory and filters were eluted immediately upon arrival. Procedures for eluting viruses from the prefilters and glass-wool filters and for concentrating filter eluates by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation were previously described (Lambertini et al., 2008; Millen et al., 2012) . Eluates from the prefilter and glass-wool filter pair that composed a filter set were carried separately through the entire analytical process and the final results summed to calculate virus concentrations per sample. Throughout the study, 27% of human viruses and 47% of bovine viruses were captured in the prefilter. After PEG concentration, final concentrated sample volumes (FCSV) were stored at −80°C until nucleic acid extraction. Extraction was carried out using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit and buffer AVL (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (Borchardt et al., 2012) . All samples were analyzed for six human enteric viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, hepatitis A virus, and rotavirus) and seven bovine enteric viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus group A, polyomavirus, coronavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2) by real-time quantitative PCR and hydrolysis probes using the LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and LightCycler 480 Probes Master kit (Roche Diagnostics). Human virus primers, probes, and standard curve performance are reported in Borchardt et al. (2012) . Bovine virus primers, probes, standard curve performance, and bovine virus sources are reported in Table S1 and Table S2 , Supporting information. qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate (see Borchardt et al., 2012 for RT-qPCR (two-step) and qPCR thermal conditions, reverse transcription procedure, the approach for summarizing duplicate qPCR results, and the calculations for normalizing virus genomic copies to per liter volume sampled). Every sample was measured for qPCR inhibition following methods described in Borchardt et al. (2012) , and if necessary, inhibition was mitigated by dilution. Of the 126 study FCSVs (concentrated eluates from 63 pre-filters plus 63 glass wool filters) 79 required dilution. Every batch of reactions included the following controls: extraction positive and negative, no-template controls for reverse transcription and PCR master mixes, and a positive control for each virus seeded into a FCSV matrix blank at low copy number. All negative controls were negative (i.e., no crossing threshold) during the study. Five field blanks consisting of 10 L sterile phosphate buffer solution were collected through the auto-sampling system; all five were virus negative. Recovery controls were performed on one date (October 17, 2007) for each of the three monitoring sites following the procedure described in Lambertini et al. (2008) . Among the three sites, mean (±1 SD) poliovirus Sabin 3 recovery was 31% ± 31%, and mean adenovirus 41 recovery was 50% ± 22%. Samples positive for enterovirus or adenovirus were identified to serotype by sequencing using the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer and previously described methods (Borchardt et al., 2012) . Human enterovirus and adenovirus infectivity was evaluated by cell culture using three cell lines (BGMK, RD, and Caco-2) or two cell lines (Graham 293 and A549), respectively, as previously described (Borchardt et al., 2012) . Only samples positive by qPCR for these viruses were evaluated. All cultures were held for six weeks and if cytopathic effect (CPE) was not observed, cell lysates from the two-week passage and the six-week culture were analyzed by qPCR (i.e., integrated cell culture -qPCR). If the number of virus genomic copies in the cell lysates was 10 times greater than the initial virus quantity added to the culture flask in the FCSV inoculum, evidence consistent with virus growth, the sample was designated as positive for infectious virus.
