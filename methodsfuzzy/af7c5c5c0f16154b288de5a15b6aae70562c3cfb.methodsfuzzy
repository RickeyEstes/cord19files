Two government white papers on China's ODA published in 2011 and 2014 did not contain detailed data on DAH. China's ODA classification system differs from the standards used in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and health-specific data were not reported. Our study collected quantitative and qualitative data on DAH and ODA in both Chinese and English. Analyses on the Belt and Road Initiative and Ebola are based on a literature search and publicly available documents. Quantitative data on China ODA and DAH are based on estimates from AIDDATA, which ascribed a value in US$ to 390 health and populationreproductive health projects from 2008 to 2013. Financial data on governance come from official documents of the Chinese Government, OECD DAC, UN agencies, and the World Bank (appendix).
