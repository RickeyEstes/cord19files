Data were managed in Excel 2013 (Microsoft Inc., USA). Statistical analyses were performed in Stata 14 (Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), and graphs were made in R [38] . T-tests were used for calculations of significance based on means, except for oocyst counts for which Mann-Whitney U-tests were used, due to lack of normality. Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate correlations. P< 0.05 was considered significant.
