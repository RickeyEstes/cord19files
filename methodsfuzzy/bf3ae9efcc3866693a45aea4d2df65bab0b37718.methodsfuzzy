HAVs and other enteric viruses may be found in large numbers in clinical samples (â‰¥10 6 virus particles per gram of stool); however, they are usually found in much lower numbers in food, e.g. 0.2-224 particles per 100 g shellfi sh meat (Sanchez et al. , 2007) . The infectious dose of HAVs and NVs is estimated to be as low as 10-100 infectious viral particles even though the ingestion of thousands of cells is required for bacterial infection to occur with the same probability (Sair et al. , 2002; Gerba, 2006; Guevremont et al. , 2006) . Unlike bacterial pathogens, viruses cannot multiply in foods, making the traditional food microbiological techniques of cultural enrichment and selective plating inapplicable (D'Souza and Jaykus, 2006) . Therefore, methods with high reliability and sensitivity are required for viral detection. In the sections below we discuss some of the currents methods. In general, current detection methods have poor sensitivity and selectivity at low virus concentrations. In the main, PCR-based methods have been used to overcome the challenges associated with virus detection; however, these methods also have limitations in terms of complexity in sample preparation and amplifi cation. Thus, the following section is an overview of emerging detection methods.
