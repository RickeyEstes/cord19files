Hemagglutination Assay: Hemagglutination assays were performed as described previously [33] . Briefly, 25 µL of viral sample was added to 25 µL of CPC diluted in PBS and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Serial 2-fold dilutions were mixed with 50 µL of 0.5% suspension of chicken RBCs (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville PA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Data were then presented as the percentage reduction in HA titer. The RBCs were exposed to CPC only to ensure CPC did not have a direct lysing effect on RBCs. Hemagglutination titers were determined as an end point dilution where no pellet was observed. The concentration of chicken RBCs was standardized using a hemocytometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM): Influenza virus (B/Lee/40) was chosen as a prototypical influenza virus and was treated with 50 µg/mL CPC for 5 minutes. A CPC concentration of 50 µg/mL was employed to ensure adequate visualization of CPC activity on TEM analysis while still remaining below CC 50 toxicity levels. Fifty microliters of sample were placed on glass slides and formvar/carbon -coated TEM nickel grids (400 mesh) were placed over the samples face down for 1 minute. Influenza virus treated with PBS only was used as a sham control. Next, the grid was removed, blotted with filter paper and exposed to 2.0% uranyl acetate solution for an additional 1 minute. Excess uranyl acetate was removed, grids were air-dried, and examined under an FEI Tecnai Spirit (T12) electron microscope (TEI, Hillsboro, Oregon). Images were captured using a Gatan US4000 4kx4k CCD camera. The reviewer of TEM analysis was masked to treatment vs control slides. Influenza Nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA: Samples were adsorbed overnight at 4°C in Costar 96well plates. Wells were washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20-PBS, followed by blocking with BSA (1 g BSA in 50 ml PBS). Next, wells were exposed to mouse anti-influenza B NP antibody (diluted 1:1000, ABCAM) for 2 hours followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:10,000, ABCAM) for 2 hours and finally tetramethylbenzidine (TMB ) ELISA substrate (ABCAM) for 15 minutes; all incubations were performed at 37°C. Washes were performed between each incubation and reactions were terminated with ELISA stopping solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified with a Biorad microplate reader. OD values were normalized with unexposed controls.
