12 mer peptides from the HCK sequence were synthesized on nitrocellulose membrane as individual spots. Peptide sequences were started from HCK N-terminal and each subsequent peptides shift one position to the right. A set of such peptides completely sampled the whole HCK sequence and formed an array on the membrane. The peptide array membrane was incubated with purified scFv-A4 antibodies in the MP buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 170 mM NaCl, 6.4 mM KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% sucrose) overnight at 4uC with gentle shaking. Unbound antibodies were removed with TBS (4uC) andthe antibodies bound were electro-transferred onto a PVDF membrane using a semi-dry blotter (0.8 mA/cm2, three hours). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h and incubated with the primary antibody (anti-V5 antibody) overnight at 4uC. After being washed with TBS buffer for three times, the membrane was incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method.
