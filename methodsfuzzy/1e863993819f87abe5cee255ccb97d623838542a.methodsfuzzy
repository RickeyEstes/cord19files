A dog suffering from vomiting and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis was euthanized after a rapid disease course lasting seven days. Necropsy showed the presence of necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure. Clinical and post-mortem tests for multiple infectious agents of enteric disease were all negative. Liver Tissue was stored at âˆ’80 C until further processing. Tissue samples (~25 mg) were homogenized, filtered, and nuclease treated as previously described to enrich for nucleic acids within viral particles [23] . Nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), randomly amplified using random RT-PCR with randomized 3' primers and nucleic acid libraries prepared as previously described [24] for sequencing using the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument (454 Life Science, Roche). The pyrosequencing reads were sorted, trimmed, assembled and compared to the GenBank non-redundant databases as previously described [9] . Potential viral sequences were identified with translated protein sequence similarity matches Figure 2 A) Inverse PCR was performed to obtain the NTR sequence between the VP termination and the NS initiation codon of episomal forms of CnBoV3. Primers (P1 and P2) were situated at VP and NS region respectively. Secondary structures (symbolic in the box) may have impeded the PCR resulting in several products of different length. B) Highly identical 'rabbit ear' structure of CnBoV3 and MVC. C) Alignments of NTR sequences obtained by sequencing different inverse PCR products directly (PCR1&2) and subcloning products (colony 1-4). Sequences outside the two arrows were identical. Underlined sequence shows location of "rabbit ear" sequence. (BLASTx to GenBank's NR database with E-value < 10 -3 ) to known viral sequences. The presence of virus protein sequences detected by 454 pyrosequencing was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Genome walking and degenerate PCR were used to amplify the viral genome. Enriched viral nucleic acids from the infected tissue was also handled using the ScriptSeq RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicentre) and sequenced by MiSeq system (illumina). The resulting near complete genome of CnBoV3 was deposited in GenBank with accession no. KC580640. Phylogenetic analyses based on aligned amino acid sequences from full-length VP proteins were generated by the neighbor joining method in MEGA [25] , using amino acid p-distances, with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
