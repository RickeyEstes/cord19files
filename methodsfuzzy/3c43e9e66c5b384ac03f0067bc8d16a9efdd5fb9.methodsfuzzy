In this section we develop a system of partial differential equations with initial and boundary conditions, for the variables introduced in Section 1, in a spherical tumor V(t) and boundary C(t). Cell density (x,y,n) In order to describe the time evolution of densities of different types of tumor cells (uninfected, infected, and dead cells), we take into account cell proliferation of tumor cells and the virus infection of tumor cells, followed by the clearance process, and the passive movement due to the velocity field u generated from tumor growth; in Section 2.6, we will derive an equation for u . The equations for x,y and n are taken from the model by Friedman et al. [50] ; Ly Lt z+ : (y u )~bxv |{z} Ln Lt z+ : (nu )~dy |{z} where u is the velocity, l is the proliferation rate of uninfected tumor cells, b is the infection rate, d is the infected cell lysis rate, and m is the removal rate of dead cells. We note that treatment by Chase-ABC does not affect these equations. We also note that Friedman et al. [50] included the effect of the immune system and immune suppressive treatment on the efficacy of the OV injection; in the present paper we ignore this aspect of the treatment, concentrating only on the efficacy derived from Chase-ABC treatment.
