The clinical usefulness of a test was determined by the relative degrees of sensitivity and specifi city and the time taken to obtain a result. Monoclonal-antibody direct fl uorescent antibody tests usually had adequate specifi city for a particular virus, but there was a trade-off between turnaround time and sensitivity. Thus, although some of the colorimetric tests for direct antigen detection had a turnaround time of less than an hour, sensitivity could be around 70%. 51 Further developments in reaction chemistry have enabled the targeted amplifi cation of other viruses in the same reaction, while keeping sensitivity and specifi city high and the turnaround time still relevant to clinical need. Available versions of in-house and commercially developed multiplex tests off er potential amplifi cation of up to 20 pathogens from a clinical sample, 26, 40, 45 although for some of these the turnaround time approaches a whole working day. Several head-to-head comparisons of inhouse and commercial tests have been published. 43, 44, [46] [47] [48]
