This pilot study is a secondary analysis of patients, and residual urine samples, enrolled in other work designed to determine the predictive accuracy of a single protein in diagnosing UTI. 11 All patients with neurogenic bladders who were actively performing clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), were followed at our center, and had a urine culture sent as part of clinical care from August 1, 2015 through November 1, 2016 were eligible to participate in the original study. This included patients presenting for urodynamics, who have routine urine cultures sent at our institution, and those presenting for evaluation of potential UTI. Patients who met inclusion criteria (ie, presence of a neurogenic bladder, actively performing CIC) were initially identified in the electronic health record (EPIC™, Verona, WI) using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes for neurogenic bladder or spina bifida. Following initial identification, the research team then performed a manual review of each patient's medical record to confirm that inclusion criteria were met. All eligible patients were then flagged in VigiLanz™ (VigiLanz Corporation, Minneapolis, MN), a real-time lab monitoring software that sent an automatic notification via e-mail to the research team when a flagged patient had a urine sample sent to the clinical laboratory. The residual urine was then obtained for use in this work. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: if they met the KDIGO criteria for acute kidney injury, 12 had signs or symptoms of sepsis 13 at the time of presentation, or if they were dialysis-dependent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patients included in this study were drawn from the original cohort, who were identified as described above. Patients with UTI were chosen to be included in the mass spectrometry phase of this study if they had sufficient residual urine for this analysis, met our criteria for UTI (described below), and were confirmed to have unequivocal UTI on manual chart review. Five patients with UTI were randomly chosen from those who met these criteria. All patients with UTC were eligible to be included if they had sufficient urine for this analysis. Of the patients with UTC who met these criteria, those closest in age to the patients with UTI were selected. The charts of these 5 patients with UTC were then reviewed to ensure that there were no symptoms concerning for UTI.
