The study was undertaken in rural coastal Kenya within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System [8] . A cohort of 47 households with young infants and other members (n=493 individuals) were prospectively sampled, regardless of their illness status, weekly over the first 4 weeks and thereafter twice weekly over 1 complete RSV season (December 2009 through June 2010) that lasted 26 weeks, as has been described previously [5, 7] . A household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with communal cooking arrangements. The RSV season was identified from surveillance conducted by the local county hospital and was defined as a period in which at least 2 RSV cases were detected per week in each of the 2 contiguous weeks and continued as long as these conditions were met [9] . During every home visit, trained field assistants recorded the presence of respiratory symptoms (ie, cough, runny or blocked nose, or difficulty in breathing). The presence of 1 or more of these symptoms defined acute respiratory disease (ARD). Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected and screened for RSV (groups A and B), human rhinovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV-OC43, NL63, and 229E), and adenovirus (AdV), using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [10] . For each test target, a cycle threshold (Ct) value of â‰¤35 was considered positive for virus [11] .
