The pH value of the treated and raw ash samples were measured by pH meter using standard method [14] . The sequential extraction procedure of metals in the ashes was performed by using the method suggested by Tesseir et al. [15] . The metals were fractionated into five fractions: exchangeable (F1), bound to carbonate (F2), bound to Fe-Mn oxides (F3), bound to organic matters (F4) and residual fraction (F5). After each extraction, the separation was achieved by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 m membranes. Heavy metals in the extraction solutions were determined by ICP-OES.
