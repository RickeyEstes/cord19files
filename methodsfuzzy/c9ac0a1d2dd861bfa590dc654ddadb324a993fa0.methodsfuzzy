This was a pre-post comparison study. The study was based in part on data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) provided by the BNHI, Department of Health and managed by the National Health Research Institutes. The database contains registration files and original claims data for reimbursement. The NHIRD is provided to scientists in Taiwan for research purposes. Each year, the BNHI collects data from the National Health Insurance program and sorts it into data files. These data files are de-identified by scrambling the identification codes of both patients and medical facilities and then sent to the National Health Research Institutes to form the original files contained in the NHIRD. [25] Based on the registration files and original claims data in the NHIRD, specific data subsets can be re-constructed for research purposes. The registration datasets, systemic sampling inpatient expenditures by admissions (DD file) and systemic sampling ambulatory care expenditures by visits (CD file) were used in this study. The interpretation and conclusions contained herein do not represent those of the Bureau of National Health Insurance, the Department of Health, or the National Health Research Institutes. [25] 2.1. Systemic sampling CD and DD files Approximately, 0.2% of the ambulatory care expenditures, by visit, CD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis, together with the related records in details of ambulatory care orders form the systematic sampling CD file; 5% of the inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis, together with the related records in details of inpatient orders form the systematic sampling DD file. [25] A total of 1 million cases of systemic sampling dataset were used in this study.
