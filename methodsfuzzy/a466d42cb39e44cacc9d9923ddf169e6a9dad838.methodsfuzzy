Because of an assumption of conditional independence between the renewal process and death, the total likelihood L is given by Minimizing the negative logarithm of the total likelihood L, we jointly estimate three parameters, Ï€ T , r, and k. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are derived from the profile likelihood, the idea of which is to invert a likelihood ratio test to obtain a CI for the parameter in question [23] .
