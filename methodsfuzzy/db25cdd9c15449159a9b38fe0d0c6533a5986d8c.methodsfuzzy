This paper utilizes the asset pricing model (Lucas, 1978) to conduct the theoretical analysis of identifying multiple bubbles from market fundamentals. In line with the theory developed by Tirole (1985) , the conception that commodity prices may deviate from market fundamental values due to mildly explosive behaviors is widely accepted. As indicated by Gürkaynak (2008) , fundamental prices of the copper commodity are derived from the no-arbitrage condition: where P t and E t indicate the copper price and expectation in period t, r f is the free-risk rate, and δ tþ1 and U tþ1 indicate returns and the invisible component in period t þ 1. By forward iteration, the equation is expressed as: where P f t represents the fundamental price of copper and δ tþi represents the returns in period t þ i. Equation (2) states the determinants in fundamental value. In turn, which is any sequence of random variables that generally satisfies the homogeneous expectation equation. As a result, Equation (1) is expressed as: Equation (4) decomposes the copper price into the market fundamental component, P f t , and the bubble component,B t . Prices may exceed market fundamentals as a result of the expectation that agents could sell at higher prices. It should be noted that the path of bubbles is not unique. Equation (4) indicates a different path for each possible value of the original bubble level, since it restricts the law of motion for nonfundamental component in commodity prices. When B t ¼ 0, the equation indicates that explosive behaviors do not exist. Otherwise, in the case of B t with a nonzero value, bubble episodes do not terminate until explosion due to expectations. Accurate recognition and prediction of multiple bubbles is of vital importance to policymakers in implementing precautionary policies. On the basis of the theoretical analysis of identifying multiple bubbles from market fundamentals, this study further implement the SADF and GSADF techniques to investigate existence of multiple bubble behaviors in the international copper market. In addition, we elaborate the Backward Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (BSADF) statistic sequence that is utilized to locate the origination and termination of each bubble. Finally, we further explore the role of macroeconomic determinants of copper bubble behaviors and confirm the relative importance of each factor. Evans (1991) has proven that when periodically collapsing behaviors exist in time series, traditional approaches are not effective in examining bubble episodes. The stationarity tests with an explosive alternative hypothesis are based upon standard ADF and Phillips-Perron tests. In the model where P tÀ 1 represents the logarithmic copper price, k represents the number of lags, and NID indicates an independent and normal distribution. The null hypothesis is β ¼ 1, implying P tÀ 1 is unit root process, while the alternatives β > 1 signify the presence of mildly explosive behaviors. Nevertheless, according to Evans (1991) , traditional tests possess limited power in exploring periodically collapsing bubbles. propose utilizing the supremum value of ADF T-statistics, which are recursively determined to address the drawback. The SADF test estimates the ADF model repeatedly on a forwardexpanding sample sequence. The window size r w ranges from r 0 to 1. The starting point r 1 is fixed at 0, and then the ending point r 2 equals r w , which changes from r 0 to r 1 . The SADF statistics can be expressed as Moreover, the GSADF method further utilizes flexible window widths, given the weakness of the SADF technique in dealing with the origin and collapse of multiple bubbles. The GSADF method not only varies the ending point from r 0 to 1 but also alters its starting point r 1 from 0 to r 2 À r 0 . The GSADF statistic is denoted by GSADFðr 0 Þ. That is, The existence of bubbles can be confirmed when the GSADF statistic is greater than the critical value obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. When the model includes an intercept and the null hypothesis is a random walk, the limit distribution of the GSADF statistic is: where r w ¼ r 2 À r 1 . We acquire the asymptotic critical values by numerical simulations and calculate the finite sample distributions by bootstrap methodology. This technique is not affected by a possible explosive root of the determinants of the copper price, and it provides a date-stamping strategy. Moreover, the BSADF statistic sequence is obtained by implementing the right-tailed ADF test on backward-expanding sample sequences to locate the emergence and termination of each bubble. BSADF statistic is defined as: Based on the obtained BSADF statistic, the starting and ending dates for the k-th bubble (i.e., r ks and r ke ) are, respectively, defined as: where cv β T r2 is the 100(1-β T )% critical value of the sup ADF statistic based on Tr 2 observations from Monte Carlo simulations and δ depends on data frequency. Utilizing the date-stamping procedure developed above, this study detects the existence of multiple bubbles and estimates the origination and termination of each explosive episode. Based on the timeline of exuberance in the international copper market, this paper further investigates the role of macroeconomic determinants in copper bubbles. Following , to represent the bubble testing results for the copper commodity, we define R t as: where t ¼ 1, 2, …, T. According to Equation (12), R t equals 1 when a bubble is detected on the t-th date and 0 otherwise. Using the bubble variable R t as the dependent variable, we next employ a standard probit model to explore the influences of driving forces on bubble formations in international copper market. Based on relevant studies, the formation of bubbles is determined by supply and demand fundamentals and influenced by financial factors such as speculation and the U.S. dollar index (Bosch and Pradkhan, 2015; Chen et al., 2019) . Therefore, the basic model specification is expressed as: where the vector X t represents macroeconomic factors that affect bubble behaviors in the international copper market, including copper supply (CS t ), copper demand (CD t ), the interest rate (IR t ), the U.S. dollar index (USD t ) and speculation (FS t ). Therefore, the probit model is described by: where Φð ⋅Þ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. The parameters are estimated by maximizing the full-sample log likelihood function: In a probit model, a parameter estimate only provides information on the direction of the effect through its sign. The marginal effect for variable X j is further calculated based on the following formula: where ϕðX ' t βÞ is the standard normal density. Based on marginal effects, we can confirm the extent of the impact of macroeconomic determinants on bubble occurrences in the international copper market.
