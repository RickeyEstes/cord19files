Cell lines. Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells (ATCC; RRID CVCL_1915) and L929 murine fibrosarcoma cells (RRID CVCL_0462) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (DCS) and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB). RAW 264.7 murine monocyte/macrophage (RRID CVCL_0493), African green monkey kidney (Vero; RRID CVCL_0059), and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa; ATCC; RRID CVCL_0058) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MEF/3T3 Tet-Off murine embryonic fibroblasts (simply called MEFs throughout; Clontech; CVCL_KS91) and immortalized primary MEFs from Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ animals (MEF isolation and immortalization are described in reference 75) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 mM HEPES buffer, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.05 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Mediatech). All media also contained 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Except for instances of experimental temperature variation, all cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO 2 . Primary cell cultures. Primary murine osteoblast cultures were generated from 3-to 5-day-old suckling CD1 mice and maintained as described previously (76) . Briefly, dissected calvaria were triply digested with collagenase P and cultured for 5 days in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha (AMEM) containing 15% FCS at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in a humidified chamber to allow osteoblast outgrowth. Osteoblasts were detached by trypsinization, strained to remove bone fragments, seeded into 150-mm culture dishes, and allowed to expand under the same growth conditions as described above. Upon reaching confluence, the osteoblasts were trypsinized and seeded into multiwell plates for experimentation. Virus stocks. cDNA clones of SINV-TR339 (77), CHIKV-LR (78), EEEV-FL93-939 (62), and VEEV-ZPC738 (79) have been described elsewhere. Mutant viruses SINV-nsP2-726G (80), VEEV-CD-nsp2-739L (37), and CHIKV-E2-79K (81) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with appropriate overlapping primers and the QuikChange kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nanoluciferaseexpressing CHIKV-LR-nluc-TaV and CHIKV-LR-E2-79K-nluc-TaV viruses are described in reference 45. To generate virus stocks, infectious, capped RNA was generated by in vitro transcription from linearized clones (mMessage mMachine; Ambion) and electroporated into BHK-21 cells using a GenePulser II (Bio-Rad) as previously described (82) . Virus-containing supernatants were collected after 24 h, and titers were determined on BHK-21 cells using a standard plaque assay. The DENV2 strain 16681 was a gift from Jared Evans. Viral stocks were generated from a single passage on C6/36 mosquito cells, and titers were determined by focus-forming assay on human hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells using antiflavivirus D1-4G2-4-15 antibody (ATCC). The YFV-Angola strain was a gift from Alan Barrett, and stocks were made and titers were determined as described previously (83) . Experiments involving RVFV strain ZH501 (84) were conducted in the laboratory of Amy Hartman. Propagation and titration of this virus are described in reference 85. Animals. All experiments involving animals were carried out under approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh (protocol 15096749) and in accordance with the recommendations found in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (92) . Five-to 6-week-old adult male and female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (RRID IMSR_JAX:000664) and 5-to 7-week-old adult male and female Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice on the C57BL/6 background were bred in-house. Mice were housed socially (maximum 5/cage for females and 4/cage for males) in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) microisolator cages in our animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facility. Animals were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum except in instances of experimental induction of metabolic torpor (detailed below). All mice weighed between 15 and 25 g and were drug and test naive prior to use in these studies. Prior to and upon initiation of experiments, all mice were weighed and checked for disease signs (lethargy, ruffled fur, and hunching) daily to ensure maximal animal welfare in accordance with approved IACUC procedures. Animals of both sexes were divided randomly into experimental groups, such that experiments reflect pooled data from both sexes. Antibodies and other reagents. robust ISG induction as well as observable dose-dependent antiarboviral activity. The required dosage, then, necessarily varied according to the cell type used, the IFN-␣/␤ sensitivity of individual viruses, murine versus human, and the experimental aim. Dosages used for specific experiments are noted in the text and figure legends. LPS was used at a concentration of 250 ng/ml. After addition of the stimulus, cells were moved immediately to the appropriate temperature treatments, and the stimulus was left until sample collection. For experiments involving poly(I:C) treatment of cells, 50 g poly(I:C) was transfected into MEF cells using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions and recommended settings. Pooled transfections were then divided among temperature conditions. For experiments involving virus infection at different temperatures, all infections were performed for 1 h at 30°C to minimize temperature-dependent variation in attachment and entry efficiency, unless otherwise noted. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in fresh growth medium before being placed under different temperature conditions. Viral growth curves. Vero, MEF, or primary murine osteoblast cells were treated for 12 to 16 h at 30, 37, or 39°C with 0 or 100 to 1,000 IU/ml human (Vero) or murine (MEF/osteoblast) IFN-␣/␤, rinsed in room-temperature PBS, and infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 as described above. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points, and viral growth was determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells for alphaviruses, by focus-forming assay on Vero cells for flaviviruses, and by plaque assay on Vero cells for RVFV. All quantification assays were performed at 37°C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assays. Vero cells were treated for 12 to 16 h at 30, 34, 37, or 39°C with 2-fold decreasing concentrations of human or mouse IFN-␣/␤ in 96-well plates, beginning with 4,000 IU. Cells were then infected at an MOI of 10 and returned to the original temperature condition for 96 h. The concentration of IFN-␣/␤ necessary to inhibit 50% of cell death was determined visually by crystal violet staining. Western blotting. Protein lysates were taken in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of protein (15 g) per sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% milk for at least 1 h. Primary antibody was diluted in TBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and applied to membranes overnight at 4°C and then washed 4 times in TBS-T (15 min per wash) and replaced with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted in a 2% milk-TBS-T solution. Secondary antibody was incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C and then washed 4 times in TBS-T, as described above. Finally, membranes were exposed to Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate, and signal was captured on X-ray film (GE Healthcare). Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software (NIH). Quantitative PCR and NanoString. Total cellular RNA was isolated from samples taken in TRIzol reagent (Ambion) per the manufacturer's protocol using 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (BCP) and isopropanol. For qRT-PCR, 10 g of RNA per sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers and semiquantitative PCR was performed using the Sybr green method on an ABI 7900 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using gene-specific primers. See Table S1 for a complete list of primer sequences. Threshold cycle (C T ) values were normalized to 18S rRNA and compared using the ΔΔC T method (86) . For NanoString, 100 ng RNA from each sample was subjected to fluorescent probe hybridization (see Table S2 for complete list of gene targets and probe sequences) and fluorescent bar codes corresponding to individual target mRNA molecules were counted automatically with an nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies). All mRNA quantification steps were performed by the Genomics Research Core at the University of Pittsburgh. Raw mRNA counts for each target gene underwent background subtraction and housekeeping gene normalization using nSolver 2.6 software (NanoString Technologies). Biological interferon assays. Concentrations of biologically active murine IFN-␣/␤ were measured by bioassay as previously described (87) . Briefly, supernatants or serum samples (200 l) were acidified to pH 2.0 with 2 N HCl overnight at 4°C and then neutralized to pH 7.4 using 2 N NaOH. Samples were serially diluted 2-fold across 96-well plates seeded with L929 cells and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Cells were then infected with 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU per well of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and incubated for an additional 24 h at 37°C prior to fixation and staining with crystal violet. The concentration of IFN-␣/␤ in each sample was calculated from the dilution required to protect 50% of cells from CPE, compared with a standard IFN-␣/␤ dilution series of known concentrations. Immunofluorescence. IFN-␣/␤-or poly(I:C)-treated cells seeded on glass microscope slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for at least 1 h at the indicated times poststimulation. Cells were permeabilized in 100% methanol at Ϫ20°C for 10 min and blocked in blocking buffer (phosphatebuffered saline with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 10% normal serum corresponding to the species of the secondary antibody for at least 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer, washed, and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain for 1 h at room temperature. Images were acquired on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope or an Olympus CKX41 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Image analysis was performed in NIS Elements v4.51.00. The DAPI channel was used to create a binary mask that identified both the nuclear location and individual cells. The intensity of the STAT-p channel for all pixels within the nuclear mask was summed and then divided by the total number of pixels to produce the mean STAT-p signal per nucleus expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU). Mean STAT-p signal was plotted for individual cells. Protein radiolabel. MEF cells were incubated at 30, 37, or 39°C for 1 or 12 h. At each time point, growth medium was replaced with labeling medium (DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine [Cellgro] supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and 1% penicillin-streptomycin [Pen-Strep]), and cells were returned to their temperature conditions for 15 min. Supernatants were then replaced with labeling medium containing 100 Ci/ml [ 35 S]Cys-Met (MP Biomedicals), and plates were returned to their temperature conditions for another 15 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS, and lysates were prepared with equal volumes of RIPA buffer. Twenty microliters per sample was resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, which was then fixed and dried to allow for autoradiographic signal capture of X-ray film (GE Healthcare). Gels were exposed for 7 days at Ϫ80°C, and resulting protein signal was quantified by densitometry analysis of all visible proteins in each lane using ImageJ software (NIH). Translation reporters. Construction and production of host-mimic firefly luciferase-expressing mRNA translation reporter constructs have been described previously (88) (89) (90) . MEFs or Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ MEFs were transfected with 5 g RNA reporter per reaction using the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and recommended settings. Single transfections were divided among 30, 37, and 39°C temperature treatments for the appropriate time course, and cell lysates were collected in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was quantified using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega), and light production was measured on an Orion microplate luminometer (Berthold). Relative light unit (RLU) values were normalized to protein concentration in each sample, as determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Data are expressed at RLU per microgram of protein. Mouse core temperature reduction and infection. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) and Ifnar1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (bred in-house) were used for all experiments. For induction of metabolic torpor, mice were housed for 4.5 days in 24-h low red light before torpor was induced by food withdrawal. Nontorpid mice were also housed in red light but had access to food and water ad libitum. Food and normal light conditions (12-h light/12-h dark) were restored 48 h after food withdrawal. For pharmacological temperature reduction, mice were given 300 l intraperitoneal injections of 1.5 to 2 mg/kg of body weight reserpine (U.S. Pharmacopeia standard; Sigma) dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid. Reserpine solutions were prepared fresh by first dissolving the powder in 100% glacial acetic acid and then diluting to the desired concentration in sterile double-distilled water (ddH 2 O). Final reserpine solutions underwent 0.22-m filter sterilization before being injected into mice. Mice were given 0.5-mg/kg booster doses as needed (when subcutaneous scruff temperature exceeded 30°C) to maintain core temperature reduction throughout an experiment. Control mice were given equal volumes of sterile 0.5% acetic acid only. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were infected with 1,000 PFU CHIKV-LR, CHIKV-LR-E2-79K, or nanoluciferase (nLuc)-TaV viruses (described in reference 45) in a 10-l volume injected subcutaneously into the left rear footpad. For torpor experiments, infections took place 12 h after food withdrawal. For reserpine experiments, infections were done 3 h after reserpine treatment. All mice were weighed and monitored for disease signs daily. Musculoskeletal disease in infected feet was quantified every 12 to 24 hours as described previously (91) . On days 2 and 6 postinfection, groups of mice were sacrificed by isoflurane overdose and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture before perfusion of tissues with PBS. Perfused tissues were extracted and homogenized, and viral load in each tissue was determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Serum was separated from whole-blood samples using Microtainer tubes (BD Biosciences), and IFN-␣/␤ concentrations were determined by biological IFN-␣/␤ assay, as described above. In vivo bioluminescence imaging. Mice were anesthetized with a low-dose continuous stream of isoflurane using the Xenogen XGI-8 gas anesthesia system (Caliper Life Sciences). The nLuc substrate furimazine (Nano-Glo luciferase assay system; Promega) was diluted in sterile Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) with Ca 2ϩ and Mg 2ϩ (Corning) and injected subcutaneously in the scruff (5 l substrate in 500-l total volume per mouse) and allowed to circulate for 3 min. After 3 min, bioluminescence was imaged using an IVIS Spectrum CT instrument (PerkinElmer). Exposure time was determined automatically according to signal strength using Living Image acquisition software (PerkinElmer). Resulting pseudocolored images, normalized for exposure time, were marked with regions of interest (ROIs) around the hind feet of each mouse, and luciferase signal was quantitated as average radiance (photons per second per square centimeter per steradian) in each ROI using Living Image software (PerkinElmer). Mice were imaged daily for up to 7 days postinfection, beginning with a preinfection image. Quantification and statistical analysis. Statistical significance for all experiments was determined using GraphPad Prism software. Results were declared statistically significant when P was less than or equal to 0.05, for all statistical tests employed across experiments. Specific tests used as well as demarcations of additional levels of significance are detailed in the figure legends. All experiments were performed with at least 2 replicate samples per group, and all experiments were performed at least twice to confirm results, except for the NanoString analysis, which was performed once, with select results being confirmed by qPCR. Data from single representative experiments are shown in the figures, and pooled data are presented as either means Ϯ standard deviations (SD) or geometric mean Ϯ geometric SD as appropriate.
