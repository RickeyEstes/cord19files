Trypan blue dye was used for confirmation of viability of Huh-7 and CHO cells. For toxicological analysis of GL, liver cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 10 5 in six well plate. First well was considered as control and added different concentrations of the GL from lowest to highest in the remaining wells. After 24 h trypsinized the cells, prepared a suspension of 1:1 of the cell suspension to trypan blue dye and dispensed 10 μl of it on a glass slide and counted viable cells through haemocytometer.
