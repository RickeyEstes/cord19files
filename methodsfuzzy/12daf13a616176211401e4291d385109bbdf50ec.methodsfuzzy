One hundred twenty Holstein calves were used in the study and were located ( MR. Lactose contents of the high and low fat MR were 44.5 and 49.0%, respectively. Vitamin and mineral contents of the MR were similar. Starters were fed for ad libitum intake from d 14 to 56. Because of minimal consumption of starter during the first 2 wk of life (10) , starter was not offered until d 14. Starters were offered daily, and orts were measured weekly or more frequently if feed contamination occurred. Starters were formulated to contain 7.3% fat (high) or 3.7% fat (low) and 20.0% CP, DM basis. The fat source of the high fat starter was ground, roasted soybeans. Soybeans were processed in a drum roaster (Roast-A-Matic®; Lebanon, PA) to an exit temperature of 150°C and steeped for 30 min. Ingredient contents of starters are in Table I , and nutrients contents are in Table 2 . Molasses, soybean meal or soybeans, calcium carbonate, vitamin and mineral premix, and coccidiostat were pelleted before addition to the grains. Water was available free choice to calves at all locations.
