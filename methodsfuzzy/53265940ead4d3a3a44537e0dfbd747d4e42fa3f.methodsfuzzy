2.1. Production of small heat-shock protein cage nanoparticle (sHsp) The small heat-shock protein (sHsp 16.5) was initially purified as described previously [33] . In a slight modification of the previously described protocol, the supernatants from 2 L of cell culture were combined and concentrated to 10 mL with a 100k MWCO amicon filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) prior to size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) so that purification of large amounts of sHsp could be accomplished efficiently. In order to remove residual protein contaminants, additional steps were added to the previous protocol. The fractions containing sHsp from size exclusion chromatography were re-concentrated to 10 mL and purified by anion exchange on a Sepharose Q column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient from 300 mM to 800 mM NaCl in 25 mM HEPES Buffer at pH 7.3. Following this, the fractions containing sHsp were dialyzed overnight into 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA, at pH 7.3, concentrated a third time to 10 mL, and re-subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) with the same buffer. For the S121C sHsp variant protein, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to a final concentration of 2 mM during each amicon concentration step prior to the FPLC runs to inhibit disulfide formation between external thiols on sHsp. The sHsp protein concentration was determined via UV-visible spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of A280 = 0.565 (mg/mL) âˆ’1 as previously documented [33] .
