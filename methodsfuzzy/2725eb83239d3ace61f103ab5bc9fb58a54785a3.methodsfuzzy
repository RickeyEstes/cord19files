''Find the problem, else we risk solving the wrong one''. This was the opening sentence of Professor Mat Santamouris when he was invited to be an expert reviewer during early stages of the study. The methodology and main tasks are summarized as follows: (A) A desk top study of related works and study examples around the world -not just scientific investigations, but also policy measures. (B) A review to understand the current urban conditions of Hong Kong, and to identify issues and problems. (C) Explore the possibility of establishing performance criteria needed for considering the impact of development on the wind environment. (D) Define the critical issues and explore the feasibility of developing a practical and cost-effective assessment methodology. (E) Examine the practicality of an effective implementation mechanism, and develop a methodology. (F) Establish principles and good practice for the use of professionals and practitioners in the shaping of the built environment for a better wind environment. The key policy outcomes of this study include (1) to advise on the framework for analyzing the urban fabric in relation to the planning context of Hong Kong; (2) to identify the key factors in planning terms that would have a bearing on air ventilation; (3) to identify the key factors for consideration in determining the circumstances under which air ventilation assessment should be required having regard to the prevailing planning context; and (4) to advise on implementation approaches and the corresponding implementation mechanisms.
