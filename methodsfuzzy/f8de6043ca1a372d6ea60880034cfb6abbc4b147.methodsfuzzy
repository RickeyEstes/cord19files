Strains and viral culture Ten MERS-CoVs isolated from 10 respiratory samples from 10 dromedaries sent to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai, UAE, in 2014 and 2015 were included in this study. Isolation of MERS-CoV was performed as previously described. 15 Briefly, the samples were diluted 10-fold with viral transport medium and filtered. Two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 μL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates containing Vero cells for adsorption inoculation. After 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with 1 mL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco). The cultures were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for cytopathic effect (CPE) for five days. Each of the cultures exhibited the typical CPE of detachment and rounding of cells. All cultures with a CPE were confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV through a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay targeting a region of the viral genome upstream of the envelope gene and isothermal amplification with a Genie instrument (Optigene Limited, Horsham, UK).
