The bacteriophage f 2 (f 2 phage), which may be present in wastewater and is suitable for serving as an indicator microorganism for evaluating disinfection effects (Havelaa, 1987; Sebastiani, 1989) , was prepared and detected according to the methods described by Womack et al. (1995) . SARS-CoV was prepared and detected using culture methods on Vero E6 cell. The cells were grown in Eagle's growth medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.015 M DMEM buffer and antibiotics (kanamycin and gentamycin each 50 g/ml), and maintained in the same medium with 1.5% FBS. Medium was replaced for 1-2 days of incubation. Culture was terminated 7 days after inoculation, and the culture was observed daily for cytopathic effects.
