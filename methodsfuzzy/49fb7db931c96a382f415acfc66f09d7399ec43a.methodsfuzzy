A detailed breakdown of viruses detected by each laboratory is shown in Supplemental table* 5. Ad2, Human Herpesvirus (HHV)-3 and HHV-5 were detected by all methods (Fig. 3, left panel) . Ad2, Ad41, HHV-3, HHV-5, Parechovirus, and Rotavirus A were detected by all laboratories (Fig. 3, right panel) . Norovirus GI and Influenza B were detected by fewer than 50% of methods while Norovirus GI was detected by fewer than 50% of laboratories. The current study did not aim to directly compare PCR and deep sequencing for detection of these viruses, however with the exception of Ad41, the viruses detected by the fewest laboratories and methods were those that were not detected by real-time PCR.
