Volunteers. A total of five healthy volunteers who received influenza vaccination were selected (A, 28 year-old male; B, 35 year-old female; C, 28 year-old male; D, 57 year-old male; and E, 29 yearold female). Ten milliliters of blood were obtained from individual volunteer and the PBMCs were prepared by centrifugation through Ficoll Pack Plus (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) for 40 min at 520g. Vaccine Cell fusion. The PBMCs were fused with SPYMEG cells at a ratio of 10:1 with polyethylene glycol #1500. Fused cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% FCS in 96-well microplates for 10-14 days in the presence of HAT. The first screening of the culture medium for antibodies specific to influenza viruses was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described below. Specific antibodypositive wells were next subjected to cell cloning by limiting dilution. The second screening was also performed by ELISA. ELISA. The 96-well microplates coated with viral antigens were reacted with the culture medium of fused cells for 30 min at room temperature, followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Aichi, Japan). Immunofluorescence assay. Monolayers of MDCK cells in 8-well chamber slides were mock-infected or infected with influenza A and B viruses. After 8 h of incubation, the infected cells were fixed with ethanol then reacted with the culture medium of individual hybridoma cell clones. As control antibodies, we used several murine MAbs, i.e., C43 to nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A H3N2 virus [12] , C179 to HA of H1N1 [12] , F49 to HA of H3N2 (Okuno, unpublished) , 9F3 to NP of influenza B virus [13] , and 9E10 to HA of influenza B virus [14] . The cells were then reacted with fluores-cein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-human or antimouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK). Western blotting. Purified HA vaccine antigens in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer were subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes then incubated with the culture medium of individual hybridoma clones. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), the peroxidase reaction on the membrane was visualized using the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Peroxidase and anti-peroxidase (PAP) staining. PAP staining was carried out as described previously [15] . Briefly, MDCK cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with influenza virus and cultured for 6 h in FCS-free DMEM. The infected cells were fixed with ethanol and reacted with the culture medium of individual hybridoma cell clones. As controls, we used several murine MAbs as mentioned above. The cells were further incubated with rabbit anti-human or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel), then with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel), and finally with PAP complex (Cappel). Hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) test. The HI test was carried out as described previously [12] . The culture medium of individual hybridoma clones was treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE). The results were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the culture medium to show inhibition. Virus neutralization (VN) test. The VN test was carried out as described previously [15] . Briefly, the culture media of individual hybridoma clones that were treated with RDE were diluted 1:8 with serum-free medium. The diluted culture medium of individual hybridoma clones (50 lL) was mixed with 100 FFU of influenza virus (50 lL), then applied to MDCK cells in a 96-well microplate. After culturing for 6 h, the cells were fixed with ethanol and stained with PAP as above. The data were expressed as percentage of infectivity. Sequence analysis of HuMAb variable regions. Total RNA was extracted from 1 Â 10 5 hybridoma cells and reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42°C for 90 min, using Human IgGH RT-primer (5 0 -TGGAGGGCACGGTCACCACGC-3 0 ) and IgGL RT-Primer (5 0 -T TGTGACGGGCGAGCTCAGGC-3 0 ) for kappa chain, and also using dT Primer for lambda chain. Next, we performed 5 0 RACE PCR with the SMART TM RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA), using Human IgGH RACE-primer (5 0 -AAGGTG TGCACGCCGCTGGTC-3 0 ), Human IgGL(kappa) RACE-primer (5 0 -GT GCTGCTGAGGCTGTAGGTG-3 0 ) or Human IgGL(lambda) RACE-primer (5 0 -CCAYTGTCTTCTCCACRGTRCTCYC-3 0 and 5 0 -TCAGAGGAG-GRYGGGAACAGAGTG-3 0 ) as the reverse primer and Universal primer mix as the forward primer, and then cloned the PCR products into the cloning plasmid pMD20-T (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). Sequence analysis was performed with an ABI3730 Sequencer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA), using the M13 primer RV or M13 primer M4 and the BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin Elmer). Epitope mapping. A total of 158 sets of 15-residue peptides (overlapping by 13 amino acids) spanning amino acid (aa) residues 1-329 of the HA1 region of A/Hiroshima/52/05 (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were subjected to binding activity assay using peptide microarrays [16, 17] with the HuMAbs obtained. Ethics. All human materials were collected using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University.
