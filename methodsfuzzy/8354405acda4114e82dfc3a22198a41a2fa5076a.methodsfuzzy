Cells, plasmids, and antibodies. Vero E6 was supplied by Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology (Beijing, China). pET28a (+) vector was purchased from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). Phagemid pDNA5 [18] was provided by Dr. Andrew Bradbury from Los Alamos National Laboratory. pCDM8/S1-Fc vector [11] was provided by Dr. Hyeryun Choe from Harvard Medical School. The antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 from Amersham Pharmacia (England), HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA), while anti-His-Tag was from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). Virion preparation. SARS-CoV BJ01 were inactivated in a biosafety level 3 laboratory and purified by differential centrifugation as previously described [19] . Construction of scFv library. Total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of four convalescent SARS patients, fol-lowed by cDNA synthesis. The V H (heavy chain variable region) and V L genes (light chain variable region) were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1 and then cloned into phage-display vector pDAN5 [18] . The recombinant pDAN5 was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue by electroporation. The transformants were plated on dishes with 2· YT, containing 1% glucose, 100 lg/ml ampicillin, and 10 lg/ml tetracycline. All the colonies were collected by scraping, rescued by helper phage M13KO7 [20] , and finally stored as a primary scFv library. Diversity assessment of the scFv library. A number of individual colonies from the primary library were randomly picked and their phagemids with scFv were prepared as described previously [21] . After amplifying with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the individual scFv gene was digested by BstNI, and the fingerprinting of each colony was analyzed by agarose gels. Selection of phage scFv to SARS-CoV. The immunotubes were coated with purified SARS-CoV virions in 0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.6, blocked 2 h with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 10 12 phage scFv in 1 ml PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X-100. After intensive washes with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), bound phage antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine/HCl, pH 2.2, and immediately neutralized with 1.0 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Eluted phage scFv were subjected to the next round of infection, rescue, and selection. After five rounds of panning, the higher binders to SARS-CoV were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated overnight at 4°C with inactivated SARS-CoV particles in 0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.6, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, and incubated with an individual phage scFv in PBS containing 1% BSA. After five washes with PBST, the bound antibodies were detected by HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody followed by incubation with ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) as substrate. The color reaction was measured at 490 nm in a BioRad ELISA reader (Hercules, CA, USA). Expression and purification of scFv. In order to obtain a large amount of scFv, the genes of selected phage scFv were cloned into  Human V k For primers with SalI J k for SalI GAAGTTATGGTCGACCCTCCGGAACCTAGGACGGTSASCTTGGTCCC Note. A set of human antibody primers for amplification of the V H and V L genes from B cells of SRAS patients was optimized based on previous publications [20, 21, [27] [28] [29] . The italic indicates the flank sequence of the primers, the underline indicates the restriction enzyme site, and the bold indicates the primer sequence for amplifying the genes of human V H and V L . pET28a (+) vector and expressed with His-6-Tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The scFv in inclusion bodies was denatured with 8 M urea and purified by gel filtration on a column with Sephacryl S200 HR (10 · 110 mm) as previously described [22] . SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The protein samples were separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS and then incubated with a mouse anti-His-Tag antibody followed by a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The specific protein bands were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-ray film. Competitive inhibition assay. Sera from convalescent SARS patients were 1000 times diluted in PBS and then incubated 1 h at 37°C with a serial twofold dilution of purified scFv B1, starting at a concentration of 24 lg/ml. The above mixture of sera with diluted scFv B1 was subjected to 96-well plate coated with SARS-CoV particles and incubated for another 1 h at 37°C. HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc was added as secondary antibody. The following procedures were the same as described in ELISA. Antibody affinity assay. The binding kinetics of scFv B1 to SARS-CoV was analyzed using a Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer. Berifly, SARS-CoV virions were covalently immobilized to a protein chip and scFv B1 solution was added on the chip surface. Binding kinetic parameters were evaluated with antibody real-time binding curve [23] [24] [25] . Preparation of Luc/SARS S pseudovirus. The Luc/SARS S pseudovirus system was prepared based on the method described in [26] . Briefly, mammalian cell 293T was cotransfected by using three vectors that are mammalian expression vector pMT 21-S coding SARS-CoV S protein, pCMVR 8.2 coding for MuLV Gag and Pol, and pHR 0 -luc coding luciferase. After 48 h postinfection, Luc/SARS S pseudoviruses were packaged as virions in the infected cell and were collected from the culture supernatant. In vitro neutralization assay. Luc/SARS S pseudovirus system was used as an infection model to evaluate the neutralization activity of scFv B1. First, the Luc/SARS S pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with a serial twofold dilution of purified scFv B1, starting at a concentration of 17 lg/ml. Then, Vero E6 cells were infected by the Luc/SARS S pseudovirus with or without scFv B1. After 3 h incubation at 37°C, the culture medium was refreshed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and continuously cultured for another 48 h. The infected Vero E6 cells were lysed and assayed using a Luminometer DL Ready model TD2020 (Tartu, Estonia) for measuring the luciferase activity in the infected cells. Immunofluorescence assay. Vero E6 cell monolayer infected with Luc/SARS S pseudovirus was fixed with the mixture of acetone and methanol. After blocking with goat sera, the slides were incubated with purified scFv B1, and then mouse anti-His-Tag, and finally FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG. The scFv bound to SARS S pseudovirus in Vero E6 cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope. SARS antigen protein preparation. SARS S protein expressed with human Fc of IgG 1 in CHO cell. Briefly, ectodomain (12-1194 amino acids) of S protein with human Fc of IgG 1 was cloned into pMT 21, and a stably expressing cell line was selected after being transfected into CHO cell. After 48 h cultures, culture mediums were recovered and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for about 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer at 100°C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, identified by Western blot using HRP-goat anti-human Fc antibody, and visualized by autoradiography on X film. The pCDM8-S1-Fc vector encoded a fusion of S1 protein (residues 12-672) and a human Fc of IgG 1 . The pCDM8-S1-Fc was transfected into 293T cells. After 48 h, the S1-Fc protein was produced by transfected 293T cells into culture supernatant and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blot for analysis. The coding sequences for 680-1189, 680-1029, 680-879, and 1023-1189 residues of S protein were PCR-amplified from the full-length S gene (a stop codon also was inserted just after the protein sequence by PCR) and cloned into expression vector pET28a (+) by restriction enzyme sites NcoI and EcoRI. After identification by sequences, protein was expressed by inducing with IPTG in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Protein samples were analyzed by using 15% SDS-PAGE and transformed into nitrocellulose membrane, which was blotted by scFv B1.
