In a preliminary study that occurred in the early fall of 2010, the senior author first determined the filth fly families of interest by trapping, identifying and testing flies for CPV that were attracted to open bowls of infectious CPV positive canine feces. Three families of flies were found to test positive for CPV by real-time PCR assay. The three families of flies captured were the house fly (Mucidae), the blow/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) and the flesh fly (Sarcophagidae). To determine if the same flies could be carrying CPV in the canine facility environment, different canine facility surveillance locations were then selected. Fly trapping methods, fly identification and testing for CPV will be addressed later in this section. At the PSL, eight commercial fly traps (Black Flag Brands LLC, Joliet, IL, USA) were modified to capture flies alive, since dead flies in varying states of decomposition would make identification difficult. Two vials were placed in each trap, one containing a commercial natural fly bait (Rockwell Labs Ltd., North Kansas City, MO, USA) and the other a fly pheromone attractant (Black Flag Brands LLC, Joliet, IL, USA). The vials were covered with gauze and fastened with elastic bands to prevent fly entry. Fly traps were strategically placed at a suitable height (âˆ¼2 m). Traps were placed near drains where fly activity occurred at the outside end of each of eight inside-outside dog runs. All traps were retrieved at the end of each month and replaced with new traps. In late November 2011 a soil sample was collected by raking a 15 by 30 m fenced enclosure at the PSL where only healthy appearing dogs were occasionally kept yet flies were present and active. The soil sample obtained from this material and one obtained in the same manner from another area of the PSL where no dogs had been kept were tested for CPV by real-time PCR assay to determine if environmental contamination by CPV was present at this location. At the ASL, traps were also modified to capture flies in the same manner as at the PSL. Participants were instructed as to the placement of traps. Between two and four traps were hung at these surveillance locations for a minimum of two to four weeks before being evaluated. At least one fly had to be trapped at each location in order for the location to be included in the study. In order to evaluate flies at all surveillance locations, fly traps were first frozen to kill live flies. At the PSL, flies were sampled by the month in which they were captured, therefore, trapped flies from eight traps were collected at the end of each month, frozen and pooled together, to constitute a single sample. At the ASL, location was the primary basis for sampling. All flies from each ASL were collected from multiple traps. Flies frozen and pooled by location were designated as a separate sample. Flies from the PSL and ASL were counted by month (PSL) or location (ASL) and identified by fly family (Evans, 2008) . Sterile forceps were used for each sample to count and identify flies and care was taken to prevent cross contamination between samples. Flies were shipped frozen to a reference laboratory 3 where they were assayed by real-time PCR and evaluated for the presence of CPV DNA. PCR was used throughout this study to evaluate flies for CPV, similar to methods that have been used extensively to assay insect vectors for arboviruses of livestock and man (Johnson et al., 2008) .
