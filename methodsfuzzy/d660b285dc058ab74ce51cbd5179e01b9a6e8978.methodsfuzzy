The performances of DNM score is compared to other systems using machine learning algorithm ( Figure 6 ). Specifically, a popular surveillance system of flu pandemic is based on logistic regression. [24] [25] [26] It is clear from Figure 6 that given only hospitalization records, the DNM-based system performs better than a system based on logistic regression. Actually, the DNM method has natural advantage comparing with traditional machine learning algorithm in the following aspects. F I G U R E 6 The performance of DNMbased and machine-learning-based methods. It is seen that using only the hospitalization records, the DNM-based surveillance system performs better than the logistic regression. The AUC of DNM is 0.898 while that of logistic regression is 0.839. The performance comparison is carried out based on the data of Tokyo. Note that the DNM-based method generally has no overfitting problem due to the three statistic conditions of DNM without the training data, in contrast to the machine-learning-based methods that depend on the training data
