Mice, virus, and infection. 6 wk to 22 mo specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories or the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health). Pla2g2d / and Pla2g2d +/+ mice (H-2 b ) were generated as described (Miki et al., 2013) . After initial development, mice were backcrossed greater than 12 times to C57BL/6NCrSLc mice. Pla2g2d +/+ C57BL/6NCrSLc mice were used as controls for all experiments. Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) and IAV A/PR8/34 were obtained from Kanta Subbarao (National Institutes of Health) and Kevin Legge (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), respectively. For infections, mice were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane and infected i.n. with 1 × 10 4 PFU SARS-CoV or 10 3 TCID IAV in a 50 µl volume. All animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee and meet stipulations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
