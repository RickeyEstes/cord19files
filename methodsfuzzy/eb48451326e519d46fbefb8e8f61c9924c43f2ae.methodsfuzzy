Cells were infected with the F-Therien strain of rubella virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 PFU/cell. Infected Vero cells were fixed at 12, 16, 24, and 48 h.p.i. while BHK-21 cells were fixed at 24 and 48 h.p.i. since infection progresses more slowly in this cell type and fewer cells are infected. After chemical fixation in a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% tannic acid in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), the cells were processed in parallel by fast freezing followed by freeze-substitution in a mixture of acetone and osmium tetroxide before embedding in an epoxy resin (Risco et al., 2002) or conventional dehydration in acetone at 4Â°C followed by embedding in an epoxy resin (Salanueva et al., 1999) . Preservation of fine structural details is superior after freeze-substitution (Risco et al., 2002; Salanueva et al., 2003) when compared with conventional processing, which, on the other hand, provides higher contrast of intracellular membranes. Ultrathin sections (30 -40 nm) were stained following procedures for obtaining high contrast, such as using uranyl acetate in ethanol before treatment with lead citrate, as described (Risco et al., 2002) . Sections were studied in a JEOL 1200-EX II electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Electron micrographs were scanned using an Epson Perfection 2450 PHOTO scanner and Picture Publisher 8 as software.
