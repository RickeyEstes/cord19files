Female suicides were more likely to be reported as having been treated for mental illness, which actually matched the findings of the PA. The situation may be related to a stereotype in Chinese society that women are more emotional, sensitive, and fragile (Canetto, 2008) . Studies indicate women suffer more from mental illness and make more suicide attempts (Zhang and Xu, 2007) . However, because they tend to use less lethal methods, they die less often from suicide than men. It seems that the media, and perhaps also society as a whole, have blurred the facts about women's mental health and suicide attempts into a stereotype that they die from suicide more often. On the other hand, male suicides were stereotyped by the HK newspapers as being associated with unemployment and unmanageable debt, which was not supported by the PA. According to the mainstream Chinese concept, a man, as a husband or a father, is the breadwinner for the family (Birkelund and Mastekaasa, 2010) . Being unemployed or having unmanageable debt can be considered as a huge crisis for a man and his family, which may explains why the media try to provide a quick explanation to their readers of suicide among males. People who committed suicide by charcoal burning were usually stereotyped by the media as unemployed, whereas the PA found that users of this method were in fact often economically active. The stereotyping might be related to HK's socio-economic environment at the time the study data were collected. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis and economic recession both hit HK hard in 2003, culminating in the highest-ever unemployment rate recorded (8.7%) in May-July of that year (Hong Kong Information Services Department, 2004) . As the mass media want to attract a large audience, they may choose to write about suicide victims who had unmanageable debt but were also unemployed so as to reflect the general socio-economic context and encourage readers to empathize even more.
