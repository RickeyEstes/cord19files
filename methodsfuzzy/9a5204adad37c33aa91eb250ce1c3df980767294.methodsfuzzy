Crystallization and X-ray structure determination SARS-CoV M pro was produced in large quantities as described. 8, 13 Crystals belonging to monoclinic space group P2 1 were grown at pH 6.0 using the published conditions. 13 Under the same conditions, especially at slightly lower pH (5.9) and higher (up to w20%) concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000, a new tetragonal crystal form was observed, often in the same droplets where the monoclinic crystals appeared. An additional screen for improving the crystallization conditions was carried out using the "Anion Suite" of Nextal Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada) and condition no. 36 (1.2 M sodium malonate in 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.5) yielded orthorhombic crystals belonging to space group P2 1 2 1 2. These were optimized at 0.7 M sodium malonate (pH 6.6). This crystal form is similar, if not identical, to the one recently described by Hsu et al. 14 Since coordinates of the structure described by these authors are not yet available, we solved the structure of the orthorhombic crystal form as well. To some crystallization setups, inhibitors were added that had been identified in an in silico screening effort 9 and subsequently synthesized or purchased. In other cases, crystals of the free enzyme were soaked in solutions containing the inhibitor in DMSO. For several of these cases, X-ray structure analysis showed that the inhibitors had not bound to the proteinase. Therefore, the resulting multiple structures of the free enzyme were used to analyze the flexibility of the M pro . Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Joint University of Hamburg/IMB Jena/EMBL synchrotron beamline X13 at DESY, Hamburg, Germany, at a wavelength of w0.80 Ã… . Intensities were measured by a MarCCD detector and processed using the HKL suite. 24 Crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement and difference Fourier methods, using the original X-ray structure for the SARS-CoV M pro crystallized at pH 6.0 (PDB code 1UJ1 13 ) as the initial model. CNS 25 and, in later stages of refinement, REFMAC 26 were employed for X-ray structure refinement. Electron density interpretation and model building were performed using the computer graphics programs O 27 and XtalView. 28
