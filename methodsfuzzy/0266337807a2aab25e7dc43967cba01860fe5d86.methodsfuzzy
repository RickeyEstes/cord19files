Research ethics. This study obtained ethical clearance from the National Health Research Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/1735) in Tanzania. Study site. This surveillance project was targeted in Tanzania's Kilombero Valley, a rural area where agro-industrial land use associated with sugarcane production has situated a growing human population in close proximity to areas of increased wildlife biodiversity ( Figure 1 ). The Illovo Sugar Limited Estate in Kilombero is the largest sugarcane production facility in Tanzania. The estate neighbors two national parks including: Mikumi National Park and Udzungwa Falls National Park. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Illovo Sugar Limited Estate Hospital (K1) and Clinic (K2). Kilombero (population > 321,000) is situated at an elevation of 300 m above mean sea level in the Morogoro Region (population > 2 million) of South-Central Tanzania. The climate is characterized by a long rainy period (March-May) and a short rainy period (October-December). Malaria transmission intensity in this region is high. 25, 26 Study design. The objective of this hospital-based crosssectional study was to assess the type and prevalence of viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents detected among patients presenting with acute febrile illness (AFI) at Illovo K1 Hospital and K2 Clinic. In this regard, consenting patients with an axillary temperature ³ 37.5°C and symptomatic onset of £ 5 days were eligible for enrollment. In addition to the collection of biological specimens, we collected demographic, clinical, and behavioral data to further characterize our patient population. Data collection. Before enrollment, patients provided written assent for participation. Pediatric patients (1 < 15 years) also needed documented parent consent to be enrolled. Clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data were entered electronically onto tablets using an Open Data Kit (ODK) platform. Data were automatically submitted via the Internet to the cloud-based Formhub server. Clinical assessment. After screening and assent, a clinical officer or assistant medical officer then sought a detailed clinical history, followed by a physical examination. The attending officer entered all clinical data in a standardized electronic clinical case report form on the tablets using ODK Collect. Epidemiologic evaluation. After the clinical examination and consultation were complete, clinical officers then administered a comprehensive epidemiologic survey to further capture demographic and behavioral data. Patients under 15 years of age were administered in a pediatric epidemiologic survey, whereas patients 15 years of age and above were administered in an adult epidemiologic survey. These two survey questionnaires were similar in scope; however, they were tailored to include or omit certain age-specific inquiries (i.e., vaccination history for infants or occupational activities for adults). The wealth index was calculated using principal component analysis based on ownership of six household assets, including radio, bicycle, mobile phone, light source, television, and refrigerator. Sample collection and storage. Before initiation of antimicrobial therapy, blood was drawn from each enrolled participant. The venipuncture site was cleaned with an alcohol swab, followed by disinfection with povidone-iodine. A total of 15 mL of venous blood was extracted, including 10 mL of whole blood (in two 5 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] tubes) for whole blood aliquotting and 5 mL of whole blood (in one 5 mL non-EDTA plain tube) for further centrifugation and aliquotting of serum. Blood samples were then stored in liquid nitrogen (−70°C) on site before specimen transport. Subsequently, at the time of enrollment, if any adult patient was suffering from respiratory conditions (cough, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or sore throat) in addition to their febrile illness, then our laboratory technician collected both an NP/OP swab. NP/OP swabs were placed in viral transport media and stored in liquid nitrogen (−70°C) on site before specimen transport. Diagnostic investigations. All blood and NP/OP specimens collected were shipped to CDC-KEMRI laboratories in Nairobi, Kenya, for further diagnostic evaluations using a syndromic TaqMan array card (TAC) diagnostic platform for the purposes of multipathogen detection of specimens. For the purposes of this study, we used both AFI and respiratory (Resp) TAC assays to screen up to 56 potential etiologic agents of illness. Serum specimens were archived in deep freezers for future analysis. AFI TAC allows for screening of whole blood samples for the detection of 15 viruses, eight bacteria, and three protozoa in the bloodstream. 27 Total nucleic acid was extracted from 2.5 mL of whole blood specimens using High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit. MS2 and phocine herpes virus served as built-in controls to confirm success of the extraction process and amplification efficiency. We mixed 46 μL of total nucleic acid extract with AgPath One Step RT-PCR reagents (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), in a 100 μL reaction, then pipetted into the inlet port of each channel. Cards were centrifuged (1 minute, 1,200 rpm twice), sealed, and the inlet ports removed as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. All AFI TACs were run on the ViiA ™ seven real-time PCR system (Life Technologies) using PCR cycling conditions comprising 10 minutes at 50°C, 20 seconds at 95°C, followed by 45 two-step cycles of 3 seconds at 95°C and 30 seconds at 60°C. 27 Resp TAC further allows for screening of NP/OP specimens for the detection of 15 viruses and 15 bacteria known to cause respiratory illness. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 100 μL of NP/OP in MagNA Pure 96 Instrument (Roche) using MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and eluted in 100 μL of elution buffer. Fortysix microliters of total nucleic acid extract was mixed with AgPath One Step RT-PCR reagents (Life Technologies), in a 100 μL reaction, then pipetted into the inlet port of each channel. Cards were centrifuged (1 minute, 1,200 rpm twice), sealed, and the inlet ports removed as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Resp TACs were run on the ViiA seven real-time PCR system (Life Technologies) using PCR cycling conditions comprising 45°C for 10 minutes, 94°C for 10 minutes, and 45 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds followed by 60°C for 1 minute. 28 Our team captured additional laboratory testing performed by clinical staff as part of routine patient care, including malaria rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy. In this regard, clinicians administered an SD Bioline malaria Ag P.f/Pan rapid diagnostic test (Alere Inc., Waltham, MA) at point-of-care for all participants. If the patient yielded a positive rapid test result, a microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick blood film smears was performed to determine the intensity of infection. Results were scored as 0 (no parasites), 1+ (1-9 parasites/μL), 2+ (10-19 parasites/μL), 3+ (20-29 parasites/μL), or 4+ (30 or more parasites/μL). Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics was presented as medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical variables. To better interpret which agents may in fact be contributing to fever syndrome, we further investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values, which serve as proxies for microbial concentration. We examined distributions of Ct values by agent using box plots and, based upon these distributions, we calculated the overall median Ct observed among all detected agents, for comparison to agent-specific Ct median values. Furthermore, to explore potential correlation between parasite load (Ct), as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the intensity of infection, as determined by blood smear, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to examine mean Ct values for patients grouped within each level of parasite intensity (1+, 2+, 3+, or 4+).
