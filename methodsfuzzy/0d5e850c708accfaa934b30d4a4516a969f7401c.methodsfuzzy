Infections by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, Nipah virus (NiV), H5N1 virus, Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Adenovirus, Astrovirus, Norovirus (NoV) and Rotavirus (RVA) in humans and animals are detected by nucleic acid amplification tests and serologic tests. For example, a standardised method based on quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for the detection of NoV and Hep A in food has been developed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) working group (TC 275/WG6/TAG 4 -Detection of viruses in food) (Lees and CEN WG6 TAG4, 2010) and provides a tool to quantify NoV concentration in shellfish. It has been used to demonstrate that the risk of gastrointestinal illness associated with consumption of oysters increases with increasing concentrations of NoV genome copies present (Lowther et al., 2012) . Costantini et al. (2010) demonstrated that a commercially available NoV enzyme immunoassay showed excellent specificity but low sensitivity both for outbreaks as well as for samples from sporadic cases. The assay detected 18 of the 21 genotypes evaluated and that at least 10 7 virus particles g −1 of faecal sample were required for a positive signal. This assay may be useful for rapid screening of faecal samples collected during an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis. To detect and quantify HEV virus present in environmental and food samples, a RT-qPCR method was developed by Jothikumar et al. (2006) . This TaqMan assay was designed to target a conserved region in ORF3, allowing the detection of four different genotypes of HEV. A number of commercially ELISA (enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay) kits for the HEV detection of IgM and IgG antibodies which can be used early diagnosis of patients suspected for infection with HEV, for the screening of blood units and the follow-up of HEV-infected patients are also available. A Taqman ). This method, when applied to environmental samples, was able to detect rotavirus at a level 2.6 Â 10 4 and 2.6 Â 10 5 particles/ml in tap water and environmental water, respectively. A competitive RT-PCR SYBR green assay was designed based on conserved regions of the VP6 gene of group A rotaviruses, producing a 433 base pair fragment (Schwarz et al., 2002) . An in vitro synthesised RNA with a 43-base deletion with respect to the wild-type sequence of this fragment was used as an internal control. Using these transcripts as templates, 10 RNA molecules were amplified and reproducibly detected. Using this protocol, the assay could be used to investigate the presence of rotavirus in environmental, food and water samples. Immunochromatography tests are also available for detecting rotaviruses in stool samples. A study undertaken by de Grazia et al. (2017) compared the performance of two commercially available one-step chromatographic immunoassays that detect both rotavirus and adenovirus. Both tests were able to detect the wide range of RVA genotypes circulating over the study period (including G1P[8] , G2P[4] , G3, G4, G9 and G12P[8] ). The results of the present study showed a satisfactory efficacy of the two diagnostic tests analyzed using real-time PCR as a reference test. The case fatality rate for NiV is estimated to be 40%-75%. In addition, there is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals. The main tests used are real time RT-PCR from bodily fluids and antibody detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA (see "Relevant Websites section"). For example, a TaqMan assay as described by Guillaume et al. (2004) for NiV detected a wide range of virus concentrations from 1.2 Â l0 5 pfu to 1.2 pfu per reaction, corresponding to a threshold of 200 pfu/ml for rapid, accurate and quantitative diagnosis. The specificity of the NiV Taqman assay was determined by the absence of amplification using measles and Hendra Paramyxovirus RNA. An antigen capture ELISA was developed by Chiang et al. (2010) for the viral detection of Henipavirus and for the differentiation between NiV and Hendra virus. This assay allows for the rapid detection and differentiation between the Henipaviruses and could be used in any future outbreaks of Henipaviruses. Astroviruses are classified into two genera: mammalian viruses (Mamastroviruses, MAstVs) and avian viruses (Avastroviruses, AAstVs). Human astroviruses are found in four MAstV species (MAstV 1, 6, 8, 9) (Pérot et al., 2017) . An RT-PCR assay was designed by Finkbeiner et al. (2009) , based on the astrovirus RNA polymerase (ORF 1 b) that allows for the detection of the eight human astroviruses serotypes found in MAstV 1, a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. This primer set also detects viruses in MAstV 6. These two groups also contain astroviruses from cats, pigs, dogs and rabbits (Pérot et al., 2017) . To date, there is no universal pan-astrovirus RT-PCR assay. Immunochromatography (IC) tests are also available for detecting astroviruses. An IC test for the detection of astrovirus was evaluated in 44 stool samples of pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis in Japan, during January to March 2007, and it is a rapid method for the detection of astroviruses and may be useful for screening astroviruses during outbreaks of food-borne and person-to-person transmission (Khamrin et al., 2010) . A broad-spectrum PCR assay was developed by Sibley et al. (2011) for the detection of Mastadenovirus (MaAdV) and Atadenovirus (AtAdV), based on the adenovirus hexon gene. MaAdV, which comprises human and bovine adenoviruses and a large variety of mammalian adenoviruses. AtAdV includes bovine adenovirus (BadV) as well as adenovirus infecting ducks, goats, sheep, deer, and reptiles (Sibley et al., 2011) . This assay has been shown to demonstrate natural BAdV excretion in urine, BAdV detection in groundwater, and recombination in AdV of livestock origin (Sibley et al., 2011) and has the potential to be used in screening samples during outbreaks of food-borne disease. For the detection of H5N1 Influenza viruses, the World Health Organisation (WHO) (see "Relevant Websites section") provides updated information on the molecular detection/diagnostic protocols for the surveillance of influenza viruses in humans. For example, the WHO provides primers and probes sequences for real-time RT-PCR procedures for the detection of: (1) Influenza type A viruses (Matrix gene). A Taqman based assay was designed for the detection of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) by Noh et al. (2017) , based on the conserved spike S2 region of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs. This assay can detect SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans but also several bat CoVs that are closely related to these viruses in bats. A monoclonal antibody-based capture enzyme immunoassay for the detection of nucleocapsid antigen in sera from patients with SARS was developed by Che et al. (2004) . This assay used a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies for capture and rabbit polyclonal antibodies for detection of serum antigen. The sensitivity of the assay was 84.6% in 13 serologically confirmed SARS patients with blood taken during the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms (11 of 13). The specificity of the assay was 98.5% in 1272 healthy individuals (1253 of 1272). There was no cross-reaction with other human and animal coronaviruses in this assay.
