All the computations, including selection of the spectra wavebands, mathematical pretreatment, principal component analysis and partial least squares regression, were performed using TQ analyst software package (Version 8.0, Thermo Scientific, Madison, USA), The Unscrambler (Version 10.1, Camo Inc., Trondheim, Norway), and MatLab (Version 7.13, MathWorks, USA). In view of both linear and nonlinear relationships between the spectral data and the reference values of TOC and SSC that coexisted, three regression methods were adopted to establish the calibration models, including linear PLS models, non-linear PLS models and the concentration weighted PLS models. Table 2 lists the RMSEC, RMSECV, RMSEP, and related Rs for all the calibration models of TOC and SSC, from which it would be easy to see that the three PLS methods provide similar results. Detail computing formula of above mentioned parameters can be found in Ref. [16] . It is well known that, during the PLS calibration, the most important issues are the selection of wavebands, spectra pretreated method and the determination of the most suitable latent variable (LV) numbers. Therefore the optimization methods are discussed in the next sections.
