Cell cultures were harvested 18-22 h after infection, when all the cells showed a characteristic cytopathic effect (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Intracellular virus was released by subjecting the cultures to three freezing and thawing cycles. This was followed by low-speed centrifugation at 4000 Xg for 30 min to remove coarse cell debris. The virus was then pelleted from supernatant fluid by high-speed centrifugation at 105 000Xg (maximum) at 4°C for 2 h, the resulting pellet resuspended overnight in 1% of the original volume of TNE (20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM EDTA), layered on top of a 10-50% (w/w) continuous sucrose density gradient prepared in TNE and immediately centrifuged for 16 h at 85 000Xg (maximum) at 4°C. Gradients were then fractionated with a Gilson 201 fraction collector (Gilson, Villiersle-Bel, France ). Each fraction was tested for its ELISA activity by diluting it 1 : 100 in coating buffer (50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and coating overnight at 4 ° C onto wells of microtiter plates. ELISA was carried out as described below. All the fractions leading to a distinct reaction with a PEDV reference serum when tested in ELISA were pooled, diluted 1:3 in TNE and pelleted at 105 000 Xg (maximum) for 2 h. The resulting pellets were then suspended in TNE and stored at -20 ° C. Fractions of the gradient showing a high reaction in ELISA were examined using electron microscopy. Cell cultures were harvested and virus was pelleted as described above. The pelleted virus was suspended in TNE to 5% of the original volume, used to fill a SW28 centrifuge tube, followed by underlayering two cushions of 12 ml 20% (w/w) and 8 ml 45% (w/w) sucrose solutions, prepared in TNE. The tubes were centrifuged at 146 000xg (maximum) for 16 h in a Beckmann SW28 rotor. The resulting band between the two sucrose concentrations was collected with a syringe and used as ELISA antigen without further processing. Harvesting of the cell cultures and virus pelleting were carried out in the same way as in Methods i and ii. The virus pellet was suspended in TNE containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP40, Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland) in 2% of the original volume. After standing at room temperature for 1 h, the detergentsolubilized virus was centrifuged at 10 000 Xg for 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was then layered on top of a 20-40% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient prepared in TNE containing 0.1% NP40 and the gradients centrifuged for 16 h at 280 000 Xg (maximum) in a Beckmann SW40 rotor. After sedimentation, the gradients were fractionated and each fraction was tested for its ELISA activity as described in Method i. PEDV antigencontaining fractions were pooled and subsequently dialyzed against TNE overnight at 4 o C. The dialyzed preparations were stored at -20 °C until further use. Mock-infected cell cultures serving as controls in the ELISA were always processed in the same way as virus-containing fluids. Two main criteria were used to compare the three different antigen preparations. First, the maximum extinction (z1OD) reached when assayed with anti-PEDV reference serum was detected. Second, the maximum working dilution leading to a/rOD of 1.5-2.0 when assayed with anti-PEDV reference serum diluted 1 : 40 was determined. The maximum amount of antigen which may be bound to ELISA plates, and consequently the sensitivity of the ELISA, depend on the absolute and relative content of the antigen in the coating buffer. High amounts of cellular proteins compete with the viral antigen for binding sites on the well wall even if the viral antigen is present in high concentrations. The three methods tested to purify ELISA antigen yielded preparations with different activities. When individual fractions prepared from a linear sucrose gradient were used to coat the plates, PEDV antigens could be detected over a wide range of the gradient resulting in ELISA reactions comparable with those of the virus band which could be clearly identified in the gradient [Fractions 5-8, at ~ 40% (w/ w) sucrose concentration and corresponding to a density of 1.18] (Fig. 1) . When examined by electron microscopy, PEDV particles in the virus band had lost most or all of their spikes (Fig. 2 ) . Coating virus band Fractions 5-8 alone resulted in an ELISA activity of AOD 2.4, but the antigen could not be diluted higher than 1 : 20. In contrast, Fractions 10-16 contained numerous morphologically irregular vesicles and membrane fragments covered by 15-nm long club-shaped projections typical of coronavirus spikes (Fig. 3 ) . No such projections were ever detected in the corresponding fractions of control preparations. The maximum AOD of Fractions 10-16 was 1.5. Pooling Fractions 5-16 of the linear sucrose gradient resulted in an ELISA activity of AOD of 1.9 and the maximum working dilution of the antigen was 1" 100. Antigen purified by centrifugation through 20 and 45% (w/w) sucrose cushions contained approximately the same amount of PEDV proteins (AOD 2.2 ) as the pooled Fractions 5-16 of the linear sucrose gradient (~OD 1.9), but was suspended in a small volume of sucrose solution and could therefore be used further without an additional pelleting step to remove the sucrose. The maximum working dilution of the antigen was 1 : 150. When NP40-solubilized antigen was used, no ELISA reaction was detected at low dilutions. Only with dilutions > 1:150 was an extinction of •OD 0.9 reached. Electron microscopy revealed that spike proteins (density 1.12, Sturman et al., 1980) were the only structural components of the virus which could be found in the gradient. The nucleoprotein was pelleted through the gradient (density 1.28, Sturman et al., 1980) and the matrix protein (density 1.06, Sturman et al., 1980) floated on top of the gradient, where the concentration of NP40 was so high that no protein could be coated onto the ELISA plates. Although a weak background reaction was observed, the concentration of PEDV-specific proteins was too low to induce a satisfactory ELISA reaction. Hence Method ii, purifying the virus through sucrose cushions of 20 and 45% (w/w), proved to be the most suitable procedure to provide PEDV antigen for the ELISA. The optimum working dilution of the antigen prepared by Method ii was defined as the highest possible dilution leading to a AOD of 1.5-2.0. Under these conditions, antigen preparations could be diluted 1 : 100-1 : 200.
