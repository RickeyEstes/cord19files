An anonymous, self-administered survey was conducted in November 2009 over 1 month. All HCWs of the 9 primary care clinics in the central and western parts of Singapore were invited to participate. The cover note on the questionnaire explained the purpose of the survey and invited participation. The questionnaire was distributed by the clinic Infection Control Nurses (ICNs) stationed at each of the 9 clinics to all HCWs in each clinic. Mandarin and Malay versions of the questionnaire were available on request. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously and drop them in the box provided in their respective clinics. The ICNs collected the completed questionnaires and returned to the research team for data entry and analysis. The research team developed the questionnaire and pilot tested among ten colleagues. In addition to demographic characteristics, participants were asked if they have any of the following chronic conditions (asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol/lipids, stroke, heart disease, cancer and chronic renal disease). Participants were also asked their perceptions towards pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines and willingness to accept these vaccines if both were readily available. They were asked to indicate reasons if they did not receive the seasonal influenza vaccination in the last 2 years or chose not to be vaccinated against H1N1. All participants were asked if they needed additional information to make a decision to accept H1N1 vaccination. Incomplete questionnaires (<90% complete) and those without any response to the designation and chronic medical history sections were excluded from this analysis. We also excluded the respondents who did not answer these 3 questions: (1) Did you receive the influenza vaccination in the last 2 years? (2) Would you be going for the influenza vaccination this year? and (3) If vaccination against H1N1 is made available, would you go for it? The respondents were divided into 4 groups of HCWs. Doctors and dentists were grouped under "Medical"; nurses and dental assistants under "Nursing"; dieticians, pharmacists, radiographers, laboratory technicians, psychologists and social workers under "Allied Health"; clinic support and operations workers including the outsourced contract workers were under "Operations". We compared willingness to accept the H1N1 vaccination among respondents with and without chronic conditions. Among those who refused to accept vaccination, we analysed their reasons for refusal to be vaccinated by the 4 groups. Data was analysed using PASW (version 18.0). Significance testing of proportions was carried out using Chi-square test, where a probability (p) of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Multivariate logistic regression was used to study the factors predicting the "willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccine". This study was approved by the Institution Ethics Review Board and granted a waiver of informed consent.
