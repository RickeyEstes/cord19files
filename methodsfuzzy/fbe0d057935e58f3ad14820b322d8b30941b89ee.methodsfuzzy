Most current studies which estimate the extent of sterilization can be classified into three groups. The first group assumes that capital flows are exogenously determined and typically estimate sterilization coefficients by running simple OLS on the monetary reaction function such as the one below: where DNDA t and DNFA t represent the change in net domestic assets (a proxy for domestic money creation) and net foreign assets (a proxy for international reserves), respectively, and X represents other explanatory variables that might influence a monetary authority's reaction. The coefficient of c 1 ¼ À1 represents full monetary sterilization, while c 1 ¼ 0 implies no sterilization. In some instances (such as Burdekin and Siklos, 2005) , DMB t or DM2 t is used instead of DNDA t . If this is the case then c 1 ¼ 0 represents full sterilization since a rise of international reserves does not affect the monetary base (or broad money). The second group uses a VAR model to estimate the lagged effects of NDAs and NFAs. The standard form of a VAR model is as follows: Some papers within this group include additional variables in the model such as the domestic interest rate, price level, or exchange rate (for instance, see Cavoli and Rajan, 2006; Christensen, 2004; He et al., 2005; Moreno, 1996) . 16 The advantage of a VAR approach is that it allows one to trace out the time path of the various shocks on the variables contained in the VAR system (i.e. the impulse response function). If a shock from foreign assets (say an unexpected increase in foreign assets) is associated with an offsetting decrease in domestic money creation, it can be concluded that the sterilization is significant. An important limitation of the VAR approach is that it tends to treat all variables as symmetrically endogenous. As equations (2a) and (2b) show, a standard form of the VAR model only yields the estimated values of lagged NDAs and NFAs due to the issue of identification. Consequently, the model cannot estimate the contemporary effect of variables without restrictions. The third group of studies -including this paper -estimates the contemporaneous relationship between NDAs and NFAs using a set of simultaneous equations. Although the studies in the first group ignore the simultaneous bias by assuming capital flows are exogenously determined (see Kwack, 2001) , it is important to note that domestic monetary conditions are affected by changes in international capital flows and foreign reserves. Concurrently, international capital flows respond to a change in domestic monetary conditions (e.g. higher domestic interest rates would, ceteris paribus, lead to greater 16 Takagi and Esaka (1999) argue that it is inappropriate to use this approach to measure the effectiveness of sterilization given the variety policy instruments used in sterilization in addition to OMOs. Consequently, the authors use the change of DM1 t (orDM2t ) rather thanDNDAt ; full sterilization is said to exist if an unexpected increase in foreign assets is not associated with a corresponding increase in overall money supply. capital inflows). 17 Some early studies, such as Argy and Kouri (1974) and Herring and Marston (1977) , have suggested using a simultaneous system to overcome the problem of simultaneity. The typical model specification for a set of simultaneous equations is: where X 1 and X 2 are the vectors of controls in the balance of payment function and monetary reaction function, respectively. Eqs. (3a) and (3b) are the balance of payments and the monetary reaction functions, respectively. The former estimates the ''offset coefficient''. The expected value of the offset coefficient is bound by 0 in the event of no capital mobility and À1 in the event of perfect capital mobility. 18 The latter measures the sterilization coefficient. The expected value of the sterilization coefficient is À1 if reserve buildup is perfectly sterilized and 0 if the central bank does not sterilize at all. In general, the greater the degree of capital mobility, the less effective is monetary sterilization; a small offset coefficient and a large sterilization coefficient generally imply that the central bank has a fairly high degree of monetary policy independence to neutralize the impact of capital flows effectively on a sustained basis.
