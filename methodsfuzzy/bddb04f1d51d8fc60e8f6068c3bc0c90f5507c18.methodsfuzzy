A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of 400 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit of a community-based hospital in Southwestern Ontario. The reviewed charts were randomly selected and divided into two equal groups of 200 each, representing the three months that immediately preceded the SARS (i.e., pre-SARS) and the three months of the SARS outbreak (March 15-June 15, 2003) . Infection control practises/strategies during these two periods are outlined in Appendix A. This sample of 400 charts was deemed sufficient to detect an absolute risk reduction of 10% in the risk of developing HAIs during the SARS period, using an alpha of 0.05 and assuming 80% power. The inclusion criteria for the study required that patients be free from pre-existing HAIs upon ICU admission and that they had an ICU length of stay of 48 hours or greater. A patient was considered a positive HAI case if he/she had a confirmed diagnosis of infection (types are outlined in Table 1 ) that did not exist at the time of ICU admission. Diagnoses of HAI's at the time of admission of our sample were made according to the CDC criteria for the definition of HAIs as outlined in Garner et al. (1988) . For the purpose of statistical adjustment for potential confounding relationships, data were also collected on other commonly reported risk factors of HAI (Table 2 ).
