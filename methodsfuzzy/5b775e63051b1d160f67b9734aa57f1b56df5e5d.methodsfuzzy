Samples were collected opportunistically from conservation rangers and researchers in addition to hunters and other members of the public who trapped or shot the animals as part of their normal pest control procedures. Samples were taken from a range of locations and habitats in South Island, New Zealand, between January and June 2001. Blood and tissue samples were extracted as soon as possible after death. A range of tissues was collected and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, mesenteric lymph node, thymus, spleen, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and colon. Extraction and fixation of samples was undertaken by field personnel and whole animals were not available for inspection of gross pathology or of age-structure. A haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained section was prepared from each tissue and was examined by light microscopy for pathological change. Where HE stains clearly indicated the presence of an infectious agent, a panel of further stains (Gram, periodic acid-Schiff and Ziehl-Neelsen), was conducted in order to provide further diagnostic information. All examinations were conducted by a Board-certified veterinary pathologist (MJD). Sera were screened with immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using viruses grown in various cell lines using standard laboratory protocols. lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) IFA slides were purchased from Charles River Diagnostics (18-well slides, SL-012) and the assay was performed as per manufacturers' protocol except that bound antibodies were detected using a goat anti-ferret immunoglobulin G fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I conjugate (IgG-FITC, Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) used at a 1/20 dilution. All other viral IFA antigens were produced in-house. Briefly, each virus was grown to a standardised titre in a suitable cell line (see below) in a 96-well microtitre plate, and was then fixed by the addition of 70% alcohol to each well. Prior to use, wells were washed and rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Each serum sample was diluted to 1 in 20 and 1 in 40 in PBS and tested in duplicate: 30 lL of serum dilutions were added to each well and incubated for 1-12 h (depending on the assay) at 37°C in a moist atmosphere. Identical dilutions of a positive control serum standard (though not from a stoat) and a negative control serum standard were also included on each plate tested. After repeat washing with PBS, 30 lL of the anti-ferret IgG-FITC conjugate (see above), diluted 1 in 20, was added to each well and plates were reincubated at 37°C for 1 h in a moist atmosphere. Wells were then rinsed repeatedly in PBS, then loaded with 30 lL of glycerol for examination under suitable epifluorescence at 1000· magnification. Results (positive fluorescence) were assigned to each sample by reference to the positive and negative control standards. Viruses for use in the IFAs described above were grown in the following cell lines: canine distemper virus (morbillivirus) and cowpox (orthopoxvirus) -Vero cells, canine parvovirus-2 and canine coronavirus -A72 cells, feline calicivirus -Feline embryo (FEA) cells, canine adenoviruses I and II and canine herpesvirus -Madin Derby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.
