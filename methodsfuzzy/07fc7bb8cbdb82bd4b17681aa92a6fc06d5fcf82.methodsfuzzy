Cells and viruses. Seventeen clone one (17Cl-1) mouse fibroblast cells [60] were cultured at 37 8C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 lg/ml). Sac(À) cells [61] were cultured at 37 8C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 lg/ml). The A59 strain of MHV and a set of ts mutants derived from MHV-A59 (Alb prefix) were originally obtained from the laboratory of L. Sturman, Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research, Albany, New York, United States [40] . Mutants prefixed with LA (Los Angeles) and NC (North Carolina) were obtained from M. Schaad and R. Baric, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States and have been initially characterized [39] . Mutants prefixed with Ut (Utrecht) were obtained from W. Spaan, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands and have been initially characterized [41] . The LA, NC, and Ut ts mutants were derived from different but related lineages of the Albany isolate of MHV-A59. Mutants prefixed with Wü (Wü rzburg, Germany) were isolated as described below. For our studies, virus stocks were derived from the original mutant isolates after plaque purification and propagation in 17Cl-1 cells cultured at 30 8C or 33 8C in low pH DMEM (pH 6.4) containing 6% FBS, 5% TPB, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 lg/ml) [24] . Revertants were picked from plaques of mutants titered at 39.5 8C, followed by another plaque purification at 39.5 8C. The virus stocks used were first passage and were obtained by using virus from a single plaque (;10 7 pfu) to infect a dish of ;4 3 10 7 17Cl-1 cells to yield 30 ml of stock virus with a titer of 1-6 3 10 9 pfu/ml. Isolation of Wü ts mutants. Sac(À) cells were infected with 10 pfu/ cell of MHV-A59 (originally obtained from P. Carthew, Medical Research Council Laboratories, Carshalton, United Kingdom), and incubated for 15 h at 37 8C in medium containing 150 lg/ml of 5fluorouracil. This concentration of pyrimidine analogue was determined to inhibit virus replication by 80%. The mutagenized virus stock was diluted to 15 pfu/ml in medium and 100 ll aliquots were incubated with 10 4 Sac(À) cells at 30 8C for 48 h. The supernatant was taken from cultures that displayed syncytium formation and used to infect duplicate cultures of 10 4 Sac(À) cells that were incubated at 30 8C or 39.5 8C for 24 h. The supernatant was taken from replica cultures that developed cytopathic effect at 30 8C but not at 39.5 8C, and potential ts mutants were isolated by two plaque purifications. Sequence analysis of the Wü rzburg strain of MHV-A59 suggests that approximately 8,000 nucleotides at the 59 end of the genome have been exchanged by recombination with a related but different MHV strain (unpublished data). Characterization of mutant stocks for titer and EOP. 17Cl-1 cells in 60 mm petri dishes were infected with 0.5 ml of 10-fold dilutions of Figure 7 . A Model to Describe the Pathway for Viral RNA Synthesis in MHV-A59-Infected Cells Shows a working model that describes a pathway for viral RNA synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells. The model proposes that the replicasetranscriptase complex forms initially and creates a negative-strand template. It is then converted to utilize the negative strand as a template for positive-strand synthesis and, finally, the complex is inactivated by the degradation of negative-strand templates. It is also proposed that proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins plays a role in regulation of this pathway. Also depicted are the putative defects of specific MHV-A59 ts mutants. It remains to be shown whether or not the group IV and VI mutants (Wü ts38, Alb ts17, Wü ts18, and Wü ts36) are defective in negative-strand RNA synthesis at the non-permissive temperature. DOI: 10 6.6] ). The inoculum was removed after 30 min and the cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 6% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 lg/ml), and 0.1% Gelritee gellan gum (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) and incubated at the appropriate temperature in 7.5% CO 2 . After incubation for 3 or 4 d at 30 8C or 2 d at 37 8C or 39.5 8C, cells were rinsed with 0.15 M NaCl, fixed with methanol, and stained with a solution of 0.2% toluidine blue, 0.2% azure blue, and 1% boric acid. The EOP was calculated by dividing titers at 39.5 8C by the titer at 30 8C. We found that all of the ts mutants produced the same titer at 30 8C as at 33 8C and in all cases 6 39 8C was non-permissive for plaque formation of the ts mutants. Complementation analysis. Classic or genetic complementation was done by infecting 17Cl-1cells in 35 mm petri dishes either singly with each mutant or doubly with two mutants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20-30 pfu/cell. After incubation at room temperature or 30 8C for 30 min, the virus inoculum was removed and the infected cells were rinsed with HBSS and re-fed with low pH DMEM or DMEM supplemented with 6% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100g/ml). The infected cells were incubated at 39.5 8C or 40 8C in 10% CO 2 . One hour later the cells were rinsed again and re-fed with warmed medium and the dishes returned to the incubator until 8 hpi. The medium was harvested, clarified at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays at 30 8C. CIs were calculated using the following formula: A CI greater than two between mutant pairs was consistent with complementation, i.e., 6 4-fold difference above background, while a CI less than two was negative for complementation [43] . Biochemical complementation was done by mock-infecting or infecting 17Cl-1cells at 30 pfu/cell with MHV-A59, or one of the ts mutants, or with a mix of 15 pfu/cell each of two ts mutants. After the adsorption period at room temperature for 30 min, the virus inoculum was removed, 1 ml of prewarmed medium containing dactinomycin and 3 H-uridine (1.85 MBq/ml) was added and the cells were incubated at 40 8C. The wt and the ts mutant-infected cells were harvested at 8 hpi and the 3 H-uridine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitated RNA was determined. Viral RNA synthesis. Viral RNA synthesis was measured by determining the amount of 3 H-uridine incorporated in the presence of dactinomycin (20 lg/ml) into acid-precipitable material. [5-3 H] uridine (!1.0 TBq/mmol) was added to the medium at either 1.85 or 7.4 MBq/ml. After incubation, the radioactive medium was removed and the cells dissolved with 5% lithium dodecyl sulfate and 200 lg/ml proteinase K in LEH buffer (0.1 M LiCl, 0.001 M EDTA, 0.01 M HEPES, [pH 6.6]) at 2-5 3 10 5 cells per ml. The DNA was sheared by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml tuberculin syringe. Triplicate samples of 5 3 10 4 cells were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and the precipitates collected on glass fiber filters (Whatman Incorporated, Clifton, New Jersey, United States), dried under a heat lamp, and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. To measure negative-strand synthesis, the dissolved cells were extracted with low pH phenol (pH 4.3), which removed DNA from the aqueous phase, and then with cholorofom:isoamyl alcohol (95:5), and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. RF RNA was generated by treatment of the RNA with RNase T1 (1U/ug RNA, 30 8C for 30 min in 0.3 M NaCl) and collected by chromatography on CF-11 cellulose and ethanol precipitation. The incorporation of 3 H-uridine into negative strands was measured by denaturing the RF RNA with heat and annealing in the presence of .100-fold excess of unlabeled RNA obtained from purified virions of MHV [24] . Isolation of viral RNA. Two different procedures were used to obtain viral RNA for RT-PCR and sequencing. Virions were purified from ;3 3 10 8 17Cl-1 cells that had been infected at a MOI of ;10 pfu/cell and incubated in low pH DMEM at 30-33 8C. The medium from the infected cells (;225 ml) was collected at 24 hpi and clarified at 4,000 rpm for 30 min. The virions were pelleted by centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 8C. The virus pellet was allowed to suspend overnight on ice in 0.4 ml/tube of 0.15M NaCl and 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.6). The suspended virus from six tubes was pooled and layered over one SW28 tube containing a linear gradient of 40% potassium tartrate (bottom) and 20% glycerol (top), in 0.0.2 M HEPES (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 3-4 h at 4 8C, the visible band containing the virions was collected, diluted, and pelleted by centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 8C. The pelleted virions were suspended in 0.15M NaCl and 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.6), and LiDS and proteinase K were added to 5% and 400 lg/ml, respectively, After incubation at 42 8C for 10 min, the viral RNA was extracted with phenol followed by chloroform:isoamylalcohol (19:1). Viral RNA was ethanol-precipitated and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in water. Alternatively, 10 7 17Cl-1 cells were infected with virus, incubated for 13 h at 30 8C to 33 8C in 7.5% CO 2 . The poly(A)-containing RNA was then isolated from the infected cells using oligo-dT 25 Dynabeads as described previously [62] . RT-PCR and sequencing. The entire replicase gene-coding region (ORF1a and ORF1b) was sequenced for eight ts mutant and revertant pairs. To do this, we used a set of 121 synthetic oligonucleotides that are complementary to sequences spaced at approximately 350 nucleotide intervals along the positive-and negative-strand copies of the viral RNA (sequences available on request). Five oligonucleotides, P17, P31, P46, P61, and P65, were used to prime the RT of viral RNA with Superscript II RT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). The reaction mix (20 ll), which contained, in addition to presupplied buffer, 35 ng of primer, 10-100 ng of viral RNA, 1 mM dNTPs, 10 mM DTT, 25 U of RNAguard (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and 200 U of reverse transcriptase, was incubated at 42 8C for 60 min and then at 94 8C for 2 min. The five cDNA templates were then amplified using eight primer pairs, P1/P16, P2/ P22, P3/P30, P4/P38, P5/P45, P6/P53, P7/P60, and P8/P64, and thermostable, recombinant Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction mix (100 ll), which contained, in addition to pre-supplied buffer, 70 ng of primer pair, 1 ll of RT reaction product, 200 lM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 2.5 U of DNA polymerase, was incubated at 94 8C for 1 min, then 94 8C for 20 s, 50 8C for 20 s, 68 8C for 3 min, for a total of 35 cycles and a final 10-min extension at 68 8C. The PCR reaction products were purified by ethanol precipitation using ammonium acetate. Finally, sequence analysis was done using primers P1-P121 and standard cycle sequencing methods. Sequencing reaction mixes (10 ll), which contained 70 ng of primer, 100 ng of PCR product, and 3 ll of cycle sequencing mix (BigDye Terminator v.3.1, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States), were incubated at 96 8C for 10 s, 50 8C for 5 s, and 60 8C for 4 min, for a total of 25 cycles. The reaction products were purified by retention on a size exclusion membrane (Montagee SEQ 96 , Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) as described by the manufacturer; eluted and analyzed with an ABI 310 Prism Genetic Analyzer. Computer-assisted analysis of sequence data was done using the Lasergene biocomputing software (DNASTAR). Figure S1 . Plaque Morphology of Alb ts17 Revertants The plaque morphologies of Alb ts17 L and Alb ts17 S are illustrated. Alb ts17 had a reversion (back mutation) frequency of 2 3 10 À6 and there was a mixture of large and small plaques at 40 8C. The virus from the small and large plaques produced progeny that formed uniformly small or large plaques at 40 8C, respectively. At 30 8C, both 17R L and 17R S produced plaques of equal diameter and Alb 17R L produced the same size plaques at 40 8C as the parental or wt MHV-A59.
