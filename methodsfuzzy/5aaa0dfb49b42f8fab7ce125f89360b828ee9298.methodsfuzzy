Cell Culture. HepaRG (Biopredic), HepAD38 (kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Seeger at Fox Chase Cancer Center), and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) (Phoenixbio) were cultured as described previously. 23 HBV Preparation and Infection. The HBV used in this study was mainly derived from the culture supernatant of HepAD38 cells. HBV infection was performed as described previously. 23 More detailed procedures are given in the Supporting Information. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Southern Blot Analysis, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)22,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assays, and Reporter Assays. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis, realtime PCR, southern blot analysis, MTT assays, and reporter assays were performed essentially as described. 23 More detailed procedures are given in the Supporting Information. Detection of HBs and HBe Antigens. HBs antigen was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously. 23 HBe antigen was detected by a Chemiluminescent Immuno-Assay (Mitsubishi Chemical Medience). HCV Pseudoparticle Assay. The HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), which reproduce HCV envelopemediated entry, were generated by transfecting the expression plasmids for MLV Gag-Pol, HCV E1E2, and a luciferase that can be packaged into the virion (kindly provided by Dr. Francois-Loic Cosset at the University of Lyon) into 293T cells. HCVpp recovered from the culture supernatant of transfected cells were used in a HCV entry assay as described previously. 24 Transporter Assay. The transporter activity of NTCP was assayed essentially as described 25 using 293 (Sekisui Medical) and HepG2 cells permanently overexpressing human NTCP. Briefly, the cells were preincubated with compounds at 37 C for 15 minutes and then incubated with radiolabeled substrate, [ 3 H]taurocholic acid (TCA), at 37 C for 5 minutes to allow substrate uptake into the cells. The cells were then washed and lysed to measure the accumulated radioactivity. In this assay, we did not observe cytotoxic effects of compounds at any of the concentrations tested. More detailed procedures are given in the Supporting Information. AlphaScreen Assay. Recombinant NTCP and HBs proteins, which were tagged with 6xHis and biotin, respectively, were synthesized using a wheat cell-free protein system as described previously. 26 Protein-protein interactions were detected using the AlphaScreen IgG (ProteinA) detection kit (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the recombinant tagged proteins were incubated with streptavidin-coated donor beads and anti-6xHis antibody-conjugated acceptor beads that generate a luminescence signal when brought into proximity by binding to interacting proteins. Luminescence was analyzed with the AlphaScreen detection program of an Envision spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). More detailed procedures for the AlphaScreen assay are described in the Supporting Information. Additional experimental procedures are included in the Supporting Information.
