From April 2006 through November 2006, 182 patients with a primary diagnosis of breast, prostate, or lung cancer were prospectively accrued to this institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol examining patient preferences for the radiation oncologist (IRB no. 0601098). This study used a survey instrument consisting of 10 questions focusing on certain aspects of the patient-radiation oncologist interaction, such as the professional image of the radiation oncologist, communication with the radiation oncologist, and physical and emotional behavior between the patient and the radiation oncologist (Appendix). The survey was developed by the authors and was then tested, critiqued, and modified on the basis of a sample focus group of breast, lung, and prostate cancer patients under a separate IRB-approved study (IRB no. 0512075). The focus groups established the content validity (relevance and coverage) of the items. The final survey was administered at three time points: before the initial consultation, midway through treatment, and at the end of treatment. After subjects answered the questionnaire at the time of initial consultation, the subject was then randomized to either an experimental or control group. In the experimental group, the radiation oncologist participants read their patient's responses to this questionnaire before their initial consultation and tried to adapt to the subject's (patient's) preferences. In the control group, the radiation oncologist participant was blind to the results of their patient's questionnaire. At the end of treatment the patients completed a satisfaction survey, which was a modified version of an established, validated instrument currently being used at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute to assess patient/subject satisfaction. The radiation oncologist participant did not have access to the patient satisfaction survey. For this report, data from only the first time point (before consultation with the radiation oncologist) for both arms were analyzed. Eligibility of patients was determined according to disease site, including age >18 years with lung, breast, or prostate malignancies, referred for radiation oncology consultation at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. This integrated cancer network comprised 14 eligible University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Center radiotherapy locations across western Pennsylvania. To effectively capture patient responses across all cancer centers, a Web-based collection tool was designed to be used from randomization upon patient first consult until the final preference study was entered. The Web-based tool stored into a relational database the randomization of the patients, the patient preferences at baseline, midpoint, and final treatment stages, and the satisfaction survey results after treatment. Descriptive analyses were performed for the 182 patients with completed baseline surveys. For all items, survey responses (categorized as agree, neutral, or disagree) were cross-tabulated by patient characteristics (gender, age, education, and cancer site). The association of survey responses by cancer site was tested with chi-squared tests. When necessary because of small cells, responses neutral and disagree were combined. For three survey items (6, 7, and 9) comparisons were not possible because patients uniformly endorsed agreement. For Item 5 further comparisons were performed to explore correlations with gender, age, educational status, and cancer site.
