All procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), under protocol number 5699170915. 2.1. IgY production, extraction and purification 2.1.1. The antigen Trypomastigotes forms of T. cruzi (strain Y) was used as antigen to immunize the chickens, according the method described by Sampaio et al. (2014b) , with some adaptations for T. cruzi, as follows below: cryopreserved trypomastigotes were inoculated into mice for reactivation and multiplication of strain, and blood samples were collected at the peak of parasitemia. In order to separate the parasites, blood was diluted in DMEM medium (1:1 v/v), followed by centrifugation (400 g for 10 min). The supernatant, rich of trypomastigotes, was collected and the amount of antigen was determined, aliquoted, and cryopreserved until use.
