We studied patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from January 20 to February 25, 2020 at the isolation ward of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Union Hospital is sentinel general hospital located in the endemic areas of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and is designated by the government for the treatments of COVID-19 infection. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong .

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Verbal consent was obtained from patients before the enrollment. Diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in this study were diagnosed according to the WHO interim guideline [9] . Throat swab sample of the patients was collected and COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assay using a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd) [10] . The clinical classification according to the coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 5) developed by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, and those meet any of the followings were diagnosed as severe case: (1) respiratory distress, respiratory rate per min≥30; (2) in the resting state, means oxygen saturation≤93%; (3) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration≤300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). (4) other conditions such as older than 60 years, with complication of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, cancer, pulmonary heart disease, structural lung disease and immunosuppressed individuals. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, clinical parameters, laboratory indexes and chest computed tomographic (CT) scan findings were extracted from electronic medical records. The vital signs of the patients (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation [SpO2]) were monitored daily; The blood tests (complete blood count, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, Inflammatory factors and lactate dehydrogenase) were examined every 3 days; The chest CT scan was performed every 7-10 days. Assessment criteria of this study was the dynamic changes of the indexes mentioned above. The Statistical Packages for Social Sciences, version 19.0 (SPSS) were used for data analysis with P < 0.05 as the criterion for significance. Continuous variables were reported as means and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile range (IQR) values. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages. Continuous variables were compared using Student's ttests, Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests. .
