Protein Production. SosV-RBP (GenBank accession no. NC_025343.1) cDNA was synthesized by GeneArt LTD. SosV-RBP (residues 125−582) was cloned into the pURD vector alongside a 3C protease cleavable N-terminal SUMO tag and hexahistidine tag (79) and used to generate a stable HEK293T cell line (80) . When required for crystallization, upscaling of stably expressing cells was performed in the presence of kifunensine (81) . All proteins were purified using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) and subsequently N-linked glycans were cleaved at the di-N-acetylchitebiose core using endoglycosidase F1 (EndoF1) (10 μg/mg protein, 12 h, 21°C). Sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, buffer using a Superdex 200 10/30 column was performed. When required for crystallography, N-terminal SUMO tag and hexahistidine tag cleavage was performed (1:10 molar ratio of protein to 3C protease, 12 h, 21°C), prior to IMAC (to separate tag from cleaved protein) and SEC. Crystallization and Structure Determination. SosV-RBP crystals were grown using nanoliter-scale sitting-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature, using 100 nL of protein and 100 nL of reservoir (82) . Crystals grew after 25 d in a precipitant containing 0.2 M magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 20% PEG 8000. Crystals were immersed in 20% glycerol prior to cryo-cooling by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Data collection was performed at wavelength 0.9795 Å at beamline I04, Diamond Light Source (DLS), United Kingdom. Images were integrated and scaled using the XIA2 pipeline (83) . SosV-RBP was solved with MuV-HN (PDB ID code 5B2C) as the search model (43) , using Phaser within the PHENIX suit (84, 85) . Model building and structure refinement were iteratively performed with COOT and Phenix.Refine, respectively (86, 87) . Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were employed throughout, and Translationlibration-screw parameters were employed for later rounds of refinement. Structures were validated with Molprobity (88) . Crystallographic data processing and refinement statistics are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of SosV-RBP were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), PDB code 6SG8 (89) . Hemadsorption Assay. The hemadsorption method to determine sialic acid binding was adapted from that developed by Morrison and McGinnes (47) . Briefly, full-length SosV-RBP (residues 1−582) and NDV-RBP (residues 1−577, GenBank accession no. AF212323.1) were cloned into the pHLsec vector with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (90) , and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher, product no. 11668030) into HEK 293T cells. HEK 293T cell monolayers were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (with MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 ), 24 h following transfection, prior to incubation with 2% sheep blood (Thermo Scientific Oxoid, 12967755) at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were gently washed to remove unadsorbed erythrocytes, prior to lysing absorbed erythrocytes using 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a CLARIOStar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Neuraminidase Assay. Neuraminidase activity was determined through hydrolysis of the substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MU-Neu5Ac; Sigma-Aldrich, product no. M8639), as described previously (38, 48) . The full-length SosV-RBP and NDV-RBP constructs presented above were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 into HEK 293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK 293T monolayers were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, counted and seeded in a 96-well black nontransparent plate at a density of 25,000 cells per mL. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, and supernatant was replaced with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 6.0 containing 1 mM MU-Neu5Ac. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C prior to addition of 0.25 M glycine buffer, pH 10.7 to stop the reaction. The amount of free 4-methylumbelliferone was fluorimetrically determined at 365 nm for excitation and 450 nm for emission using a CLARIOStar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Cell Surface Expression. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was utilized to measure expression of full-length SosV-RBP and NDV-RBP on HEK293T cells (91) . Lipofectamine-2000 transfected cells were washed with PBS pH 7.4 following 18 h incubation at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , counted and seeded into an ELISA plate at a density of 25,000 cells per mL. Cells were bound overnight at 4°C prior to fixation for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following thorough washing, cells were blocked in PBS-5% milk for 1 h and subsequently reacted with rabbit anti-6xhis-tag antibody (Abcam, product no. ab9108) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were repeatedly washed prior to addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, product no. PI-1000), for 1 h at 21°C. Cells were repeatedly washed prior to addition of TMB substrate kit (Pierce). Stop solution (2 M sulphuric acid) was added following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, and absorbance was read at 430 nm using a using an Infinite F200 plate reader (TECAN). Production of the Hexapeptide Motif eSosV-RBP Mutant. The splice-by-overlap extension PCR method was utilized to generate a soluble contruct of SosV-RBP (eSosV-RBP, residues 125−582) bearing the following hexapeptide motif site-directed substitutions: R242N, L243R, K244Y, and H245S (Fig. 1A) . eSosV-RBP was cloned into a pHLsec vector containing an N-terminal SUMO tag and hexahistidine tag (79) . Warren Method for Determining Free Sialic Acid. Alongside a mock-transfected negative control, HEK 293T cell monolayers were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with eSosV-RBP, WT SosV-RBP, and NDV-RBP (residues 47−570) similarly cloned into a pHLsec vector encoding an Nterminal SUMO tag and hexahistidine tag. An ELISA plate was incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse-derived monoclonal anti-penta-histidine antibody (Qiagen, product no. 34660) diluted 1:200 in PBS, pH 7.4 (Gibco). Plates were washed and stained with HEK293T cell supernatants containing soluble NDV-RBP, WT SosV-RBP, eSosV-RBP, and the mock-transfected control. Neuraminidase activity was assayed by measuring levels of free sialic acid (FSA) following incubation with 50 μM fetuin (Sigma Aldrich, product no. F3004) for 18 h at 37°C in PBS, pH 7.4 (Gibco). Using a sialic acid assay kit (Sigma Aldrich, product no. MAK314) based on the Warren method for assaying sialic acid (49) , FSA was oxidized to formylpyruvic acid and subsequently reacted with thiobarituric acid to form a pink product, which was fluorimetrically measured (λex = 555/λem = 585 nm) using a CLARIOStar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Structural Phylogenetic Analysis. Structural phylogenetic analysis was performed with the Structural Homology Program (SHP) (59, 60) using paramyxoviral RBP monomers. The resulting evolutionary distance matrix was used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree with the PHYLogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) (92) . Dimer Angle Analysis. Analysis of relative angles monomers within the paramyxoviral dimers was performed with UCSF Chimera (93) . To calculate the angle between the monomers of a dimer, planes representing the top faces of the monomers were constructed based upon conserved stretches of paramyxoviral RBP sequence, using the "Define plane functionality."
