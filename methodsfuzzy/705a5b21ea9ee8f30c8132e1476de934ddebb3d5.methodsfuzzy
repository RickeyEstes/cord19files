To achieve the research aim, we conducted a questionnaire survey study targeting occupants of four academic buildings located in different neighborhood environment in Hong Kong. These four buildings are strategically selected to involve those located in high (two) versus low (two) neighborhood building density, high (two) versus low (two) neighborhood building height, and large (two) versus small (two) neighborhood greenspace. Please refer to Figs. 2 and 3 for the locations of the buildings. Academic buildings are selected mainly for two reasons. Firstly, unlike commercial buildings which only accommodate the working age groups and residential buildings which accommodate residents with similar social background (e.g., housing affordability), academic buildings accommodate a good mix of occupants who come from different age (e.g., teenage students, senior students, middle aged staff, senior staff, etc.) and social (e.g., students needing financial aid have the same right as students who come from higher income families to enjoy education at universities) groups. On the other hand, previous studies have indicated the intimate relationships between property values and neighborhood environment, such as greenspace (e.g., [27, 56] . In other words, occupants of buildings located in a greener environment may have a higher housing affordability, and thus social background, in which these have found to have impact on individuals' health [63] . To ensure a good mix of respondents, this study targets academic buildings which accommodate occupants with different age and social background, and are located in areas with different neighborhood environment. Previous studies, using academic buildings as the bases of data collection for investigating interactions between occupants and built environment, tend to sample students only (e.g., [40] . In view of the potential impact of respondents' age on health and satisfaction, this study targets not only students, but also academic and administrative staff. Purposive sampling is adopted, in which respondents are recruited only if they are academic or administrative staff working or students studying in the target academic buildings. In sum, 200 valid responses are collected. Students account for 64.5% of the total sample, while academic and administrative staff account for 35.5%. The respondents age from 30 or below (71.5%), 31-50 (26%), to 50 or above (2.5%), in which 57.5% are male and 42.5% are female. Amongst the respondents, 56% spent 11-30 h in the building a week, 36.5% spent more than 30 h and 7.5% spent 10 h or less. To control the impact of building age on occupants, the target buildings are 4-9 year-old (built in the past decade), with 25% aged 4, 25% aged 5, and 50% aged 9. The post-occupancy evaluation survey is designed to have four main parts, namely, background information, indoor environment quality (indicated by occupants' satisfaction towards indoor air quality, ventilation, thermal comfort, lighting, and acoustics; [7] , neighborhood environment quality (indicated by occupants' satisfaction towards neighborhood building density, building height, greenspace and cleanliness [16] , and building-related health symptoms (frequency of occupants suffering from dry eyes, itchy or watery eyes, blocked or stuffy nose, runny nose, dry throat, lethargy or tiredness, headaches, dry, itching or irritated skin, sneezing, and breathing difficulties; [53] . Adopting the health measurement scale developed by Ref. [53] ; respondents were asked to rate the frequency of the 10 symptoms. Occupant health is then calculated by taking an average of the scores of these 10 items. Respondents were invited to answer the questions based on a 7-point likert measurement. Statistical analyses are then conducted, using the software of SPSS, to investigate the hypothetical relationships between neighborhood environment, indoor environment, and health of occupants.
