Vector production. The FIV vector system utilized in this study 22, 50 expressed either secreted (Gaussia) luciferase, mCherry, or firefly luciferase. Pseudotyped FIV vector particles were generated by transient transfection, concentrated 250-fold by centrifugation, and titered using real-time PCR as previously described. 22 The following envelope glycoproteins from the following viruses were used in this study: Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (GP64), 30 Indiana strain of VSVG, JSRV, 28 Primary cultures of airway epithelia. Airway epithelial cells were isolated from humans or pigs and grown at the air-liquid interface as described previously. 53 Briefly, the culturing process is as follows: tissues undergo enzymatic dispersion; epithelial cells are dissociated; and seeded onto collagencoated semipermeable membranes (0.6 cm 2 , Millicell-PCF; Millipore, Billerica, MA). 53 Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells are allowed to grow and differentiate at the air-liquid interface. All preparations used were well differentiated (>3-4 weeks old; resistance >1,000 ohm × cm 2 ). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, Iowa). In vitro viral vector administration. Primary cultures of HAE or PAE were transduced with pseudotyped FIV by diluting vector preparations in serum-free media to achieve the desired MOI and applying 100 μl of the solution to the apical cell surface. After incubation for 4 hours at 37 °C, the vector was removed and cells were further incubated at 37 °C, for 4 days. To transduce epithelia with pseudotyped FIV from the basolateral side, the Millicell culture insert containing the epithelium was turned over and vector applied to the basolateral surface for 4 hours in 100 μl of media. Following the 4-hour transduction, the vector was removed and the culture insert was turned upright and allowed to incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , for 4 days. The A549 (no. CCL-185; ATCC) and H441 (no. HTB-174; ATCC) epithelial cell lines are derived from human lung carcinomas. IB3, 54 FBS. In addition, each medium was supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). In vivo viral vector administration. To analyze mCherry expression in vivo, FIV3.2 mCherry virus (5 × 10 8 TU) was delivered to the ethmoid sinus and tracheal lobe of 4-weekold pigs. The pigs were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine (20 mg/kg; 2 mg/kg). Nasal passageways were opened using Afrin-coated gauze and 2 ml of viral vector resuspended in 1% methylcellulose 56 was delivered to right ethmoid sinus via syringe and tube. To deliver 2 ml of viral vector to the tracheal lobe, a pediatric bronchoscope lined with a PE20 catheter or drug infusion balloon (ClearWay; Atrium, Hudson, NH) was used to ensure accurate delivery. Seven days following vector delivery, the pigs were euthanized and the ethmoid sinuses and lungs were collected for further analysis. Fluorescence analysis of in vivo mCherry expression. Ethmoid sinuses and lung lobes were collected and fixed o vernight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were then placed in 15% sucrose for 8 hours and transferred to 30% sucrose overnight, all steps carried out at 4 °C. Tissues were frozen into OCT blocks using 2-methylbutane and liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored at −80 °C and sectioned using a microtome at −35 °C. Fluorescence microscopy was then used to analyze sectioned tissues for mCherry expression in the ethmoid sinus and tracheal lobe. To quantify the percentage of FIV-transduced cells in cultured ethmoid sinus tissue, 6-7 representative fields were examined under ×20 magnification. The number of mCherry-positive cells was divided by the number of DAPI-stained nuclei to determine the percent positive transduction. Approximately 600-900 cells were counted from each section. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Well-differentiated primary porcine epithelial cells transduced with GP64-FIV expressing mCherry were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, and rinsed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100 followed by incubation in 5% fetal calf serum overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated with 1:200 of FITC-conjugated -tubulin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 1 hour. Cells were rinsed and 1:1,000 of To-Pro-3 nuclear stain was applied for 10 minutes. Sample images were captured using Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine cell morphology after fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (0.1 mol/l sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes. After serial alcohol dehydration, samples were treated with hexamethyldisilazane (Polysiences, Warrington PA) and mounted on stubs. Samples were examined under a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope (Hitachi, Dallas, TX). Trim5 detection. For the reverse transcription-PCR assays, RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (74104; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was generated using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (18064-022; Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR for the pig species variant of TRIM5 was performed using specific primers (pigTRIM5-F 5 TGTCCAGGCAGAGTTTATG CGACT 3 and pigTRIM5-R 5 TCCAAATTTGCGCGCGTATCT CAC 3 ) and pig GAPDH (pigGAPDH-F 5 GGCAAAGTGG ACATTGTCG 3 and pigGAPDH-R 5 GGGATGATGTTCTGGG CAG 3 ). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed (95 °C for 30 seconds, 54 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 60 seconds). For western blots, cells were lysed with Galacto-Light Plus lysis solution (Tropix, Grand Island, NY) and loading volumes were determined based on BCA assay using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (23227; Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL). Proteins were separated on a 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (161-1155; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (162-0145; Bio-Rad). The blot was blocked overnight in blocking buffer (5% milk-0.05% Tween-20 in PBS), followed by a wash in 1× PBS. The membrane was probed with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (H6708; Sigma) for 2 hours followed by three rinses in wash buffer. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000, 31460; Thermo scientific) was used as the secondary antibody for 1 hour. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (34080; Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposed to Kodak BioMax XAR film (165 1454; Kodak, Rochester, NY). Pig TRIM5 cloning and knockdown. PCR primers to amplify pig TRIM5 from a cDNA clone (Genbank accession no. AY970971, kindly provided by Dr Timothy Smith, USDA/ARS US Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, NE) were designed (TRIM5ClaIFwd 5 AGAatcgatGAAGCTGGGAC-GAGCAGGA 3 and TRIM5HASphIRev 5 CGAgcatgcTCAAGC GTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAGAGCCCGGCGAGC ACAGA 3 ) which introduced a ClaI restriction site at the 5 end and SphI restriction site at the 3 end. The PCR product was ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO (45-0641; Invitrogen). Following ClaI and SphI enzymatic digestion, pig TRIM5 was ligated into pCAGGs vector plasmid 57 creating pCAGGs-pigTRIM5. Dicer substrate RNAi duplexes against pig TRIM5 were designed using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) online RNAi design software. Three duplexes were tested individually (100 and 10 nmol/l) by reverse transfecting 4 × 10 4 cells per well of PK1 cells in 48-well dishes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (13778; Invitrogen). Same amount of negative control small-interfering RNA (5 AUACGCGUAUUAUACGCGAUUAACGAC 3 , and 5 CGUUAAUCGCGUAUAAUACGCGUAT 3 ) was used as a comparison. Two days after transfection, mRNA levels of porcine TRIM5 were measured by real-time PCR using the TaqMan U niversal PCR Master kit (4304437; ABI, Grand Island, NY). The primers and a probe used to detect porcine TRIM5 are as follows: The upstream primer TRIM5F445 (5 TAGGCAT GTGGCCAACATAGTGGA 3 ), the downstream primer TRIM5 R581 (5 AGCAAATGACCTTCCCATCCTCCT 3 ), and the probe TRIM5P501 (5 56FAM-TGGCGCAGA-ZEN-AGGGAAATCTCT GTGTA-3IABkFQ 3 ). The levels were normalized to pig GAPDH. Primers and a probe used to detect porcine GAPDH are as follows: The upstream primer (5 GGCATGGCCTTCCGTGT 3 ), the downstream primer (5 GCCCAGGATGCCCTTGAG 3 ), and the probe (5 56FAM-CCTGCTTCA-ZEN-CCACCTTCTTGATG TCATCAT-3IABkFQ 3 ). The duplex that yielded the greatest knockdown (TRIM5po S 5 CCACUAAUUUCGUCAGGGAAACA TT 3 , and TRIM5po AS 5 AAUGUUUCCCmUGmACGAAAUU mAGmUGmGmGmU 3 ) was used for subsequent knockdown experiments. Porcine TRIM5 was silenced by reverse transfecting PK1 cells with siTRIM5po. Briefly, 5 × 10 4 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were transfected with 10 nmol/l of siTRIM5po or 10 nmol/l of negative control small-interfering RNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after the incubation, cells were transduced with viral vectors and TRIM5 restriction assays were performed. TRIM5 restriction assay. Stably transduced MDTF cells expressing either TRIM5 from human (TRIM5 hu ), African green monkey (TRIM5 AGM ), rhesus (TRIM5 rh ), a human/rhesus chimera (TRIM5 hu(rh325-344) ), or a TRIM5 null MDTF control cell line (kindly provided by Theodora Hatziioannou and Paul D Bieniasz) 25, 26 were seeded in 24-well dishes (10 5 cells/well) yielding ~50% confluency 24 hours later. HT1080 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes (2 × 10 4 cells/well). After 18 hours of incubation, cells were transiently transfected with empty plasmid or pCAGGs-pig TRIM5 using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (11668; Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after the seeding of MDTF cells or 48 hours after the seeding of HT1080 cells, cells were transduced with appropriate MOI or MOI predetermined for achieving ~30-40% GFP-positive cells by fluorescence cell sorting (FACScan; Becton-Dickinson, San Diego, CA) on TRIM5 null control cells. Viruses tested included N-MLV, B-MLV, and FIV, all expressing GFP. All transductions were carried out for 1 hour at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml polybrene (107689; Sigma). Two days post-transduction, the percentage of GFPpositive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Statistics. Unless otherwise noted, all numerical data are presented as the mean ± SE. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test.
