Participants were recruited from randomly selected households, in 40 communities in a transect spanning a gradient of decreasing population density extending to the northeast of Guangzhou, China. Details on the methods can be found in Lessler et al. [21] . We define a community to be all of those within the jurisdiction of a single street or village committee (SVC), the smallest administrative unit in China. SVCs hold information on all residential households within their jurisdiction. A list of households was obtained from each SVC and then reordered randomly. Recruitment of households was attempted in sequence from this list until at least 20 households had been recruited into the study. The longitude and latitude of participating households were recorded by study researchers using a handheld GPS device. Community locations were classified as urban or rural based on their administrative designation according the Chinese government. Communities were also classified by local population density. Local population density was considered to be the average of the density in the Landscan tile containing that location and all adjacent tiles (i.e. density in a 9 km 2 area roughly centred on that community) [22] . Communities were divided into four categories based on the log of local population density: (i) low density-more than 1 s.d. below the mean, (ii) low-mid density-below the mean by less than 1 s.d., (iii) high-mid density-above the mean by less than 1 s.d., and (iv) high density-more than 1 s.d. above the mean.
