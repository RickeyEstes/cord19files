Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Initial bivariate screening was conducted between selected covariates of interest and various outcome variables representing respiratory illness severity. A student's t-test for continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher exact tests for dichotomous or categorical variables, were used. Predictors with a bivariate p <0.1 were then included in a stepwise, backward elimination unconditional generalized linear regression model. Predictors with a p < 0.05 were retained in the final model and adjusted prevalence ratios calculated. Outcome variables that were assessed included severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) as defined by the World Health Organization (fever >38C, cough, onset within last 10 days, and requires hospitalization), oxygen delivery, intravenous fluids, length of stay greater than or equal to 3 days, receiving oral antibiotics during admission, and prescription of a bronchodilator (18) .
