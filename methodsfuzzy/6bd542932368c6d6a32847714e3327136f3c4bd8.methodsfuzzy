The methods studied use the following chemical transfection reagents: Lipofectamine, Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Fugene-6, Fugene-HD (Promega), PEI, jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection), or calcium phosphate precipitation. The choice of reagent is based on optimized lab protocol, cost, as well as the cytotoxicity of each reagent depending on requirements of pseudotype production. Of the above reagents, calcium phosphate precipitation and Fugene-6 are the most popular. Calcium phosphate precipitation is a well-established transfection method of mammalian cells, developed in 1973 by Graham and van der Eb. This method involves mixing a comparatively high amount (5-25 Âµg) of plasmid DNA with calcium chloride and then adding this mixture slowly to a buffered saline solution. The mixture is incubated at room temperature whereupon a positively charged DNA and calcium phosphate precipitate is formed. The charge allows the precipitate to associate with the negatively charged cell membrane, entering by endocytosis or phagocytosis. The calcium phosphate precipitation process is sensitive to small differences in pH (20, 110, 111) . Polyethylenimine is a polymeric cation, which was first evaluated for its transfection capabilities in 1995. PEI acts at a range of pH values and associates with DNA to produce a complex with an overall positive charge that can then allow interaction with the cell membrane. Entry is by endocytosis and PEI has been shown to aid the delivery of nucleic acids to the cell nucleus of transfected cells. The original report states that PEI is non-cytotoxic at optimal concentration for transfection (112) . However, when using PEI for transfection, it is commonplace to change cell culture medium within 24 h of transfection. JetPEI is a manufactured linear form of PEI, which is suited to high-throughput assays (84, 113) . Lipofectamine (or Lipofectamine 2000) are cationic lipids sold by Invitrogen that allow delivery of nucleic acids such as vectors into host cells through the formation of positively charged liposomes. The liposomes containing the pseudotype vectors are then able to fuse with cell membranes due to their positive charge and lipid constitution (114) . Lipofectamine is among the most expensive transfection reagents used in influenza pseudotype production. The benefits of using this method are not readily apparent when the cost of the reagent is considered (107, 115) . Fugene-6 and Fugene-HD are cationic lipid complexes, which have low cell cytotoxicity. This allows laboratories to avoid replacing the transfection medium that may allow an increase in final titers of pseudotype when harvested. Fugene-HD has been shown to be more efficient than other transfection reagents (17, 96, 116, 117) . Table 1 shows a list of transfection reagents, their cytotoxicity, cost, and plasmid input required.
