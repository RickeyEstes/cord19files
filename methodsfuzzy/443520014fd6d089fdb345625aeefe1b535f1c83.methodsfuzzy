In this study we examined the antiviral activity of nitric oxide (NO) against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) isolate Frankfurt-1 (FFM-1). Two NO donor compounds, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, Sigma, Belgium) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Sigma, Belgium), were added to confluent African Green monkey (Vero E6) cells. SNAP releases NO in aqueous solutions with a half-life of approximately 4 hours. 7 The non-nitrosylated form of SNAP, N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP, Sigma, Belgium) was included as a control compound in the assay. Antiviral activity and cytotoxicity measurements were based on the viability of cells that had been infected or not infected with 100 CCID 50 (50% cell culture infective doses) of the SARS-CoV in the presence of various concentrations of the test compounds. Three days after infection, the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method, in which the reduction of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) dye (CellTiter 96 AQ ueous One Solution kit, Promega, The Netherlands) by cellular dehydrogenases to an insoluble coloured formazan was measured in a spectrophotometer (Multiskan EX, Thermo Labsystems, Belgium) at 492 nm. 8, 9 The selectivity index was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC 50 or 50% cytotoxic concentration) to the concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect to 50% of the control value (IC 50 or 50% inhibitory concentration). The amount of NO produced by SNAP in culture medium was determined by assaying its stable end-product, NO 2 − (nitrite) in a cell culture environment. Freeze-thawed cell culture samples were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min; equal volumes (100 l) of the sample supernatants and Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide, 0.1% N-1-naphthylethylenediamine, 5% H 3 PO 4 ) (Sigma, Belgium) were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 37 • C. The optical density at 540 nm was measured with an automated multiscan spectrophotometer. A range of sodium nitrite dilutions served to generate a standard curve for each assay.
