Patients. This cross-sectional study was performed in National Influenza Center, Virology Department, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. During fall and winter 2012-2013, a total of 140 throat swabs were collected from hospitalized patients less than two years of age with RTIs. All samples were stored at -70 Â°C until used for DNA extraction and PCR. DNA extraction and PCR. DNA was extracted from the specimens by using High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit (Roche, Germany). HBoV DNA detection and genotyping were performed by PCR amplification for the NP-1 and VP2 genes with products lengths of 354 and 1054 bp, respectively. PCR primers were used according to the previous published articles (8) . The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gel. All samples were tested at least twice and positive samples were confirmed by sequencing. Sequencing. PCR products of VP2 genes were cloned by TA-cloning method and sequenced in both directions with the use of Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained sequences were assembled by Staden Package-2 and edited using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Version 7.0.5.3. Phylogenetic analysis. For phylogenetic analysis, 5 Iranian HBoV sequences were included. Sequence alignment was performed by using Clustal W multiple alignment. MEGA 5.2 program phylogenetic neighbor-joining analysis was conducted. The evolutionary distances with the Kimura 2-parameter model and bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates were computed. The sequences were deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers KJ598617-KJ598621. Co-infections. All samples were screened for detection of influenza A and B and RSV using real-time RT-PCR and hemi nested RT-PCR respec-tively.
