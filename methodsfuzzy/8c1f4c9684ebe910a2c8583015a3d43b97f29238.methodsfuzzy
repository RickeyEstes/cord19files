Descriptive statistical analysis of the quantitative data was conducted using SPSS 11.5 (SPSS Inc., 2002) . Several statistical techniques were employed for analysis of the data. A cluster analysis was used to group the study sample into several groups. This analysis, also called segmentation or taxonomy analysis, is a way to create groups of objects, or clusters in such a way that the profiles or characteristics of nurses in the same cluster are very similar and that the profiles of nurses in different clusters are quite distinct (Chan et al., 2003) . In this study, the analysis was based on four main variables: (1) demographic variables; (2) attitudes towards bereavement care variables; (3) attitudes on the importance of hospital policy on perinatal bereavement variables; and (4) attitudes on the importance of formal training to deal with perinatal bereavement care variables. The analysis used standardized values (z) based on these variables. Two-step cluster analysis was used for this study. In this technique, nurses are sequentially merged into a decreasing number of clusters until the conjoint set contains all nurses (SPSS Inc., 2002) . The choice of a similarity measure and the determination of the number of clusters were based on the Log-likelihood distance and Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion (BIC), respectively (SPSS Inc., 2002) . Differences between the cluster groups were delineated descriptively. Due to ordinal data and skewed patterns in most of the outcomes, Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to test differences in various nurses' characteristics between the clusters (Hall-Lord et al., 1999) . In addition, factor analysis was used to identify the number of factors, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients were used to examine the internal reliability of each part of the instrument. Spearman's correlation coefficients (r s ) were used to quantify the relationship between the three attitude scores. Results were considered significantly different at p < 0:05.
