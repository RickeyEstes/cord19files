2.1. Cells, viruses, immunofluorescent assay (IFA), cytopathic effect and cytotoxicity assays Swine testicular (ST) epithelial cells (ATCC®CRL-1746™) and the Taiwan field isolated virulent strain of TGEV were grown and propagated; IFA and cytopathic effect and cytotoxicity assays regarding TGEV were also as described (Yang et al., 2010 (Yang et al., , 2007 with only two modifications: 1) test compounds were pretreated for 1 h; 2) ST cells were infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 7 for IFA, 3.5 for cytopathic effect, and 0.01 MOI for determining virus titers. The murine astrocytoma cell line DBT and the MHV, JHM strain were maintained as described; IFA and cytopathic effect regarding MHV (0.005 MOI) were also performed as described (Lee et al., 2012) .
