RNA purification. Total cellular RNA was isolated from normal and HEV(B)-infected cyno livers by the guanidinium-LiCI precipitation method (Cathala et al., 1983) and pofy(A)+ RNA was selected by one round of oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (Aviv and Leder, 1972) . cDNA library construction and screening. Synthesis and screening of the infectious bile cDNA library had previously been described (Reyes et al., 1990) . Oligo(dT)-, random hexamer-, and HEV sequence-specific oligomer-primed (primer A, see Fig. 1 ) cDNA were synthesized using a commercially available cDNA synthesis kit (Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), ligated to EcoRl linker-adapters and cloned into X gtl0 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). G-tailed cDNA was made essentially as described before (Tam et al., 1989) . Briefly, first strand cDNA primed with HEV sequence-specific primer C (see Fig. 1 ) was tailed with dGTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The modified cDNA was then amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) employing the same synthetic HEV primer and an oligo(dC) primer, both of which contained an EcoRl cloning site at the 5' end. All four cDNA libraries were screened with appropriate synthetic oligomer probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) described under Results. Hybridizations were generally performed in duplicate (using 32P kinased probes) at 42" in 30% formamide, 5X SSC, 5X Denhardt's (0.1% ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% BSA), 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 @g/ml salmon sperm DNA. After an overnight hybridization, filters were washed three times with 0.2X SSC and 0.1% SDS at 37-42" depending on the length of the oligomer probe. Primer extension analysis. Primer extension studies were carried out using oligonucleotide primers kinased to a specific activity greater than 3 X 10' cprn/pg with [T-~~P]ATP (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) essentially as described (McKnight et a/., 1981) . Extension products were separated on a 6% pofyacrylamide-8 M urea sequencing gel that was subsequentty dried and autoradiographed. The sequences forthe HEV primers used in these studies are: Primer A: 5'-CCCGATAAGCAGCCTCAAGCCTC-3' Primer B: 5'-CCGCGTACACACTAACCCCCCGGC-CAATAAT-TCACGCTGG-3' Primer C: 5'-CAAGCTGGCGAGGTTGCATTAGG-3' Primer D: 5'-ACAGCATICGCCAGGGCAGAGTT-3' Northern blot analysis. Four micrograms of HEV(B)infected cyno liver poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was hybridized under high stringency conditions with a radiolabeled BETG-1 EcoRl fragment insert (5 X lo* wmhg). DNA nucleotide sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide method @anger et a/., 1977) using 7-deaza-dGTP (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). All sequencing reactions were carried out on both strands using Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) subclones obtained from HEV XgtlO phage clones. Appropriate overlapping subfragments were exploited wherever possible, or adjoining dissimilarend subclones were employed for unambiguous orientation. Sequencing primers were commercially available or synthesized based on derived HEV sequences. 7-deaza-dGTP eliminated areas of compression due to the high G + C content of the viral genome (see Results) . Computer analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Computer programs for manipulation of nucleic acid and protein sequences were obtained from lntelligenetics (Mountain View, CA).
