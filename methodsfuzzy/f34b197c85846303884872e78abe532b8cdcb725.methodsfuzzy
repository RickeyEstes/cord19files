Virus and cell culture. HCMV strain AD169 was propagated on human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) using standard procedures. To obtain pure virus stocks, virion DNA was transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Graham and van der Eb, 1973; Copeland and Cooper, 1979) , and resulting virus was plaque purified. Labeled virus was purified from cultures incubated with 50 &i/ml [""S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol. Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig) at 4 days postinfection (Ebeling et al, 1983) . Proteins from cell extracts were prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled, AD169-or mockinfected cells as described . For isolation of immediate early (IE) RNA, cells were infected and maintained in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, and total cellular RNA was harvested 14 to 16 hr postinfection. Late RNA was isolated after 4 to 6 days of infection. Mockinfected cell RNA was extracted from confluent, uninfected HFF cultures. Cloning of DNA in plplasmids and bacteriophage Ml3 Recombinant clones containing subfragments of cosmid-cloned AD169 DNA (Fleckenstein et al. 1982) was constructed by using the plasmid vector pAcyc148 (Chang and Cohen, 1978) . Procedures for isolation of cosmid and plasmid DNA and construction of recombinant clones were carried out as described (Fleckenstein et aL, 1982; Knust et c& 1983) . Each cloned viral DNA fragment was identified by separation on agarose gels after restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization (Southern, 1975) . Cloned, single-stranded viral DNA was obtained by using the bacteriophage derivative M13mp9 and the procedure described by Messing et al. (1981 Messing et al. ( , 1982 . Isolation of RNA, size fracticmaticm, and Northern blot anal&s. Cellular RNA was isolated from cultures by a modification of the guanidine hydrochloride method (Liu et aL, 1979) . HCMV-or mock-infected cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), scraped into PBS, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and washed once more. The cells (10' to 5 X 10' per pellet) were resuspended in 7 ml of lysis buffer (6 M guanidine hydrocholride, 0.1 M P-merceptoethanol, 0.5% N-lauroylsarkosine, 50 mM lithium citrate, pH 6.5). The lysate was layered on a cushion of 4 ml of 5.7 M CsCl in 0.1 M EDTA, pH 7.5. After centrifugation in a Spinco SW41 rotor at 28,000 rpm at 20' for 20-24 hr, the gelantinous pellet was dissolved in a small amount of HaO. Following ethanol precipitation and digestion with proteinase K, the RNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. Polyadenylated [poly (A)+] RNA was prepared by passing total RNA over a column of oligodeoxythymidylic acid-cellulose (Bethesda Research Laboratories) (Aviv and Leder, 1972) . Poly (A)+ RNA was size fractionated on sucrose-formamide gradients (Siddell et al., 1980) . A 50-pg sample of poly (A)+ RNA was denatured in 60% deionized formamide, 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA at 37" for 5 min before centrifugation. The RNA was layered on top of a to 5 to 20% sucrose formamide gradient containing 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM LiCl, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 50% deionized formamide. The gradients were centrifuged for 20 hr at 28,000 rpm and 20" in an SW41 rotor. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient, and 30 pg of calf liver tRNA per ml was added as a carrier. The RNA of each fraction was precipitated with ethanol and divided into two parts. One aliquot was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization, the other part was used for in vitro translation assays, Labeled ribosomal RNA from owl monkey (28 S, 5.2 kb; 18.5 S, 2.0 kb) and Escherichia coli ( Eight cosmid clones representing the entire viral genome are indicated by horizontal brackets (Fleckenstein et al, 1982 to cloned viral probes. The respective cosmid clones are marked by their numbers above the lanes. Selected mRNA was eluted and translated in a reticulocyte cell-free system containing [85S]methionine. The translation products were ana-S, 1.5 kb) were used for size estimation. For Northern blot analysis, RNA was denatured with glyoxal (McMaster and Charmichael, 1977) . The RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Thomas, 1980) , and hybridized with nickrepair, 3zP-labeled DNA probes (Knust et al, 1983 ). H&ridization select&n and cd-free translation. The procedure for hybrid selection (Ricciardi et d, 1979) was modified, following suggestions of H. Esche (personal communication). Twenty micrograms of cosmid-plasmidor phage-cloned viral DNA was bound to a OA-cm-diameter nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher-Schull, BA 85). Cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA (0.15-0.2 mg/ml) was incubated for 4 hr at 56" with several filter pieces in 20 mM PIPES (1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid) (pH 6.4), 0.2% SDS, 50% formamide, lyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. The sizes of polypeptides, indicated in kilodaltons, were determined by coelectrophoresis of marker proteins. Lane a, p"S] methionine-labeled proteins of purified AD169 virions; lane b, translated products of nonselected late poly (A)+ RNA from AD169-infected cells; lane c, translated products of nonselected RNA from mock-infected cells; lane d, endogenous proteins synthesized in the cell-free system without addition of RNA. Note. Sizes of polypeptides (X10-*) obtained by in vitro translation of late RNA selected with seven cosmid clones covering the entire HCMV genome. These polypeptides were detected in repeated experiments.

Immunoprecipiation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Precipitations were carried out as described by Ross et al. (1980a) . After preincubation with Staphylococcus aureus (Kessler, 1975) , samples of in vitro translation assays were incubated on ice for 30 min with human immune sera or monoclonal antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were adsorbed to protein A bearing S. aureua The washed immunoprecipitates were denatured and solubilized by the addition of SDS-sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) , followed by boiling for 3 min. In vitro translation products and immunoprecipitates were separated on 15% linear polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) (Bodemer et aL, 1980) . Fixed gels were fluorographed by the method of Bonner and Laskey (1974) .
