We use the expanded generalized Fisher index method to analyze different factors on transportation carbon emissions in Beijing based on the expanded Kaya identity. The main reason is that the most commonly used index decomposition methods of the Laspeyres and Divisia index methods cannot handle the residuals in the decomposition process and the explanation of all the changes in carbon emissions is inhibited. The generalized Fisher index has better decomposition characteristics than the Laspeyres and Divisia index methods. Ang et al. (2004) compared the generalized Fisher index method with five widely employed index decomposition methods on a basis of the factor-reversal, time-reversal, proportionality, aggregation, zero-value robust and negative-value robust tests (see Table 1 in Ang et al. (2004) for details). The generalized Fisher index passed all of the tests except the aggregate test, and achieved complete factor decomposition. This suggests the generalized Fisher index should be a better way to perform decomposition.
