In this open-label trial, 314 adults were randomized to receive TZP or SAM for up to 21 days. Patients with polymicrobial infections involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also received vancomycin 1 g q12 h. Samples for bacteriologic evaluation were taken at baseline from infected ulcers and blood to document causative pathogen(s) and test for antimicrobial susceptibility; samples were taken as clinically indicated at the end-oftreatment and test-of-cure visits (14-21 days post-treatment). To minimize risk of contamination, samples were to be obtained by aspirate, curettage, or biopsy rather than by swabbing. Results: A total of 123 of the 314 patients in the study were bacteriologically evaluable. The most common causative pathogens in monomicrobial infections were S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. About 30% of patients in each treatment arm had polymicrobic infections. The combination of S. aureus plus S. agalactiae was most common. The median duration of treatment was 8 days for both groups. The bypathogen bacteriological success rates were similar in both treatment groups for S. aureus, S. agalactiae, and E. faecalis. TZP had an eradication rate of 85.7% for P. aeruginosa; SAM is not active against P. aeruginosa, and patients with P. aeruginosa in the SAM group (n = 5) were discontinued from the study . Conclusions: Previous studies have shown that TZP at a dose of 3 g/0.375 g q6 h was effective for treatment of diabetic foot infections. Our study confirmed that less frequent administra-tion of TZP at 4 g/0.5 g q8 h was sufficient to attain bacteriologic success rates of 76.9% for S. aureus, 83.3% for S. agalactiae, 71.4% for E. faecalis, and 85.7% for P. aeruginosa in the bacteriologically evaluable population. This study differed from previous studies of infected diabetic foot ulcers, which found gram-negative enterics to be more common than P. aeruginosa as causative pathogens. However, it is consistent with data showing that P. aeruginosa has recently become the gramnegative pathogen most frequently isolated from soft tissue infections in Europe, North American, and Latin America. This was an open-label, nonrandomized study in subjects undergoing an invasive procedure to the lung (other than percutaneous lung biopsy) which facilitated the removal of macroscopically normal healthy lung tissue without exposing the subject to undue risk. Penetrance of GRN into bone was determined when removal of rib bone was part of the normal surgical procedure. A single 600 mg oral GRN dose was administered based on the scheduled operative time. LP and, if possible, BM and/or bone samples and corresponding plasma samples were removed at 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 10 to 12, or 20 to 24 h post-dose. Concentrations of GRN in these samples were determined using validated LC/MS/MS assays. Safety was assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and changes in physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and electrocardiographic results. Results: Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled; samples were taken from a minimum of 6 patients at each time interval. Mean GRN concentration in LP increased between the 2-4 and 4-6 h post-dose, suggesting rapid penetration into LP, then declined similar to the decrease seen in plasma concentration. Concentrations of GRN in LP exceeded the MIC90 of organisms associated with RT infections by 62-to 466-fold over a 24 h period. GRN concentrations in BM over a 24 h period exceeded the MIC90 of respiratory pathogens 51-to 380-fold. Concentrations of GRN in bone exceeded the MIC90 of the organisms associated with bone infections (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, Fusobacterium species, and Enterobacter species) by 6-to 101-fold over a 12 h period. Across the 4 time intervals, mean ratios of tissue to plasma GRN concentration in LP, BM, and bone reached 2.80, 0.99, and 0.56, respectively, suggesting adequate penetration. No GRN-related AEs were reported, indicating that a single 600 mg oral GRN dose was well tolerated in subjects undergoing invasive procedures. Conclusions: GRN penetrates rapidly into LP, BM, and bone tissue, producing sustained concentrations that predict adequate coverage of GRN-susceptible pathogens at these sites. The medical records of all ptt admitted to a tertiary hospital ICU in a 6 month period in 2002 were retrospectively reviewed, and the antifungal therapies were recorded and correlated to the findings of fungi from the ptt. The PK-PDparameters for each pt was estimated from the treatment given and the MIC of the isolated Candida, i.e. AUC/MIC-ratio (in h) for the azoles, and Peak/MIC ratio for the free fraction of amphotericinB. Candida isolated from various infectious foci, or from the surveillance samples taken routinely three times a week, were susceptibility tested using E-tests for fluconazole, itraconazole and amphotericinB. Results: In total 120 ptt were included.Among the 14 ptt with invasive fungal infections, 3 ptt had bloodstream infections at admission. One of the remaining 11 (9%) received systemic prophylactic therapy before getting colonized, and 3 ptt (27%) were prophylactic treated when colonized, 3 ptt with fluconazole (AUC/MIC: 66-1600), and one pt with liposomal ampho-tericinB (Peak/MIC = 3 Objective: To predict the pharmacokinetic properties of BAL4815 a new azole antifungal, in humans.Methods: BAL8557 (the water-soluble pro-drug of BAL4815) was incubated at 10 lg/mL in pooled heparinized rat, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma for 5 minutes at 37°C. BAL4815 was incubated at 1,10 and 100 lg/mL equivalent BAL4815 with rat, cynomolgus monkey and human liver microsomes for 120 min at 37°C in the presence of 1 mg/mL proteins. The extent of plasma protein binding of BAL4815 in rat, cynomolgus and human plasma was measured using the red blood cell partitioning method and 14C-BAL4815. Rats received a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg equivalent BAL4815 and a single intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg equivalent BAL4815 as BAL8557. Cynomolgus monkeys received single oral and intravenous doses of 3 mg/kg as BAL8557. Serial blood samples were obtained. Plasma concentrations of BAL4815 and BAL8557 were quantified using an HPLC/fluorescence method or a LC-MS/MS assay. Results: In plasma, BAL8557 is converted within minutes to BAL4815 in all species investigated. In the presence of rat, cynomolgus monkey and human liver microsomes, less than 10% of BAL4815 is metabolized during a 120 min period. BAL4815 is bound to plasma proteins with a free fraction of 3.5%, 3.6% and 2.2% in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, respectively. After intravenous administration, the pro-drug BAL8557 is converted to BAL4815 within minutes. BAL4815 has a large volume of distribution with values greater than the total body water: 15 L/Kg and 5 L/kg in rat and cynomolgus monkey, respectively. BAL4815 is slowly eliminated with halflives of 5 h in rat and 10 h in cynomolgus monkey. After oral administration of the pro-drug, BAL4815 reaches Cmax-values between 2.0 to 3.5 hours. We observed high bioavailability of BAL4815: 62% in rat and 87% in cynomolgus monkey. Conclusions: Based on these in vitro results and animal data, we predict that the pro-drug BAL4815 is very rapidly converted to BAL4815 in man. Due to the protein binding and in vitro metabolic stability, BAL4815 is expected to behave as a low intrinsic clearance drug in human (clearance < 10 % of liver blood flow). This combined with a large volume of distribution explains the long half-life > 30 hours observed in man. Animal data suggest a good oral bioavailability as is confirmed in humans.
