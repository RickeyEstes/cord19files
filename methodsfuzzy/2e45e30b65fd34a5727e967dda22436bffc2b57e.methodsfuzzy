Datasets and nomenclature of genes. Sequence similarity searches were performed using the NCBI BLAST tools blastn http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and Ensembl BLAST/BLAT search programs http:// www.ensembl.org/Multi/Tools/Blast?db=core using default parameters. For identification of bovine CEACAM exons, exon and cDNA sequences from known CEACAM and PSG genes were used to search whole-genome shotgun contigs (wgs) databases limited to organisms Bovidae. Hits were considered to be significant if the E-value was <e-10 and the query cover was >50%. Once a wgs contig was identified that contained CEACAMrelated sequences we confirmed manually the presence of the complete exon by the number of nucleotides and identification of CEACAM-typical splice site sequences. Only sequences which were considered to be complete exons were used for further analyses. In a second step we used the identified exon sequences to search the database again in order to identify all existing paralogous CEACAM genes. Once we had identified individual exons we predicted the gene structure based on the organization of known CEACAM genes. The location of different exons on the same contig was a prerequisite for considering that these exons belong to the same gene. Gene predictions were further supported by the identification of expressed sequence tags (est) and/or predictions in genome builds at NCBI and Ensemble, if available. Short exons, like exons coding for cytoplasmic tails, were identified by alignments of downstream sequences of identified transmembrane exons with cytoplasmic exon sequences of human CEACAMs. Sequence alignments for exon identification were performed using clustalw . The CEA gene family in cattle is not well annotated; therefore, we adopted the nomenclature according to the one previously used for the CEA gene family of other mammals i.e. bovine CEACAM1 paralogs were numbered CEACAM32-CEACAM35 following the canine CEACAM numbers 8 . Gene names and corresponding sequences are summarized in (Additional File 1). The following databases were used for gene loci analyses: UMD3.1 assembly and Btau_5.0.1.
