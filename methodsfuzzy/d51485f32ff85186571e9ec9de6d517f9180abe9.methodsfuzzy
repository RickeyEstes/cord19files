Study site: The shelter selected for this study was an open admission animal shelter that admitted approximately 10,000 animals annually, of which approximately 50% were cats. Both stray and owner surrendered animals were admitted. At the time of the study the shelter staff had been using the software system a for six years; however, when asked by one of the authors (Ann Therese Kommedal) the majority of the personnel reported that they had received limited training in the use of the program or in the usefulness of data collection and entry. Software system reports: Reports from the software system a regarding daily inventory; daily intake; animal identification; location within the shelter; age; vaccination status; and URI diagnosis were collected from the study shelter using a reports generator c provided by the software manufacturer. Manual data reports: Manual data were collected by one of the authors (Ann Therese Kommedal) observing all the cats present in the shelter during morning cleaning, between 9:30 and 11 am, every day. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period during the month of February 2009. The data points collected included daily inventory; daily intake; animal identification; location within the shelter; age; vaccination status; and URI diagnosis (Table 1) . Intake date, vaccination date and vaccination status were collected from the printed software system's cage-cards and paper medical records. A cat was recorded as vaccinated if it had a vaccine sticker and/or a handwritten note of vaccine, with or without a date of vaccination, on its cage card or medical record. Age was estimated by the observer based on size, physical appearance, presence or absence of adult canine teeth, and behavior, and animals were classified as "adult" when estimated to be 5 months of age or older, or "kitten" if estimated to be younger than 5 months based on a combination of these factors. URI was diagnosed by the observer based on the presence of any of the following clinical signs: sneezing, clear or colored nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, or ulcers/sores on the nose, lips, tongue or gums. If a cat was hiding and thus not possible to observe closely, age and URI data were not collected. Data analysis: The software system a reports were compared to the manually collected data to assess for completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. All the data were transferred to spreadsheets b and evaluated for quality. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the compared data points. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for URI diagnosis entered into the software system a , with the observer diagnosis as gold standard. The shelter inventory (the number of cats present in the shelter at a given time) was evaluated by comparing the inventory report generated by the software system a with the number of cats recorded by the observer on the same time and date, as well as comparing each cat's specific location according to the software system a and manual data. The accuracy of the intake reports was evaluated by comparing the previous day's software system a intake report with cats observed to have been admitted on the date in question. Timeliness of URI diagnosis data was evaluated by comparing the number of days after shelter entry a URI diagnosis was entered into the software system a software system versus the date URI was first diagnosed by the observer (Tables 1  and 2 ).
