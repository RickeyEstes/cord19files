Mice. Female BCF~ and BALB/c mice were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, C57BL/6 and CBA/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) whereas, CBA/ N mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). Mice were housed in the AMC animal facility under SPF conditions and maintained on mouse chow and acidified water ad libitum until they were euthanized at 6-10 weeks of age. Medium and reagents. M199 with Hank's BSS (M.A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM Na-pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 25 ug/ml gentamycin, 50 #M 2-mercaptoethanol, and NaHCO3 was used in all cultures. A stock solution of 10 mM PbC12 (Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY) was prepared in physiological saline and sterile filtered prior to dilution and addition to culture. Sheep erythrocytes, purchased from the Colorado Serum Co. (Boulder, CO) were stored in Alsever's preservative and washed 3× in BSS prior to use. Stock solutions of conalbumin (CA, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and rabbit 3' globulin (RGG; Sigma) were prepared in physiological saline and sterile filtered prior to addition to culture. Anti-lg (Rabbit F(ab')2 anti-mouse F(ab')2) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Monoclonal antibodies. The following hybridoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD): HO-13.4 (anti-Thyl.2, a mouse IgM to all T cells); GK1.5 (anti-L3T4a, a rat IgG anti-CD4) and 53-6.72 (anti-Lyt2, a rat IgG anti-CD8). Cells were cultured as recommended by ATCC, supernatants were harvested, precipitated with (NH4)zSO4, dialyzed extensively into PBS pH 7.4, and sterile filtered. Each preparation was characterized by either titering for optimal staining as assessed by flow cytometry or cytotoxicity prior to use. B cell preparation. B cells were enriched by treating splenocyte suspensions with two cycles anti-Thy 1.2 (HO-13.4, 1:10) plus rabbit complement to remove T cells. B cells obtained in this manner were routinely 90-95% slg + and < 1% Ly-1 +, and they did not respond to C0ncanavalin A (Con A) indicating that T cell contamination was functionally insignificant. Resting B cells were obtained by centrifugation of the B cell preparations into a discontinuous PercoU gradient with Percotl (Sigma) concentrations of 50, 60, 70, and 75%. The fraction of cells that layered at the 70% Percoll interface (sp gray 1.087 g/cm 3) was verified as resting by size (forward angle light scatter, FALS) and cell cycle analysis (acridine orange staining) by flow cytometry~ "Unseparated B cells" are defined as those B cells that were not further fractionated by the PercolI gradient separation, whereas "activated B cells" are defined as those that layered above 60% Percoll, indicating blastlike status. The AFC responses per 106 unseparated B cells and resting B cells were <50 and 0, respectively. Primary in vitro AFC assay. Spleens were aseptically removed and a single cell suspension was made by pressing the spleens between the frosted ends of two sterile microscope slides. Clumps were allowed to settle and the cell suspension was washed 1 × in BSS. Each spleen equivalent was resuspended in 5 ml ofPBS + 10% FBS + 0.1% NAN3, layered onto a 4-ml Ficoll-metrizoate density gradient, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 22°C to remove erythrocytes, granulocytes, and dead cells. The lymphocyte-rich interface was collected, washed 3× in BSS and cultured as described (Mishell, 1967) . Briefly, 5 X 10 6 spleen cells/0.5 ml/well, + PbC12 + 25 #1 of 1% SRBC were cultured in 24-well cluster plates for 5 days in a special gas composed of 10% CO2, 7% 02, and 83% N2. On Day 5, cells of triplicate cultures were harvested and pooled, and the number of AFCs were enumerated by a slide modification of the Jerne plaque assay (Jerne and Nordin, 1963) . Only direct plaques were enumerated. Membrane segregated cultures were designed as described (Eastman and Lawrence, 1984) . A 1.0-#m Nucleopore membrane was used to separate B cells at a density of 2.5 × 10 6 cells/upper chamber from splenocytes (approximately 50% B cells) at a density of 5 × 10 6 cells/ lower chamber. Both chambers contained 1% SRBC + 100 #M PbCl 2 or Pb-pretreated B cells (Pb-B cells; 100 #M PbC12, 45 min, 37°C, washed 3× prior to culture).
