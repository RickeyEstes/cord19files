The inclusion of nucleic acid technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ) for the detection of respiratory virus infections in children has substantially increased the diagnostic sensitivity for most respiratory viruses. [5] [6] [7] This technology has allowed the recovery of viruses that have been diffi cult to detect by conventional methods. 8 For example, PCR is three to fi ve times as sensitive as cell culture for detecting rhinoviruses. 9,10 Figure 31-1 shows the viral identifi cation breakdown in three recent studies of children 5, 11, 12 in different countries over the winter viral season using PCR techniques. This fi gure illustrates the differences between studies in patient sampling and methods and the consequent differences in results. However, in all three studies, rhinovirus and RSV are the dominant viruses, with the relative proportions of each differing even between the two studies in infants (studies A and B). Mixed viral infections, particularly with rhinovirus, are common. Finally, studies fi nd only the organisms they look for-only study C tested for bocavirus. Molecular methods have also allowed the rapid identifi cation and characterization of previously unknown viruses causing respiratory illness. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was fi rst identifi ed in the Netherlands in 2000 13 and shows a wide geographic distribution. 14,15 Five new human coronaviruses have been discovered, 16 including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 17, 18 human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63), 19 and human coronavirus HKU1 (hCo-HKU1). 20 Another virus, the human bocavirus (hBoV), has also been identifi ed in association with respiratory illness in hospitalized patients. 21 Global estimates and national estimates of ARI incidence and mortality usually depend on data derived indirectly by curve fi tting, extrapolation, and applying one proportion to another. Studies at different time points and using different methods may be included. Many of the incidence studies go back to the 1980s, 65 whereas mortality estimates are based on more recent total and cause-specifi c mortality data.
