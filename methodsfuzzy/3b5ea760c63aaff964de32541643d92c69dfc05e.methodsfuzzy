Four different methods were used to concentrate virions from the sewage samples: protein precipitation with PEG, organic flocculation with SMF and filtration with positively charged filters, MAF, or GW. All concentration methods were done in triplicate together with a negative control using sterile molecular grade water (VWR-Bie & Berntsen, Søborg, Denmark). Nucleic acids were extracted from 200 μL-portions of the respective viral concentrate using four different extraction kits; NUC (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), QIA (Qiagen, Valencia CA, USA), MIN (BioMerieux, Herlev, Denmark) or POW (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA). In all cases, extractions were carried out according to manufacturer's instructions.
