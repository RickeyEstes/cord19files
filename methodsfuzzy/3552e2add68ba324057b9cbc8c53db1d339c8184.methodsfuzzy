The sample for this study was the 224 SARS patients who were admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. This hospital is where the SARS outbreak had originated. The diagnosis of SARS was based on the following clinical criteria: A person with a history of fever (!38-C); one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (cough, difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath); radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or RDS or without an identifiable cause. These SARS patients were treated for the first 2 days with broad spectrum antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia, according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous cefotaxime 1 g every 6 h with either oral levofloxacin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. Oseltamivir was also given to the initial patients to treat possible influenza infection. Clinical symptoms, blood oxygen saturation, and chest radiograph were assessed daily. If fever persisted after 48 h, patients were given a combination of ribavirin and ''low-dose'' corticosteroid therapy commencing on Days 3 -4 (oral ribavirin as a loading dose of 2.4 g followed by 1.2 g three times daily and prednisolone 0.5 -1 mg/kg body weight per day), whereas those with dyspnea were treated with intravenous ribavirin (400 mg every 8 h), combined with hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 h). Pulses of high-dose methylprednisolone (0.5 g IVI for three consecutive days) were given as a response to persistent or recurrent fever, and radiographic progression of lung opacity with or without hypoxemia, despite initial combination therapy. Further pulses of methylprednisolone were given if there was no clinical or radiological improvement, at a total dose of up to 3 g. The intention was to continue with the combination of ribavirin and ''low-dose'' corticosteroid for up to 12 days, when there was complete resolution of lung opacity. Those who became afebrile, but with incomplete radiological resolution, were given oral ribavirin 600 mg t.i.d. and prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day for at least one further week. The current research protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Subjects were approached by a research nurse by phone, and invited to participate in the study. After informed consent was obtained, clinical data were retrieved using a computerized hospital discharge record system, and clinical records were studied in details. The bone mineral density (BMD) of all subjects were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. On average, patients had their BMD measured at 197 days after being diagnosed as SARS patients. (median = 195 days and range = 149 -231 days). A Hologic QDR-4500 machine (Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) was used. The CV in our laboratory was 1% at both sites [3] . The BMD of SARS patients were compared to age-and sex-specific normal range data from our center. The normal range was previously established from healthy volunteers. The BMD of SARS patients were presented as Z scores. To test if more than 2.5% of SARS patients had a BMD of Z score Ã€2 or lower, a 1-sided exact binominal test was used. The total number of days of bed rest was unknown in patients.
