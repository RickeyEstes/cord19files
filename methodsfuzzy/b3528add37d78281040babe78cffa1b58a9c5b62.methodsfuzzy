Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: Human DRG neuron isolation and culture DRGs from 2 human donors from the first thoracic vertebra (T1) through the first sacral vertebra (S1) were used in the present study. The DRGs were stripped of connective tissue and enzymatically digested at 37 C for 2 hr using the methods described by Davidson et al. (2014) . Dissociated cells were seeded on 96-well plastic bottom plates (Corning) that had been pre-coated with poly-D-lysine. Cells were maintained in culture at 37 C with 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% horse serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2 mM glutamine, 10 ng/mL hNGF (Cell Signaling Technology), 10 ng/mL GDNF (Peprotech), and penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Half of the culture media was replaced with fresh media every 3 days. Live-cell intracellular calcium imaging of MED17.11 neurons and primary mouse DRG and nodose/jugular ganglion neurons Cells on 35 mm dishes (MatTek) were loaded with Fluo-4 (Thermo, F10471) or Fura-2 (Thermo, F1221). The dye was removed and 1 mL of HBSS with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (Thermo, 14170112) was added to each dish for 10 min prior to microscopy. A brightfield image was taken prior to cell stimulation and imaging. Fluo-4 microscopy was performed using Spinning Disk Confocal microscopy at 40X (PerkinElmer) with Volocity imaging software (Perkin Elmer). Cells were imaged at 488 nm. After a 10 s baseline recording, cells were treated with controls or extracts for 90 s and images were obtained every 1 s. A waiting period of 2-5 min was performed between treatment of cells with another molecule to minimize neurons being desensitized. For Fura-2 experiments, after dye loading, cells were placed in 1 mL of HBSS with 20 mM HEPES for 10 minutes prior to recording. Using an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope, data was acquired with MetaFluor Flourescence Ratio imaging software (Olympus) at excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm with image acquisition every 1 s. A 100 s baseline was first recorded after which DMSO was added and recording was obtained for 300 s. Next, compounds or extracts were added with continuous recording for 300 s. Finally, 200 nM was capsaicin added with continuous recording for 300 s. Live cell calcium imaging of human DRG neurons Experiments were conducted on isolated human DRG neurons from post-mortem donors by Anabios, Inc., San Diego, CA. Cells were loaded with 3 mM Fluo-8-AM (AAT Bioquest) containing 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Extracellular solution contained in (mM): 145 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 10 glucose adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Fluo-8-loaded cells were excited at 480 nm and emission was collected at 520 nm with a pcoEDGE sCMOS camera (PCO) mounted on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71). Images were acquired at 0.2 Hz for 5 min, adding the compound of interest or the vehicle (1% DMSO) after 30 s for a total of 2 min, then washing with the external solution. At the end of the response profiling, an additional application of 200 nM capsaicin (Sigma) was performed to identify the nociceptor human DRG neurons. Image acquisition and data analysis were performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices).
