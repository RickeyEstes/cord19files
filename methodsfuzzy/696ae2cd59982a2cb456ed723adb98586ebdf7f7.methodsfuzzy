Viruses and cells TGEV strain (GenBank No. HQ462571), PCV2 strain (GenBank No. EU366323), PPV YL strain (GenBank No. JN860197), PEDV strain (GenBank No. AF353511) and PRRSV Shaanxi strain (GenBank No. HQ401282) used in this study were isolated and purified previously by our team and stocked in our laboratory [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . The CSFV Shimen Strain (GenBank No. AY775178) was provided kindly by Professor Yanming Zhang [27] . These virus strains were maintained at -80Â°C and used as standard viruses for this study. TGEV, PCV2 and PPV were propagated in PK-15 cells. CSFV was propagated in ST cells. PEDV was propagated in Vero cells. PRRSV was propagated in Marc-145 cells. Four types of cells (PK-15, ST, Vero, and Marc-145) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco).
