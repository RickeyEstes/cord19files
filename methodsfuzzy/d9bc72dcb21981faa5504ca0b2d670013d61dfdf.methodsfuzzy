Assessment included demographic data, assessment on scheduled intervals of pain scores at rest and with activity, the occurrence of adverse effects, and the time of symptom resolution. The pain scores were assessed with a visual analogue scale from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (the most severe pain the patient has ever experienced). A 10-cm, numbered, horizontal, visual analogue pain score was used for baseline measurements (t 0 ) and at subsequent intervals after the first injection. 20 Pain scores and adverse effects were recorded every 30 minutes for 2 hours after drug administration. Patients were aware of their previous scores at all stages of recording. Research staff contacted the patient by telephone at 24 hours (or physical assessment if the patient was admitted to the observation ward), at 5 days, and also by telephone at 14 days, unless symptoms were not resolved. Patients recorded data daily for 5 days at home. The type, number, duration, and severity of adverse effects were documented. Specific questions for each adverse event were asked each day in the collection of adverse event data, eg, "Did you experience nausea today?" The primary clinical outcome measures were pain relief, measured as changes in pain score at rest and with activity, and adverse events. Both the change in the score and absolute value were measured. Activity involved the research nurse gently moving the joint involved in a standardized manner to assess pain. Adverse events were assessed for number, duration, and severity (where applicable). Secondary outcome measures were time to complete resolution of pain, stiffness and joint swelling, supplementary acetaminophen, and relapse rate. Data collection ceased at day 14, and nonresolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms at this time was regarded as a treatment failure.
