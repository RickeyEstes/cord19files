The emergence of diagnostic tests which may be more sensitive than electron microscopy and more suitable for large-scale screening of specimens has still demanded the continuing use of electron microscopy to monitor the performance of these tests by confirmation of results on selected specimens. Electron microscopy also plays a role in quality control of the viral reagents utilized in these tests.
