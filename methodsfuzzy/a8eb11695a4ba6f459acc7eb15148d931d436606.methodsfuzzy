HCT. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, approved this study. Elevated enclosed runs were used for housing, and dogs were maintained in social groups wherever possible. All dogs were enrolled in a veterinary preventative medicine program that included routine anthelmintics and a standard immunization series against canine distemper, parvovirus, adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and rabies. Mixed breed cxmd canines were maintained as a colony at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, as previously described. 27 Littermates composed of healthy wild-type donors, and cxmd recipient dogs were matched by intrafamilial histocompatibility typing using two polymorphic satellite markers-one located in the class I region and one located in the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex. 35, 36 Matching was confirmed in all cases by DRB1 gene sequencing. 37 The HCT protocol for cxmd canines was described previously. 27 The day of HCT was designated as day 0. Donor marrow cells were aspirated 30 days before transplant, under general anesthesia through needles inserted into the humeri and femora, and cryopreserved. Subcutaneous injections of recombinant canine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 mg/kg b.i.d.; gift from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) into the donor from days −5 to −1 were used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. Leukaphereses for collection of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-"mobilized" peripheral blood mononuclear cells were performed on day 0 using a percutaneous central dual-lumen catheter 38 and a continuous flow blood separator (Cobe 2997; Cobe BCT, Lakewood, CO 39 ). On day 0, each recipient received total body irradiation at a single dose delivered at 7 cGy/min from a linear accelerator (Varian CLINAC 4, Palo Alto, CA). 40 One recipient received 200 cGy, and the other received 920 cGy. Within 4 hours of total body irradiation, thawed donor bone marrow cells and freshly isolated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-"mobilized" peripheral blood mononuclear cells were infused intravenously. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of oral CSP, 10 mg/kg twice daily, from days −2 to 35. 41 All dogs were given standard supportive care that included subcutaneous fluids with electrolytes, and systemic antibiotics.
