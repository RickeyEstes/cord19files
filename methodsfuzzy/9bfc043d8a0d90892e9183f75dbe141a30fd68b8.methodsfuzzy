The diversity of fungi identified using the culture method was compared with the fungal diversity identified using HTS at the genus level. Table 5 shows a summary of this comparison in biomethanization samples. Culture methods were able to detect six fungal genera. For HTS, the first 20 most abundant genera were considered. They represented 81% and 84% of the total relative abundance of ITS1 and ITS2, respectively. The most abundant genera were the same using both methods (Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Talaromyces). Although Phialocephala is shown to be present only in the profile obtained from the culture method, it was also detected by ITS1 and ITS2 (but not present in the top 20). The diversity profile obtained by the culture method in dairy farms was more exhaustive compared to biomethanization facilities (Table 6 ). For HTS, the top 20 most abundant genera accounted for 67% and 90% of the total relative abundance for ITS1 and ITS2, respectively. As in biomethanization samples, only four genera were detected by both approaches in dairy farms: Penicillium, Cladosporium, Bipolaris and Fusarium. However, some genera were shared only between ITS1 and culture (Sarocladium and Aspergillus) and between ITS2 and culture (Wickerhamomyces and Alternaria). The HTS profile of fungal genera is much more exhaustive than what is shown on the lists in Tables 5 and 6 . Of the fungal genera that were isolated using culture techniques, three (Hyphopichia, Gibellulopsis and Myceliophthora) were not detected by HTS.
