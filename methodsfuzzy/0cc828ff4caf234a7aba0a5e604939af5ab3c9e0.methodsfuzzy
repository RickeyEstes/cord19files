A wide range of techniques can be utilized to investigate the structural changes and the mechanisms controlling the release and stability of encapsulated systems. Among the most commonly used methods, spectroscopy and scattering techniques are particularly interesting to study structural changes taking place at the molecular and nano-/microstructural levels. In particular, scattering techniques present an enormous potential, although, to date, their application within this research field is still very limited. This is mainly due to the unfamiliarity of many researchers within the food science field and unawareness of the valuable information that can be extracted from these techniques. However, several works have already demonstrated the great advantages of combining small angle scattering techniques with traditional methods to provide unique insights into the characterization of food systems (Blazek and Gilbert, 2011; Lopez-Rubio and Gilbert, 2009 ).
