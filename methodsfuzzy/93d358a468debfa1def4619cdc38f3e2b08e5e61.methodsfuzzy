The development of diagnostic assays has advanced by developing in 1993 the pyrosequencing method by Nyren et al. (1993) which combines the benefits of PCR of the DNA sequencing. This assay amplifies a divergent viral fragment that is embraced by two conserved regions on which the amplification primers are designed. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction, and then pyrophosphate is released. De Battisti et al. (2013) applied pyrosequencing to diagnose rapidly and to pathotype NDV directly in clinical specimens. NDV is the only member of serotype 1 avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1) that causes respiratory and neurological disease in chickens and other species of birds and can cause severe economic losses in the poultry sector. Pathotyping is needed for NDV to characterize the infecting viruses. In this study degenerated primers were designed to amplify a portion of the fusion gene responsible for virulence, then a 30-bp region encompassing the cleavage site was pyrosequenced. Pyrosequencing analysis was a useful technique also for genotyping AIV reassortants in the search of vaccine virus candidates (Shcherbik et al., 2014) . The latest development for achieving rapid and affordable molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiological surveillance was the development of the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform in 2014 (Lu et al., 2016; Leggett and Clark, 2017) . The device is exceptionally compact, it is powered from the USB port of a laptop computer, allowing it to be portable outside the dedicated laboratory. The MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, a thirdgeneration sequencing (TGS) technology. The DNA sequencing is performed by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited. Due to the speed in data production, the MinION is considered suitable for real-time applications. The MinION third-generation, real-time DNA sequencing platform was introduced also to the detection and characterization of Newcastle disease outbreaks (Butt et al., 2018) . The rapid identification and virulence prediction of the circulating NDV are a global challenge to the poultry industry diagnostics, but it is rather complex by the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of NDVs. Spatz et al. (2019) investigated the MinION technology in a phylogenomic approach by examining the the single nucleotide mutations and genomic insertion and deletions in the amplicons generated by the single allele assay. They aimed to develop a fast and affordable genotyping assay for the detection, genotyping and surveillance of emerging ILTV strains in the US, providing by their study a revolutionary horizon in the avian viral diagnosis.
