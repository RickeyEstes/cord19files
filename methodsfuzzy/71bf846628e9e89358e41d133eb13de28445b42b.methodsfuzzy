This investigation used an environmental chamber to simulate a full-scale, one-person inpatient room (4.90 m Â 4.32 m Â 2.72 m) as shown in Fig. 1 . The room was furnished with one bed, cabinets, a TV set with 23.8 W of heat load, a piece of medical equipment with 36.3 W of heat, a simulated patient with 106.3 W of heat supine on the bed, and a simulated healthcare worker with 110.6 W of heat. The room used a four-way overhead air-supply diffuser that generated mixing ventilation or employed a perforated diffuser on the floor at the end wall that produced displacement ventilation. There were two ventilation exhausts in the room. One was the main exhaust and the other was an auxiliary exhaust through the restroom. The ventilation rates studied were 4 ACH (0.057 m 3 /s) and 6 ACH (0.085 m 3 /s), respectively. The auxiliary exhaust extracted 0.039 m 3 /s of air from the inpatient room to the restroom, while the main exhaust extracted the rest. The 6 ACH ventilation rate was used in the mixing ventilation, which is the standard supply flow rate for inpatient rooms. The lower ventilation rate was used for displacement ventilation since it could provide better air quality than mixing ventilation. The supply air temperature was 19.5 C for both systems. This investigation studied the distributions of the contaminant exhaled by a patient with sitting and supine postures on a bed and with different expiration modes (breathing and coughing) in the room. This study conducted seven cases of measurements as summarized in Table 1 . These cases were designed to investigate the distributions of contaminants exhaled by a patient with different postures (sitting and supine), different expiration modes (breathing and coughing), and different ventilation systems (mixing and displacement ventilation). Cases 1 and 4 compared breathing with coughing for the displacement ventilation and Cases 2 and 3 for the mixing ventilation. Cases 5 and 1 and Cases 6 and 7 studied the impact of the ventilation rate on the contaminant distribution in the room with displacement ventilation. Both gaseous and particulate contaminants were exhaled by the patient in the room. A patient with an airborne infectious disease often releases respiratory viruses into the surroundings through breathing and coughing. Both breathing and coughing are transient processes. However, it is difficult to make a transient measurement in an inpatient room because a cough exhalation lasts for less than 1 s [8] and a breathing cycle takes around 5 s, but measurements of contaminant concentration need around 10e20 s. Hence, our investigation simplified the coughing and breathing as constant processes, which means that the virus release was simulated at a constantly releasing rate. Coughing differs from breathing in velocity and direction. Coughing has a distinguished momentum and direction. Therefore, for simplicity, our study simulated breathing by introducing a contaminant source at negligible velocity. The usual sizes of the droplet nuclei exhaled by people differ much depending on the expiration modes [14] , however, droplets with big size would deposit to walls or floor very soon. The main size of the droplet transporting in air is in the range of 0.8e3 mm [15] . To simulate infectious disease viruses breathed out by a patient, this study used a tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride or SF 6 , and a monosize particle of 3 mm. Both of the contaminants were released at a constant rate at the mouth position of the patient. The studies by Chao et al. [16] indicated that the deposition fraction for this size range was less than 20% for 6 ACH flow in a hospital environment. Therefore, the current study assumed no deposition. The SF 6 tracer gas was in a 1% solution and was introduced at a constant flow rate of 300 mL/min. This investigation did not use large particles as they may be deposited quickly on the floor and may not be airborne. The releasing rate of the particles depended on the background concentration of the particles in the supply air and room air. Our experiment adjusted the releasing rate to ensure that the particle concentration in the room would be at least 100 times higher than the background concentration. This would eliminate the influence of the background particle concentration on the data. The particles were generated by a condensation Monodisperse Aerosol Generator (TSI Model 3475). To simulate the disease viruses from breathing, the SF 6 was introduced into a sponge sphere with a diameter of 4 cm, so the tracer gas was released into the room at a very low velocity and at a constant releasing rate. To simulate the disease viruses from coughing, a "coughing machine" was used that had a fan mixing the room air with SF 6 gas or particles, as shown in Fig. 2(a) . The outlet velocity of the coughing machine was 2.9 m/s, which was obtained by integrating one of the cough flow rates from the studies by Gupta et al. [8] and dividing it with the mouth opening area and the "mouth opening" was round, with a diameter of 0.02 m. The coughing position had a 50 angle upwards for the patient lying on a bed, as shown in Fig. 2(b) . To investigate the effect of different postures of a patient on contaminant distributions and the infection risk to the healthcare worker, two typical postures (supine and sitting) were studied, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3 , respectively. All the measurements were conducted under steady-state conditions. This implies that the breathing and coughing processes were continuous, which is of course not true in reality. However, the steady state would help to establish with high accuracy stable conditions for measurements. The experiment measured the air velocity and temperature with omni-directional anemometers at 3 poles (VT1, VT2, and VT3, as shown in Fig. 4) . The measurements were conducted at seven heights in each pole, namely 0.12, 0.35, 0.85, 1.35, 1.85, 2.35, and 2.60 m above the floor. The SF 6 and particle concentrations were measured in five poles in the room (TG1 through TG5, as shown in Fig. 4 ) at six different heights above the floor (0.12, 0.60, 1.10, 1.60, 2.10, and 2.60 m above the floor). A photoacoustic multi-gas analyzer (INNOVA model 1312) with a multipoint sampler (INNOVA model 1309) was used to measure the SF 6 concentration with an accuracy of 0.001 ppm. An aerodynamic particle sizer spectrometer (TSI model 3321) was used to measure the particle concentration with a size range from 2.642 to 3.523 mm for the 3-mm particles. bed. The results showed that the air velocity in the room with mixing ventilation was significantly higher than the velocity in the displacement ventilation in most areas. The air velocities in the room with displacement ventilation under different ventilation rates were almost the same except for the area close to the floor, marked in Fig. 5 , although the supply airflow rates were different. This indicates that the flow in the room with displacement ventilation was mainly created by thermal buoyancy, not the momentum from the diffuser. In fact, the air velocity from the diffuser was very low. Fig. 6 shows the airflow velocity profiles at several locations 5 cm away from the diffuser surface at an airflow rate of 4 ACH. The diffuser was supposed to produce a uniform airflow on its surface. However, the results showed that the velocity in the lower part of the diffuser was much higher than the velocity in the upper part. This is because the thermal buoyancy between the cool supply air and the warm room air caused a downward flow.
