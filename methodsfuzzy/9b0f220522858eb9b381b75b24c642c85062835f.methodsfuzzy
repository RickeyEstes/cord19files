The results of this study should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. Though the present findings indicate that PTG and positive mental health, negative mental health, and subjective physical health are associated (albeit modestly), only cross-sectional data were included in the analysis, which constrains causal inference. For example it is not clear if PTG leads to better psychological and physical health, or if these factors result in an enhanced perception of PTG. Furthermore, even though studies were included in the analysis only if they used a clear measure of PTG the final data set consisted of studies that used varying conceptions of PTG, which could be problematic. For example, past research has indicated that benefit finding and PTG are related but distinct constructs, and might therefore have unique predictors and outcomes (Sears et al., 2003) . Therefore, future research in the area should ascertain if such constructs are theoretically and empirically interchangeable. The present study did not examine type of illness as a moderator because there were not enough studies of HIV/AIDS to include cancer vs. HIV/AIDS as a moderator variable. Although research suggests that people with HIV/AIDS report similar levels and areas of PTG compared to individuals with cancer, there are unique differences between the illnesses, particularly in social responses to individuals with HIV/AIDS compared to those with cancer (Lechner & Weaver, 2009) . For example HIV/AIDS is an infectious disease and people who are HIV positive may face more stigma because of fear, lack of knowledge concerning transmission, and greater perceived accountability (Lechner & Weaver, 2009 ). This may hinder opportunities for emotional processing and therefore may not facilitate PTG and positive adjustment as readily as cancer and other illnesses. Furthermore, meta-analysis, like any other procedure, has its advantages and disadvantages, and this study is no exception. First, where authors of papers reported significant findings but did not include enough statistical information to calculate the effect size, these effect sizes were coded as zero. This is a conservative approach and therefore may have lowered the effect size estimate for each meta-analysis conducted. Second, as with many meta-analytic studies, the current findings may over represent those studies that are published and have significant results, preventing the generalization of the current findings to unpublished reports (Rosenthal, 1979) . For the overall effects, our publication bias analysis showed that the population effect size estimates were relatively unaffected when corrected for moderate selection bias. This finding gives us some confidence that the results are not idiosyncratic to our sample of studies. However, when correcting for severe publication bias the effect of growth on positive mental adjustment and physical health became strongly negative (the opposite direction to the population effects). Although this is a correction for severe publication bias, the current findings should be viewed within the context of these results.
