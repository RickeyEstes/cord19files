2.1. Material preparation 2.1.1. Pre-treatment of pristine PU A honeycomb PU piece (2 Â 2 Â 3 cm) was ultrasonicated for 20 min in toluene and ethanol to remove residuals on its surface, and then the cleaned PU was dried at 40°C under vacuum for 2 h. The dried PU was placed in a mixed solution of toluene (50 mL), toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) (5 mL), and anhydrous triethylamine (2 mL) in a 150-mL flask, and stirred continuously. The solution was then heated at 60°C for 1 h under nitrogen to introduce isocyanate groups (NCO) on the surface of the PU (reaction 1) [28] . After this procedure, the material was washed repeatedly with toluene and dried under nitrogen gas for 4 h at 60°C.
