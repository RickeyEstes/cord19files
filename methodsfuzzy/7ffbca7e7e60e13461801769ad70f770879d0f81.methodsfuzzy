As described in a report of a previous study (2) for which this study served as an extension, participants were recruited from a New York City tourist site frequented by both New York residents and tourists, thus providing a representative sample of visiting and local populations. Two rounds of participant recruitment were undertaken: the first from 29 April to 31 July 2016 (summer) (2) and the second from 28 January to 30 April 2017 (winter). All parts of the recruitment process (i.e., participant solicitation, consenting, surveying, and sampling) were performed during weekend days. Participants had to be over 18 to enroll and had to provide informed consent after reading a detailed description of the study (CUMC IRB AAAQ4358; AMNH IRB FWA00006768). Consented individuals were given a baseline survey, and one nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each nostril. Survey. Participants were surveyed with respect to demographic attributes, including age, gender, and race, as well for as other information, including reports of recent travel, preexisting medical conditions, allergies, self-reported propensity to get sick, and flu shot status. Data were also collected, per the common cold questionnaire (20) , on whether participants were experiencing symptoms (over the previous 48-h period) commonly related to respiratory infection: fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eye, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and chest pain. The severity level for each symptom was recorded on a Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe; scored at 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively), and a total symptom score was calculated by adding together the values for all 9 symptoms. Specimen collection and analysis. Nasopharyngeal swabs from both the left and right nasal cavities were collected from each participant using a Minitip flocked swab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). The samples were jointly stored in 2 ml DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) for up to 30 days at 4 to 25°C and were subsequently divided into 2 aliquots and stored at Ϫ80°C until assay. Nucleic acids were extracted from 200-l samples, with the addition of 10 l of MS2 bacteriophage as an internal control, using an easyMAG NucliSENS system (BioMérieux, Durham, NC). Samples were tested for infection using a multiplex PCR assay known as an eSensor XT-8 respiratory viral panel (RVP; GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive samples were identified using a threshold of 25 nA/mm 2 . The viruses detected by the XT-8 RVP include influenza A (any subtype), A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and AH1N1pdm2009 virus and influenza B virus; RSV A and B; PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; hMPV; HRV; adenovirus B/E and C; and CoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Definitions of asymptomatic infections. There is no standard definition of symptomatic infection, so several definitions were used so that the sensitivity of our findings could be tested. All definitions were based on self-reporting of symptom type and severity. Definition 1 consisted of reporting at least two symptoms, with at least one being moderate or severe (21) . Definition 2 required only one moderate to severe symptom. Definitions 3 to 7 were based only on fever, cough, and sore throat symptom reporting, as used to define influenza-like illnesses (22) . Definition 3 required at least one of those three symptoms to be moderate to severe. Definition 4 required moderate to severe fever and moderate to severe cough or sore throat. Definition 5 required mild to severe fever and mild to severe cough or sore throat. Definition 6 required moderate to severe fever and mild to severe cough or sore throat. Lastly, definition 7 required mild to severe fever and moderate to severe cough or sore throat. Statistical analysis. We conducted a range of statistical tests to identify associations between various demographic factors and both symptom scores and viral positivity. For categorical variables, such as gender and age group, we used ANOVA and Tukey tests to determine whether there were statistical differences in the average symptom scores between categories of the variable. We used chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to compare differences across each categorical variable with respect to positivity. We performed univariate and multivariate regression to test associations between each set of variables (race, gender, age group, allergies, travel, residence, and Hispanic self-identification) and quantitated positivity scores (measured in nanoangstroms per square millimeter) for all viruses and for HRV and CoV separately. Logistic regression was used to conduct a similar analysis on associations between the demographic variables and positivity as a binary variable (positive versus negative) for all viruses and for HRV and CoV separately. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to identify the best-fitting models.
