The SAXS and SANS measurements, as well as details of the data analysis, have been described in detail elsewhere (Kuzmanovic et al., 2006 (Kuzmanovic et al., , 2003 . The Mw of the MS2 was obtained from the forward scattering intensity, I(Q=0), with Q= 4p sin(y)/l, where l is the neutron wavelength and 2y is the scattering angle. Both the Guinier approximation, I(Q)=I(0) exp(ÀQ 2 Rg 2 /3), used on the low-Q portions of the data, and the GNOM program (Semenyuk and Svergun, 1991) , which makes use of all of the data, were used to obtain values for the radius of gyration, Rg, and the forward scattering intensity, I(0), of the samples. The total Mw of the MS2 was then calculated from I(0) using the equation where Dr ¼ (rÀr s ) is the contrast or the difference between the scattering length density of the molecule (r) and the solvent (r s ), n is the number density of MS2 and V is the volume of the MS2 particles. The number density can be written as n ¼ cN A /Mw, where c is the concentration and N A is Avogadro's number. The volume can be written where d is the mass density. Now, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as The only unknown parameter in Eq. (4) is the Mw, since all other parameters can be measured or calculated. The I(0) value is generally taken from the GNOM (Semenyuk and Svergun, 1991) analysis of the data. Both c and d can be directly measured during sample preparation and Dr can be calculated from the chemical composition of the sample and solvent. It is important to note that I(0) must be on an absolute scale, usually in cm À1 , in order to obtain accurate Mw values from Eq. (3) or (4). The SANS data were placed on an absolute scale, in cm À1 , by normalizing the scattered intensity to the incident beam flux, which is independent of prior knowledge of the Mw of MS2 or the concentration of the sample. On the other hand, the SAXS data were put on an absolute scale by comparing the scattered intensity of the MS2 sample at Q=0 to that calculated using the known Mw, scattering length density and volume of the RNA and coat protein components, as verified by earlier SANS studies (Kuzmanovic et al., 2003) . Since this method is not independent of prior knowledge of the Mw of the MS2 sample, the SAXS data could not be used to obtain an unbiased determination of the Mw of MS2. At the resolution level of the SAS measurements, MS2 has been shown to be approximated very well by a spherical shell, with inner radius, R1, outer radius, R2, and shell thickness, t ¼ R2ÀR1 (Kuzmanovic et al., 2003) . Thus, the SAXS and SANS data were fit to a core-shell sphere model in order to obtain the radii of the protein shell and the solvent core (Hayter, 1983) . The core-shell model fits take into account the resolution function of the SANS and SAXS instruments. The outer radius, R2, was taken as the total size of the MS2 particles and is used for comparison to size parameters obtained from other techniques.
