We performed an exhaustive descriptive prospective crosssectional study of children aged 0 and 24 months admitted with ALRTI to the paediatric department of the Blida University Hospital. The study was carried out between 21 December 2010 and 1 April 2011. The province of Blida is located 50 km west of Algiers; its population is estimated at 1085000 inhabitants, including 140000 children younger than 5 years, living in rural or urban areas. The study population was composed of children aged 15 days to 24 months with an ALRTI that required hospitalization in the pzaediatric department. Infants younger than 15 days old and children older than 2 years were excluded from the study. Acuteness of infection was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms for less than 2 weeks. ALRTI is diagnosed in the presence of fever or hypothermia associated with at least one of the following symptoms: polypnoea, wheezing, abnormalities in pulmonary listening or friction. Hospitalization criteria are based on the presence of at least one of the following signs: rapid breathing (>60 breaths per minute), chest recession, cyanosis, disturbance of consciousness and eating disorders. Respiratory distress was considered as mild, moderate or severe depending on the intensity of the following parameters: respiratory rate, labored breathing, cyanosis, wheezing or crackles. Associated risk factors (very young age, prematurity) or comorbidity (heart disease, neuromuscular disease, severe malnutrition) may have constituted hospitalization criteria. We sought to identify the viruses responsible for ALRTI. All children hospitalized during this period were systematically sampled by nasal or nasopharyngeal aspiration for the following respiratory viruses: influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3. The sample was taken at the time of hospitalization and stored at 4°C until it was sent to the influenza and respiratory virus laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Sidi Fredj. Each swab was collected and placed in a tube containing 2 mL of virus transport medium (Becton Dickinson, USA). All samples were tested by real-time PCR and conventional PCR. An aliquot of 450 μL was tested for the presence of the influenza virus, then for RSV and HMPV. Another aliquot was used for conventional multiplex PCR for rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43, 229E) and parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3. The rest of the sample was stored at −80°C for 1 year. The virus identification techniques used are provided in Supplementary Material S1. For each child under 2 years of age hospitalized for ALRTI, a preestablished standard questionnaire was completed (Supplementary Material S2). The infant's identification and the data necessary to meet the study objectives were reported. Then a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample was taken via swab (Supplementary Material S1). Each swab was labelled with the child's full name and was accompanied by the clinical information sheet. Samples were sent to the reference laboratory within 1 week from the day of sampling to be stored at 4°C. Parental consent was obtained before nasal or nasopharyngeal sampling was performed. We studied two main criteria. The first criterion was the proportion of children with identified respiratory tropism virus, both overall and according to different age groups. The second criterion was the proportion of children in whom the following were identified: influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, HMPV and parainfluenza virus. For the secondary criterion, for each virus identified, we studied the average positivity rate and its evolution over the study period depending on age and sex.
