A thorough search of the Medline database was performed on published reports on the human pathology of SARS and avian influenza A subtype H5N1. The terms used in the search were combination of severe acute respiratory syndrome or avian influenza (as subject heading) and pathology (as keyword but not subject heading). Original pathology reports were the primary target of this review, but clinical reports with pathology findings were also included if contributory. All the English full-text reports were retrieved and reviewed. A few original pathology reports in Chinese were excluded. The pathology of the 2 diseases was separately summarized and then compared. The pathology material on 2 postmortem cases of SARS, 1 liver biopsy from a patient with SARS, and 2 full postmortem cases of H5N1 examined by the authors were incorporated in this review and used in the figures, which are newly taken photomicrographs. These cases have all been previously reported. The pathology material used in the illustration was from standard paraffin blocks processed for hematoxylin and eosin sections. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded sections were used. The antigen retrieval process was done by wet heating of sections in a pressure cooker. The primary antibodies used were from mouse and the secondary antibody was from rabbit. The reaction was detected by a peroxidase method using the DAKO detection kit on DAKO Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark) . The manufacturer and dilution of the antibodies  used were as follows: CD3, DAKO, 1:150; CD20, DAKO,  1:750; CD30, DAKO, 1:5; CD56, ZYMED, 1:250; CD68,  DAKOPATTS, 1:2500; AE1/AE3, DAKO, 1:30. 3.
