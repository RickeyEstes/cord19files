We performed a prospective cohort study at the Hospital Severo Ochoa (Leganés, Madrid) to assess the incidence, aetiology and clinical characteristics of viral respiratory infections in neonates that required admission to the NICU for 2 or more weeks. Patients were enrolled between November 2011 and May 2013. The study was funded by grant number 09/00246 of the Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital Severo Ochoa. The parents signed an informed consent form before patients were included in the study. We collected a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) sample the first day of life and weekly until discharge. When infants developed respiratory symptoms such as cough, respiratory distress, rhinorrhoea and longer than usual apnoeic pauses with or without fever, an additional NPA sample was collected at the moment. The neonatologist filled out a clinical form for each episode. The NPA specimens were sent to the Unidad de Virus Respiratorios y Gripe (Unit of Respiratory Viruses and Influenza) of the Centro Nacional de Gripe (National Influenza Centre) of the World Health Organisation, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, in Madrid, Spain. This unit subjected the specimens to three nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the detection of a total of 16 respiratory viruses, as reported in previous publications. 8--- 10 We have expressed discrete variables as percentages and continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation (SD). We compared the variables corresponding to clinical and laboratory characteristics by means of Student's t test, the Mann---Whitney U test, the 2 test and Fisher's exact test. We set the level of statistical significance (for two-tailed tests) at P < .05. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 13.0.
