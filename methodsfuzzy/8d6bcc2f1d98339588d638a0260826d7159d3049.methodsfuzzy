Patients were recruited between 2009 and 2014. To qualify for the study, those with typical cDGS had a maximum T-cell count of 50 3 10 6 /L, no naive T cells, and an absent proliferative response to PHA. Patients with atypical cDGS had less than 5% naive CD4 cells (CD45RA 1 CD27 1 or CD45RA 1 CD62L 1 ) . In addition, there had to be at least 1 of the following features: congenital heart disease, hypoparathyroidism, hemizygosity for 22q.11 deletion, or CHARGE syndrome. For further patient details, see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Patients with typical cDGS without clonal expansion were not given any immunosuppression. In those with atypical cDGS, cyclosporine was used before transplantation to control inflammatory disease, and this was continued after transplantation. These patients were also treated with 3 doses of 2 mg/kg body weight rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG; Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass) and 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone administered intravenously for 4 days, followed by 1 mg/kg oral prednisolone for 5 days. Patients referred who were already on artificial ventilation and those with severe neurological defects likely to be life-limiting were excluded from the study. In patients with congenital heart disease requiring corrective cardiac surgery, thymus transplantation was delayed until at least 1 month after surgery, or cardiac surgery was delayed until at least 3 months after thymus transplantation. Patients continued their routine antibiotic prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole and fluconazole until a CD4 count of greater than 300 3 10 6 /L and a normal mitogen response were achieved. Replacement doses of immunoglobulin were administered for a minimum of 2 years after thymus transplantation. Additionally, during winter months, patients received monthly intramuscular injections of palivizumab as prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus.
