As each group managed the simulated patients, 2 skilled observers experienced with simulator experience observed their actions. Time to completion of predesignated critical actions was recorded by faculty running the patient simulators. The simulation software is programmed to capture the times when observers noted that critical actions were performed. Each subject completed questionnaire 1 after each simulation run ( Figure E3 , available online at http://www.annemergmed. com) and questionnaire 2 ( Figure E4 , available online at http:// www.annemergmed.com) after completing both simulation runs of a critical care scenario.
