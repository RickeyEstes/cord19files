A 10 ml aliquot from each reaction was run on a 3% Nu-Sieve 3:1 electrophoresis-grade agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, Maine, USA) in 1Ã‚ TAE buffer (0.04 mol/l Tris acetate, 0.001 mol/l EDTA) with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/ml) to visualize the amplified PCR products under UV-illumination. Procedures for avoiding contamination were strictly followed. DNA/RNA isolation, preparation of reaction mixtures, and amplification and analysis were physically separated and performed in three different rooms. Positive displacement tips were used for all manipulation and negative controls containing reaction mixtures without DNA were always done.
