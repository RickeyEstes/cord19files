All FIP-positive cats were sampled from different geographic locations, with the exception of 2 cats (USP17 and USP18) that lived in the same house. USP17 was euthanized 1 month prior to USP18 due to FIP related reasons. In parallel, faecal samples were also obtained from 2 cats (USP2, and USP14) without clinical signs of FIP and from two different locations not related to the locations from the FIP+ cats. This study has been approved by Commission on Ethics on Animal Use from School of Veterinary Medicine, University of SÃ£o Paulo (CEUA N. 2055211113).
