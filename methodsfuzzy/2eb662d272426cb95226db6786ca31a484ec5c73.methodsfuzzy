In vitro assays are the preliminary step toward the identification of antiviral activity of a plant extract or phytocompounds. These assays measure the ability of a virus to infect and replicate in specific cell lines and the response of a particular extract toward the relevant virus infection. The cell culture system provides a rapid and less cumbersome method for the growth of viruses at higher titers, testing of cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy, maintenance of cultures, and genetic manipulations. The cell lines characterized and routinely used for common viruses along with their respective methods are given in Table 8 Ophiorrhiza nicobarica Rubiaceae Harmaline Inhibit IE gene synthesis [10, 11] Rhus javanica Anacardiaceae Moronic acid Anti-HSV-1 and -HSV-2 [28] Achyranthes aspera Amaranthaceae Oleanolic acid Anti-HSV-1 and -HSV-2 [12] Odina wodier Anacardiaceae Chlorogenic acid Prevent attachment [29] Mallotus peltatus Euphorbiaceae Ursolic acid HSV replication [30] Terminalia chebula Combretaceae Chebulagic acid, punicalagin Inhibit entry and cell spread [31] Ilex Gentiana lutea Gentianaceae e Anti-RSV [55] Cimicifuga foetida L.

This initial evaluation is usually done at a twofold concentration (with a 10-fold difference, e.g., 1 and 10 ng/ml or mg/ml). An 18 h culture (80e90% confluency) of an appropriate cell line should be added with the test drug or placebo, immediately after the virus infection. When the drug effect was tested as pretreatment, cells need to be treated with the test drug for 15e180 min before virus infection, and incubated Here, the uninfected cell monolayer treated with the test drug will provide an idea of the maximum dose of drug causing minimum cell toxicity, as enlargement, granularity, rounding off, detachment, etc., and the degree of cytotoxicity as T (100% toxic), PVH (partially very heavy toxic, 80%), PH (partially heavy toxic, 60%), P (partial toxic 40%), PS (partial slightly toxic, 20%), or 0 (nontoxic, 0%). A 50% cell inhibitory or cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and 50% end point of virus inhibitory or effective concentration (EC 50 ) can be determined from a graph plotted with the concentration versus cellular effect due to virus infection, while the selectivity or therapeutic index (SI or TI) is calculated as CC 50 /EC 50 . 30 min at 4 C, because the viruses with neuraminidase activity will detach from the RBCs, and then the lattice-forming parts will be counted to calculate the titer as Virus concentration/ml ¼ 10 7 X HA titer. Protocol: The RBCs separated from blood is collected in Alseiver's solution (20.5 g dextrose, 8 .0 g sodium citrate dihydrate, 4.2 g sodium chloride, and 0.55 g citric acid per liter, pH 6.1) and kept overnight at 4 C. The cells are washed with PBS (2X), and the quantity of the cell pack (2.0 ml blood yields 0.5e1.0 ml pack) is measured in 10% suspension with PBS. The RBC solution (0.75%) in PBS (0.75 ml 10% RBCs in 10 ml PBS, pH 7.2) is added to each well of a 96-well plate, except for the first well of each row, along with the antigen (culture fluid containing virus from drug-treated and untreated controls) to the first two wells of each row. A twofold dilution (transferring 50 ml from the second well of each column A2-K2 to A3-K3) is mixed with 0.75% RBCs (50 ml) in all wells, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The cell control needs to be checked for the complete settling of the RBCs, and the results are recorded in the HA sheet. The RBCs form a button or ring at the bottom of the wells that is recorded as "O," while hemagglutination (RBCs remain in suspension) is recorded as a þ symbol. The highest dilution of virus that causes complete hemagglutination is considered as the end point. The HA titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of the virus in the last well with complete hemagglutination (Figure 8.4) .
