Viruses and cells. MHV-A59 was grown in 17CL-1 cells as previously described (Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983) . SD and SK viruses (Burks et al., 1980) were obtained from Dr. J. Gerdes and were also grown in 17CL-1 cells. HCV-229E was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in human embryonic lung (L-132) cells also obtained from the ATCC. These viruses were plaque purifled two times and grown in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Robb and Bond, 1979) . HCV-OC43 was obtained as a 20% suckling mouse brain suspension from Dr. J. Hierholzer at the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta. It was inoculated intracerebrally into C57BL/6 suckling mice, harvested 2 days later, and a 10% brain suspension was made in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.75% bovine serum albumen. The mothers of the suckling mice were obtained from Jackson Labs as MHV-free animals. All were negative for antibodies against MHV-A59 (as de-termined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and HCV-OC43 (as shown by a lack of 0C43 hemagglutination inhibiting activity in the sera of these animals (Hierholzer et al., 1969) ) and thus were considered uninfected by these coronaviruses. Virus in brain homogenates was assayed by hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells at room temperature (Hierholzer et al., 1969) . Virus was further verified as HCV-OC43 since hemagglutination was inhibited by an anti-0C43 reference antisera obtained from CDC. HCV-OC43 was also grown in human rectal tumor (HRT) cells (Laporte et al., 1980) obtained from Dr. David Brian. Infected mouse brain homogenates were adsorbed onto monolayers of HRT cells for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were extensively washed, medium added, and the cells incubated at 33 ~ Virus in the supernatant was titered at various times postinfection by hemagglutination (Hierholzer et al., 1969) . Mock-infected cells were adsorbed with a brain homogenate from uninfected suckling mice. cDNA probes, cDNAs were synthesized using purified genome RNA as template, oligomers of calf thymus DNA as primers, and reverse transcriptase (Taylor et al., 1976) . cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP to specific activity of approximately l0 s cpm/#g. When used for liquid hybridization, cDNA was synthesized in the presence of actinomycin D and was >95% single stranded. Such cDNAs were validated to be highly virus specific and to represent the majority of the genome RNA as previously described in detail Leibowitz, 1981, 1983) . RNA extraction. MHV-A59, SD, SK, and HCV-229E virus infections were carried out with a multiplicity of infection of between 0.1 and 1 plaque-forming units per cell. RNA was extracted 18 hr after infection with A59, SD, and SK viruses, when massive syncytia were present. 229E-infected cells were labeled with [3H]uridine in the presence of 10 ttg/ml actinomycin D from 18 to 24 hr postinfection when RNA was extracted. RNA was extracted from OC43-infected HRT cells at 3 days post-infection. RNA was extracted from the cytoplasm of infected cells by SDS-proteinase K treatment followed by phenol extraction as previously described (Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983) . RNA was extracted from suckling mouse brain homogenates by SDS-proteinase K treatment followed by phenol extraction (Weiss, Varmus and Bishop, 1977) . RNA analysis. (1) Gel electrophoresis. RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, in the presence of methyl mercury hydroxide (Bailey and Davidson, 1976) or formaldehyde (Lehrach et al., 1977) as denaturant. Gels were either fluorographed with sodium salicylate (Chamberlain, 1979) or blotted onto nitrocellulose (Thomas, 1980) . (2) Blots. Dot blots. RNA was adsorbed onto nitrocellulose filters in various amounts (as designated in figure legends), dried, and the filters were baked and hybridized with cDNA (Thomas, 1980) . Northern blots: RNA was electrophoresed in gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with cDNA (Alwine et al., 1977; Thomas, 1980) . (3) Hybridization in solution was carried out at 68 ~ 0.6 MNaC1, and assayed by $1 nuclease digestion as previously described (Leong et aL, 1972) . In Crt curves, increasing amounts of RNA were hybridized with a fixed amount of cDNA to achieve increasing Crt values where Crt = concentration of RNA â€¢ time of hybridization.
