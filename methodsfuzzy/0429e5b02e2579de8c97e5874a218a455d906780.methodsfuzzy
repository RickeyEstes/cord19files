There are three main approaches for automated CC syndrome classification: supervised learning, rule-based classification, and ontology-enhanced classification. The supervised learning methods require CC records to be labeled with syndromes before being used for model training. Naive Bayesian [8] [9] [10] and Bayesian network [4] models are two examples of the supervised learning methods studied. One prerequisite of supervised learning methods is collecting a sufficient amount of training records, which is usually costly and time-consuming. Another major disadvantage of supervised learning methods is the lack of flexibility. New syndromic definitions may be required by public health practitioners as new events may indicate new surveillance focuses. However, it is often difficult to produce new training data for new syndromic definitions. Rule-based classification methods do not require labeled training data. Such methods typically have two stages. In the first stage, CC records are cleaned up and transformed to an intermediate representation called "symptom groups" by either a symptom grouping table (SGT) lookup or keyword matching. In the second stage, a set of rules is used to map the intermediate symptom groups to final syndromic categories. For instance, the EARS system (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/surveillance/ears/) uses 42 rules for such mappings. A major advantage of rule-based classification methods is their simplicity. The syndrome classification rules and intermediate SGTs can be constructed using a top-down approach. The "white box" nature of these methods makes system maintenance and fine-tuning easy for system designers and users. In addition, these methods are flexible. Adding new syndromic categories or changing syndromic definitions can be achieved relatively easily by switching the inference rules. The SGTs can typically be shared across hospitals. A major problem with rule-based classification methods is that they cannot handle symptoms that are not included in the SGTs. For example, a rule-based system may have a SGT containing the symptoms "abdominal pain" and "stomach ache." This system, however, will not be able to handle "epi-gastric pain" even though "epigastric pain" is closely related to "abdominal pain." The BioPortal CC classifier [11, 12] is designed to address this vocabulary problem using an ontology-enhanced approach. The semantic relations in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a medical ontology, are used to increase the performance of a rule-based chief complaint classification system. At the core of this approach is the UMLS-based weighted semantic similarity score (WSSS) grouping method that is capable of automatically assigning symptoms previously un-encountered to appropriate symptom groups. In most chief complaint classifier studies, the performance of chief complaint classification methods is measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), F measure, and F2 measure [4, 5, 8, 13, 14] . The F measure is a weighted harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity. In the context of syndromic surveillance, sensitivity is often considered more important than precision and specificity [4] . The F2 measure gives sensitivity twice as much weight as precision and thus can reflect this emphasis on sensitivity. In our previous study dealing with English CC records, we showed that the ontology-enhanced approach can achieve a higher level of sensitivity, F measure, and F2 measure when compared to a rule-based system that had the same symptom grouping table and syndrome rules [11] . Little research has focused on non-English CC classifications. One straightforward extension is adding non-English keywords into existing English CC classification systems. For instance, this approach has been applied to process Spanish CCs in EARS [15] . However, for other languages (such as Oriental languages), it would be difficult to incorporate them in an English-based system. It is also possible to use International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes instead of free-text CCs to classify ED records. ICD-9 codes are standardized, widely used, and can be more accurate than CCs in terms of reflecting true patient illness. Wu et al. used ICD-9 codes attached to ED records to classify Chinese CCs into eight syndromic categories [16, 17] . However, as ICD-9 codes are primarily used for billing purposes, they are not always informative for syndromic surveillance [18, 19] . As such, freetext CCs remain one of the most important data sources for syndromic surveillance [20] .
