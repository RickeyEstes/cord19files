An exploratory, qualitative study was undertaken using a method described by Denzin. 20 A semistructured interview protocol was developed and piloted using 4 volunteer participants. Upon revision, the protocol and study were reviewed by the Ethics Review Board, and approval was received to continue with the study. Pharmacists were recruited for this study through advertisements at local continuing professional development events, where a general description of the study objectives and processes was provided. Those who were interested in participating were contacted by a research assistant who provided further details regarding the study, explained confidentiality provisions, and then completed signed informed consent. After completion of the consent procedure, participants scheduled a 30-to 45-minute telephone-based interview time with a research assistant. All participants were assured that interviews were confidential, that no identifying data or names would be presented, and that their anonymity was ensured. In order to participate in this study, pharmacists were required to have been practicing as a pharmacist in a direct patient-care setting in Toronto for at least 25 h/wk during March 2003 to June 2003 (SARS) and August 2004 (blackout). No exclusion criteria were established because the inclusion criteria were deemed to be clear and comprehensive enough. All interviews were recorded using a digital recorder and were transcribed verbatim. An initial coding structure was developed by all investigators. Analysis proceeded using a method described by Chi 21 for coding and categorization of qualitative data. Briefly, this method involved the use of interative analysis of a random sample representing approximately 10% of the data by 2 independent reviewers until agreement on a coding structure was achieved. Once an agreed-upon coding structure had been developed, 2 independent reviewers analyzed another sample of data representing approximately 10% of the data using the coding structure. Where disagreements in coding occurred, a third reviewer was available to adjudicate differences. On the basis of this analysis, revisions to the original coding structure were undertaken to allow for development of a final coding tree. All remaining transcripts (representing approximately 80% of the data) were subsequently read and reviewed by 2 independent investigators; where disagreements in coding occurred, a third researcher was available to adjudicate, using the agreed-upon coding structure. In this way, reliability of analysis is strengthened while minimizing the number of different reviewers required to analyze data. This method of analysis has been used to interpret data collected from a variety of different data-gathering methods, including focus groups and interviews. Data were managed and stored using the software program Knowledge Forum v3 (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada).
