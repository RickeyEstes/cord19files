Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for positive and negative tests were calculated by standard methods. Sensitivity and specificity were defined as the probability that the target assay result was positive when the IFAs specific to REBOV-NP and -GP and NT showed positive and the probability that the target assay result was negative when the IFAs and NT showed negative, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and two graph-ROC (TG-ROC) curves were analyzed using Stat Flex software (Artech Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) [36, 37] . To examine the agreement between the serological assays used in the present study, we employed Friedman test with Dunn's post-hoc test [38, 39] using GraphPad Prism using pair-wise comparisons in nonparametric one-way ANOVA.
