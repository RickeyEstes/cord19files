Patients A major outbreak of SARS occurred in the Prince of Wales Hospital of Hong Kong in March 2003, affecting more than 100 health care workers and hospitalized patients. 2 This is a retrospective study that evaluated the enteric manifestations of the first 138 consecutive patients of this cohort. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University Hong Kong. The diagnosis of SARS was based on the criteria defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. 16, 17 Briefly, SARS is defined by the presence of fever (38°C or higher), cough, or shortness of breath that is associated with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography or high-resolution computed tomography in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation. A history of contact with patients with SARS is also required. The clinical course of these patients on presentation and their subsequent hospital stay, including supplementary oxygen requirement, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation, were recorded. Enteric symptoms, particularly diarrhea (defined as passing loose stool Ͼ3 times per day), were noted. All patients were kept in the hospital for a minimum of 21 days from the onset of symptoms for public health reasons.
