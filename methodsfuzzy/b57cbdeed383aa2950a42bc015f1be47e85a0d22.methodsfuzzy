Extractions were performed following the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that 7 µl of linear polyacrylamide (Sigma) were added to the sample before the lysis step instead of the RNA-carrier supplied in the kit. Nucleic acids were eluted in 60 µl RNAse-free saline buffer, 7 µl were immediately used for reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction using ssIII-RT (Life tech) and hexamers. Five µl of RT product were then used as template in a 25 µl semi-nested PCR reaction resulting in the amplification of a 440 / 220 (first PCR / nested PCR) nucleotide fragment of the RNA-dependent-RNA-Polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) coding region. The homemade semi-nested PCR protocols and primers designed to detect a broad range of coronaviruses were described previously (Gouilh et al., 2011) and allow to obtain fragments of the polymerase (nsp12) ranging from 121 to 393 nucleotides after primer and quality trimming. Briefly, the first PCR (PCR 1) used BatCoV pol 15197 (forward: 5′-GGTTGGGAYTAYCCWAARTGTGA-3′) and Bat-CoV pol 15635 (reverse: 5′-CCATCRTCMGAHARAATCATC-ATA-3′) primers; the second semi-nested PCR (PCR 2) used BatCoV pol nested 15419 (forward nested primer: 5′-GCNAATWSTGTNTTTAA-CAT-3′) and the PCR 1 reverse primer. For both PCRs (PCR 1 and the semi-nested PCR 2) the pcr programs were composed of 3 min of denaturation at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles including 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50°C (with a touch-down of 0.7°C per cycle during the first 10 cycles) and 30 s at 72°C. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 8 min. Bat Cyt-b sequences were amplified by PCR (Puechmaille et al., 2007) for all coronavirus-positive samples in order to confirm the host species and for a representative number of coronavirus-negative samples, to evaluate co-roosting. The PCR products were revealed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and were sequenced using Big-Dye v1.1 chemistry on an ABI-3730XL sequencer. Resulting chromatograms were trimmed, analysed and assembled using the CLC Main Workbench software v7 (Qiagen) and cleaned sequences were submitted to a BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) in GenBank.
