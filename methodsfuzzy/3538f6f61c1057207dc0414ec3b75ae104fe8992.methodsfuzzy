The use of statistical methods in Chinese medical journals has been improving [84] . According to Wang and Zhang [84] , the percentages of original articles reporting clinical trials, prospective studies, or basic science research increased from 18% in 1985 to 31% in 1995 ( p < 0.001), of articles using statistical methods increased from 40% in 1985 to 60% in 1995 ( p < 0.001), and of those articles using appropriate statistical methods increased from 22% to 46% ( p < 0.001). In both 1985 and 1995, the most commonly used statistical methods in the Chinese medical journals were t tests and contingency tables [84] . According to Wang and Zhang [84] , the most common errors the Chinese authors committed were presentations of p values without specifying the test used, use of multiple t tests instead of analysis of variance, and use of unpaired t tests when paired tests were required.
