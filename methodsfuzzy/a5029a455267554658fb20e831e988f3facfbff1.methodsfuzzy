In the absence of freely available, officially published time-series data on the origins and destinations of scheduled commercial passenger flights into and out of South Africa, the research used flight timetable summaries produced monthly for the countryÕs travel industry (GSA Magazine, 1994 . The data provide a comprehensive but unofficial record of ÔdirectÕ (single carrier operated, but not necessarily non-stop) scheduled flights to and from the Republic. The published data show scheduled flights to and from a list of 48 African airports (outside South Africa) and 41 overseas airports for each day of the week in the month of publication. Listing flights day-by-day for just one week in a month, the compilation assumes there are no flight alterations from week to week during the month. The listings do not show how many of each of the days there are in each publication month, so multiplying the weekly number of flights by four to arrive at a monthly total may be misleading. Aggregation would misrepresent flight patterns that changed markedly within a month. Annualising such ÔmonthlyÕ data would undercount actual flight totals because the arithmetic would yield information for only 48 weeks in a year. Extrapolating ÔweeklyÕ flight data into annual flight counts would fail to account for air links that only lasted a short time within or between months. Published in advance of actual flights, the data (unlike official air traffic records) includes flights that were rescheduled or cancelled for technical, logistical, financial or security reasons. Any resulting inaccuracies would overlook particularly the performance vulnerability of small regional carriers operating few aircraft. The published data would also be slow to reflect the case of mid-month withdrawal of intercontinental service operated by airlines that suddenly ceased flying because of bankruptcy (e.g. Alliance, Austrian, Swissair, Sabena), or air services that were abruptly terminated because of political violence (e.g. in West, Central and East Africa). Similarly, new air links would not be recorded precisely if they commenced mid-month, if the announcement of the start date was wrong, or if the notification was too late to meet the publication deadline. The focus here is more on origins and destinations than airlines, so it matters less that the published lists are slow to record any mid-month airline rationalisation, mergers or codesharing that does not disrupt the geography of flight links. The most comprehensive picture of air route developments in the decade would have entailed analysis of the origin and frequency of every incoming flight, and the destination and frequency of every outgoing flight for 120 months between January 1994 and December 2003. In view of the data flaws, the uncertain returns from capturing every piece of flight information, and the laborious and error-prone process of manually transcribing 150, 120 items of data, the listings were sampled to detect major trends. Flight information for the decade 1994-2003 was collected for four equally-spaced years, 1994, 1997, 2000 and 2003 . The two end years coincide with the start and end of the first decade of democratic rule in South Africa. Detailed information about the non-South African origin and destination of weekly flights was collected for January, April, July and October in each of the four years. These four sample months coincide approximately with the summer (December-February) and winter (July-August) high and low seasons for tourist air traffic, and with the intermediate shoulder seasons. The reasonableness of the 33% annual sampling was validated for the year 2000: there were only minor discrepancies between a full count of ÔweeklyÕ flights in all months of that year and the Ôgrossed upÕ four-month totals. Spreadsheets comprising 20,160 items formed the basis of the study. The effective sampling rate for the decade is 13%.
