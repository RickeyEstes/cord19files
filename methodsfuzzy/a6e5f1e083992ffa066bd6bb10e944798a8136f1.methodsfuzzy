It was found that the main source of aerosol particles in Shanghai are coal combustion, metallurgic dust and vehicle exhaust [13] . Samples of coal combustion were collected at Shi Dong Kou power plant, the largest coal-fired power plant in Shanghai. Samples of car exhaust were collected from a Santana 3000 car on the engine test bench using model CYQ-26 air sampler at Shanghai Institute of Internal-combustion Engine. Samples of metallurgic dust were collected from a converter for steelmaking at Bao Steel, the largest steel industry in Shanghai. The particles were delivered depressively to a 0.3 lm thick Mylar film adhered to an aluminum frame with a hole of diameter 10 mm for TXM experiments. The TXM experiments were performed at beam-line 32-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab, IL, USA. A schematic of the experimental setup is provided in Fig.1 . The electron storage ring was run at 7 GeV 102 mA. Monochromatic X-rays were produced using a double-bounced Si(1 1 1) monochromator and double-reflection vertical harmonic rejection mirrors. A set of elliptically shaped glass capillary condenser (73 mm in length and with an inner diameter ranging from 0.90 to 0.84 mm) was used to focus the incident X-rays on a sample. The sample is rotated through 180 degrees with sample projections produced at specified angle intervals and exposure times. X-rays transmitted through the sample are magnified by a Fresnel zone plate objective lens and captured by a high resolution charge couple device (CCD). In this full-field X-ray transmission measurements, the condenser with the inner diameter of 0.9 mm was chosen to maximize the vertical acceptance of the undulator beam at 65 m from the source. An Au Fresnel zone plate with a 45 nm outmost-zone width and 900 nm thickness was used as an objective lens to produce a magnified image of the sample on an optically coupled high resolution charge-coupled (CCD) device system. The estimated flux of monochromatic X-ray passed from a Si(1 1 1) double crystal monochromator and focused by the condenser was 2 Â 10 11 /s at 8 keV. The high brightness and the optimized condensers design to yield an excellent imaging throughput of 50 ms/frame with $1 Â 10 4 charge coupled device counts per pixel. Spatial resolution for this TXM setup is around 30 nm. For three-dimensional images by X-ray nanotomography, a total of 141 sequential tomographic images (2D) were automatically collected from À90 to +90 degree with a 50 ms per image measurement time at X-ray energy of 8.0 keV. The image reconstruction was performed using the IDL code. All reconstructed images were treated by using the Amira 5.2 code to build three dimensional images. Details of this TXM system are provided by Shen et al. and Grew et al. [14, 15] .
