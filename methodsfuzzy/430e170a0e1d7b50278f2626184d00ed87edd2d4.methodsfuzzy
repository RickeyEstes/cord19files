Cloning and sequencing of the TaV genome TaV was purified from frozen infected Setothosea asigna larvae supplied by Dr Bernhard Zelazny, Integrated Coconut Pest Control Project, Jakarta, Indonesia. Virus purification and RNA extraction were as described. 23 A TaV cDNA library was prepared and a 2200 nt clone containing a portion of the TaV RdRp was isolated previously. 23 Here, the plasmid library was screened by colony blotting using the original clone as a probe, and by PCR of the clone library to isolate the remainder of the replicase gene using RdRp-specific primers and universal forward or reverse primers. All nt sequences were confirmed on two separate clones or by sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from viral genomic RNA.
