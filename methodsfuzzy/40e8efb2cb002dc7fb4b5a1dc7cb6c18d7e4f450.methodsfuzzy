2.1. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification and cloning Total RNA was extracted from an isolate of atypical bovine pestivirus Th/04 KhonKaen (Liu et al., 2009a) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA synthesis was primed randomly by 1 M hexamer in a 20-l volume using 200 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The reaction was performed at 50 • C for 60 min and the enzyme was inactivated at 85 • C for 5 min. The RNA strand of the cDNA was removed by 2 units of Escherichia coli RNase H (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37 • C for 20 min. Two microliters of cDNA were used for amplification of the E rns gene region in a 25-l reaction volume, including 12.5 l of water, 2.5 l of 10× buffer, 2 l of 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 l of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, MO, USA), 2.5 l of 10 M each primer and 1.25 U PfuUltra DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The nucleotide sequences of primers were 5 -GAGAACATAACACAATGGAATTTGAAAG-3 (forward) and 5 -TGCATGAGCCCCGAACC-3 (reverse). The thermo profile was 35 cycles of 94 • C for 40 s, 49 • C for 40 s, 72 • C for 40 s. The amplified PCR product (681 bp) was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The excised fragment was purified using PCR cleanup system kit (Promega, Co., Madison, WI) and cloned into pFastBac/HBM-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the positive plasmids designed as pFastBacHBM-E rns were verified by DNA sequencing.
