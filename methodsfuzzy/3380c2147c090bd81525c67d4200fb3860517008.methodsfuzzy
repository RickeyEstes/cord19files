Animals BALB/c 6-week old male mice were purchased from Japan SLC Co. (Shizuoka, Japan) and used at 7-week. Animal care was performed according to ethical guidelines, and approved by the Institutional Board Committee for Animal Care and Use of Mie University. Construction of rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP was constructed according to the method reported previously, except for methods of the supply of T7 and hPIV2 RNA polymerases (NP, P, L). In brief, to generate replication-deficient rhPIV2 vector, two nucleotides change [ATG to TAG (position of 89aa) and AAG to TAG (259aa)] were introduced into the M frame of the plasmid pPIV2, a full-length cDNA copy of hPIV2 anti-genome [19] (Fig. 1A) . Consequently, the 6 n length cDNA of Ag85B or EGFP, followed by transcriptional end sequence of NP gene (R2), intergenic sequence (IG), and transcriptional start signal of V/P gene (R1) ( [20] was synthesized by PCR using appropriate primers), was inserted into a Not I site of the plasmid DNA encoding the replication-deficient rhPIV2 genome described above. Then, the viruses (rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP) were recovered by co-transfection of each anti-genomic plasmid and plasmids expressing the NP, P, M and L, each cloned in a mammalian gene expression vector (pCAGGS) [21] into BSR7/5 cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase [22] . The cells were harvested, and then co-cultured with fresh Vero cells every 48 hr. Approximately 90% of the cells showed syncytia formation in the 10 th cocultured cells, and its state was maintained in further co-culture. Furthermore, for virus propagation, Cos7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing M and co-cultured with abovementioned 10 th cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 12 h at 4uC. The virus pellet was suspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carisbad, CA, USA). The virus titers were determined by CPE method using Vero cells, and were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ).
