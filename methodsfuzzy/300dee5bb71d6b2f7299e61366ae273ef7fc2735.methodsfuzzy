A large number of studies have used different recipes, calculation formulas, and rates of administration for fluid therapy in calves. These recommendations are sometimes too academic and complicated for an economical and practical approach, for which intravenous fluid therapy should be as simple and cheap as possible. Selection of an appropriate electrolyte or fluid therapy should be based on easily obtained clinical signs. Figure 3 shows a simple flow chart with guidelines for the treatment of dehydrated calves with diarrhea; however, for an appropriate determination of daily fluid requirements, estimated amounts for replacement, maintenance, and ongoing losses for diarrhea have to be calculated. The quantity of replacement fluid in liters can be calculated by multiplying the estimated dehydration in percentage with body weight in kilograms according to the following formula: The rate of fluid administered should not exceed 80 mL/kg/hour. 35, 51, 104 This means that a maximum fluid volume of 2.8 L for a 35 kg (77 lb) or 1 gallon (3.8 L) for a 47 kg (104 lb) for a severly dehydrated calf can be administered per hour; however, to avoid overhydration and pulmonary edema, a slower infusion speed of 30 to 40 mL/kg/hr is more frequently recommended and used. A recent study gave the first 1.0 L within 30 minutes and the subsequent dose of 3.0 L in the next 2.5 hours,6 which is in agreement with a slower rate of 30 to 40 mL/kg/ hr. 87 With an administration speed of 30 to 40 mL/kg/hr, a 10% dehydrated 40-kg calf can be rehydrated within 3 to 4 hours.87 This can be accomplished through a 22-gauge ear catheter, which permits a flow rate of approximately 30 mL/minute (1800 mL/hr) when fluids are placed at least 1 m above the calf's head. 26 In addition, daily maintenance fluid of 80 to 100 mL/kg9 and ongoing losses of up to 7 L per d ay22 have to be added to calculate the daily fluid requirements 73 ; however, if the calf can suckle after initial resuscitation, the daily fluid requirements should preferably be given orally to reduce costs. Measurements of buffer needs are based on formulas for extracellular base excess (from blood gas analysis) or plasma TC0 2 concentration. Amounts calculated from blood gas analysis multiply base deficit with body weight and with a factor for the volume of distribution for bicarbonate ions in the body of 0.5 according to the following formula 68 ,87: Another reference uses a higher distribution factor for bicarbonate of 1.0 for the calculation of the bicarbonate requirements in order to consider for the ongoing daily bicarbonate losses in diarrhea,28 although this figure appears much too high to be used to correct existing deficits. Guidelines developed by Naylor 73 based on standing ability, suckling force, and age of diarrheic calves have been very useful for predicting if alkalinizing therapy is indicated and how much isotonic sodium bicarbonate should be administered; however, depressed calves without diarrhea and dehydration are often severely acidemic and therefore need intravenous buffer administration. 1, 5, 50, 52, 54, 93 Because base deficit or blood pH is normally not determined calf side, the quantity of buffer to be administered is initially estimated and reassessed on the basis of the clinical response of the calf to treatment with sodium bicarbonate. If calves do not respond to buffer therapy or their clinical condition continues to deteriorate, the presence of hypoglycemia or septicemia should be considered as differential diagnoses. 25 , 54 An easy and successful method for the treatment of severely dehydrated diarrheic and acidemic calves is to administer isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution at approximately 10% body weight over a period of 8 to 12 hours.57 Without exact calculation of base deficit, fluid rate, or maintenance requirements, this study had a success rate of therapy of 91%. 57 A total of 90 calves with a mean base deficit of -19.0±3.8 mEq/ L (pH 7.06 ± 0.22) received approximately 10% of their body weight as an isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (1.26% = 12.6 giL instead of the more widely used 1.3%). The first half of the calculated dose of isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution was administered rapidly over 2 to 3 hours, which equals an administration rate of approximately 17 to 25 mL/kg/hr. When after 3 hours approximately 5% body weight of isotonic sodium bicarbonate had been infused, 77% of the calves were able to suckle again. In this study, milk replacer was continuously fed, and only water instead of electrolyte solutions was offered to the calves. Further intravenous replacement therapy with 2 to 4 L Ringer's or 0.90/0 sodium chloride after resuscitation with sodium bicarbonate was given to 16 of 90 calves. 57 Earlier guidelines for the application of isotonic sodium bicarbonate distinguished between moderate and severe dehydration. 83 Moderately dehydrated calves with an estimated loss of 6% body weight received 50 mL/kg as hydration therapy in the first 4 to 6 hours and 140 mL/kg over the next 24 hours. For more severely dehydrated calves, the dose rate for hydration therapy was doubled to 100 mL/kg in 4 to 6 hours with the same maintenance therapy. A practical instruction for a 45-kg, severely dehydrated and comatose calf is to give 2 L of isotonic sodium bicarbonate rapidly and then change fluids to an isotonic mixture of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. This mixture can be easily achieved mixing isotonic sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solutions together. 83 A slightly hypertonic solution of 5% dextrose added to 12.6 g sodium bicarbonate can also be used. 85 The fluids administered should be warmed if a calf is hypothermic because cold fluids increase energy consumption as they are warmed by the body.88 This may further decrease cardiac output and even kill a critically ill calf, especially if a rapid infusion rate of 80 mL/kg/hr is used.73, 107 Warmed fluids cool out very fast with a slow continuous drip administration. In this case the tubing can be looped around a heat lamp or through a bucket with hot water to warm the fluids. Additionally, the calves can be warmed with heat lamps or pads to minimize their energy demand for correcting hypothermia. Close monitoring of fluid therapy in practice is not possible, and continued treatment should be based on improvement of clinical signs. 35 Besides an improved mental state, criteria for response to treatment are decrease of enophthalmos, returning of suckle reflex, wet mucous membranes, increase of rectal temperature, and urination within 30 to 60 minutes. 35 , 84,88 Recumbent calves should stand within 6 to 24 hours of fluid therapy. 85 In the past it was recommended to correct the whole amount of calculated dehydration plus maintenance plus substitute for the ongoing daily losses and to rehydrate the patient over a time of 24 to 48 hours. This deficit therapy approach may sometimes be too complicated to calculate and undertake in routine practice. It is therefore recommended to infuse only part of the total fluid requirement intravenously to resuscitate the calf and restore circulation. During a rapid infusion of the first liter of solution the calf can usually be monitored by the veterinarian and the flow rate can be adjusted. 89 In most cases, 1 to 3 L given over 2 to 3 hours partially restore fluid deficits and restore the calf's suckle reflex for further oral rehydration and buffer therapy. 57 If the suckle reflex does not return, one should look for concurrent diseases, such as hypoglycemia, septicemia, omphalitis, or pneumonia. 85
