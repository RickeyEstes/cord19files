Mouse L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Ea-Three hours after DNA transfection, the cells were infected with MHV-A59 at an m.o.i. of 10. Actinomycine D gle medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal calf se-(20 mg/ml) was added to the medium at 4 hr post MHV RESULTS infection. Coronavirus-like particles are detected in L-cells Isolation and analysis of viral RNA First, we studied whether virus-like particles were produced in the vTF7.3-infected L-cells that were cotrans-Intracellular RNA was isolated from infected and fected with four DNA constructs encoding the known transfected L cells 8 hr postinfection or transfection as structural proteins S, M, N, and E of MHV-A59. vTF7.3described previously (Spaan et al., 1981) . RNAs were infected cells that were mock transfected or transfected separated on 1% agarose/2.2 M formaldehyde gels with all structural proteins were fixed at 10 hr after trans- (Meinkoth and Wahl, 1984) , and hybridization was done fection. MHV-infected L-cells were fixed at 6 hr postinfecin dried gels using 5 end-labeled probes (Meinkoth and tion and prepared for electron microscopy analysis. Wahl, 1984) . Oligo 48 (5GTGATTCTTCCAATTGGCCATG In L-cells endogenous retrovirus type A particles con-3), which binds to the 3 end of the genome, and oligo taining a clear double membrane (reviewed by Kuff and c122 (5ATGCCATGCCGACCCCT 3), which binds to the Lueders, 1988) were observed in vesicles (Fig. 1) . MHV region between the hepatitis delta ribozyme and the T7 virions were detected in collecting or budding vesicles terminator, were used for hybridization. Oligonucleotides in the MHV-A59-infected cells. Virions were heterogewere labeled using [g-32 P]ATP (NEN-Dupont) and T4 poneous in size, but could easily be distinguished from the lynucleotide kinase. retroviruses as the latter have a distinct morphology.
