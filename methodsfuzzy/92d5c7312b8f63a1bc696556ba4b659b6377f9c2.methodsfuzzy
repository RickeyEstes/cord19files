The most frequently used tests for diagnosing hepatitis E are detection of IgM and IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosor- Fig. 2 . HEV replication cycle. HEV particles first bind to heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) and are consequently transferred to an unknown functional receptor, thus mediating cellular uptake through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Following uncoating, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm and translated into nonstructural proteins. These proteins form a replication complex that produces new full-length and subgenomic viral RNA. The latter is translated into capsid protein (ORF2) and the membrane associated ORF3 protein that is known to interfere with interferon-a signaling. Viral RNA is packaged into capsid protein and released from the cell with help of the host factor Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101). The released particles are associated with lipids and ORF3 proteins; both are consequently removed through the bile acids and digestive proteases respectively. bent assays (ELISA) and detection of viral RNA by (quantitative) reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Presence of IgM antibodies indicates a recent infection, while IgG antibodies appear later and persist afterwards, at least for some time, indicating a past exposure. The current ELISAs suffer from large variability between assays (Bendall et al., 2010; Drobeniuc et al., 2010; Mast et al., 1998) and therefore require urgent optimization and validation. Acute infection is usually confirmed by (quantitative) RT-PCR (e.g. Jothikumar et al., 2006) , although these assays should be standardized as well to increase reliability. Since the incubation and symptomatic periods for acute hepatitis E are only a few weeks, the successful use of antiviral drugs for acute cases of hepatitis E would depend on the availability of a rapid and inexpensive diagnostic test. Such test should also be easy to employ in resource-poor settings.
