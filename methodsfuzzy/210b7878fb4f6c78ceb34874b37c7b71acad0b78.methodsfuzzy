Plasmids. pGBK-T7-WNVCp, a bait plasmid for yeast two-hybrid screening, was created by cloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-His-WNVCp into pGBK-T7 (Clontech). pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp and pET28a-His-WNVCp were prepared by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-his-WNVCp into pcDNA3-HA and pET28a-His (Invitrogen). The bacterial expression plasmids for Hsp70 and Hsp70AAAA were used as described previously [2] . Hsp70 mammalian expression vector, pcDNA/HA-Hsp70, was used as described previously (Nollen et al. [10] ). pcDNA3.1/Luciferase was obtained from pGL3 (Promega) using XbaI and HindIII restriction, and was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). All DNA constructs were produced by PCR and sequenced. Yeast two-hybrid screening. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer using the pretransformed MATCHMAKER human brain cDNA library (Clontech). In brief, pGBK-T7-WNVCp was transformed into yeast strain AH109. The transformants containing bait plasmid were mated with the pre-transformed human brain cDNA library. Candidates for two-hybrid interaction were initially selected on SD (-His, -Leu, -Trp) medium and further confirmed on SD (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) medium containing X-gal. The plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clones and sequenced according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To further confirm the interaction between WNVCp and Jab1, Y187 and AH109, each of which contained pGAD-T7-Jab1 and pGBK-T7-WNVCp, respectively, were mated and tested using SD (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) medium containing X-gal. Cell biology. A human cancer cell line, 293T (kidney carcinoma), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) or Welfect (Wellgene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously [17] . Biochemical analyses. Recombinant Hsp40, Hsp70, ATPase domain, SBD, and Hsp70AAAA were expressed and purified as described previously [2, 26] . His-WNVCp was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In brief, BL21 cells, which were transformed with pET28a-His-wnvcp or pET28a-His-P5/8A, were treated with IPTG (1 mM) at 25°C. The crude extract was prepared using lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was resolved over the Resource Q (35 ml, Pharmacia-LKB), His-bind resin (20 ml, Novagen), and DEAE column (50 ml, Pharmacia-LKB). Fractions containing His-WNVCp was concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore). Concentrations of proteins were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, IL) relative to standard BSA (Pierce, IL). Folding assays of guanidine-HCl denatured b-galactosidase and luciferase (Sigma, MO) followed existing protocols [2, 26] . The pull-down experiment was carried out as described previously [17] . Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as follows. Cells were plated in six-well plates with coverslips; transfections were performed using lipofectamine reagent. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (Invitrogen), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz) in PBS for 30 min and incubated overnight with specific primary antibody at room temperature. The samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse or Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies (each diluted at 1:400) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma) for 5 min. The slides were analyzed using confocal or immunofluorescent microscopes (Carl Zeiss Vision, LSM510 and 5203 Axiophot, respectively, Oberkochen). FACS analysis. For FACS analysis, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp, with or without pcDNA/HA-Hsp70. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested using trypsin and were subsequently fixed with 70% EtOH. After washing three times with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (1 lg/ml) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by treatment with propidium iodide (PI) (50 lg/ml) for 30 min. Stained cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis (Becton-Dickinson). Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (Becton-Dickinson). Antibodies and chemicals. Hsp70 (SPA810) was purchased from Stressgen. Luciferase (L0159) and Flag (M2) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse and Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Alexa.
