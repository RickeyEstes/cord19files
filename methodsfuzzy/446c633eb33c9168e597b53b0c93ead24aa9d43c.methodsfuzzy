Cell culture and virus. MRC5 fibroblasts (ATCC) and MeWo cells (Sloan Kettering Institute) were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin-streptomycin. When the cells were ϳ90% confluent, they were inoculated with trypsin-dispersed infected cells at a ratio of one infected cell to eight uninfected cells (18) . The titer of the inoculum was 1 million infectious foci/ml. The virus strain was the completely sequenced low-passage-number VZV-32 strain (50) . Reagents. Bafilomycin A1 (B1793), as well as rabbit antibody against LC3 (L7543), was purchased from Sigma. The toxicity of BAF to cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The Golgi apparatus GM130 antibody (PA1-077-A555) was obtained from Thermo Scientific. The mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to VZV gE (clone 3B3) was produced in our laboratory (51) . Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (A11070; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (A11018; Life Technologies). The DNA stain was Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen; H3570). Gradient sedimentation and Western blotting. The protocol for sedimentation of VZV sonicates in potassium tartrate-glycerol gradients has been described previously; the virion bands from the gradients were pelleted, and the supernatant was discarded (52) . The pellets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.125 M Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% beta-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and bromophenol blue). The solubilized, purified virus was separated on 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in primary antibodies diluted 1:2,000 in PBS-0.05% Tween 20-1% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed 5 times for 5 min each time at room temperature in PBS-0.05% Tween 20, incubated in goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted 1:25,000 in PBS-0.05% Tween 20-1% milk for 1 h at room temperature, and washed 5 times for 5 min each time at room temperature in PBS-0.05% Tween 20. The labeled proteins were detected using a SuperSignal West Pico Plus chemiluminescent substrate kit from Thermo Scientific. Confocal microscopy. Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C until they were 90% confluent. The cells were inoculated with VZV-infected cells at a ratio of 1 infected cell to 8 uninfected cells. The infected cells were treated with 10 nM bafilomycin at 24 or 48 hpi. At 72 hpi, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde with 0.02% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed 5 times for 5 min each time in PBS and blocked for 30 min in PBS with 5% nonfat dry milk. The coverslips were incubated in primary antibodies diluted 1:2,000 in PBS-1% milk for 1 h at room temperature and washed 5 times for 5 min each time in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546, washed 5 times for 5 min each time, and mounted on glass slides. Images were collected on a Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope (6) . Z-stacks of 2D images were converted into 3D images with Imaris software (Oxford Instruments). Transmission electron microscopy. Cell culture medium overlying a monolayer was replaced with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer prewarmed to 37°C (53) . The cells undergoing fixation were allowed to cool to room temperature and then remained in the fixative overnight at 4°C. After rinsing several times in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixation was carried out for 20 min with 1% osmium tetroxide solution reduced with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer solution (54) . This second fixative was removed with several rinses of distilled water. An en bloc staining with 2.5% uranyl acetate was done for 5 min. The cells were then dehydrated using gradually increasing concentrations of ethanol to 100%. At this point, infiltration of a 1:1 mixture of Eponate 12 epoxy resin (Ted Pella) and ethanol was applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. This mixture was replaced with 100% resin three times at 1-h intervals and cured for an additional 48 h in a 60°C oven. Sections 80 nm thick were cut using a Leica UC-6 ultramicrotome and collected on Formvar-coated 75-mesh copper grids. Counterstaining was done with 5% uranyl acetate for 2 min and with Reynold's lead citrate for 2 min (55). Images were collected at 120 kV using a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope and recorded directly in digital format with a Gatan 2,000-by-2,000 charge-coupled-device camera equipped with Gatan Microscopy Suite software. Archives of electron micrographs. We have retained archives of TEM negative prints in the laboratory. For the TEM results concerning the VZV infectious cycle described in a previous article from our laboratory, the published images were selected from a total of 595 micrographs taken during 12 separate experiments (21) . For a subsequent series of TEM analyses carried out as part of the research for a master's thesis, a total of 337 digital micrographs of VZV-infected cells were retained on file on a hard drive (56) .These images were captured during 10 separate experiments. The latter study included our early analyses of autophagy during VZV infection (7) . We reexamined all 932 images as part of the current study. In addition, 230 new images were collected as part of the BAF research protocol on infected monolayers. Statistical analysis. The statistical analyses shown in Fig. 3 were performed with Student's t test. The test has been described in detail previously (57) .
