Calves were cared for by acceptable practices as described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching (FASS, 2010) . In phase 1, 2 groups of 48 male Holstein calves (96 total) initially 2 to 4 d of age from a single dairy farm were transported 3.5 h to the Nurture Research Center in southwest Ohio. The second group arrived 35 d after the first group. Upon arrival, calves were randomly assigned to receive a s.c. injection of Draxxin (2.5 mg of tulathromycin/kg of BW; TUL) at arrival (d −1) and again at weaning (d 42) or receive no injections (CON). Calves were housed in 1.2 m × 2.4 m individual pens with a coarse-rock, tile-drained floor bedded with straw in a curtain-sided, naturally ventilated barn with no added heat for 56 d. Milk replacer (MR) was fed at 0.66 kg of DM daily for 39 d and then 0.33 kg of DM daily for 3 d. The MR was manufactured with whey, whey protein concentrate, and animal fat (25% CP, 18% fat; Table 1 ), reconstituted to 14% solids with warm water, and fed at 0630 and 1400 h daily. A highgrain, textured starter (Table 1 ; fed at approximately 1300 h) and water (fed at approximately 0800 h) were fed free choice for the 56 d of phase 1. Every other bag of MR and starter was sampled and composited for nutrient analysis. Management practices including vaccinations and medical treatments during the trial were based on the recommendations of the herd veterinarian. The day after arrival at approximately noon approximately 5.5 h after feeding MR, the calves were weighed (d 0, initial BW). At this time, blood was sampled intravenously, serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (VWR, Batavia, IL) at 20°C for 15 min, and serum protein concentration was estimated using an optical refractometer (ATAGO USA Inc., Bellevue, WA). Calves were weighed initially and weekly thereafter at approximately noon. Body condition score (1 being thin and 5 being obese, modified from Wildman et al., 1982) and hip widths using a caliper were measured initially and every 2 wk thereafter. Phase 1 was conducted in consecutive months of October 2014 to January 2015. The average temperature in the nursery was 6°C with a range from −8 to 27°C. The average relative humidity was 74% with a range from 13 to 100%. Feces were scored daily using a 1-to-5 scale with 1 being normal and 5 being watery (modified from Kertz and Chester-Jones, 2004) . Calves with fecal scores of 3 or greater (considered abnormal fecal scores) received oral electrolytes that were not counted as medical treatments. During the first 28 d, the first abnormal feces (fecal score of 3 or greater) per calf was sampled and mixed. An aliquot was tested for Cryptosporidium, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, or K99 Escherichia coli using lateral immunochromatography strips (Biox Diagnostics, Jemelle, Belgium). Antibiotic medical treatments were recorded daily. Bovine respiratory disease was defined as one or more of the following symptoms: coughing, nasal discharges, labored breathing, and rectal temperatures >39.4°C. Baytril 100 (Bayer Healthcare, Shawnee Mission, KS; 5 mL s.c.) was administered to calves with BRD. Banamine (Merck, Madison, NJ; 1.5 mL i.v.) was administered for lethargy. Navel infections were treated with 5 mL of penicillin G procaine i.m. (300,000 units/mL; Agri Laboratories LTD, St. Joseph, MO) daily for 7 d. On d 28, 42, and 56, an experienced technician auscultated lungs of calves (right, anterior side of calves) to assist in identification of respiratory disease. Calves received an intranasal respiratory disease vaccine (TSV-2, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) and s.c. injections of vitamins A, D, E (Vital E − A + D, Merck Animal Health) and Se (MU-SE, Merck Animal Health) upon arrival. Calves received an injection of Bovashield Gold 5 (Zoetis) at d 7 and again at d 28. Calves were surgically castrated and dehorned at 36 d of age. In phase 2, the same calves from phase 1 were grouped by CON and TUL and moved to group pens (12 pens per treatment with 4 calves per pen) for the next 56 d. The pens had 6.5 m 2 of outside pen space and 1.35 m 2 of inside pen space per calf. Inside pen space was bedded with straw, and there was no added heat. The same starter fed in phase 1 was blended with 5% chopped grass hay (Table 1) . Starter-forage mix and water were fed free choice. Every other bag of starter and every bale of hay was sampled and composited for nutrient analysis. Initially and at 84 and 112 d, calves were weighed and scored for body condition and hip widths were measured. The trial was conducted in consecutive months of December to March immediately following phase 1 for each group of calves. Average temperature in phase 2 was −2°C with a range from −22 to 15°C. Average relative humidity was 73% with a range from 38 to 100%. Composites of feeds and refused feed were analyzed (AOAC International, 2000) for DM (oven method 930.15), ash (oven method 942.05), CP (Kjeldahl method 988.05), fat (alkaline treatment with Roese-Gottlieb method 932.06 for MR; diethyl ether extraction method 2003.05 for starters and hay), NDF with ash by the procedure of Van Soest et al. (1991) without sodium sulfite or α-amylase, ADF with ash (Robertson and Van Soest, 1981) , starch (α-amylase method; Hall, 2009) , and sugar (colormetric method; Dubois et al., 1956) . Nutrient analysis of the refused feed for each wk and pen was similar to composition of feed offered. In phase 1, data were first grouped by week, except hip width and BCS change, which were grouped by 14-d periods. The data were analyzed as a completely randomized block design with repeated measures when applicable by Proc Mixed in SAS (version 8, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The 48 calf groups received 35 d apart were the blocks. An auto-regressive type 1 covariance matrix was employed as determined using Akaike's information criteria. Abnormal fecal score days and medical days were summed over phase 1 and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test with Proc NPAR1WAY in SAS. Calf (1 calf per pen) was the experimental unit. In phase 2, intake and growth data were analyzed as a completely randomized block design with repeated measures when applicable (grouped by two 28-d periods for body measurements) by Proc Mixed in SAS. An auto-regressive type 1 covariance matrix was employed as determined using Akaike's information criteria. Pen was the experimental unit. Significance was determined at P ≤ 0.05. Trends were considered at P ≤ 0.09.
