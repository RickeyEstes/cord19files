Due to the diversity of the infectious disease related laws, the laws need to be more systematic and consistent with each other, reflecting the inclusive and multifaceted characteristics of the public health area and the national health care system. Measures for response to emerging infectious diseases require collaborative governance that distinguishes the role of the central government from those of metropolitan cities/provinces and si/gun/gu, and then closely interconnects them. In addition, it should protect the human rights and privacy of those who are exposed to infectious diseases, and be in a form ensuring commonly shared rights of all the subjects. In the present paper, we reviewed the legislative procedure of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, analyzed its problems, and then proposed the direction to improve the Infec- munity. This has been found all over the world including Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, Europe, and the US and the concept expanded the scope of response from containment of infectious diseases within the border to a supranational level [8] . IHR 2005 also affected the law of the Korea: the 'Communicable Diseases Prevention Act. ' On December 29, 2009 , the Communicable Diseases Prevention Act was fully revised (enforced on December 30, 2010) , and the term, 'communicable diseases' has been changed to 'infectious diseases' so as to include both communicable and non-communicable diseases. The revision was not limited to the term. In Aticles 2, 11-13 of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, Class 1-5 infectious diseases and designated infectious diseases were named legal infectious diseases, because they were designated by law. On the other hand, WHO monitors infectious diseases, bioterror infectious diseases, sexually transmitted infectious diseases, zoonotic infectious diseases, and health care-related infectious diseases, and these were designated as notifiable infectious diseases by the Minister of Health and Welfare (MOHW). Measures of response to infectious diseases can be summarized as Early Detection (surveillance) -Non-pharmacological Intervention (quarantine/isolation) -Medical Intervention (health care intervention) -Risk Communication, in which patients with infectious diseases are early detected by surveillance of infectious diseases, and transmission is maximally prevented through nonpharmacological intervention such as quarantine and isolation, damage is minimized through vaccination and drug distribution, and risk communication is conducted based on risk assessment. All of these activities are fulfilled through public health administration and disaster management ( Figure 2 ). Public health administration is to apply technologies and principles of health care for health of populations based on all knowledge available in the areas of medicine and public health [9] . The WHO defined the scope of public health administration as 1) preservation of public health records, 2) health education to the public, 3) environmental sanitation, 4) infectious disease control, 5) mother and child health, 6) health care, and 7) nursing and statistics of public health [10] . According to Article 3, Clauses 1-3 of the Framework Act on the Management of Disasters and Safety, damages by infectious diseases are considered as a kind of social disaster. Thus, when infectious diseases break out, a command system for disaster management, unlike normal administrative management, in collaboration with public health experts, is required. The scope of disaster management includes advanced prevention, minimization and recovery activities of human and material damage, a supply of a minimum level of convenience for a certain period of time, and then return to daily life after risk situation is ended. National intervention that is in the form of public health administration and disaster management are performed through management support systems and command response systems. A management support system is a risk response plan that mediates response strategies by securing comprehensive information about the incident, and makes a decision for a response level and required Disaster management support ranges of human and material resources. A command response system is composed of authorities to control and command, which are required for response measures in the field, so that command response system can be different depending on infectious disease, and local governments or medical institutions may have their own command response systems. The concepts of the management support system and the command response system can be found in the National Incident Management System that was standardized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US, in which 'Incident Management System' and 'Incident Command System' have been established in relation to public health risk response by infectious diseases in order to facilitate mediations between all levels of governments, including the Federal Government, state governments and local (city and county) governments, plus public, private and non-profit organizations [11] . The Incident Management System classifies potential risk factors for public health into biological, artificial, intentional, and natural factors, determines the order of risk management based on seriousness of all potential risk factors for public health, chance of incidence, and response ability, and then takes appropriate measures as a response [12] . The US CDC supports state governments and the Department of Health and Human Service. The Incident Command System refers to a temporary management procedure that can manage finance, human resources, facilities and risk communication from the time of incidence. The Minister of Health and Human Service (HHS) forms the HHS Secretary's Command Center, in which he/she makes preparations at all health care levels, and performs response and recovery activities. However, an incident manager is selected at the incident field, who operates an emergency organization that flexibly responds depending on type and severity of the incident, and all staff persons participating in the incident response report only to the incident manager. The importance of the command response system and the management support system is related to the matter of governance. When the first MERS patient was confirmed in the Korea on May 20, 2015, the crisis stage of infectious diseases was 'Caution' stage. Nevertheless, the type of emergency organization was continuously changed, from KCDC (Countermeasure Headquarter) to the MOHW (Central MERS Management Headquarter), to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security (Pan Government MERS Countermeasure Support Center), and then ultimately to the Blue House (MERS Emergency Response Team). On June 4, 'Comprehensive Public-Private Response Task Force for MERS' led the response. On June 8, 'Immediate response TF' mainly composed of private experts was implemented, which was conferred with full authority for nosocomial infection management and command of administrative support. On June 9, the 'MERS Immediate Response Team' was organized. Even the commanding authority was transferred from the spokesperson of the Blue House to the acting prime minister, to the Chief Secretary of Policy Coordination and to the President. As such, there were problems in the command response system [13] . While the management support system can be guided by a manual, there was no consistency in manual instructions after the MERS outbreak, which intensified the confusion. A manual is written to assess risks of infectious diseases in advance, whereas it can be added with confirmation of specific activities or selection of essential measures after outbreak of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, it is important for the government to apply the manual to the field without confusion even after modification.
