Animal ethical statement. The animal experiment was carried out in strict accordance with the institutional ethical guidelines on animal care and were approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee Animals. Male DBA/1J, female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility and rabbits were housed in clean-grade animal cabin with free access to standard laboratory water and food, and kept in a 12 h light/dark cycle with controlled humidity (60-80%) and temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Collagen-induced arthritis. The male DBA/1J mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 per group), 3 groups were immunized at the tail base with 100 μ g bovine type II collagen (CII, Tokyo, Japan) in 0.1 M acetic acid emulsified equal volume complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). A boost injection of 100 μ g collagen-incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) emulsion was given in the same manner 3 weeks later. From day 10 after booster immunization, immunized groups were orally administered with saline, MTX (1 mg/kg/day) or SM934 (10 mg/kg/day) for consecutive 40 days, while normal controls were administered with saline. The arthritis severity of mice was monitored every two days. At the end of treatment, all 4 groups of DBA/1J mice were sacrificed, and serum, hind paws and splenocytes were then collected. Clinical assessment of arthritis. The clinical severity of arthritis was scored as previously described 51 . Briefly, each limb was graded based on a scale of 0 to 4 according to the following scale: 0 = normal; 1 = detectable arthritis with erythema one or several digits; 2 = erythema and moderate swelling extending from the ankle to the midfoot; 3 = severe swelling and redness from joint to digit; and 4 = maximal swelling with ankyloses. The severity was described as the cumulative score of four limbs (the maximum score for each mouse is 16).
