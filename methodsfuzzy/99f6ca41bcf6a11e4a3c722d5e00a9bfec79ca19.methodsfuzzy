Viral genome sequencing and modified 5=-3= RACE. Viral RNA was isolated using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen), and cDNA libraries were prepared using Superscript III (Invitrogen). Sanger sequencing was performed on PCR templates generated using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) and analyzed using Sequencher (Gene Codes) and Lasergene (DNAStar) software. The 5= and 3= UTR sequences were determined as previously described (53) . Briefly, viral RNA was isolated and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Ambion) for 1 h at 37°C to remove terminal phosphates of uncapped RNAs. Following a phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation, the RNA was treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Ambion) for 1 h at 37°C. After another phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation, the RNA was incubated with T4 RNA ligase I (Ambion) for 1 h at 37°C and then overnight at 4°C, to ligate the 5= and 3= ends. cDNA (Superscript III; Invitrogen) was made and used to generate an amplicon containing both the 5= and 3= UTR sequences, which was Sanger sequenced. ZIKV infectious clone design. We designed a quadripartite unidirectional molecular clone strategy similar to that previously described for DENV and emerging coronaviruses (20-22, 24, 25) . First, we identified naturally occurring class IIG nonpalindromic restriction endonuclease sites within the six ZIKV full-length genomes. For the clone of strain MR766, synonymous nucleotide changes were introduced at positions 895, 901, 2983, 7834, 7837, 8467, and 8473 to eliminate four internal restriction enzyme sites (two PflMI sites, an SmaI site, and a BstAPI site, respectively), simultaneously leaving marker mutations for identifying recombinant viruses. A T7 promoter sequence was added to the immediate 5= end of the genome, and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme was added directly after the last nucleotide of each ZIKV genome to generate an authentic 3= end. The four subgenomic fragments were synthesized into the pUC57 vector (BioBasic) and amplified in Escherichia coli strain MC1061. The resulting purified plasmids were digested, ligated, in vitro transcribed, and electroporated into C6/36 cells as previously described (20) (21) (22) . Supernatants from electroporated C6/36 cells were harvested after 6 to 7 days and passaged once on C6/36 cells to generate virus stocks. Clone MR766 ϩDel and MR766 ϩGly viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the MR766 ϪGly clone. Except for the junction sites (Bsu36I, BstXI, and SfiI), we used an identical strategy as for the H/PF/2013 clone and for SPH2015. Strain BeH819015 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the SPH2015 clone in the six positions where the two strains differed (5= UTR, T81ins; E, I384V; NS1, H951Y; NS3, Y1892H; NS4B, M2330I; and NS4B, M2480I). We confirmed the sequence of all recombinant viruses. Phylogenetic analysis. Full-length sequences (Ͼ10,000 nt) were obtained from GenBank and from sequencing of laboratory clones/isolates. Sequences were either manually edited to remove the 5= UTR, left as downloaded, or manually modified to provide the viable 5= UTR sequence variants for Haiti/1225/ 2014 and SPH2015. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MAFFT (54) . The best substitution model for each alignment was evaluated using jModelTest (55) and identified to be a general time-reversible (GTR) model with an estimated proportion of invariable sites and estimated gamma shape parameter (GTR ϩ I ϩ G). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using RAxML (56) using 100 bootstrap replicates. Trees were visualized using EvolView (57) . Virus capture ELISA. Virus particles were captured using mouse anti-DENV MAbs 4G2 and 2H2 in carbonate buffer. MAbs (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) were diluted to a concentration of 20 ng/l and added to captured virus for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation with alkaline phosphataseconjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate (Sigma) was added and absorbance at 405 nm was measured (Bio-Rad). Background signal (optical density at 405 nm [OD 405 ] with no primary antibody) was subtracted from each virus sample, and absorbance was normalized to binding of an antiflavivirus human polyclonal serum sample.
