Virus MERS-infected nasal samples were derived from animal work which was previously approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Colorado State University and was performed in compliance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health with every effort to minimize animal suffering [2] . Nasal swabs were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-infection from three camels experimentally infected at Colorado State University with MERS-CoV strain HCo-V-EMC/2012, as described in Adney et al., 2014 [2] . The viral stock used for the infections was provided with the permission of the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and had been propagated in Vero E6 cells. Vero passage 7 of HCoV-EMC/2012 ("Seed") was used for the camel infections and served as the pre-in vivo passage tissue culture control. No additional cell culture passages were performed as a control for the subsequent passage of the virus from Vero cells into camels. MERS-CoV was obtained from BEI Resources (EMC/2012, NR-44260) for generation of viral cDNA for testing of PCR primers prior to the arrival of nasal samples and seed stock. Note, the number assigned to each camel in this study differ from those assigned to the same camels in Adney et al. [2] (work performed at Colorado State University (CSU)). Camel 1 from this study corresponds to CSU Camel 2, Camel 2 corresponds to CSU Camel 3, and Camel 3 corresponds to CSU Camel 1.
