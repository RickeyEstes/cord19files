Virus and Cells. MHV strain A59 and C12, the attenuated mutant derived from it, were described previously, z2"23 These viruses were grown routinely in L2 cells using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The titration of infectious virus in homogenized tissue samples was performed at 37 째C as described previously . 22 Mice./~2M-/mice were obtained originally from Dr. Beverly Koller (Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill USA) and have been described previously. 21 Breeding pairs were housed in microisolator cages in the Univ. Pennsylvania animal facilities. Four-to six-week-old male, MHVantibody free, C57BL/6 mice and 129/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME USA), and housed in the same manner as ~2M -/-mice. Inoculation of mice. We diluted A59 or C12 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin. Mice were anesthetized with Metofane (Pittman-Moore, Mundelein, IL USA) and 20/~1 of diluted virus was injected into the left cerebral hemisphere. Mockinfected controls were inoculated similarly but with an uninfected cell lysate at a comparable dilution. Virus-infected animals and controls were housed in isolation for the duration of the experiments. LDso assays were performed as described previously. 23 Briefly, groups of 5-10 mice were inoculated with serial dilutions of wild type A59 as described above. Mice were examined for signs of disease or death on a daily basis up to 21 days pi. LDs0s were calculated by the Reed-Meunch method. The LDs0 of C12 in p2M -/-mice was determined similarly except that fewer mice and virus dilutions were used. Histology. At selected times postinfection, mice were anesthetized, perfused with PBS, and brains, spinal cords, and livers removed. Brains were cut sagitally at the midline, and one half was placed into gelatine saline, 41 weighed, and stored at -70째C for virus titrations; the remaining half was fixed overnight in phoshate-buffered formalin. Spinal cords were cut into six 3-5 mm pieces. One half of the cord (using alternating pieces) was placed into gelatine saline, weighed, and stored at -70째C; the remaining pieces were fixed in formalin. Livers were placed into gelatin saline, weighed, and stored at -70 째C. Formalin-fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) or with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB). H&E-stained sections were used for pathologic evaluation while LFB-stained sections were examined to identify regions of demyelination. The extent of demyelination was calculated as the percent of spinal cord quadrants containing lesions. Pathologic examinations were done blind using coded samples.
