Cells, viruses and antisera BSC40 (African green monkey kidney cells) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated neonatal calf serum (NCS), non-essential amino acids (1%), gentamicin (50 μg/mL), penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and fungizone (0.5 μg/mL). Vaccinia virus (VACV), strain Western Reserve (WR) [22] , and the recombinant VACV (rVV) derivatives were propagated and titrated in BSC40 cells. To obtain a polyclonal antiserum against PToV-HE (αHE), a New Zealand rabbit was inoculated with two different peptides coupled to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Peptides comprising residues 51-67 (CTNPSTPN SLDIPQQLC) and 152-162 (LTPPENIPSHC) of PToV-HE-Bres [GenBank: FJ232070] [23] were chemically synthesized at the Proteomics facility of our institution after selection of target PToV-HE antigenic regions by bioinformatic analysis with Protean software (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI, USA).
