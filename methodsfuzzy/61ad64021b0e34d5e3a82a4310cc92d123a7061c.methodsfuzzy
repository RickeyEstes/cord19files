Ethics statement. MERS-CoV genome sequences were obtained from the patients' respiratory samples after ethical approval granted by the institutional review boards of Chungnam National University Hospital and Seoul National University Hospital. The clinical samples collected for viral diagnosis before consent of the patients were used for viral sequencing analysis after the ethical approval. These procedures were approved by the institutional review boards. All the patients who recovered provided their written, informed consent to participation. In the cases of patients who died, we obtained exemption of patients' consent for the analysis of viral sequences from the institutional review boards of Chungnam National University Hospital and Seoul National University Hospital. Viral genome analysis. Nucleic acid extracts from PCR-confirmed MERS patients were processed for reverse transcription and PCR amplification using a modified version of methods described previously (16) . Briefly, RNAs were extracted from sputum or tracheal aspirate samples using TRIzol LS reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MERS-CoV RNA genome was converted to DNA and amplified by PCR in 30 overlapping amplicons using the primer sets listed in Table S5 in the supplemental material. All amplicons were gel purified and sequenced directly using an ABI-3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and the contigs were assembled using SeqMan version 7.0 (DNAStar Lasergene, USA). The 13 new genomes were aligned with the 101 published MERS-CoV genomes using MUSCLE (27) and MEGA6 software (28) . Structural analysis of D510G and I529T mutations. The complex structure of MERS-CoV spike RBD bound to CD26 (PDB identification [ID] or accession number 4KR0) were used to analyze the effects of D510G and I529T mutations (17) . Mutations were highlighted using Py-MOL (http://www.pymol.org). FoldX (http://foldx.crg.es) was used to calculate the changes in the energetic stability of residues (⌬⌬G) in wildtype and mutant RBD structures (29) . Interfacial residues in RBD were identified by the change in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) greater than 1 Å 2 upon the formation of complexes (30) . The SASA of each residue was calculated by using NACCESS (31) . The contacts of particular residues were identified using CSU software (http://ligin.weizmann.ac.il/ lpccsu/) (32) . Protein expression and purification. The human CD26 and MERS-CoV RBD (wild-type and mutant) proteins used for surface plasmon resonance experiments were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). CD26 (residues 39 to 766) and MERS-CoV RBD (spike residues 367 to 606, wild type), which were kindly provided by George F. Gao, were cloned into pFastBac1 vector (17) , which contains the gp67 signal peptide at the N terminus for protein secretion and the hexahistidine tag at the C terminus for further protein purifications. Two MERS-CoV RBD mutants (D510G and I529T) were generated by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). CD26 and RBD constructs were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells in a secreted form and collected after culture at 27°C for 3 days through centrifugation to remove Sf9 cells. Media were concentrated and adjusted to a pH of 8.0 before purification. All the proteins were purified using 5 ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), with washing buffer (20 mM -type protein and D510G and I529T mutant proteins) with gradient concentrations (0, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nM) was prepared and passed over the chip surface. At the end of each cycle, the chip surface was regenerated with 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). A 1:1 Langmuir binding model was used to analyze the binding kinetics of each RBD (wild type, D510G, and I529T) to CD26 protein. Stable 293T cells expressing human CD26 and RBD binding assay. Full-length human CD26 protein with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was cloned into the pEFIRES-P vector to express both CD26 and the puromycin resistance gene via an internal ribosome entry site sequence (33) . Overexpression of CD26 in 293T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using anti-human CD26 antibody (BioLegend) after transfection with the plasmid constructs and selection with puromycin (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). RBD-CD26 binding was further examined by flow cytometry analysis. Purified wild-type or mutant RBD proteins were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 2 ϫ 10 5 293T cells overexpressing CD26 in 200 l of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with rabbit anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) for flow cytometric analysis. Pseudotyped virus and viral entry. Pseudotyped virus was generated from 293FT cells (Invitrogen) by cotransfection of human immunodeficiency virus backbone plasmids expressing firefly luciferase as described previously (34) . We used the packaging plasmids (pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/ VSV-G; all from Invitrogen) and pLVX-Luc-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Luc stands for luciferase, and IRES stands for internal ribosomal entry site) (Clontech). For S-protein pseudotyping, full-length cDNA of the s gene (Sino Biological Inc.) was cloned into pcDNA3 and used for transfection instead of pLP/VSV-G. A plasmid carrying the gene encoding the I529T mutation in S protein was generated by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) based on the wild-type construct, and the point mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection and normalized by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Clontech) before infecting 293T cells for viral entry assay. The infected 293T cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and the efficiency of viral entry was measured by comparing the luciferase activity between pseudotyped viruses bearing the wild-type or mutant S protein (34) . VSV-Gpseudotyped lentivirus was used as the positive control. The relative luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan).
