Influenza viruses have mainly been detected by assessing specific nucleic acids and proteins using analytical methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [13, 14] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) [15] , but these methods must be employed with very expensive equipment under specific laboratory conditions by skilled personnel [16e19]. Although the above-mentioned techniques provide impressive analytical performance, the few major drawbacks complicate their applications in large epidemiological screenings, where an in situ analysis is required to exclude the infection and thus prevent economic losses. The most suitable alternative is the application of nanomaterials that can enhance the performance of common optical or electrochemical biosensors and thus can significantly increase their usefulness for screening AIV in various types of matrices. Western blot, protein and DNA microarrays or PCR followed by DNA sequencing analysis are generally used to diagnose influenza virus infections. In contrast, AIV typing microarray tests can detect and provide additional information about the subtype detected in positive clinical samples compared with that obtained using realtime-PCR [20] . Lab-on-a-chip and fully integrated techniques have been developed for pathotyping and the phylogenetic characterization of influenza A viruses obtained from real samples [21] . Various types of ELISAs, including immunochromatographic strip tests [22] and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunesorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) [23] , have been widely used for the rapid detection of subtype H9 influenza viruses and receptor binding specificity in different types of samples. DAS-ELISA uses two monoclonal antibodies with 99.1% specificity and 93.1% sensitivity. Dual-function and blocking ELISAs are highly sensitive and 100% specific for a timely diagnosis of AIV infections. These tests represent valid alternatives to the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, mainly for the screening of a large number of samples, as these tests are as sensitive and specific as the HI test but are faster and easier to automate [24, 25] . A magnetic immunofluorescence assay with an optical fibre spectrometer and a portable microfluidics chip was also reported for AIV detection [26] . A method was developed for the detection of avian influenza A/ H7N9 using real-time PCR with a detection limit of 3.2 Â 10 À4 and 6.4 Â 10 À4 haemagglutination units (HAUs) for the H7 and N9 genes, respectively [27, 28] . A microfluidics chip (fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane) with real-time fluorescence detection for the rapid identification of AIV H5 was suggested by Zhu et al. [29] . Protein and DNA microarrays are useful for the multiplexed detection and typing of AIVs that are currently classified as the H16 and N9 subtypes and provide new possibilities for screening applications, although their use in diagnostic laboratories is still limited due to economic and practical factors [30, 31] .
