The procedure for the assessment of favourable wind climate to pedestrians is comprised of (1) Statistical meteorological data of nearby weather station; (2) Aerodynamic information of the area and (3) Mechanical wind comfort criteria [13] . The aerodynamic information helps to compute the statistical data at particular building site obtained from the weather station. Then transformed data at this location is compared to wind comfort criterion. This procedure is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 . Meteorological data from weather station consist of hourly mean wind speed (U ms , measured at 10 m height) and wind direction in open terrain ( = y m 0.03 meteo 0, ). This wind speed data obtained from weather station is analyzed statistically using Weibull distribution function [14] [15] [16] to calculate the probability of exceedance of threshold wind speed as following Eq. (1). Where > P U ( )represents the exceedance probability of the wind speed; U is the mean wind velocity magnitude at building site; c is the dispersion parameter and k is the shape parameter. These constants are obtained by fitting Eq. (1) to the meteorological data. Then statistical information has to be transformed to the area of interest by the means of aerodynamic information using amplification factor R (Eq. (2)). This amplification factor consists of design related contribution and terrain related contribution (Eq. (3)) [16] . The design related contribution comprises of modification of statistical wind climate information due to local building design. These modification can be obtained by either wind tunnel measurement or using CFD simulation. The whole research community in this area is devoted to evaluate the design related modification. The terrain related modification accounts for the differences in terrain roughness between the weather station and area of interest [17] and can be obtained using Eq. (4) and Eq. (5).  Where U 0 is the reference wind speed at certain distance upstream of area of interest or without the presence of building or at the inlet of computational domain; u* site and u * meteo are the friction velocity at building site and meteorological station respectively; y site 0, and y meteo 0, are the aerodynamic surface roughness length at building site and meteorological station respectively. The dependency of the probability of exceedance and amplification factor R is given by Eq. (6) [16] . Most of the studies related to PLW environment tackle the problem based on discrete point analysis [17, 24, 81] . In this method, wind speed is evaluated at discrete locations. Then this wind speed is compared to the suitable wind comfort criteria. But obviously, pedestrian wind environment varies spatially in an urban area. So this type of discrete analysis is not efficient to address the real needs of urban planner in design [66] . In order to improve assessment method, Shi et al. [66] proposed that the practical pedestrian wind comfort for urban planning design must be space-based. The authors defined two parameters to analyze the pedestrian wind, the spatially averaged wind V avg (Eq. (8)) and the maximum wind speed V max in a plane.  In above equation a i is the proportion of i-th wind direction; V j is the wind speed in j-th mesh grid; n is the total number of mesh grid in the plane. The above calculated wind speed should be within the specified limit defined in comfort criteria.
