Fifteen six to eight-month old crossbreed dogs were used in this study. Before the experimental period faeces from these animals were collected and examined for helminth eggs and larvae. All the dogs were treated with an anti-helminthic drug in two doses (Nitroscanate, 50 mg/kg). Additional exams were performed at 7-day intervals to confirm that animals remained free of parasites. All the dogs were immunized against parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper virus in three doses at 1-month intervals. The dogs were divided according to their weight in three groups. Groups A and B were inoculated orally with 50 and 100 larvae/kg of body weight, respectively. The control Group C animals were not inoculated. The third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) were obtained by experimental infection. The aquatic snail Biomphalaria glabrata was maintained in the laboratory and each snail was experimentally infected with 400 first-stage larvae. After the 25th day of infection (d.i.) faeces were colleted daily and examined by Baermann's method to determine the prepatent period. Samples of blood (5 mL) were obtained from each animal by atraumatic jugular venipuncture using vacutainer tubes. The first blood sampling was performed before the larval inoculation and subsequently on the 10th, 20th, 30th and 45th d.i. and then at intervals of 30 days for the 210-day experimental period. These samples were centrifuged at 700 Ã‚ g, for 15 min and the serum obtained was immediately used for running the following biochemical tests.
