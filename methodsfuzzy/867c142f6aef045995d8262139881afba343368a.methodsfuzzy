Parasitic diagnostic information can be collected for three different purposes and it is important to recognize that the techniques currently available are not equally reliable for all three. The three purposes are as follows: penetrations of the gut, such as occurs after cecal perforations and rectal tears, or from surgical interferences such as castration. Chemical/ mechanical peritonitis may occur secondary to uroperitoneum, hemoabdomen, parasite migration or surgical handling of the bowel. Focal peritonitis or diffuse fibrinous peritonitis are relatively common and where the inflammation extends to the parietal peritoneum affected horses show a characteristic reluctance to move, stretching, a tense 'boarded' abdomen and pain and resentment on abdominal palpation. Signs of acute septic peritonitis include depression, abdominal distension, signs of shock and colic. Clinical signs of chronic peritonitis include weight loss, poor hair coat, diarrhea, colic and 'pot belly' appearance. There may also be evidence of multiorgan disease especially in foals with swollen joints, uveitis and pneumonia. Most abdominal abscesses remain discrete and may reach considerable size. The clinical signs of peritoneal abscesses are usually vague and ill-defined. Rupture of peritoneal abscesses causes either a focal or diffuse peritonitis and unless intestinal contents are involved the former are more common.
