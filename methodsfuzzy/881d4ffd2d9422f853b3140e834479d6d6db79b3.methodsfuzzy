This was an unblinded, parallel-group study with balanced randomization (1:1 ratio) for the two groups of patients. The study was conducted from 1 st June 2010 -30 th July 2010 (including recruitment and follow up) in a single centre i.e. Primary Health Care Clinic in the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). This study was part of a Master dissertation. Although the study was completed in 2010, there was a delay by the author in writing it up as a full manuscript. Ethical approval was obtained from the UMMC Medical Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants. For child participants, written consent was obtained from the participants' parents or guardian. This method was approved by the ethics committee. The inclusion criteria were: Age > 12 years, patients who were suspected to have dengue fever based on the assessment by the primary healthcare clinician, history of fever for three days or more, and thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 150 x 10 9 /L) [9] [10] [11] . The exclusion criteria were: Patients with any type of current or active malignancy, human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other immunodeficiency states due to complicated and multi-factorial aetiologies. Patients who were not given a follow-up appointment to review the clinical progression and to repeat the full blood count test were also excluded. This was to ensure that the patients enrolled in this study were similar to the target population, which were suspected dengue patients who were being followed up for outpatient monitoring. Similarly, those who were assessed on the first outpatient clinic visit and found to require hospital admission were excluded from this study. The process of recruitment and follow-up of the participants is shown in Fig 1 while the data collection process of the trial is shown in Fig 2. All patients presenting to the clinic with a history of fever for 3 days duration or more were identified by the triage counter nurses. The phases of dengue fever were based on the day of illness: febrile phase-day 1 till day 3 of illness; critical phase-day 4 to day 6 of illness; recovery phase-day 7 of illness onwards. It was standard practice for the clinic that such patients would have a full blood count test done mostly before the patient's consultation with their doctors. Online results of clinical investigations of patients were traced and those fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. The initial assessment of the patients and the subsequent follow-up consultations were conducted by the respective doctors working at the clinic. After the consultation, the researcher and trained research assistants obtained consent from the patient before they were randomized into either the control or intervention group. Simple randomization was done, with a 1:1 allocation ratio, using the table of random numbers. The table of random numbers was a standard table obtained from a statistics textbook. The researchers referred directly to the table during the randomization process (no opaque envelope was used). All patients recruited into the study, regardless of randomization group, were given the standard care in the form of the dengue home care card. The information on this card was read out to all participants. The control group would be asked to recall their twenty four hour fluid intake, and details on what type of fluids was consumed. This information was obtained during recruitment and each follow-up. The intervention group participants were given a plastic cup of uniform size (200ml), along with a twenty-four hour fluid chart. These patients were instructed to use the cup for drinking any form of fluid they wished to consume for the duration of their participation in the study. A fluid chart was used to record the detailed fluid intake (S1 File) and verbal instructions were given on how to fill in the fluid chart. Should the patient receive intravenous fluid during the following twenty-four hours either from a clinic or from the emergency department, they would record in the fluid chart given the time and amount of bottles received. In addition, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. All the patients recruited into the study were followed up until they had improved clinically and/or biochemically as determined by their doctors. This means that the duration of follow up varies between different participants. Data collection involved 24-hour fluid recall for the control participants, and the completed fluid charts from the intervention group. The research team would give out a new fluid chart if another appointment had been given to the participant. For both groups, the following data were recorded for each subsequent clinic follow-up: blood investigations (haemoglobin, haematocrit levels, total white cell count, platelets, and dengue serology) and temperature readings. The participants were managed by the respective doctors. As long as some data were collected from the participant, they would be included in the analysis. Only those participants who defaulted directly after recruitment into the study (meaning that they only came to clinic during recruitment) were excluded from the analysis as no clinical and oral fluid consumption data could be collected from them. For those who defaulted their follow-up with the research team, an attempt to contact the participant via telephone was made, with a maximum of three attempts. The reasons for defaulting follow-up were elicited and if the patient was admitted, details regarding the admission were obtained. The only published study on oral hydration in dengue patients [7] did not state their estimated sample size. For this pilot study the sample size was time driven, and the pre-specified time limit for data collection was two months. The minimum recruited number of participants required for each study group was 30 patients, giving a minimum number of 60 patients in total. However, the research team strived to recruit as many patients as possible during those two months. This is to determine the actual treatment effect size, and the participant recruitment and retention rates to be used in the sample size calculation for the main evaluation trial. The data for this pilot study were expressed either as the mean ± standard deviation or as frequencies and proportions. Differences in data between the control and intervention group were analyzed using the Student's t test for continuous variables. The chi-squared test (χ 2 test) or the Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, whichever was appropriate. A p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The statistical software utilized for the analysis was SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc. Cary, NC). The main outcomes were hospitalization rates, need for intravenous fluid treatment and amount of oral fluid intake.
