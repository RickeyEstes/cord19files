The McNemar test was used to compare the accuracy of all three tests; comparison was made in pair-wise fashion and exact methods were used when discordant cells had less than 20 observations. To reduce bias, only the first sample of each patient with multiple samples was included in the analysis. For purposes of analysis, patient age was divided into four different age groups based on years of age: â‰¤2, 3-5, 6-13, and 14-18. This was a paired study, pairwise comparisons being made between performance of FilmArray and ResPlex, FilmArray and LDTP, and ResPlex and LDTP. When targets differed between the systems under comparison, results were collapsed into the narrowest taxonomic category that encompassed both systems of a pair. Results from individual samples in which the first run failed were excluded from the analysis. However, results from second run from consecutive samples in which the entire run failed were included in the analysis as it was assumed that a systematic or technologist error was most likely the cause for the failure of the entire run For the ResPlex system, a positive result was determined using a cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of 200.
