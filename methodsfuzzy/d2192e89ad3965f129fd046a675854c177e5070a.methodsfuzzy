Four mice were allocated to test and control groups. These experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chungbuk National University (Approval Number CBNUA-240-1004-01). Pyruvic acid, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), reduced form of NAD (NADH), Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, bovine serum albumin (BSA), acrylamide, N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide, N,N,N',N'tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), bromophenol blue (BPB), DL-lactic acid, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), phenazine methosulfate (PMS), and anti-rabbit IgG (peroxidase conjugate) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
