Female Sprague±Dawley rats, 24 days of age, were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Raleigh, NC). Before initiation of the study, 5 rats were randomly selected for parasite evaluation and gross observation for evidence of disease. Serological evaluation for Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus/sialodacro-adenitis virus, Kilham rat virus/H-1 virus failed to reveal any abnormalities. Animals were housed ®ve per polycarbonate cage (23 HH £ 15 HH £ 8 HH ) on hardwood bedding (P.J. Murphy Forest Products, Montville, NJ). Cages were changed twice weekly and water and NIH-07 open formula pelleted diet (Ziegler Brothers, Inc., Gardners, PA) were available ad libitum. Temperature was maintained between 22^28C, and relative humidity between 50^15%. The light level from 40 W Trimline¯uorescent bulbs averaged 178 and 175 lux (SDs: 7.4 and 7.8, respectively) between the two rooms. The irradiance of these bulbs was measured using a spectroradiometer (PhotoResearch, model 650, Chatsworth, CA). Light levels varied between 250 and 120 lux at the front and rear of individual rat cages. The study animals were randomized, based on weight at 26 days of age and separated into two groups of 50 animals. One group was housed with a lightdark cycle of 8:16 (LD; lights on from 8 am to 4 pm) and the other group maintained in a constant light environment of 24:0 (LL). The 8L:16D photoperiod is characterized by an extended nocturnal period and a lengthened duration of melatonin production [16, 17] . Such a scheme was chosen to enhance the light exposure differences between animals in constant light versus those in the cycling (control) photoperiod. At the time of group assignment, the average weight was equivalent in the two groups at 58 g/animal (SD 7:9). Cages were rotated on each rack once per week to minimize inhomogeneity in light level. In previous experiments in our laboratory, it was determined that 8 mg of DMBA yields tumors in about 40% of Sprague±Dawley rats by 141 days of age. Therefore, in this study all rats were dosed with 8 mg DMBA (TCI America, Portland, OR) in sesame oil intragastrically at 52 days of age (between 9 and 10 am). Subsequently, the rats were palpated weekly and masses were located and recorded by speci®c mammary gland location (L1±L6 and R1±R6). Tumor size was determined by comparing the masses with wooden spheres of de®ned size (0.5±5 cm). Two individuals each palpated half of the rats each week, alternating groups of rats. When there was a discrepancy between the previous week in number or size of the masses, then both individuals palpated the animal and resolved the discrepancy. Presence and location of tumors were con®rmed at necropsy. At 141 days of age, rats were euthanized with ,70% CO 2 and necropsied. The skin with the breast epithelium was re¯ected from the rat by dissecting the fascia above the musculature. Any mammary tumors were measured (largest and smallest diameter) and the size recorded. Body weights were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance. Tumor palpation results repeated over time (tumor incidence and total tumors) were analyzed by a non-parametric Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance on ranks. Dunnett's test was used to delineate intergroup differences. Tumor necropsy results were analyzed by the nonparametric Mann±Whitney rank sum test [18] .
