Allergy-prone group. Thirteen allergic pregnant women with allergic husbands were selected from the Allergy and Obstetrical Clinics of the University of California, San Francisco and the Kaiser-Permanente Hospital in San Francisco, between 1973 and 1976. All parents had asthma, hay fever, or eczema, either singly or in combination. At birth, the authors examined the infants and collected cord blood with viable leukocytes and plasma for immunologic studies. The I3 offspring have been studied at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years, and at 6-month intervals up to 4 years. We acted as observers, but informed the family pediatrician of any significant findings in the laboratory tests; in some instances the pediatrician acted on that evidence, e.g., changed the formula. He also gave routine immunizations at the appropriate times. Nursing was strongly encouraged and supplemented with soy or casein hydrolysate (Nutramigen) formula feedings. The clinical diagnosis of allergy in infants involved the criteria discussed in the following paragraphs. ECLEMA. Mild was a pruritic maculopapular rash on the face and flexural surfaces of the limbs persisting for more than one month, i.e., observed on 2 or more visits. Moderate was such a rash observed for 6 or more months, or involving, in addition, trunk and extensor surfaces of limbs. Severe was such a rash that was scratched open and became infected and/or persisted 9 months or more. ALLERGIC RHINITIS. Mild was recurrent sneezing and clear or while nasal discharge observed on 3 or more occasions; moderate was such a discharge plus nose rubbing on 3 successive visits for 6 months; severe was a constant profuse white discharge with intermittent purulent episodes on 3 visits. ASTHMA. Mild was 4 weeks of persistent cough and mild wheezing with infections; moderate was cough persisting beyond 4 weeks and wheezing without infection and requiring intermittent bronchodilators; severe was constant coughing interfering with sleep or exercise or wheezing of sufficient severity to require daily bronchodilators. OTITIS. In&m&tent otitis lasting 6 months or more was mild; 9 months of otitis with persistent fluid was moderate; such otitis or persistent fluid that required placement of tympanostomy tubes was severe. COLIC. Infantile colic meaning prolonged crying, cramps, and frequent flatus and persisting for one month or more was mild; such colic persisting 2 months and/or associated with vomiting was moderate; these symptoms associated with diarrhea and dehydration were severe. Well-baby control group. Our original intent was to follow the same protocol in a group of infants born into families with no allergic family background, but we were prevented from doing so by a lawsuit brought by a member of our Human Experimentation Committee over the issue of serial venous blood sampling in normal children. Therefore, we made clinical observations on the development of allergic symptoms in a group of 28 infants with nonallergic parents from our Well-Baby Clinic. These 28 children were followed at 3-month intervals for 1 year or more for signs of allergy. An additional 7 children were followed but were not included in the control group when it was discovered that close relatives had allergies. The 2 infants in the allergy-prone study group (S. G. and M. J.) who failed to develop significant allergic symptoms or positive immunologic tests served as internal controls, in that they had the same bilateral family history of allergy but had few colds. Single blood samples from IO nonallergic age-matched children undergoing cardiac catheterization served to establish baseline values for our immunologic tests. Single blood samples from 24 age-matched known allergic children (symptomatic-positive skin tests) served to test the validity of our immunologic assays. While our controls were not optimal, they were the best possible under the legal constraints imposed. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST).7 RAST was used for IgE antibodies to a panel of 7 allergens common for children (cat or dog dander, house dust, and mite (D. farinii), rye grass pollen as representative for grass or cereal antigen, whole cow's milk, and soybean). The allergens were coupled to Whatman No. 1 filter paper discs activated with cyanogen bromide, mixed with 50 ~1 1: 5 diluted serum, and incubated 24 hr at room temperature, with slow rotation . After centrifugation , the discs of sorbent-allergen antibody mixed with 50 ~1 lzZI rabbit antihuman IgE (40,000 cpm) were incubated for 18 hr, recentrifuged, washed, and counted on an Auto-Gamma Spectrometer (Searle 1185). Results from children's sera were compared with cord sera from infants of nonallergic families and dil-uent. RAST of 2 times greater than base was considered positive, and 1.5 times base was borderline; this choice of significance has been established for our laboratory for 5 years. Histamine release (HR) from leukocytes.8 Leukocytes were separated by dextran from 5 to IO ml heparinized blood, mixed with antigen in 3 or more decimal (dilutions) or with rabbit antihuman IgE serum, incubated 40 min at 37" C, and cells were removed by centrifugation. Histamine was extracted from the supematant in n-butanol in NaOH, then in n-heptane and HCl, cooled, and made fluorescent with o-phthaldialdehyde. Acidified fluorescent histamine was quantitated by spectrofluorometry (Aminco SPF-125). Perchloric acid (4%) was used to completely lyse one aliquot of cells for total histamine content; antigen-induced histamine release was expressed as percent of total histamine present in cells. Antigen-induced histamine of 10% or more than control was considered positive. Lymphoblast transformation test (LTT)." Lymphocytes were collected from heparinized blood by first separating erythrocytes in dextran; the supemate was then layered on Ficoll-Hypaque and centrifuged. Six IO-fold dilutions of antigen or PHA 100 ~1 were added to 1,000 ~1 lymphocytes (1Oj) in tissue culture TC 199-20% autologous serum suspension. Cultures at 37" C in 5% CO, were carried 3 days for PHA and 7 days for antigen; then, 3H-thymidine (0.5 /Xi) was added to 0.1 ml culture and harvested after incubation for 4 hr. Incorporation of 3H-thymidine was mea- sured by counting samples in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Mark III, Searle). Lymphocyte transformation indices were ratios of 3H-thymidine in cultures with (E = experimental) or without (C = control) antigen or PHA. A ratio of E/C greater than 2.0 was considered positive, and 1.7 was borderline. Virus anribodies. Complement-fixing antibodies were determined before and after respiratory infections by utilizing a panel of 7 common childhood respiratory virus antigens: influenza A, parainfluenza 1,2,3; adenovims, RSV, CMV, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.'O These tests were kindly performed by Dr. A. Back, Director of Laboratories, Department of Public Health, San Francisco, California. Routine bacteriologic and viral cultures from the nasopharynx were made at times of acute respiratory infection. For virus cultures, alglnate nasal swabs were dipped in 1 ml of Hanks balanced sall: solution containing penicillin and gentamicin; 0.1 to 0.2 ml was immediately added to 2 tubes each of: rhesus monkey kidney, WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts and HEP-2 cells (Flow Laboratories, Rockville, Maryland). Cell monolayers were incubated at 35" to 36" C on roller drums for 2 weeks (for HEP-2 and monkey kidney) and 4 weeks (WI-38) with weekly feedings. The presence of viruses was detected by cytopathic effects and/or hemadsorption, and the identity was confirmed by reaction with the specific antiserum. /3-adrenergic status assessment. In two children at the age of 6 months we determined blood sugar, free fatty acids, and total eosinophil baselines, then gave epinephrine injection (10 pg/kg) subcutaneously, and repeated the blood sampling at 20, 40, and 60 minutes. This evaluation was again repeated in the two children at 12 or 18 months after each had developed allergic symptoms.
