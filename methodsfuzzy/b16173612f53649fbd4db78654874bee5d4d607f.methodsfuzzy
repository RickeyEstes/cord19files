Reagents and antibodies. Recombinant a2NTD was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and subjected to endotoxin removal column chromatography (Proteome Resources). Recombinant a2NTD was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-AF488) via a microscale labeling kit (Invitrogen, A30006). Conjugation of a2NTD to AF488 was kept within a range of 1-3 mol of dye per mol of a2NTD. A scrambled peptide conjugated to FITC was used as a negative control. Lipopolysaccharide (L6529), chloropromazine (C8138), filipin (F9765), rottlerin (R5648), polyinosinic acid (P4154), polycytidylic acid (P4903), polyadenylic acid (P9403), nystatin (N4014), dimethylamiloride (A4562), cytochalasin D (C2618), dynasore (D7693), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (D1634), sodium azide (71289), colchicine (C3915) and mycophenolic acid (M3563) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Paraformaldehyde ampules were from Thermo Scientific (PI28908). Anti-CD14 D22914) and 0.1 ng/mL, 1.0 ng/mL, or 10 ng/mL a2NTD for 1 h at 4°C or 37°C. To confirm that macropinocytosis was taking place, cells were pre-incubated with dimethylamiloride for 30 min at 37°C and then treated with 10 kDa neutral dextran Alexa Fluor 647. To remove surface bound dextran, cells were treated with 0.1% trypsin-EDTA and the cells were then fixed in 2% PFA followed by two washes in PBS and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. PBMCs and primary monocytes were incubated with different concentrations of trafficking inhibitors for indicated times. Cell viability was measured via two different assays: an ATP (G7570) and a NADH assay (G8080). Cellular toxicity was measured by using a live vs. dead cell proteases assay (G9201). All three kits were conducted following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Digitonin, a detergent, was used as a positive control (Sigma, D141). Statistical analyses. The Student's paired t-test was used to compare two groups. If more than two groups were being compared, repeated measures ANOVA was applied. Results are reported as means ± SEM and significance was defined as indicated in figure legends. Results were analyzed using Sigma Plot 11 (Systat Software Inc.).
