A multicenter survey was performed in four general hospitals in the Republic of Korea between July and August 2010. The study hospitals included three >500-bed tertiary care centers and a single 350-bed secondary care center. All centers were assigned as local influenza centers by the Korean government during the outbreak. During the outbreak, all of these centers established isolated influenza facilities using tents or separate warehouses outside of the main hospital buildings for daytime outpatient visits. Emergency departments undertook some outpatient care during holidays or weekday nights. Several inpatient rooms were designated for admitted patients with pandemic H1N1 2009. However, these rooms were located in the general ward due to the absence of specialized isolation wards among the study hospitals. HCP who had been on duty during the outbreak were invited to participate in the survey. The anonymous, selfadministered questionnaires were distributed and collected by infection control personnel of the study hospitals. The questionnaire was developed to assess the following characteristics of HCP: age, gender, job type, facility type in which they principally worked during the outbreak, presence of underlying diseases associated with influenza complications, adherence to isolation precautions, presence of influenza-like illness (ILI), the receipt of diagnostic tests for pandemic H1N1 2009, the results of the tests, the number of household members, the presence of ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 among household members, the associations of the family member illnesses with those of HCP within one week, and the order of illness onset in HCP families. Job types were classified as physician, nurse, nursing assistant, technician, or jobs not directly related to patient care. Facility types in which HCP had principally worked were classified as influenza outpatient department, influenza inpatient department, non-influenza outpatient department, non-influenza inpatient department, emergency department, or facilities not directly related to patient care. The levels of adherence to isolation precautions were rated according to a four-point scale (always-often-rarely-never). Optimal adherence was determined for responses of "always" ILI was considered to be present if HCP experienced an acute episode including at least one respiratory symptom, such as cough, sputum production, rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction, with documented or subjective fever. The presence of pandemic H1N1 2009 was noted if HCP had a positive result in either the rapid influenza antigen detection test (RIDT) for type A influenza or in the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 12.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). For univariate analysis, a c 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for the development of ILI among HCP. All p-values were twotailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
