Robust laboratory-based real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tools were described immediately after MERS-CoV was discovered and remain reliable [44] . Several different research-based antibody detection protocols have also been reported for human and animal studies [45] . Molecular and serological kits are commercially available [46] . While current molecular methods are rapid, there are many steps that combine to delay publication of a final test result; from the initial decision to request a MERS-CoV test, to sample collection, nucleic acid extraction, PCR, additional sampling, repeat testing, and reporting processes. Molecular, rapid, and sensitive point-of-care tests (POCTs) are not available but would help support infection control in healthcare settings. The World Health Organisation recommends testing of appropriate samples for MERS-CoV RNA using real-time RT-PCR methods with subgenomic sequencing to confirm screening results, as necessary [47] . Repeat testing is often required [17, 48] . Virus isolation by culture is not a recommended tool. Detecting antibodies against MERS-CoV may be useful to identify a seroconversion that can define a probable case when confirmation by RT-PCR has been unsuccessful or impossible [47] . Mild and subclinical MERS cases are reported among younger people including healthcare workers and children [17, 49, 50] . It remains unclear what proportion of MERS-CoV infections are truly subclinical after one study found many were initially incorrectly classified [51] . Difficulty identifying a useful diagnostic antibody response in mild and subclinical disease means seroprevalence studies likely under-report the history of MERS-CoV [40] ; MERS-CoV specific CD8 + testing may be helpful [43] . The usefulness of serology needs clarification.
