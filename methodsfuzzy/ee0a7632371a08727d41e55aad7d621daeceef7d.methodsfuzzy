Introduction: Current molecular methods for testing Zika virus face several challenges such as 1) simplification of sample preparation from blood, 2) reagent stability under ambient conditions, 3) ease-of-use for the end-user and 4) affordable pricing. Reverse transcription coupled Loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a highly sensitive, rapid molecular method which can be used to detect Zika virus RNA. We report on the performance of a simplified Zika assay in an easy to use LAMP platform. Methods: The Meridian illumigene Zika (Research Use Only, RUO) reverse transcription coupled DNA Amplification Assay, uses one step RT-LAMP to detect the RNA of Zika virus. During LAMP amplification, magnesiumpyrophosphate accumulates, changing the absorbance of the reaction mixture. The absorbance change is measured by the Meridian illumipro-10 instrument. A one step purification based on chemical lysis and gel filtration was designed to extract Zika virus RNA from whole blood. Purification procedure uses gravity-driven gel filtration column, Meridian M-prep that produces amplifiable RNA within 5 to 7 minutes. Simulated blood samples were prepared by mixing particles of Zika virus with donor blood samples. Viral DNA was purified using M-prep and directly amplified in one step RT-LAMP assay. Amplification of target was detected using illumipro-10 readers. Results: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of illumigene Zika assay is 840 Copies/mL. The assay also detected the synthetic templates representing highly polymorphic seven strains of Zika virus. In addition, the assay also detected the RNA of commercially available strains of Zika virus. No cross-reactivity was observed with synthetic templates of closely related Dengue type 1 and 2. Conclusions: The RT-LAMP based illumigene Zika assay was demonstrated to detect Zika virus from whole blood samples with high analytical sensitivity using an extremely simple procedure, in less than one hour. No blood fractionation or additional lab equipment (centrifuge or heat blocks) was necessary. The described RT-LAMP may be particularly suitable for deployment in resources limited settings. This provides a much needed alternative to the more complex molecular test for Zika diagnosis. NOTE: The illumipro-10 and M-prep are not cleared for use with the illumigene Zika RUO assay. M-prep is CE Marked, not cleared for use in the United States of America. (68) samples were evaluated. All samples were nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSW) collected in BD viral transport media (VTM), stored at 4°C. Primary patient testing was performed on either the BioFire (BF) FilmArray Respiratory Panel or the Cepheid Xpert FLU/AB/RSV assay. The maximum time from collection to evaluation was 72h. Testing on all three platforms was performed on the same day. Alere is CLIA waived for direct nasal swabs, CLIA moderate for swabs in VTM. Sofia is CLIA waived for nasal swabs and NPSW tested directly, and NPSW in VTM. Xpress is CLIA waived for NPSW in VTM. All three assays were run according to manufacturers' instructions. Evaluation Criteria: Samples had to be positive with at least two systems (BF, Alere, Xpert, Sofia) to be included in the study. Several operators performed testing and evaluated hands-on time for each assay. Results: Ten samples were negative for Flu A,B,RSV; 4 samples were Flu A-, B-, RSV+; and 6 samples were Flu A,B,RSV-and positive for other targets. Twenty-seven samples were Flu A+; 21 samples were Flu B+. Of the 68 samples, 22 were discrepant on at least one of the 3 systems. Four of the discrepant samples positive for Flu A in BF and negative with all three comparison assays were excluded from further evaluation. Forty-six samples agreed across all systems: 20 Flu A/B-, 16 Flu A+/ B-, and 10 Flu B+/ A-. Sensitivity: Alere 82.6% A+, 81% B+; Xpress 100% Flu A,B; Sofia 69.6% A+, 47.6% B+. Specificity: 100% for all platforms. Hands-on/testing times for each platform are: Sofia 2.5 min set up time, 15 min incubation and read totaling18 min. Alere 15 minutes directly from swab and 18 min if testing swab in VTM; about 2 min hands-on time. Xpress 1 to 2 min set-up time, 60 min incubation. Conclusions: Timely testing at the POC with a rapid accurate influenza test will directly impact appropriate treatment. The Xpert Xpress platform had the highest sensitivity (100%) with results in 1 hr. The sensitivity of Alere was 82.6% and 81% for Flu A and B respectively, results in 18 min. Sofia had the lowest sensitivity with 69.6% and 47.6% for Flu A and B respectively; results in about 18 min. When considering rapid systems, accuracy, hands-on time, incubation time, and interface capability should all be considered for the final system selection. D. Brinza 1 , R. Chen 1 , J.

Introduction: Detection and characterization of tumor DNA from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of tracking tumor recurrence and resistance of tumors may improve outcomes in the future. Research studies suggest that somatic DNA mutations in tumor clones can serve as biomarkers that can be tracked in plasma from blood. Tumor DNA comes from different tumor clones, and its abundance in plasma can be very low requiring ability to detect mutation biomarkers at very low frequency from cfDNA. For an efficient low input DNA solution it is necessary to have highly accurate and low-loss interrogation of cfDNA fragments. Here we describe computational and analytical methods used to develop such assay, including a variant calling method that utilizes molecular tagging and enables accurate detection of variants at frequency above 0.05%. Methods: We present computational methods used in development of a multiplex next-generation sequencing assay to optimize cfDNA fragments capturing efficiency, on-target rate, amplification uniformity, primerdimer interactions, molecular tag structure, and number of systematic errors. Followed by an analysis algorithm that models errors accumulated during amplification and sequencing, and accurately reconstructs sequence of tagged DNA molecules based on multiple next-generation sequencing reads. We then developed a variant calling method that uses accurately reconstructed sequences, models offtarget amplification, and PCR polymerase errors to enable sensitive and specific detection of somatic mutations to 0.05% allele ratio. The limit of detection is sample specific and it is dynamically determined by the number of captured DNA molecules. We used our design methods to develop a next-generation sequencing assay that allows interrogation of~150 biomarkers relevant in lung from COSMIC and Oncomine databases, and de-novo variant detection at ~1,700 genomic positions in 11 genes implicated in non-small cell lung cancer. Results: We demonstrate assay performance and accuracy of variant analysis in control and archived cfDNA research samples. The assay delivers >95% on target reads and highly uniform amplification across targeted cfDNA molecules with input DNA of 1ng or higher, and has a fast turnaround time from extracted DNA to variants of less than 24 hr. Observed limits of detection are 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.05% for amounts of input cfDNA of 1ng, 20ng, and 50ng respectively. This limits are defined for >90% sensitive and >99.5% specific variant calling. For doubled input DNA amount we observe >95% sensitivity and >99.8% specificity. Conclusions: Described computational and analytical methods for assay design and variant calling may facilitate researchers to study relevant biomarkers at 0.05% frequency in cfDNA. T.

Introduction: Detection of driver gene alterations including gene rearrangements is an essential step for a treatment decision of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, genetic testings generally require invasive biopsy. Liquid biopsy is a promising technology which can detect gene alterations with minimal invasions. Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been revealed to be useful to detect cancer gene alterations. However, it is difficult to accurately detect gene rearrangements by ctDNA based liquid biopsy even though various methods have been tried. On the other hand, there is cell-free tumor RNA in circulation (ctRNA) as is the case with ctDNA. Therefore, we aimed to develop high sensitivity detection methods for EML4-ALK fusion using ctRNA. Methods: We developed two different high sensitivity detection methods of EML4-ALK fusion based on RT-PCR. The first was multiplexed RT-PCR with fusion specific hydrolysis probes combined with preamplification (OneTube assay). The second was detection of 3' ALK mRNA with nested RT-PCR (NestedPCR assay). Blood samples were collected from patients with EML4-ALK positive lung adenocarcinoma with EDTA blood collection tubes and then centrifuged. Blood plasma samples were stored at -80°C until use. RNA extracted from cell-free culture supernatant of H2228 cell line was used as positive control. RNA was extracted from 1mL stored plasma with Plasma/Serum RNA Purification Midi Kit (Norgen). Results: OneTube assay accurately detected EML4-ALK fusion from diluted samples which contained approximately 2.5 copies of cellfree culture supernatant RNA. OneTube assay was considered to have the ability to detect 1 copy of fusion mRNA considering sample concentration inhomogeneity. NestedPCR assay had equivalent sensitivity with OneTube assay. Both methods could detect EML4-ALK fusion from culture supernatant ctRNA although they could not detect from six clinical plasma samples. Conclusions: We succeeded in development of 2 different high sensitivity detection methods of EML4-ALK fusion. However, we could not detect EML4-ALK from plasma ctRNA. It is expected that there is no or very little amount of ctRNA in plasma samples. Development of a novel method enriching ctRNA is needed to detect gene rearrangements by liquid biopsy with plasma ctRNA. S. Gunn 1 , 2 , C. Sims 1 , 2 , S. Govender 1 , A. Khurana 1 , M. Moore 1 , P. Cotter 1 1 ResearchDx/PacificDx, Irvine, CA; 2 Targeted Genomics, San Antonio, TX. Introduction: In breast cancer with amplification of the CEP17 probe region and equivocal HER2 results by FISH, alternative HER2 probe sets (representing the 17p13, 17p12, and/or 17q21 regions) have been proposed as a method for establishing a stable denominator to reveal the tumor's "true" HER2 gene copy number status. However, the chromosome 17 regions represented by these alternative probes can themselves contain genomic loci that are commonly rearranged in cancer (TP53 loss at 17p13), (RARA amplification at 17q21), and inherited polyneuropathy (CMT duplications, deletions, or translocations at 17p12) resulting in false skewing of the HER2 gene/alternative probe ratio towards negative, positive, or equivocal. Methods: In the current study, DNA was extracted from IHCtargeted HER2 receptor "hot-spots" representing 25 FFPE breast tumors previously characterized by FISH for HER2 gene copy number. Tumor DNA (test) and human genomic DNA (reference with known diploid HER2 gene copy number) (Promega, The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics ■ jmd.amjpathol.org Madison WI) were differentially labeled with Alexa Fluor dyes, and competitively hybridized to a custom-designed oligonucleotide genomic DNA microarray with highdensity probe coverage of the HER2 amplicon on chromosome 17 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA). The array design includes over 4,600 chromosome 17 probes representing the p arm, q arm, telomeric and centromeric regions with 66 tiling probes over the HER2 (ERBB2) gene. Following hybridization, average HER2 gene copy number was calculated for each tumor sample by converting mean log2 signal intensity ratio value into genomic region copy number adjusted for % clonal fraction and experimentally established log2 ratio compression of the assay. Results: All samples yielded adequate DNA for array CGH analysis and HER2 gene copy number was scored as: HER2-Negative, < 4 copies, HER2-Low, 4-6 copies, HER2-Positive, > 6 copies. In 25/25 (100%) of cases, HER2 gene copy number results were consistent with FISH results: Conclusions: Calculation of average HER2 gene copy number using array CGH derived mean log2 ratios with reference DNA of known diploid HER2 gene copy number circumvents ratio skewing associated with unstable chromosome 17 reference probes, and provides an alternative high-resolution method for determining HER2 status in FISH equivocal breast cancer. The study group consisted of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections from 30 GCLS resection specimens. All cases were subjected to in situ hybridization for EBER and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2. DNA mismatch repair status was assessed using IHC (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) and PCR analysis for MSI. DNA was extracted from tumor and matched-normal specimens and sequenced on the Ion Proton using Comprehensive Cancer Panel (ThermoFisher) that targets 409 cancer-related genes. Data were analyzed using the Variant caller 4.4 software and Ion Reporter (ThermoFisher). Results: Five (17%) cases were EBV+ and microsatellite stable (EBV+), 12 were EBV-negative with MSI (MSI), and 13 were EBV-negative and MSS (EBV-/MSS). PIK3CA variants within the kinase domain were common in EBV+ tumors (43%), whereas 36% of MSI tumors showed helical domain variants. ERBB2 variants were more prevalent in EBV+ (43%) and MSS (27%) groups. Somatic alterations in KRAS were detected in 45% MSI cases. EBV-/MSS tumors often harbored TP53 variants (>80%). and 3 (23%) were genetically unstable with numerous alterations. Copy Number Alterations (CNA) were more common among MSS and EBV+ tumors than EBV-/MSS cancers, with frequent amplification of PIK3CA, JAK2, and MYC in EBV+ cases and amplifications in EGFR, JAK2 and BAI3 in the MSS group. Several tumors in all groups had amplifications and deletions in APC. Amplification of ERBB2 was lacking in GCLS, and only one case (3%) showed HER-2 staining by IHC. Conclusions: Molecular changes in GCLS are heterogeneous, but seem to cluster in three major groups: EBV+/MSS, EBV-/MSI, and EBV-/MSS. EBV+ tumors commonly show PIK3CA variants and high-frequency CNA, raising the possibility that affected patients may benefit from PI3-kinase inhibitors, or have a better prognosis than patients with EBV-/MSS tumors.

Introduction: Recurrent copy number gains of 20q have been observed in several malignancies. Despite several studies investigating 20q gain on a functional level, 20q gain in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has not been methodically investigated in relation to clinicopathologic and molecular features including prognosis and response to treatment. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular and clinical features of CRC harboring 20q gain. Methods: Tumor and matched normal DNA from patients with advanced CRC were sequenced using the MSK-IMPACT assay which detects somatic alterations in 410 cancer genes (PMID: 25801821). C.L.

Introduction: DNA-based microarray technology is useful for providing information about gene copy-number and chromosomal aneuploidy. Formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue is an important yet difficult sample type to work with in molecular assays. The chemical fixation process intended to preserve specimens for long term storage causes genetic information to be lost through DNA/protein cross linking and the creation of apurinic sites. Further compounding the problem, longterm storage of blocks before molecular analysis contributes to nucleic acid degradation. Here we describe a method for reference size matching, amplification and fluorescent labeling of FFPE specimens that yields high quality material for downstream DNA-based microarray analysis of this difficult sample type. Methods: In the current study, nucleic acid extraction was performed for 50 FFPE samples using the QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit either manually or on the QIAcube, followed by fragmentation using an Episonic 2000 sonicator to a mean library size of 500bp (with a +/-100bp cutoff interval) tapering off to 2000bp. Mean library size was determined electrophoretically using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent); samples were matched to an appropriately fragmented reference. Whole genome amplification and incorporation of 5-(3 aminoallyl)-dUTP was performed using the GenomePlex Whole Genome Amplification kit (Sigma-Aldrich). To allow for size selection of DNA libraries, while maintaining the mean library size, amplification products were cleaned up using Agencourt Ampure XP DNA magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Fluorophore (NHS Ester) coupling was performed under basic conditions. Final labeled products were cleaned up using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean up kit (Machery Nagel). Degree of labeling (DOL), dye molecules per 100 bases, and total recovery was measured spectrophotometrically using a Nanodrop 2000 instrument (Thermo Scientific). Results: All samples yielded labeled DNA of sufficient quality and quantity for downstream analysis on the Agilent SureScan G4900DA using the following QC metrics: optimal DOL of 2.5, and at least 1000ng to 2000ng of labeled DNA required for an Agilent 8x60k microarray. Across the 50 samples tested, mean DOL was 2.2 (acceptable range 1.5 to 3.5). Mean labeled DNA yield was 3000ng (acceptable range 2000ng to 4000ng). Conclusions: As technology and our ability to ask and answer genetic questions about solid tumors improve, FFPE solid tumor specimens will become central to the molecular diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of disease. Given the use of commercially available kits and easily sourced reagents, the method described could be optimized for use on any microarray based analysis platform. Introduction: Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare type of salivary gland cancer (SGC), typically refractory to treatment and with a particularly aggressive clinical course. Whereas specific gene fusions have been conclusively associated with other types of salivary gland malignancies, it remains to be determined whether genetic rearrangements are a characteristic feature of SDC. In the current study, we sought to explore this possibility. Methods: Nucleic acid from 42 SDC archival specimens was evaluated for structural rearrangements by a targeted gene-fusion assay based on anchored multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing (AMP-NGS). In addition, tumor genotyping, focused on a panel of clinically-relevant genes, was performed using a DNA-based AMP-NGS platform. HER2 gene amplification was assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Oncogenic fusions were detected in 8 (19%) tumors. Four SDC harbored RET gene rearrangements, including 3 NCOA4-RET fusions and one case with a TRIM33-RET fusion. Additional translocations included one case each of: CHCHD7-PLAG1 and FGFR2-KIAA1598 fusions, and previously unreported CCDC6-EGFR and ETV6-MET rearrangements. Out of these translocations, only two had been previously associated with salivary gland neoplasms: CHCHD7-PLAG1 fusions have been reported in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland, and ETV6 rearrangements (with NTRK3, not MET) have been associated with mammary analogue secretory carcinoma. By contrast, similar rearrangements involving the RET oncogene have been described in papillary thyroid tumors and in lung adenocarcinoma, and FGFR2-KIAA1598 fusions have been reported in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but were never associated with salivary gland tumors. Targeted genotyping identified additional mutations in TP53 (63%), PIK3CA (17%), HRAS (11%), CDH1 (7%), PIK3R1 (7%), and BRAF (5%). HER2 gene amplification was observed in 31% of the cases. With the exception of mutations in TP53, oncogenic rearrangements in SDC did not overlap with other genetic abnormalities. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that genetic rearrangements are prevalent in SDC. Molecular analysis detected clinically-relevant alterations in 86% of the cohort and implicated novel genetic drivers in the pathogenesis of SDC. Importantly, due to the availability of targeted inhibitors, EGFR, MET and FGFR fusions may have therapeutic potential. Our findings highlight the utility of using multiple testing modalities in the discovery of actionable genetic alterations in SDC. The high prevalence of potential targets identified in our study may also expand the therapeutic strategies for these patients. Introduction: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a critical technology in guiding patient treatment in clinical oncology. As laboratories are increasingly challenged to reduce testing time while managing increased sample volumes, there is a high demand for targeted panels that offer rapid library preparation and the ability to highly multiplex patient samples. Here we evaluate the Pillar SLIMamp Lung and Colon Hot Spots Panel and compare the results to the Ion Torrent Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2). Methods: A total of 15 samples were included in this evaluation: six non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and nine colon adenocarcinoma. All samples had DNA concentration higher than 50 ng/μL and high DNA quality (Q129bp/Q41bp: 0.8 to 0.92) according to the KAPA hgDNA Quantification and QC Kit. Library preparation was performed using 50 ng and 5 ng of gDNA of each sample. A total of 30 samples were normalized using Qubit, pooled and sequenced on the v3 cartridge on the Illumina's MiSeq system. For data analysis, FASTq files were uploaded to the Pillar, where sequence alignment, annotation, and variant classification were performed. Variant calls within genomic regions covered by both panels were compared. Results: For the 15 FFPE samples, there was a high degree of concordance between the SLIMamp Lung and Colon Hot Spots Panel and CHPv2 variant calls (90.0%, 27/30 variants). Three variants that were called by the Pillar panel were not called using the CHPv2 (two single base-pair deletions and one-point mutation). In addition, variant calls for the Pillar panel were highly reproducible using both 50 ng and 5 ng of input material (100.0% concordance, 30/30 variants). Allelic frequencies for the variants detected in the 50 ng and 5 ng replicates were also highly reproducible (average deviation of 1.5% between replicates). Conclusions: As NGS tumor profiling becomes an increasingly integral component in determining patient treatment, clinical laboratories will need to accommodate high sample volumes and variable specimen quality. The Pillar SLIMamp Lung and Colon Hot Spots sequencing panel allows laboratories to perform accurate, highly-multiplexed, targeted NGS using benchtop instruments. In addition, this panel demonstrates a high degree of reproducibility in variant calls using both average and extremely low FFPE DNA inputs. K. Krishnan, E. Yigit, M. Karaca, B. Langhorst, T.

Introduction: RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) has become the most popular method for transcriptome analysis. It is widely used for gene expression analysis, detection of mutations, fusion transcripts, alternative splicing, and post-transcriptional modifications. Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) and sample barcoding strategies allow analysis of multiple samples in parallel in a cost effective manner. As RNA-seq is being rapidly adopted for molecular diagnostics, the quality and reproducibility of library preparation methods are becoming more important. In addition, demand for library preparation methods that support successful NGS library construction from low input RNA or precious clinical samples is increasing. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a strandspecific RNA-seq library preparation method that retains information about which strand of DNA is transcribed from as low as 10 ng total RNA input. Strand specificity is important for the correct annotation of genes, identification of antisense transcripts with potential regulatory roles, and for correct determination of gene expression levels in the presence of antisense transcripts. Methods: poly-A mRNA from Universal Human Reference RNA (10 ng -1000 ng total RNA) was enriched to make libraries using our strand specific method. Libraries were analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, pooled at equimolar ratio and sequenced on Illumina's Nextseq 500. Paired end reads were mapped to a human reference genome (hg19) using Hisat2 and sequencing metrics were calculated using Picard's RNA-seq Metrics and RSeqC tools. Transcript abundance was measured using Salmon and the Ensembl GRCh38 CDS sequences. Results: Libraries prepared with our streamlined method using inputs that range from 10ng to 100ng show greater than 98% directionality at all input levels. Furthermore, GC content analysis, gene body coverage and gene expression correlation are similar for all inputs tested (10 ng, 100 ng, 1000 ng) even though input amount varies by three orders of magnitude. These consistent results are recapitulated with the spiked-in ERCC controls at all inputs. Conclusions: Our library preparation method is streamlined and can be used for a wide range of input RNA without any major modifications to the protocol, making it a convenient method for RNA-seq library preparation. In addition, it has increased sensitivity and specificity, especially for low-abundance transcripts, reduced PCR duplicates and sequence bias, delivering high quality strand-specific data even for low input RNA. Finally, our method is compatible with both poly A-tail enriched and ribosomal RNA depleted samples, and is amenable to large-scale library construction and automation. Introduction: A (GGGGCC)n hexanucleotide repeat expansion in an intronic region of the C9orf72 gene has been observed in the general population with a frequency of ~1/600 and is present in ~10% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Fewer than 30 repeats are considered normal whereas pathogenic C9orf72 expansions have 100's to 1000's of repeats. The GCrich repeat poses formidable challenges to routine PCR-based fragment sizing methods, and currently requires analysis using multiple short-range PCR reactions for each sample followed by Southern blot (SB) analysis of expanded samples. Here we describe a two-site evaluation of a single-tube, highly streamlined PCR assay that both detects C9orf72 expansions and sizes expanded alleles with 100's of repeats. Methods: AmplideX PCR reagents were optimized for the amplification of C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeats. Amplicons were sized on a 3500xL or 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher) and/or SeaKem LE Plus agarose gels (Lonza). The assay was evaluated at both the University of Pennsylvania (Site 1) and Asuragen (Site 2). Site 1 evaluated a subset of NINDS ALS samples (n=50) and an independent set of ALS and FTD patient-derived from peripheral blood (n=100, 50 of which were expanded), saliva (n=10 expanded), and brain (n=30 expanded) specimens. Site 2 assessed a broader set of NINDS ALS samples (n=119, 72 of which were expanded), including those in common with Site 1, as part of a larger study to analyze the full collection (n=2100). Results: Across both testing sites, repeat numbers were resolved consistent with previous annotations for all normal samples and up to 145 repeats for expanded samples. Fragment sizing was limited only by the resolution limitations of capillary electrophoresis (CE). Compatibility with both blood and brain FFPE DNA at 40 ng inputs was demonstrated, and samples with size mosaicism or indels could be identified from the repeat-primed CE traces. Site 2 further demonstrated sensitivity to as little as 1 ng input of cell-line DNA. This site also showed proof-of-concept for agarose gel sizing of PCR amplicons from expansions with up to 800 repeats, which is >10-fold larger than any published report The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics ■ jmd.amjpathol.org using PCR. Conclusions: A multi-site evaluation of a long-read C9orf72 PCR technology revealed both the reliable quantification up to 145 hexanucleotide repeats at high resolution on CE and the identification of repeat expansions irrespective of size, all in a single assay. This innovative, high-throughput PCR has important implications for clinical research and emerging diagnostic, therapeutic, and screening applications for ALS and FTD, and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.

Introduction: Approximately 25% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not candidates for tissue biopsies and in some cases where tissue is obtained, it is not always of sufficient quantity or quality for molecular testing. Thus, the detection of circulating nucleic acids has become relevant in the Clinical Laboratory setting. Methods: In this study, we have focused on the optimization of the nucleic extraction step (manual versus automated) for a commercially-available diagnostic test system for NSCLC, GeneStrat. Criteria for evaluation included yield of circulating free (cf) nucleic acids, droplet counts for somatic mutant variants and the counterpart wild-type, as well as percentage minor allelic frequency (%MAF) as measured with validated assays. The specific assays used to evaluate performance were for KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D, EGFR T790M and EGFR del19 (A740-E746). As the reference method for evaluation of the automated QIAsymphony SP we used the previously validated "manual" method developed using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Performance was determined by detection of recovered DNA variants by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). For our reference and test arms, plasma from four donors with NSCLC and from four parallel processed spiked mixed allelic frequency DNA sample with known %MAF, were extracted and tested by GeneStrat. Results: Three of the clinical samples and all four of the spiked control sample extractions yielded results. Operator error accounted for the loss of one of the clinical samples during the manual extraction method. Overall, we observed that the automated method performed at least equivalently or was slightly superior to the established manual method when evaluating any of the measures in this study. The automated system yielded better results when evaluating the average percent differences for the variants and wildtype counts from both clinical samples (16% and 3%, respectively) and for the analytic samples (3% and 11%, respectively). Overall method variability as evaluated by calculated differences in %MAF between the methods were below 0.01% (0% to 0.01%). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the automated and manual methods of recovering circulating nucleic from plasma perform at least equivalently for the gene read-outs and test system evaluated here. The quality and yield of cf DNA from the automated process was sufficient to meet the previously established criteria for the manual performance of the assays. Evaluations are on-going with the automated systems for larger plasma volumes and increased numbers of samples that could be processed in parallel.
