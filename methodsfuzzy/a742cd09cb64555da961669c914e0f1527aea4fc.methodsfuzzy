Cell cultures. SCP cells were prepared from the choroid plexus of domestic Hampshire or Suffolk sheep and serially propagated by methods previously described (Harter and Choppin, 1967) . EBTr cells were purchased from the American Cell Type Culture Collection. SV40-transformed lamb choroid plexus (SCP-T) cells were obtained from Drs. 1~. Takemoto and L. Sturman of the National Institutes of Health. Cell lines were maintained in 250-ml plastic flasks in reinforced Eagle's medium (Bablanian et al., 1965) Infection of cells. Monolayers of SCP and EBTr cells grown in 60.mm plastic petri dishes were inoculated at multiplicities of 0.5-2.0 TCIDSO/cell. These low multiplicities were employed so as to prevent the rapid cell fusion and degeneration that occurs when higher virus: cell ratios are used (Harter and Choppin, 1967) . Following adsorption for 3 hours at 36", maintenance medium containing 2 % heat-inactivated lamb serum and 2.0 pg/ml amphotericin B was added, and the cultures were incubated at 36" in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. At intervals of 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after infection the supernatant from infected cultures was removed, and 0.5% bovine plasma albumin (BSA. Fraction V, Armour Pharmaceutical Co., Kankakee, Illinois) was added. Such material was quick-frozen, stored at -70" and later assayed for infectivity. The remaining attached cells were prepared for electron microscopy. Control monolayers were inoculated with medium containing 0.5% BSA and handled in a similar manner. Monolayer cultures of SCP-T cells propagated in 250-ml plastic flasks were inoculated at a multiplicity of 2 TCID,O/cell. Seventytwo hours after inoculation, cells were collected and prepared for electron microscopy. Assay of infected virus. Viral infectivity was determined as previously described by observation of eytopathic changes in SCP monolayers (Harter and Choppin, 1967) . Density gradient purification of virus. Media from infected cultures were clarified by low speed centrifugation, digested with bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, and centrifuged in a cesium chloride density gradient in the manner previously described (Harter et al., 1969) . The banded material was collected, diluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and 0.001 M EDTA, centrifuged at 159,300 g for 3 hours, and prepared for electron microscopy. Preparation for electron microscopy. The SCP and EBTr cell monolayers were washed with Tyrode's solutions, and, after the addition of 1% glutaraldehyde, were scaped off the plastic and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was fixed for 20 min in 1% glutaraldehyde, mashed, postfixed for 20 min with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812). SCP-T cells were treated similarly, except that they were fixed in glutaraldehyde for 1 hour and osmium tetroxide for 30 min. The latter fixation was also used in preparation of pelleted density gradient fractions for electron microscopy. Sections of the embedded cells and virus were stained with uranyl acetate had lead citrate, and examined in an RCA EMU-3G electron microscope.
