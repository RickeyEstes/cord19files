Men and women experiencing fertility difficulties with and without medical experience were sampled from one fertility clinic each in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and two clinics in the United States. Patient advocacy websites in these countries (i.e., Access, American Fertility Association, Resolve, Infertility Awareness Association of Canada, International Consumer Support for Infertility, Infertility Network UK) hosted the online survey. The clinical sample consisted of 291 women and 75 men, and the online sample consisted of 1,014 women and 34 men. The Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology, Cardiff University, approved the online study, and the Internal Review Board of each clinic approved the clinical studies. The FertiQoL technical working group (TWG) managed the FertiQoL project and comprised as core investigators Jacky Boivin, Janet Takefman, and Andrea Braverman, with international collaborators joining the TWG as needed.
