The study cases consisted of 20 trauma patients who were admitted to the emergency room by ambulance. As soon as they arrived in the emergency room, their blood sample were collected, centrifuged, and stored at -80°C. The serum HMGB1 concentration was measured by ELISA. We compared the injury severity score ( Lung heat shock protein (HSP70) expression in glucosamine vs saline following cecal ligation and puncture. Introduction While early aggressive fluid administration has been associated with improved outcome in sepsis [1] , this approach may increase the risk of lung edema and abdominal compartment syndrome when capillary permeability is increased. The aim of this study was to test two different approaches of volume resuscitation in septic animals. Methods Thirty pigs were anaesthetized and invasively monitored (systemic and regional flows and pressures). They were randomized to control, moderate volume (C; n = 7), control, high volume (CH; n = 8), peritonitis, moderate volume (P; n = 8) and peritonitis, high volume (PH; n = 7). Peritonitis was induced by instillation of 1 g/kg autologous faeces dissolved in glucose solution. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain an arterial pO 2 >100 mmHg. Groups CH and PH received 15 ml/kg/hour Ringer's solution plus 5 ml/kg/hour HES 6%, whereas groups C and P received 10 ml/kg/hour Ringer's solution. If clinical signs of hypovolaemia were present, additional boluses of HES 6% (maximally 100 ml/hour) were given. The animals were treated and observed for 24 hours or until death. Results Cardiac output was higher in group PH as compared with the other groups (P < 0.05), while mean arterial pressure was Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 From January 2003 to August 2006 we used APC to treat 44 severely septic patients in our ICU. We obtained complete data for 37 patients. We collected data from the case notes, ICU charts and drotrecogin alfa (activated) data forms and recorded relevant data on an Excel spreadsheet proforma. Results NICE guidelines. We were 100% compliant with patient selection criteria for APC administration, which included a known or suspected site of infection, SIRS criteria and organ dysfunction criteria. All prescriptions were made by intensive care consultants. We were not fully compliant in excluding patients who met exclusion criteria (2/37 patients), although these cases were justified clinically by the consultants prior to administration. Data entry. In 90% of cases the patient selection fields were completed, but only 30% of the exclusion and outcome fields were completed. In 30% of patients where a lactate ≥1.5 times normal was listed as one of the inclusion criteria, it was not associated with a pH ≤ 7.30 or a base deficit ≥5.0; however, all these patients had ≥3 organ-dysfunction criteria and hence still met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes. Seven patients (15.9%) died during or within 28 days of APC administration. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was lower in patients receiving APC when compared with the rest of patients admitted over the same period (SMR ~0.5 vs ~1.0). Twenty-eight patients had an APACHE II score <25 and the effective cost per survivor was ~€16,800. Patients with APACHE II scores ≥25 had an effective cost per survivor of ~€22,400. Nine patients (20.5%) had their drotrecogin alfa (activated) infusions interrupted or discontinued for various reasons (including seven patients who had hemorrhagic complications, three of which were serious). The goal of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of meropenem by continuous infusion administration (CIA) or by bolus intermittent infusion (BII) for the treatment of VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An historic control group with VAP caused by P. aeruginosa who received initial empiric antibiotic therapy with meropenem by BII (n = 32) was compared with a prospective cohort treated with meropenem by CIA (n = 20) in a 12-bed surgical ICU, at a 400-bed surgical complex of a district hospital. We looked for demography, APACHE II score, mortality, attributable mortality for VAP, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU length of stay. VAP was treated during 14 days with meropenem (1 g/6 hours intravenously). The antibiotic clinical effect was categorized as cure or failure. Difference between groups were tested by means of Student's t test end exact chi-square test, using the MedCalc program. We consider values of P < 0.05 as a significant difference. Results Significant differences were not found between both groups of patients in sex, age, APACHE II score, and diagnosis. The CIA group showed significantly greater clinical cure than the BII group (CIA 18/20 (90%) vs BII 21/32 965.6%), P = 0.041) and smaller but not significant attributable mortality to VAP (2 of 20 (10%) vs 10 of 32 (31.3%), P = 0.288). Conclusion Our results suggest that administration of meropenem by CIA may have more clinical efficacy than administration by BII for the treatment of VAP, but more studies are required to confirm this. We treated 27 septic shock patients using DHP-PMX. The patients were separated into two groups for analysis: those whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by more than 30 mmHg immediately after DHP-PMX (15 cases), and those whose SBP did not increase by more than 30 mmHg after DHP-PMX (12 cases). Furthermore, the patients were separated into two other groups for analysis: those whose P/F ratio increased by more than 20% immediately after DHP-PMX (15 cases), and those whose P/F ratio did not increase by more 20% after DHP-PMX (12 cases). Mediators were measured at four points: before and after DHP-PMX, and 1 day and 3 days afterward. The unit is a 10-bed closed-format medical-surgical ICU in a general hospital. Starting in 2003 insulin was prescribed to ICU patients using several nurse-driven computerised protocols, each subsequent protocol aiming for lower glucose levels. From February 2004 until May 2005 protocol 1 was used, aiming for glucose between 5.0 and 9.0 mmol/l; from July 2005 until December 2005 protocol 2 was used, aiming for glucose between 4.5 and 7.5 mmol/l. Serum glucose was measured at 6:00 a.m. in all patients from blood derived from arterial lines or venous puncture. The rest of the day blood glucose was measured either using the Glucotouch (protocol 1) or the AccuCheck (protocol 2) devices. To eliminate differences due to these different methods of measurement, only the 6:00 a.m. glucose measurements done by the central laboratory were studied here. Data were derived from ICU and laboratory databases. Results See Table 1 . The median morning glucose was reduced from 7.5 mmol/l with protocol 1 to 6.8 mmol/l with protocol 2, resulting in small but nonsignificant improvement in outcome. Subgroup analysis focusing on medical or surgical patients or on patients with specific length of stay in the ICU also revealed nonsignificant differences in outcome. Conclusions A small but significant decrease in serum glucose probably results in a small but statistically nonsignificant decrease in mortality and length of stay. The total of 40 patients who had undergone this type of surgery were involved in this study. Near the end of the surgery procedure a percutaneous jejunostomy was performed in 20 patients (G1), and enteral nutrition started on the first postoperative day with small doses of immunonutrient (Reconvan) 10 ml/hour. After every 12 hours the tolerance was estimated (abdominal distension, diarrhoea, vomiting). After every 24 hours the immunonutrient dose was increased by 20 ml/hour until we reached the maximum of 80 ml/hour. In the first three postoperative days the patients were also administered total parenteral nutrition, and after that only enteral nutrition. The other group of 20 patients (G2) was administered only parenteral nutrition from the first postoperative day. Preoperatively, every patient was measured for body weight, body height and body mass index, and using laboratory tests we established the levels of albumin, transferine, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. On the third and ninth postoperative days we repeated the same laboratory tests, and measured the daily loss of nitrogen by excretion of urea in urine. Results and discussion Patient recovery was faster in G1. The average patient stay in ICU was 5 ± 1 days (G1) vs 10 ± 2 days (G2). The average hospital stay was 22 ± 3 days (G1) vs 29 ± 5 days. Peristalsis was detected on the third day as an average (G1) vs 4.5 days (G2). A decrease in pulmonary complications was achieved in G1 (one pleural effusion) vs G2 (eight pleural effusions). Laboratory tests show that patients in G1 are in lower catabolism compared with G2 patients. Conclusion Early enteral immunonutrition through jejunostomy is an efficient and safe method of patient nutrition with fewer postoperative complications, and also accounts for a hospital cost decrease of 50%. Introduction A large randomized trial is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glutamine (GLN) and antioxidant (AOX) supplements. However, high doses of such nutrients via enteral and parenteral routes early in the course of critical illness is often interrupted by high illness acuity and other treatment priorities. The purpose of this pilot trial was to evaluate the feasibility of delivering high-dose GLN and AOX supplements early on in the course of critical illness, and to estimate recruitment for the larger REDOXS study. Methods In six Canadian centers, using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we randomized mechanically ventilated adults who had two or more organ failures within 24 hours of ICU admission to one of four groups: (1) GLN (0.35 g/kg/day i.v. plus 30 g enterally), (2) AOX (500 µg selenium i.v. and 300 µg selenium, 20 mg zinc, 10 mg β-carotene, 500 mg vitamin E, and 1,500 mg vitamin C enterally), (3) both AOX + GLN, and (4) placebo. Supplementation was continued for a minimum of 5 days up to 28 days and was provided independent of nutrition support. We recorded the time from ICU admission to randomization, the time to start of supplements and nutrition support parameters. Results From April 2005 to April 2006, 80 patients were randomized (average 2.1/site/month). The median time from ICU admission to randomization was 18.2 hours (range 11.6-21.1 hours). All patients received parenteral supplements, the median (range) time to start was 2.7 hours (2.0-3.8 hours) and 78/80 (98%) received enteral supplements with a median (range) of 2.6 hours (1.9-4.5 hours) from randomization. The mean duration of supplements was 11.1 days (enteral) and 12.2 days (parenteral). The mean volumes of enteral and parenteral supplements received were 84% (range 45-102%) and 93% (range 54-100%) prescribed volumes, respectively. The average prescribed energy and protein intakes were 1,802 kcal/day and 86 g protein/day but the average daily percentage energy and protein received from nutrition support was only 65% (range 4-95%) and 62% (range 2-97%) of that prescribed, respectively. Conclusion In critically ill patients with organ failure we provided adequate amounts of study supplements via both enteral and parenteral routes in the early phases of acute illness, independent of nutrition support. We estimated recruitment of at least two patients/site/month for our future trial. Introduction Standard selenium (Se) substitution (30-75 µg/day; 0.4-0.9 µmol/l) in the critically ill is not sufficient for a sustained plasma level (0.58-1.82 µmol/l; 46-143 µg/l). Standard Se substitution keeps the plasma level in the range 0.28-0.42 µmol/l. High-dose Se substitution correlated with a decrease in mortality of patients with SIRS. The influence of high-dose substitution on selected parameters, MAP and mortality in the critically ill were evaluated in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods One hundred and twenty-three patients (78 males, 45 females, median age 62.7 and 60 years, respectively) were randomized into group A (SOFA 19.27) and group B (SOFA 10.23). Group A received standard Se substitution: 30-75 µg NaSelenite i.v./day. Group B received high-dose Se substitution according to a protocol: 1,000 µg at day 1, followed with 500 µg at days 2-14 of NaSelenite i.v. The plasma levels of Se, prealbumin, albumin, CRP, PCT, cholesterol, gluthathionperoxidase GSHPx, D-dimer, creatinine clearance and leucocytes were examined daily. MAP trends and 28-day mortality were evaluated as clinical markers. We inserted 16 PICC and 40 MC in patients requiring prolonged venous access (estimated >15 days); nine were septic, six had coagulopathy, 21 had tracheostomy. We used both silicone and polyurethane 4 Fr catheters. Procedures were performed by a team of trained physicians and nurses. Catheter insertion was easy in most cases, and immediate complications were few (no failure; one hematoma; no arterial or nerve injury). Late complications were: one local infection; three thrombosis (two requiring removal); four cases of damage of the external catheter (due to poor nursing or to inappropriate use of the catheter during rx procedures), all easily repaired; one dislocation; no catheter occlusion; no catheter-related bacteremia. Most catheters stayed in place for a prolonged time (range 9-65 days, median 19 days); only three were removed because of complications. Conclusion Our experience with PICC and MC was characterized by an extremely low rate of infective and thrombotic complications. Venous access was achieved in any patient, even with limited availability of peripheral veins. The use of US-inserted PICC and MC should be considered when central access is not advisable or is contraindicated. Introduction Ultrasound has been introduced in the insertion of central venous lines to reduce the complications associated with the conventional landmark technique [1] . We compared both techniques; we noted the number of attempts, the duration of insertion and complications. Methods Thirty patients were randomly selected, from the operating theatre and ICU, who required placement of a central venous catheter. The central venous catheter placement was performed by two experienced anaesthetists with more than 6 years experience in anaesthesia and intensive care. In 15 patients the internal jugular venous catheter placement was performed using the external anatomical landmark technique, and in the other 15 patients the placement was under ultrasound guidance. The duration of insertion was recorded from the moment the needle touched the skin until insertion of the catheter and removal of the guide wire. The numbers of attempts as well as immediate or delayed complications were recorded. Results The central venous catheter placement was successfully performed from the first attempt in both groups. There were no immediate or delayed complications noted; however, the mean time of insertion was longer in the ultrasound-guided group (4.55 min) compared with the external anatomical landmark group (2 min) ( Figure 1 ). Discussion Some studies have been designed to evaluate ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement compared with the conventional method based on external anatomical landmarks. These studies demonstrated the superiority of ultrasound-guided central venous line placement over the external anatomical landmark technique. However, there was no time gain demonstrated in ultrasound-guided placement [2] . On the other hand, a number of studies have expressed several reservations concerning the systematic use of ultrasound guidance for central line placement [3] . In our patients we found that the use of ultrasound neither altered the rate of complication nor the number of attempts in central venous catheter placement. Also the duration of placement of the central line catheter using the external We recently demonstrated in isolated blood perfused rat lungs subjected to i.t. LPS-induced pulmonary oedema that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indirect indicator of progressive lung oedema [1] . Here we extend these findings to two other types of pulmonary oedema: hydrostatic oedema induced by elevation of the left atrial pressure, and alveolar oedema (ALV) by infusing normal saline into the trachea at two different infusion rates (2 and 4 ml/hour for 120 min). See Table 1 . Our results indicate that the continuous measurement of inspiratory resistive work is a good indicator of both permeability and hydrostatic lung oedema, but not of pure alveolar oedema (absence of interstitial oedema  Introduction A reduced content of biophysically active large surfactant aggregates is a common finding in acute inflammatory lung disease. Cyclic surface area changes and a carboxylesterase activity (surfactant convertase) are thought to mediate this subtype conversion. However, data concerning regulation of surfactant convertase are scarce. We therefore investigated the expression and activity of lung surfactant convertase and HMSE-1, a potential macrophage-derived human convertase, under normal and acute inflammatory conditions. Methods Convertase activity in lavage fluid (BALF) was assessed using the in vitro cycling assay. The relative large surfactant aggregate content was determined by phospholipid quantification in the pellet following centrifugation at 48,000 x g. Esterase activity was assessed by means of a chromogenic substrate assay. Expression of both convertase and HMSE upon LPS challenge was assessed by real-time (TaqMan) PCR in murine alveolar macrophages, murine primary type II cells, and the human monocytic cell line U937, respectively. Results Lavage fluid from ARDS patients displayed an increased esterase activity when compared with BALF from healthy controls. In addition, a pronounced large to small aggregate conversion was observed for BALF from LPS-challenged mice or BALF from ARDS patients. Incubation with LPS resulted in a significant increase in convertase gene expression in primary mouse type II cells as well as in HMSE-1 gene expression in U937 cells and monocytes from peripheral blood. No convertase expression was found in cultured murine alveolar macrophages. Conclusions An increased convertase activity was found under acute inflammatory conditions of the alveolar compartment, and type II cells seem to be a relevant source of this increased convertase activity. However, leakage of esterase activity from the vascular space and other inflammatory cells cannot be ruled out.  were used for this study. The rats in the control group (n = 6) were injected with saline of 2 ml intraperitoneally, and the rats in the experimental group (n = 6) were treated with intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of 40 mg/kg. The hemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gas analysis, BL and PtO 2 were measured in both groups. TL and pyruvate in subcutaneous tissue were measured using microdialysis. These parameters were measured every 50 minutes until 400 minutes after LPS was administered. We performed four consecutive lithium dilution cardiac output determinations on 70 critically ill patients requiring haemodynamic monitoring. The heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (mAP) were documented in conjunction with cardiac output estimation. Data were excluded if a ±5% change in HR, CVP or mAP occurred during the sequential measurements. The CV ((SD/mean cardiac output) x 100) was calculated for single measurements and for the average of repeated measurements. In order to clinically accept the precision of the technique, we aimed to obtain a CV below 10%. Results Sixty-five series were suitable for analysis. The CV showed a normal distribution and no correlation with the magnitude of the mean cardiac output. The mean CV for single lithium dilution was 12.3%. The CV for the average of n lithium dilutions was 8.6% for n = 2, 7.1% for n = 3, 6.1% for n = 4. Conclusions The CV for one lithium dilution was higher than clinically acceptable (12.3 > 10%). The average of two lithium dilution measurements improves the precision by 30% and shows an excellent CV (that is, 8.6%). When measuring cardiac output with LiDCO an average of two lithium dilution curves provide an excellent precision, and we suggest that in this population (medical/surgical) this approach should always be used when calibrating the pulse pressure algorithm (PulseCO) at the baseline. Results Six patients were studied (five males, one female). All were intubated but none were receiving muscle relaxation. Mean age was 60.6 ± 21.8 years. The mean APACHE II score was 20.8 ± 2.3. Ten paired results were obtained (see Table 1 ). The mean difference of LiDCO from PiCCO overall was -5.49 ± 21.3%. The correlation coefficient r = 0.73 (P = 0.0166). Conclusion There was general agreement between LiDCO and PiCCO. There were significant differences (>30%) in only three out of 10 measurements. Combining the results of >1 lithium calibration may improve accuracy. These results are promising but a larger trial will be required. Introduction Measurement of extravascular lung water (EVLW) obtained with transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCO system) can help the physician to guide fluid management of critically ill patients [1] . The thoracic fluid content (TFC) is a parameter deriving from the electric conductivity of the thorax, determined from intravascular, alveolar and interstitial fluids [2, 3] . Introduction A new device may be used in intensive care to measure the cardiac output (CO) by arterial pulse pressure waveform analysis, but few studies have evaluated the reliability of this method and the correlation with other methods of CO determination. The aims of this study were to evaluate the CO obtained using the Flow Trac™ Vigileo™ and the correlation with CO obtained by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Materials and methods Ten critical care patients admitted to a general ICU were enrolled in the study. All patients were mechanically ventilated (tidal volume 6-8 ml/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH 2 O) and connected to an integrated monitoring system (Flow Trac™/Vigileo™; Ewdards Lifescience, Irvine, CA, USA) that attaches to an arterial cannula. After haemodynamic stabilization the CO was calculated from an arterial pressure-based algorithm that utilises the relationship between pulse pressure and stroke volume. At the same time a TTE examination was performed (Hewlett Packard, SONO 1000) and the CO was calculated by Doppler measurement of the left ventricular outflow area (LVOT) and the velocity-time integral (VTI LVOT), assuming stroke volume = cross-sectional area x VTI. Every patient had two CO determinations by TTE during Flow Trac™ measurement. A regression analysis and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the two methods of CO determination. Results A total of 40 CO determinations were performed in 10 patients. Table 1 reports the main results. Figure 1 and use in severe sepsis compared with 2003 can be seen in Table 1 .  Patients' records were reviewed for the past 2 years. In Yokohama (3,700,000 people), the cardio-S131 pulmonary arrest (CPA) patient is transferred to the nearest ED of the selected 11 hospitals with adequate ability of CPR and cerebral resuscitation. We perform ultrasound, chest X-ray, and blood examination including Troponin in all CPA patients, and cerebral plane CT (40%) or chest CT (7%). CT was not performed in patients with a clearly known aetiology. Introduction We evaluated the time course and relationship of proinflammatory cytokines and procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We hypothesized that an increase of cytokine levels would precede a marked increase in PCT levels and that PCT would be the best predictor of the final neurologic outcome. Methods Data were prospectively collected from 71 patients. Blood samples were taken after admission to the hospital and after 6, 12, 24, 72 and 120 hours. PCT, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα levels were measured using automated assays. On day 14 patients were divided into two neurologic outcome groups according to the Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC 1-3: bad; CPC 4-5: good). Differences between groups were evaluated using a t test. ROC curves were computed to analyze the predictive value of the markers for a bad outcome. Results There was an early and significant increase in TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 after admission to the hospital (14.4 ± 5.2, 185 ± 248 and 89 ± 81 µg/l) and in the ensuing 6 hours (15.6 ± 8.7, 209 ± 239 and 176 ± 232 µg/l) in patients with bad neurologic outcome. Initially, PCT levels were indistinguishable between the groups; however, a striking increase was observed in patients with bad neurologic outcome peaking after 24 hours (16.7 ± 30.0 vs 6.9 ± 2.1 µg/l; P < 0.013). PCT values after 24 hours were the best predictor for a bad neurologic outcome with an area under the curve of 0.91 (cutoff value: 0.44; sensitivity 100%/specificity 62%). Conclusion TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 serum levels are significantly elevated in the early phase after successful CPR in patients with bad neurological outcome. PCT increases are subsequently found and have a high prognostic value for the neurologic outcome. Introduction Mortality among patients surviving to be discharged following inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is high. The present study assesses whether this might be explained by differences in patient factor or in factors at resuscitation. Methods An analysis of IHCA data collected from one Swedish tertiary hospital and from five Finnish secondary hospitals over a 10-year period. The study was limited to patients surviving to be discharged from the hospital. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with survival at 1 year from the arrest. . There was no difference in initial rhythm, delay to defibrillation or delay to return of spontaneous circulation between survivors and nonsurvivors at 12 months. Conclusion Several patient factors, mainly age, functional status and co-morbid disease, influence long-term survival following IHCA. Location of the arrest also influences survival, but the initial rhythm, the delays to defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation do not. Introduction Mild hypothermia (32-34°C) is a promising new therapy for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Animal studies suggest that early and fast cooling is crucial for beneficial effect on neurological outcome. Inducing mild hypothermia immediately after successful restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the out-of-hospital setting remains a challenge. Therefore, a novel cooling-blanket (EMCOOLSpad ® ), independent of any energy source during use, was developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate feasibility and safety of out-of-hospital surface cooling with EMCOOLSpad ® in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Methods We included patients successfully resuscitated from outof-hospital cardiac arrest with an oesophageal temperature (T es ) >34°C. The EMCOOLSpad ® consists of multiple cooling units (12 mm thick), filled with a mixture of graphite/water, which are stored in a cooling box at -3°C in the ambulance car. Cooling was initiated as soon as feasible by the first treating paramedics and emergency physicians, and was continued in the emergency room. The cooling-blanket was removed when the T es reached 34°C. The target temperature of T es 33°C was maintained for 24 hours. Data are presented as the median and interquartile range (25-75%). The clinical subjects consisted of 1,112 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke in the acute stage, hospitalized in our hospital between April 2003 and September 2006. We investigated the clinical course, especially the time from the onset to the physical examination, and radiological examinations (CT, MRI, MRA and/or cerebral angiography). The mean age was 72.3 years. Among them, 334 patients were classified as atherothrombosis, 232 were cardiac embolism, 439 were lacunar infarction and 107 were transient ischemic attack. Only 19 patients underwent acute thrombolytic therapy. Results Two hundred and forty-one patients (21.7%) were hospitalized within 3 hours from the onset, and 365 patients (32.9%) were within 6 hours. Among them, only 438 were admitted by ambulance. We found the following results. The main reason for the delayed admission is through another hospital, not a stroke center. The patients denied their symptoms are not so rare. The patients or their family often hesitate to request the emergency car. Conclusions The most significance point for rapid diagnosis and therapy is that people must doubt 'stroke' at first. We should further educate citizens to the warning signs of stroke and also the necessity of emergency admission using an emergency car. In addition, we should justly build a core stroke center in the district and centralize the patients. We examined interhospital cooperation after critical and emergency care for life-threatening cervicalthoracic-abdominal trauma (n = 501) and thoracoabdominal emergency diseases (n = 236) who were treated with intensive care in our CCEC and were able to be discharged or transferred to another acute treatment hospital. We studied 50 patients with sepsis within the first 48 hours of sepsis. Operating room patients served as control a group (ORCG). Nitrite and nitrate (NO x -) and 3nitrotyrosine (3NT) in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed by the Griess/vanadium chloride method and ELISA, respectively. Results were expressed as median and interquartile range. Receiver operator curves were constructed to compare the predictive value of NO x values in BALF at admission with other variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival between high and low BALF NO x levels at admission. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results At study admission in the sepsis group, nonsurvivors had higher levels of BALF NO Introduction Myocyte stretch is the main stimulus of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) synthesis and release. During septic shock, important variations of volemia can occur and a correlation has been described between the cardiac index and the BNP level [1] . However, the relation between the echocardiographic left ventricule area and the BNP level has never been described. The aim of our study was to evaluate BNP and left ventricule area variations after an acute fluid loading in septic shock. Methods Mechanical ventilated patients with septic shock, and without anterior cardiac disease, were included in our study. A fluid challenge was performed with colloid (500 ml) in 30 minutes. A BNP blood sample was drawn before and 1 hour after fluid loading. The primary endpoint was BNP variation after fluid challenge. Median values (25-75th percentiles) were compared with the Wilcoxon test (P < 0.05). The end-diastolic left ventricule area was recorded before and 1 hour after fluid challenge. Linear regression of BNP variation and left ventricular area variation was determined and r 2 was calculated.  An open prospective observational study as part of the APRiMo project [1] . The study period was January 1996-September 2004. Inclusion criteria were critically ill obstetric patients and ICU length of stay >24 hours. Exclusion criteria were those of the used scores. The main outcome of interest was the survival status at ICU discharge. The database was divided into two samples: development and validation datasets. Development database patients were chosen randomly (n = 414) and the remaining patients composed the validation dataset (n = 229). A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to predict mortality associating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score [2] , Simplified Acute Physiology Score II [3] , Admission Mortality Prediction Model (MPM-H0) and Day 1 Mortality Prediction Model (MPM-H24) [4] . Discrimination and calibration were assessed by goodness-of-fit C-hat statistics and area under the ROC curve. The developed model was then tested in the validation dataset. Good discrimination was retained if C-hat statistics P > 0.1 and good calibration if area under the ROC curve > 0.8.
