As stated in the published results, 30,31 the trytophan residue (Trp121) around the CypA binding site could be used as an intrinsic probe for studying the interaction between CypA and its ligand. Therefore, we investigated the binding affinity of compound DC838 against CypA by using the published intrinsic fluorescence titration technique. 31 During the assay, a 1:1 stoichiometry of CypA/compound binding was performed according to the published result for CypA/CsA interaction. 32, 33 The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K 0 D ) for CypA/DC838 binding was thus calculated according to the literature method. 31 It is assumed that 50% occupancy of CypA is set at a fractional fluorescence change of 0.5 (FC 0.5 ), then at this point the concentration of the bound ligand equals to the bound protein, the half of the total concentration of protein. Accordingly, K 0 D is equal to the total ligand concentration at FC 0.5 minus the concentration of the bound protein. 31 Figure 2 shows the typical tryptophan fluorescence quenching of CypA induced by the titration of DC838 with an increasing concentration. Since compound DC838 itself does not show any intrinsic fluorescence absorption, its possible effect on the experiments could be neglected. Obviously, the evaluated K 0 D value at 3.78 lM is compatible to the K D value by Biacore 3000. Moreover, as indicated in Figure 2 and Table 2 , the fact that DC838 can perturb CsA binding to CypA during the competition assay by shifting the K 0 D to 10.05 lM for CypA binding to CsA implicates that both DC838 and CsA bind to CypA in the same binding pocket. This is in agreement with the molecular docking analysis result of this work, as will be discussed blow.
