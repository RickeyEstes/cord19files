Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the relative hazard of ARI associated with three vaccination exposure statuses (1) unvaccinated (starting day one of study season or day of enrollment until day of vaccination, or the entire study season for unvaccinated individuals), (2) postvaccination as described above, and (3) vaccinated (starting after the post-vaccination risk period) [19, 20] . A time-varying variable was used for the three vaccination statuses. Because multiple ARIs can be reported by the same subject over the course of the study periods and repeat events from the same subject may be correlated, a frailty model was used. The frailty model includes a random variable in the Cox model in order to adjust for potential unmeasured confounders [19, 20] . All models were adjusted for season using a time-varying covariate (Autumn: September-November, Winter: December-February, Spring: March-May/ June) and three time-independent covariates: age (categorized by years: 4, 5-17, 18-49, and !50), gender, and prior diagnosis of chronic respiratory condition (collected as reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or chronic inhaler use). Level of significance was set at a=0.05. SAS version 9.3 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for data analysis. Separate models were conducted for each of the three primary outcomes of ARI based on nasal swab results as (1) influenza, (2) non-influenza respiratory pathogen, or (3) ARI symptoms without pathogen detected within the relevant post-vaccination risk periods (i.e., influenza and non-influenza pathogens in the 14-day risk periods and ARI symptoms without a detected pathogen in the 2-day risk period) ( Fig. 1 ). Analyses were completed for each influenza season separately to evaluate inter-seasonal variability and with the three seasons combined to assess trends and increase power to detect differences in the rate of ARI between the three time intervals. Post-hoc analyses were completed with the three seasons combined to better understand our significant findings. This included stratification by age (i.e., children age <18 years versus adults age !18 years), a sensitivity analysis that included only vaccinated individuals stratified by age, a sensitivity analysis that excluded individuals who received the live attenuated influenza vaccine, and a sensitivity analysis that excluded the two days following vaccination from the 14-day risk period.
