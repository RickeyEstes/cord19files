Cells and Viruses The origin and growth of the L2 cell line has been previously described (Rothels et al., 1959) . Cells were propagated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, New York) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a 100 units/ml of penicillin G and 100 micrograms/ml of streptomycin. wt MHV-JHM employed in these studies has been described previously (Oleszak and Leibowitz, 1990a) . Five independent RNA + ts mutants of MHV-JHM, namely ts104, tsl10, tsl15 Bond et al., 1979) , ts8 and ts15 (Haspel et al., 1978) , have been employed in this study and their characteristics are summarized in Table  1 . Propagation of the ts104, tsll0 and tsl15 mutants and of wt MHV-JHM was carried out as described Bond et al., 1979) .
