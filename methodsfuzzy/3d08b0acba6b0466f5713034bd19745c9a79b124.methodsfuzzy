Virus and cells. The plaque-cloned JHM strain of MHV (Makino et a/., 1984) was used throughout this study. The virus was propagated on DBT cells (Hirano et a/., 1974) at m.o.i. of 1. Virus was harvested and purified from the medium, and viral RNA was prepared as previously described (Makino et a/., 1984) . CDNA cloning.

Hydropathy profiles of the predicted amino acid sequences of ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b. Values above the lrne are hydrophobic and values below the line are hydrophilic. The hydropathicrty was calculated using a moving window of 40 amino acids, with a value plotted every 16 residues (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) . gene 1 were obtained by using specific synthetic oligo-gonucleotides were derived from RNA sequence analynucleotides as primers and purified virion genomic sis of the RNase Tl-resistant oligonucleotides which RNA as template. Initially, the sequences of these olihad been mapped to either gene 1 or 2 (Shieh et al, , 13, 600 13,650 Nucleotide number 13,700 FIG. 3. Dragram of the codon preference in the region between ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b. The codon usage patterns for the three reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequences at the junction between the ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b are shown. The two stop codons at 13600 (TAG) and 13679 (TAA) are marked. The codon usage table was generated for genes 3, 6, and 7, which encode the viral structural proteins, of MHV-IHM (Schmidt er a/., 1987; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) and used for comparison with ORFs 1 a and 1 b. The parameters used are a window length of 25 and a maximum scale of 1.1 (Gribskov et al., 1984) . l BV-M42 5' 12337 GAUAAGAAUUAUUUAAACGGGUACGGGGUAGCAGUG----AGGCUCGGCUGAUACCCCUUGCUAGUGG 3'   II I lllll  11111111111 llllllI  IIII  I II II 11-11111 III Illll  MHV-JHM 5' 13643 GACACGAAUUUUUUAAACGGGUUCGGGGUACAAGUGUAAAUGCCCGUCUUGUACCCUGUGCCAGUGG   3'   MHV-A59 5' 284   llllllll  11111111111 IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlTrIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII   GACACGAACUUUUUAAACGGAUUCGGGGUACAAGUGUAAAUGCCCGUCUUGUACCCUGUGCCAGUGG  3  Comparison of the RNA sequences and the proposed secondary structure of the MHV-JHM, MHV-A59 and IBV RNAs at the junction between ORF 1 a and ORF 1 b.

(B) Tertiary RNA structure at the region of ribosomal frameshifting. The potential signal for ribosomal frameshifting is boxed, and the stop codon is underlined. Arrows indicate the differences in the RNA sequence of MHV-JHM in comparison with that of IBV (boldfaced) and MHV-A59 (outlined).

Translation was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using [35S]methionine. Translation products were analyzed directly (lanes l-3) or after immunoprecipitation using the ORF 1 a-specific antiserum (lanes 4-6) or rabbrt preimmune serum (lanes 7-9). M indicates molecular weight markers in kilodaltons; lanes 3. 6, and 9, translation of pTZ(ORFaug). nant DNAs were transformed into Escherichia co/i strain MVl 190 competent cells (Dagert and Ehrlich, 1979) . Homopolymer dC tailing to the 3'-end of the cDNAs using terminal transferase were also used to anneal to Pstl-linearized pBR322 with oligo(dG) tails and transformed into E. co/i strain MC1 061. Specific cDNA clones were identified using 5'-end-labeled oligonucleotides as probes and confirmed by subsequent hybridization to viral mRNA . Once the sequences of the cDNA clones were obtained, oligonucleotides complementary to the 5'-ends of these clones were synthesized to serve as primers for addi-tional cDNA cloning to obtain overlapping cDNA clones. DNA sequencing. Sequencing was performed as previously described . Both chemical modification (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980) and dideoxynucleotide chain termination @anger et a/., 1977) methods were used directly on plasmid DNA (Chen and Seeburg, 1985) . Construction of recombinant plasmids for the frameshifting analysis. Subcloning and mutagenesis of cDNA clone T-l 2 was accomplished using synthetic oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Briefly, oligomer #166 (5'-GATCGAATTCCTTTACAT-GGTGAAGGGGTG-3') which extends from nucleotide 13,147 to 13,167 of gene 1 and contains mismatches at both nucleotides 13,154 and 13,156, and oligomer #199 (5'-CATATGACACAGGATCCTTTATGCC-3') which is complementary to nucleotides 13,529 to 13,553 and includes the BamHl site at nucleotide 13,537, were used for DNA amplification by PCR according to the standard procedures (Saiki et al., 1988) . The resulting PCR DNA product encompasses sequences from nucleotide 13,147 to 13,537 with a specific mutation (T to A) at nucleotide 13,154 and another (T to G) at nucleotide 13,156, resulting in the introduction of an ATG codon.

It consists of four distinct pieces separated by regions that could not be aligned with certainty. For the latter regions, only the total numbers of amino acid residues are indicated. The amino acid numbers of the first and the last residues of each aligned segment are indicated in parentheses. Two dots, identical residues; single dots, similar residues. Conserved Cys residues are highlighted by boldface. Asterisks, putative catalytic residues of proteases; arrows, putative cleavage sites for BC-like proteases. Box, the putative cleavage site for 3CLpr0 in IBV substituted by a KR dipeptide in MHV-JHM. The IBV sequence was from Boursnell et al. (1987) . MHVA: ORF la of MHV.

Recombinant RNA was translated in the mRNA-dependent rabbit replasmids pTZ(ORFaUg) and pTZ (FrSh) Shin and Morrison (1989) and analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5 to 15% polyacrylamide gel. Computer analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Sequence data were analyzed on a VAX 1852 using the GCG sequence analysis software package developed by Genetics Computer Group of University of Wisconsin. Detailed comparative analyses of coronavirus protein sequences were done by programs MULTALIN (Corpet, 1988 ) OPTAL (Gorbalenya et a/., 1989a), DOTHELIX (Leontovich et al., 1990) , and SITE (Koonin et a/., 1990) . The programs DOTHELIX and SITE are parts of the GENBEE program package for biopolymer sequence analysis.
