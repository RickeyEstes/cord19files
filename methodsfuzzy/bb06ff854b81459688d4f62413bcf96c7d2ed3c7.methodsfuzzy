Horses A total of 36 colts of mixed breeding and aged 5 to 12 months were purchased from a commercial source. An assessment of the maturity of the reproductive tract of each colt was based on age, serum testosterone concentration and ultrasonographic findings. The colts were assigned to either a prepubertal (nos 48-61, 64-70) or a peripubertal (nos 17-31) group. A total of 10 age-matched colts were used as controls (nos 111-118, 255, 257) . All of the animals were confirmed as seronegative to EAV and equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) at the time of purchase and again immediately before inoculation with EAV. It should be noted that shortly before the start of this study, a Streptococcus equi infection spread through the group of peripubertal colts. All indications of infection had resolved before the study began.
