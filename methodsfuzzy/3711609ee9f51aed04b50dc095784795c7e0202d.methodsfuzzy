To a hot solution of 4-substituted-N-phenylthiosemicarbazide (5.98 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was added dropwise a solution of the corresponding 5-substituted-2-thiophene carboxaldehydes (5.98 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) during 15 min. The reaction mixture was refluxed and the progress of the reaction was followed by TLC (about 10 h) and cooled. After cooling the product was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was recrystallized from methanol.
