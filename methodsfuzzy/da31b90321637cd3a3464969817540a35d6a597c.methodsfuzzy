The fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured under the excitation wavelength of 490 nm with a slit width of 10 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000, Japan). The emission peak of FITC is centred at 520 nm, and thus we used the corresponding filters to obtain the needed spectral detail. For atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements, sample solutions containing bare GO or modified GO were pipetted onto freshly cleaved mica and dried in ambient air. Surface topographic features were scanned in contact mode using a commercial AFM (CSPM 4000, Benyuan, China) equipped with a silicon cantilever.
