We assume the existence of several metapopulation units inside a given geographical region such that for each of these the dynamics of disease is well approximated by the standard SIR model. The disease transmission among the units is due to migrating population described using a coupling term. In classic SIR model the s, x, and r represent the susceptible, infected and recovered fractions respectively. However while dealing with multiple meta-populations of heterogeneous sizes we are required to represent them in arbitrary units, typically taking smallest meta-population as the unit. If φ i = s i + x i + r i is the size of metapopulation i in these units, then product terms in SIR model must be divided by φ i for sake of consistency. We can view this system as a network in which metapopulations are the nodes that are connected by links representing migration. We assume that the outward migration rate from node i is proportional to its size φ i . Assuming that a migrating individual at i is equally likely to migrate to any of the k i neighbours, the fraction of population reaching a neighbour is proportional to 1/k i . Finally, we note that, in reality when dealing with spatially extended network, migration between i and j takes place with finite speed and hence there is an associated delay δ ij , which we consider to be proportional to the geographic distance between i and j. Combining all these, our model of interacting meta-populations is the following day) for COVID-19 following the recent estimate by Zhu et al 11 . Now we make a crucial observation that in the real world, in spite of migrations the total population of a city remains more or less constant during the span of a typical epidemic. To enforce this condition the net migration of a node should be zero, although the same cannot be said for s, x, and r sub-populations. Thus This is a self-consistent equation for η i 's, and can be solved iteratively, starting from arbitrary values of η's. The η's thus obtained are determined up to a proportionality constant, say D. In the subsequent sections we consider India to be our geographical region and cities as metapopulation units. The required data is obtained from various online resources [19] [20] [21] .
