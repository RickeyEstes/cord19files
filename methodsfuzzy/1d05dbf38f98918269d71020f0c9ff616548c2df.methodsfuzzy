If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required. Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Yes The authors have determined human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, observed through outpatient surveillance. This study was conducted over 11 months and showed a high prevalence and diversity of HRV in out-patient with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required. The study is a nice examination of the complexity and scope of RV circulation. It adds to an established but growing literature acknowledging that "rhinovirus" is not one virus, but a large group of distinct viruses capable of apparently independent co-circulation. This circulation includes the majority of genotypes (types) at a single location over time using molecular methods augmented with sequencing. The paper notes some important aspects for further study.
