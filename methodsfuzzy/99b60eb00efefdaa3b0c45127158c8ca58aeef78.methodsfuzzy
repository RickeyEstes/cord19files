Experimental Practices for Designing, Performing, and Interpreting qPCR Experiments This work was conducted at the maximum possible extent according to the guidelines on minimum information for publication of qPCR experiments. 24  Measures of agreement between results of standard microbiological tests and the qPCR assay are shown in Table 4 . Positive percentage of agreement varied between 60.0% for S. pneumoniae and 100% for M. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, and RSV. Negative percentage of agreement exceeded 95% for M. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, RSV, and influenza A and was lowest, 55.8%, for H. influenzae. Overall, the qPCR assay detected higher numbers of microbial agents compared with standard diagnostic methods, with a total of 113 and 38 agents, respectively. The difference in diagnostic yield in large part resulted from the panel design of the qPCR assay constantly targeting eight bacterial and six y For some organisms, the number of results for sputum is <44, because the specimen volume was consumed so not all duplex reactions could be completed. Cq, quantitation value; NpA, nasopharyngeal aspirate; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. jmd.amjpathol.org -The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics viral agents compared with standard diagnostic tests variably being applied to respiratory specimens from the corresponding patients. Of the 50 NpA specimens tested with the qPCR assay, 33 were analyzed by standard tests for specific viruses or M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, but no corresponding respiratory specimens were tested for the presence of other bacteria. Nineteen additional observations of bacteria resulted from using the qPCR assay. Of 44 sputum specimens, 38 were tested by standard culture test, but no corresponding tests were performed for identifying viruses or difficult-to-culture bacteria. Two additional M. pneumoniae but no additional observations of viruses resulted from using the qPCR assay. Generally, the increase in detection rate by the qPCR assay was most pronounced for H. influenzae, S. aureus, M. pneumoniae, and RSV (Table 5 and Supplemental Table S2 ). Unique observations by the qPCR assay versus the standard tests and vice versa are highlighted in Table 5 . Notably, two of five specimens were positive for RSV and two of four specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae by the qPCR assay only. Analysis of mean Cq values for positive identification by the qPCR assay found that specimens culture-positive for H. influenzae or S. aureus were significantly lower than values of culture-negative specimens, (P Z 0.0005 and P Z 0.0088, respectively), suggesting that high Cq values represent numbers of bacteria below the detection limit of culture (data not shown). Two of five culture-positive sputum specimens were false negative by the qPCR assay for S. pneumoniae. One of them was also false negative for H. influenzae and positive in the inhibition control assay, indicating the presence of a potent inhibiting substance. In addition, two NpA specimens were false negative for influenza A by the qPCR assay, both with Cq values of >36 cycles in the standard qPCR test, indicative of low viral RNA abundance.
