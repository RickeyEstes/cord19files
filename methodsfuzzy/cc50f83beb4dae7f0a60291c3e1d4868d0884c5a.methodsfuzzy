Preparation of PVX-infected plant material. A pSPVXp31 binary vector, containing PVX full-length cDNA, was kindly provided by Dr. Kim from Seoul National University, Seoul Korea (Park and Kim, 2006 ). An Agro-infiltration method previously described by English et al. (1997) has been applied for PVX infection to Nicotiana benthamiana. After two or three weeks, the treated-leaves were collected from healthy and diseased plants. Total RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the leaves of PVX-infected or non-infected N. benthamiana using the easy-Blue RNA extraction kit (Intron, Republic of Korea) as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Primer design. Primer sets were designed from the coat protein (CP) gene of PVX (Fig. 1) . Three primer sets were designed using Primer Explorer V4 (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan), and the other three primer sets were designed using Lamp Designer (Premier Biosoft, USA). All primers were purified by HPLC.
