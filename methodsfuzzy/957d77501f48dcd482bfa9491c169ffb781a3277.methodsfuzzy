We conducted a matched case-control study, which was nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS, main centres Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, St. Gallen, and ZÃ¼rich; described in detail elsewhere [36] ). We determined plasma levels of MBL (primary exposure variable) and M-ficolin (ficolin-1), Lficolin (ficolin-2), and H-ficolin (ficolin-3) respectively (secondary exposure variables). Two groups of patients were compared: HIVinfected patients with CMV disease (cases), and HIV-infected individuals with CMV antibodies but without CMV disease (controls). Patients with other concurrent opportunistic diseases were not excluded.
