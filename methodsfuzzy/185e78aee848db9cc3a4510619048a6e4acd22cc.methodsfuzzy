Cases were identified after surveying the lymphoma faculty at our institution. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Case Series Patient 1. Patient 1 was 51 years old at initial presentation, with progressively worsening left inguinal lymph node enlargement, fever, malaise, night sweats, and weight loss. He had no significant past medical history. Physical examination was significant for temperature of 103.4 F, palpable spleen tip 2 cm below the mid-costal margin, and a large left inguinal lymph node measuring 10 Â 4 cm. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed splenomegaly, and enlarged periaortic, celiac, retroperitoneal, and left inguinal lymph nodes. Blood and urine cultures were collected and remained sterile; EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive at 1,600,000 copies/mL. Other laboratory values are summarized in Table 1 . Core needle biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node showed cHL, with RS cells positive for Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) by in situ hybridization (ISH), and CD68 staining showed a predominance of macrophages comprising over 50% of the tumor background. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for disease involvement. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed diffuse hypermetabolic activity in lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm as well as focal sites of increased osseous uptake, consistent with Ann Arbor stage IVB disease, with IPS risk score of 6. Intravenous ganciclovir was initiated for treatment of EBV viremia prior to starting chemotherapy. The decision was made to begin treatment with ABVD while inpatient, with doxorubicin dose reduced by 50% (12.5 mg/m 2 ) given bilirubin elevation (3.5 on date of treatment) and risk for reduced clearance, and vinblastine, bleomycin, and dacarbazine given at standard dosing. Vital signs at initiation of treatment were significant for temperature (T) of 97.9 F, heart rate (HR) of 87, weight 112 kg, body max index (BMI) of 33.5 kg/m 2 , and body Table 1 . Vasopressors were weaned off within 12 hours, and the patient was extubated within 24 hours. Bleomycin was omitted from further cycles without subsequent complications. After 6 cycles of treatment, PET imaging was consistent with complete response (CR). The patient remains in follow-up with no evidence of relapse over 3 years after completion of therapy. Patient 2. Patient 2 was 28 years old at diagnosis with a history of HIV infection treated with anti-retroviral therapy; baseline CD4 count was 287 cells/mm 3 with an undetectable HIV viral load. He presented with fever, shortness of breath, and a dry cough. Physical examination was significant for dry mucous membranes, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and an enlarged right axillary lymph node. Baseline laboratory values are summarized in Table 1 . CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral airspace consolidation and an enlarged right axillary lymph node. Bone marrow biopsy was performed and was interpreted as nondiagnostic with necrotizing granulomas noted. The patient was intubated on hospital day 3 for worsening respiratory status and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bronchiolar lavage was consistent with pneumocystis pneumonia, and treatment with methylprednisolone and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was initiated. On hospital day 14, the patient was extubated, and the following day, an excisional right axillary lymph node biopsy was performed that was consistent with cHL, and the patient was transferred to our hospital for further care. The prior bone marrow biopsy was reviewed by hematopathology at our institution and read as consistent with cHL with extensive necrosis with scattered fibro-histiocytic infiltrates containing typical RS cells, positive for EBER by ISH, and numerous CD68þ macrophages present (percentage not enumerated). PET scan showed mildly hypermetabolic left hilar and right peri-bronchial lymph nodes and hypermetabolic postoperative changes in the right axilla. The patient was staged as Ann Arbor stage IVB given the presence of bone marrow involvement, with IPS risk score of 5. Oral valgancyclovir was initiated for treatment of CMV viremia. Therapy was initiated with ABVD given at standard dosing. Vital signs prior to start of treatment were significant for T 99. 8 Table 1 . Blood cultures were collected and remained sterile, and cefepime was initiated empirically. Intravenous saline and 50 mg hydrocortisone were administered as well as hydromorphone for rigors. Symptoms rapidly improved, with normalization of lactate and resolution of fever within 6 hours. Antibiotics were discontinued after 24 hours of negative cultures. ABVD was continued with dexamethasone 20 mg premedication with subsequent infusions, and no further reactions were observed. PET scan was performed after 3 cycles to evaluate response and showed progressive disease. Platinum-based salvage therapy was initiated; the patient is currently alive receiving salvage therapy for refractory cHL. Patient 3. Patient 3 was 62 years old at initial presentation, with a prior history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with 6 cycles of obinutuzumab and otlertuzumab in an investigational protocol completed 3 months prior to presentation. He was diagnosed with IGVH unmutated CLL after presenting with bulky lymphadenopathy; baseline cytogenetics were positive for trisomy 12 as the sole abnormality. During treatment with obinutuzumab and otlertuzumab, he experienced clinical resolution of lymphadenopathy by physical exam. At his end of therapy evaluation 3 months after his sixth cycle of treatment, he noted daily fevers as high as 103 F. Physical exam showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. He was hospitalized for further evaluation with serum EBV PCR positive at 84,523 copies/mL; other laboratory values are summarized in Table 1 . Blood and urine cultures were collected and remained sterile, and other infectious workup was negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with absent CLL cells by morphology or by flow cytometry, but classical RS cells were present, positive for EBER by ISH, with increased surrounding CD68þ macrophages. PET scan showed hypermetabolic activity in cervical, mediastinal, abdominal, and pelvic lymph nodes as well as hypermetabolic liver lesions and diffuse increased uptake throughout the bone marrow. The patient was staged as Ann Arbor stage IVB Richter transformation to cHL with an IPS risk score of 5. Oral valacyclovir was initiated, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Upon outpatient evaluation, the decision was made to initiate treatment with ABVD, given at standard dosing. Vital signs prior to treatment were significant for T 99.5 F, HR 130, weight 92.5 kg, BSA 2.17, and BMI 26.9. At 16:20, bleomycin was administered, and dacarbazine was completed at 16:40. At 17:17, rigors were noted with temperature of 103.5 F, and inpatient admission was requested. By 18:15, confusion and lethargy were noted with T 106 F, HR 144, BP 92/53, and RR 27. Hydrocortisone was administered intravenously (50 mg) as well as oral acetaminophen and normal saline hydration. The patient developed progressive hypoxia with requirement of 13L oxygen by high-flow nasal canula; chest radiograph demonstrated a pulmonary edema pattern bilaterally. Blood and urine cultures were collected and remained sterile, and an extended respiratory viral panel returned positive for coronavirus. Other laboratory values are summarized in Table 1 . Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient developed progressive hypotension; norepinephrine infusion was initiated to maintain a mean arterial BP of 65, and 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone was administered. Hypotension quickly improved, and norepinephrine was titrated off within 12 hours of onset. Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after blood cultures remained sterile for 48 hours, oxygen was weaned off within 24 hours, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. For the remaining cycles of ABVD, dexamethasone 6 mg was given for 2 days prior to treatment in addition to 12 mg on the day of treatment. The patient experienced rigors at home after cycle 1 day 15 and took 6 mg of oral dexamethasone with resolution of symptoms. No subsequent episodes were noted, and the patient completed 6 cycles of ABVD. End of therapy PET was consistent with CR, and end of therapy bone marrow biopsy was negative for cHL or CLL. Within 6 months, relapse of CLL was diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy, and the patient opted to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) with reduced-intensity conditioning from a haplo-identical related donor for definitive treatment of CLL and to mitigate the risk of relapse of Richter transformation to cHL. He remains alive in active follow-up with no evidence of relapse of CLL or cHL over 12 months after HCT.
