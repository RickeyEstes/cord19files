The study is an in silico analysis of the expression of reninangiotensin system genes in connection with lung cancer. A total of 15 renin-angiotensin system related genes were studied (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ). The gene expression analysis was conducted on data sourced from NCBI's GEO database as log2 values. The specific dataset used, GSE10072, profiled the gene expression of lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples and paired noncancerous tissue samples [1] . The dataset was analyzed through the GEO database's integrated statistics utility, GEO2R, in addition to PRISM6 (v.6), GeneSpring (v.13.1), and Microsoft Excel. More specifically, GEO2R calculated values in order to identify significant differences in gene expression while GeneSpring extracted and normalized the raw expression data using provided algorithms to allow for further statistical calculations using PRISM (Graphpad Software), which was also used to generate graphs and other figures from tables of raw data created in Excel. One value for ANPEP in the tumor group was excluded based upon the criterion of being more than 5 standard deviations from the mean. Since the number of samples in this specific data set differed between the tumor ( = 57) and the normal tissue ( = 49) groups, comparisons were made using an unpaired Student's -test with Welch's correction for heterogeneity of variance. Data is presented with and without Sidak's correction for multiple comparisons: = 0.05, = 1 − (1 − 0.05) (1/15) (15 genes were studied) to provide a relative estimate of significance ( Table 2)
