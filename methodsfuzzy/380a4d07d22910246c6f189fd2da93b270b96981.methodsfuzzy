For the prediction of redox-regulated conditionally disordered segments a slightly modified version of the IUPred2a method was used. The basic principle is the same as published [21] . We generate two prediction profiles with the default settings of the IUPred method, one for the native sequence corresponding to the state achieved through cysteine stabilization (redox-plus) and one calculated for a modified sequence with cysteines residues mutated to serine, corresponding to the state without cysteine stabilization (redox-minus). To initiate a redoxsensitive conditionally disordered region, the difference between the two profiles has to be larger than 0.3, while the minus profile is below 0.5 and the plus profile is above this threshold at a given position. This region is then extended until the difference between the two profiles becomes lower than 0.15, or the redox plus profile falls below 0.35. Two adjacent regions are combined if they are closer than 10 amino acids. Two minor modifications were introduced compared to the original web server implementation, aimed at decreasing potential overprediction of such regions. First, a predicted redox-sensitive conditionally disordered region must have at least 3 residues that meets the opening criterion. Second, the minimal length of the predicted region must be at least 15 residues. The current version of the program is available at: http://gerdos.web.elte.hu/data/iupred_redox_2.0.tar.gz For the analyses of PDB structures, a non-redundant dataset of protein structures was downloaded from the PISCES web server filtered at 40% sequence similarity, resolution of at least 2 Å and maximum R factor of 0.25 [23] . The dataset contained 1,4150 protein chains. 5 chains were omitted for technical reasons and for the remaining sequences the redox regions were predicted with the customized IUPred2A program. Disulfide bonds were identified from the structure using the distance criteria of 2.3 Å between the sulphur atoms of two cysteines. For the identification of cysteine clusters, all potential combinations of four non-disulfide bonded cysteine and histidine residues were considered within each structure. For the four selected residues, the approximate location of the metal center was calculated as the center of mass of the positions corresponding to the coordinates of SG atoms for cysteines and ND1 atom for histidines. A cysteine cluster was identified when the distance of each of the considered atoms from this center position was smaller than 4.2 Å. These criteria were selected to maximize the agreement with the provided PDB annotations. Full proteomes were downloaded from the 23/08/2018 version of UniProt reference proteomes [24] . The customized IUPred2A was run on all protein sequences from all proteins, using the redox-sensitive option. A protein was considered to contain a redox-sensitive conditionally disordered region if IUPred2A returned at least one region. The fredox value of a proteome was calculated as the number of proteins with predicted regions over the total number of regions in the proteome. In total, the analyzed data consisted of 192 viral, 436 archaeal, 608 bacterial, and 167 eukaryotic proteomes. The proteomes, together with the number of predicted redoxsensitive conditionally disordered proteins and fredox, are listed in the Supplementary material. The set of human proteins containing predicted redox-sensitive conditionally disordered protein regions (RSCDP) was determined as described for all proteomes. The list of 5,644 proteins together with the 10,109 identified regions is listed in the Supplementary material. Redox-sensitive conditionally disordered domains were identified by assessing overlapping regions predicted by IUPred2A, and domains predicted by Pfam [25] (release 31.0). A Pfam domain instance was considered to be redox-sensitive conditionally disordered if an IUPred2A region covers at least 5 of its residues and at least 20% of its total length. The number of thus identified redox-sensitive domains are listed in the Supplementary material for the S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and human proteomes, containing 6,049, 13,775, and 21,050 proteins, respectively. In each case the reference proteome downloaded from UniProt were used. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for human proteins were taken from the 24/05/2018 version of the EBI GOA database [26] . Only those biological process terms were considered that are attached to at least one protein with at least one predicted redox-sensitive structural switch. In order to enable the analysis of fairly generic and high level processes, only those terms were kept which are reachable from the root term (biological_process) with at most four steps following only 'is a' or 'part of' relations. These terms were further filtered for ancestry, and if two terms were in ancestor/child relationship, only the child term was kept. The resulting set of GO terms were manually split into four groups based on the level of biological process they describe. This yielded the GO molecular slim, containing 61 terms describing basic molecular processes; the GO network slim, containing 77 terms describing pathway/network level processes; GO cell slim, with 103 terms describing cellular processes; and GO organism slim, with 183 terms describing organism level biological processes. The enrichment of each term among redox-sensitive conditionally disordered proteins was assessed comparing the occurrence of the term in the RSCDP set and the human proteome. 1,000 sets of 5,488 proteins were taken from the human proteome randomly, and were evaluated for term occurrences, yielding an average and standard error for expected occurrence. The enrichment of each term in RSCDP is expressed as the difference between the observed and expected occurrences in standard error deviations. The supplementary material shows the enrichment values for all terms in all four slims. Missense variants annotated in human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries were downloaded from the Humsavar website (https://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar). Only those mutations were considered that contained 'Disease' annotation as type of the variant and involved a cysteine either in the original or in the mutated form. Mutations located within redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions were filtered out based on an overlap with predicted regions using the original sequence in cases when a cysteine residue was altered, or using the mutated sequence in case the mutation introduced a cysteine. The identified mutations are shown in the supplementary material. To concentrate on cases that are likely to be directly associated with alteration of a redox-regulated conditionally disordered region, proteins were sorted according to the ratio of mutations within predicted regions versus all mutations within the corresponding gene.
