are not supported by the presented data. QUALITATIVE Quality appraisal: Researchers are divided on the merits of critical appraisal and whether or not it should be a standard element in metaethnography [60] . Some researchers choose to follow pre-determined criteria based on critical appraisal [e.g., 62], whereas others do not critically appraise. 2) Refutational synthesis. Contradictions between key themes, metaphors, or concepts are examined and explained. 3) Lines of argument synthesis. Interpretation is created from comparison of findings across distinct studies. QUALITATIVE Quality appraisal: Rapid reviews typically do not include an assessment of the quality of the literature, nor do they always include the views of experts and/or reviews by peers [152] . •Searching electronic journals only; • Narrowing to specific geographic settings or contexts; • Restricting the timeframe during which articles are assessed; • Limiting contact with authors/industry or key stakeholders for clarification, follow-up, or input [152] [153] [154] . 3) References are retrieved, selected, summarized or synthesized, and a report is created. The public may be consulted about the results [152] . It is important that those conducting a rapid review describe the methodology in detail to promote transparency, support transferability, and avoid misrepresenting the veracity of the findings [152] .
