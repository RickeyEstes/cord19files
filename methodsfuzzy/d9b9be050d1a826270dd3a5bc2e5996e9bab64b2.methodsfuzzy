Vero E6 cells were cultured in our laboratory, College of Life Science and Bioengineering, Beijing University of Technology. BJ 9-2b SARS virus was provided by Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Vero E6 cells (1.2 × 10 4 cells per well) were inoculated in triplicate in 200 μl of Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 96 wells plate. After 2 days cultivation, the cells grew to a thin layer, then the cells were infected with 100 TCID50 SARS virus in 0.1 ml medium and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , humidified incubator for 2 hours. After a 2 h adsorption, the supernatant was discarded to remove the free virus. Chemicals in a series of 2 × dilation in 0.2 ml medium were added into the cell wells, the chemical control without virus and the viral control without chemical in 0.2 ml medium were also added into the cell wells, they were then cultivated in the same incubator for 3 days and the CPE of cells were recorded.
