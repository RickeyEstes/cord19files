This prospective and descriptive study was conducted at Cairo University Pediatric Hospital. 51 Children under 3 years of age from October 2013 to March 2014 were included in the study. Children enrolled had clinical picture of viral ALRTI diagnosed as bronchiolitis or pneumonia that developed few days before the admission to the hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were sent to Cairo University molecular laboratory. Data were coded and entered using the statistical package SPSS version 21. Data were summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for quantitative variables and frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Comparisons between quantitative variables were done using the nonparametrical Mann-Whitney test. For comparing categorical data, Chi square (v 2 ) test was performed. Fishers' test was used instead when the expected frequency is less than 5. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
