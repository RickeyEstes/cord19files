PONDR® VLXT (www.pondr.com) is the main tool used in our investigation. It is a neural network that reads inputs from the sequence of a protein and then predicts regions that are expected to be disordered as output [21, 23] . The PONDR® VLXT has been found to be the most accurate predictor in situations that involve protein-protein interactions, which are essential in viral shell proteins [56, 57] . This is likely the reason for it to be rather successful in the various studies of viral shell proteins as aforementioned. The sequences of the various NiV strains were selected and downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org). The programming language JAVA was then used to retrieve and record into MYSQL. This process was done through a JAVA-JDBC driver. The program also calculates the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of predicted disordered residues divided by the total number of residues in the protein. In order to obtain a clearer visualization, a search for Nipah nucleocapsid was made using NCBI-Protein Databank (NCBI-PDB, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Structure/index.shtml). The accession codes were recorded and the respective PDB and FASTA files were downloaded and placed into the MySQL database. The information stored in the database can later be retrieved using a JAVA program that would generate codes to be used in molecular viewing software, Jmol (www.jmol.org) [29] . Statistical analyses were done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) via R statistical package. The case-fatality ratios were calculated based on published data from the World Health Organization (WHO) (http:// www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/links/nipah_virus_ outbreaks_sear/en/). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) and the mentioned sequences of NiV N proteins from UniProt. The NiV strains and the respective calculated N PIDs (disorder levels) were carefully denoted on the tree.
