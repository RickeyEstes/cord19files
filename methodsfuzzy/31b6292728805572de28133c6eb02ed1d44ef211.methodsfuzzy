The EpiSearch method was successfully validated using six independent test cases where input peptide sequences from phage display experiments as well as the X-ray co-crystal structures of antigen-antibody were available. Table 1 gives an overview of the accuracy of EpiSearch method and shows that the method correctly predicted the location of conformational epitopes. Despite the low sequence similarity among the input peptide sequences, the residues in the highest scoring patch shared approximately 70% sequence identity with the residues in the input peptide sequences. In our analysis, we observed that, though all the residues in the input peptide sequences were not present in the epitope binding sites, a highest scoring patch correctly predicted the location of the conformational epitopes as found in the crystal structure. Except in case of mAb 17b peptides, the extent of coverage to locate the conformational epitope site in all the test cases was found to be more than 50% (Table 1 ). In case of mAb 17b the second high scoring patch performed better than the top scoring patch. The second high scoring patch partially overlapped with the top scoring patch and contained seven of the eleven residues present in the mAb 17b interface. In case of Trastuzumab, mAb 17b, mAb b12 and mAb 13b5 peptides, we also determined the influence of terminal cysteine (Cys) residues on the quality of the results. Experimentally, the terminal cysteine residues were introduced to constrain the peptides to a cyclic structure and might influence the selection process. We observed that in most of the cases the result was not sensitive to the presence of the Cys as terminal residues. However, in the case of mAb 17b bound gp120 the constrained loop peptides gave a better result than the analysis performed without the terminal Cys residues, which is evident from the presence of a Cys residue in the epitope binding site of gp120. 35, 36 The performance of the EpiSearch method was compared with the online version of the PepSurf method (http://pepitope.tau.ac.il/), 42 see Table 2 . We observed that PepSurf method groups the input peptide sequences based on their sequence identity and maps the high scoring group on to antigen surface. However in case of the EpiSearch method all input peptide sequences satisfying equation 2 were mapped on the antigen surface.
