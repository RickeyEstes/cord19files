Formalin-fixed samples were dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol to xylol and embedded in paraffin wax by routine techniques for light microscopy. Samples were sectioned (3 μm) and stained by different methods as haematoxylin-eosin and the Fraser Lendrum technique, or processed for their immunohistochemical study using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. The ABC method for immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on serial sections of formalin-fixed samples, which were dewaxed and rehydrated as previously described by Pedrera et al. [29, 38] . Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was exhausted by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were subjected to different methods for antigen retrieval (Table 1) . After pretreatment, the sections were rinsed three times in PBS (pH 7.2) for 10 min and then covered with 1% normal horse serum (Pierce-Endogen, Woburn, USA) in 0.05 M Tris buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.6) or 20% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, for primary monoclonal Ab(mAb) and polyclonal Ab(pAb), respectively. After this blocking stage, sections were incubated with primary Ab at 4°C overnight. After primary incubation, the slides were washed in PBS (three times for 5 min each) and then incubated with the secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab (Pierce-Endogen) diluted 1:200 in Tris buffer containing normal horse serum 1% was used for the primary mAb. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary Ab (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing normal goat serum 1.5% was used for the primary pAb. After three further 5 min washes in TBS, samples were incubated with the ABC complex (Vectastain W ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. All tissue sections were finally rinsed in PBS and incubated with chromogen solution (NovaRED W Substrate Kit, Vector Laboratories). Slides were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. Details of the primary mAb and pAb are summarized in Table 1 . Tissue samples from cattle, in which reactivity for primary Ab against cytokines and cellular markers used in this study had been demonstrated, were used as positive controls in IHC [29, 38] . Tissue sections for which the specific primary Ab were replaced by rabbit or mouse non-immune sera (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) were used as negative controls.
