The documents were stored at the medical history depository of IMCJ Hospital, at the medical records and hospitalization registries of Tokyo First Army Hospital (a predecessor of IMCJ Hospital), and at the Fifth Japanese Army Garrison Hospital, Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Medical records in which influenza was diagnosed between January 1918 and December 1920 were selected. Because the influenza virus had not yet been discovered at that time, no serologic or virologic diagnostic methods for influenza infection were available, and no examinations such as chest radiographs were performed. Thus, the diagnosis flu (kanbo in Japanese) was defined as clinical influenza. Three types of documents were investigated. The first type was the hospitalization registry of Tokyo First Army Hospital, in which records of 127 patients from January 1918 through November 1918 were included. Because these records were bound, it was assumed that no records were missing. The second type was the medical records of 132 patients at the Fifth Japanese Army Garrison Hospital in Russia from March 1919 through April 1920. These records were also bound, and it was again assumed that no records were missing. The third type was the medical records of 419 patients at Tokyo First Army Hospital from January 1918 through May 1920. These records were not associated with time and were partially discontinuous, which indicated that some records (dates) were missing. Information on the hospitals (e.g., numbers of beds and physicians) was unclear. This research was reviewed and approved by the research review boards at IMCJ
