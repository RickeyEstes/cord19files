Cloning, expression, and purification of M-nsp13 helicase. M-nsp13 is encoded by nucleotides 16208 to 18001 of the MERS-CoV genome (human betacoronavirus strain 2c EMC/2012; GenBank accession no. JX869059.2). The coding region of M-nsp13 was amplified by PCR using 5=-BamHI-nsp13-CGGGATCCTG CTGTAGGCTCTTGTGTTG-3= as the forward primer and 3=-EagI-nsp13-ATGCGGCCGCTATTGCAGCTTGTAG TTGGTAAAGCTC-3= as the reverse primer. The PCR amplicons were digested with BamHI and EagI, followed by ligation into expression vector pET52b (Novagen-EMD Millipore), which fused M-nsp13 with a Strep tag at the N terminus. After confirmation of the amplicon nucleotide sequences, the construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Protein expression and purification were performed as described previously (1, 31, 42) using Strep-Tactin beads (IBA). The protein was eluted with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM desthiobiotin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol (BME), and 5% glycerol. Using dialysis, the buffer was exchanged with (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM BME, and 5% glycerol). Fractions containing the desired protein were concentrated and stored at Ϫ80°C. The M-nsp13_K288A mutant was prepared using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) as described by the manufacturer and expressed and purified as described above for the wild-type enzyme. Expression and purification of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3Dpol. Expression and purification were as previously described (43) . Briefly, the pET-28a-FMDV 3Dpol plasmid was transformed into the Rosetta 2 expression strain (Novagen). Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown at 37°C, and protein expression was induced at an A 600 of 0.9 to 1.0 by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl ␤-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were allowed to grow for 3 more h after induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 ϫ g, 20 min) and stored at Ϫ20°C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol). The protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography with a gradient of 25 mM to 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing pure protein (95%) were pooled and dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 50% glycerol. Western blotting. Purified M-nsp13, M-nsp13K288A, and FMDV polymerase were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). M-nsp13 was detected with anti-M-nsp13 rabbit antiserum as the primary antibody, which was commercially developed upon request (Abcam). A horseradish peroxidaseconjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Dako) was used as the secondary antibody. Nucleic acid substrates. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Sequences of the RNA and DNA substrates are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using absorption at 260 nm and their extinction coefficients. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were annealed to corresponding 5=-Cy3-labeled 22-mers in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl at a ratio of 1 to 1.2 by heating them at 95°C for 5 min and cooling them slowly to room temperature. Unlabeled 22-mers were used as traps for the helicase assay. Characterization of helicase activity. Helicase activity was measured by incubating 20 nM M-nsp13 with a 5 nM concentration of an RNA substrate (Fig. S1 ) in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM ATP at 30°C for various times. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of loading buffer (0.2% SDS and 20% glycerol). Unless otherwise mentioned, reactant concentrations refer to the final concentration in the reaction mixture. The released single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) product and unwound double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were resolved by 8% nondenaturing PAGE using a running buffer containing 89 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.2, and run for 45 min at 4°C and 110 V. The controls for measuring maximum unwinding were dsRNAs denatured by heat for 5 min at 95°C and loaded immediately on the gel. In this and subsequent assays, the gels were scanned with a Bio-Rad multipurpose imager. When necessary, the band intensities representing ssRNA and dsRNA were quantitated using the Image Lab 5.1 software (Bio-Rad). The fraction of unwound RNA was plotted against time, and the kinetic parameters described in the mechanism were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc.). Analyses of RNA unwinding. To obtain the kinetic parameters associated with RNA unwinding by M-nsp13, the fraction of unwound RNA was plotted against time. By nonlinear regression, data were fit to the single-exponential equation in Results using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Inc.). To obtain the kinetic parameters associated with the K m and V max of M-nsp13 with regard to ATP hydrolysis, the fraction of unwound RNA was plotted against different ATP concentrations. Data fitting was carried out by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Inc.).
