An aliquot of 350 l from each respiratory sample was extracted and eluted into 110 l on the bioMérieux easyMAG (bioMérieux, Durham, NC). Reverse transcription was performed on 10 l of RNA using the Quanta cDNA kit with random primers (Quanta, Gaithersburg, MD). The viral protein 1 (VP1) gene sequence of HRV was initially targeted using PCR primers designed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Unpublished, kindly provided by Dr. Dean Erdman). If this assay failed to produce a band for sequencing, a further assay with primers targeting a different region of the VP1 gene was used [7] . If the VP1 gene assays failed, the VP4 gene sequence was amplified with primers described in Coiras et al. [8] . PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% TAE gel, and purified using Affimetrix ExoZapIt on samples displaying the appropriate size products (Affimetrix Santa Clara, CA). Sequencing was performed using the PCR primers from each of the assays. Sequences from either the VP1 or VP4 genes were first BLAST analyzed to determine the HRV type. Sequences obtained using the CDC unpublished VP1 assay were aligned to representative VP1 sequences from species A, B and C imported from GenBank using the Clustal W multiple alignment program in MEGA 6.0 [9] . The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 6.0 with the neighbor-joining method for HRV-A and -B, and HRV-C. Since the sequences obtained using the Nix et al. assay (VP1) [7] and Coiras et al. assay (VP4) [8] target different regions, they were not used in the phylogenetic analysis.
