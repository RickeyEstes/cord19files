Electronic searches of Science Direct, PubMed central and Google Scholar were undertaken with search terms "HIV", "medicinal plants", "Africa", "anti-viral" and "southern Africa". Initially publication titles were screened for suitability and plant species, active compounds and their mode of action were documented from primary literature sources. Ethnobotanical surveys in other African countries such as Ethiopia (Asres et al., 2001) , Uganda (Lamorde et al., 2010) , Cameroon (Mbaveng et al., 2011) , Zimbabwe (Viol et al., 2016) , Namibia (Chinsembu and Hedimbi, 2010) and Zambia (Chinsembu, 2016) also assisted in identifying plants traditionally used for management of HIV or HIV symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: (1) plants should have a record of traditional/popular use for infectious or viral diseases, HIV treatment or symptoms similar to HIV infection, (2) if not traditionally/popularly used, plants should be closely related to plants with popular use and HIV activity identified by means of in vitro assays, (3) plants should have been identified scientifically, (4) should be native to the southern African region and (5) anti-HIV activity should be within acceptable ranges. Clinical relevant concentrations have been defined as IC 50 of < 50 or < 100 µg/ml for extracts and at < 5 or < 25 µM for individual compounds and have been applied as a selection criterion in this study (Agarwal et al., 2014; Butterweck and Nahrstedt, 2012; Cos et al., 2006; Gertsch, 2009 ). Since traditional refers to plants with a long history of use, and HIV being a relatively new disease, the use of these plants are referred to as "popular" or "popularly used" against HIV. Many plants have been traditionally used to treat viral infections and other ailments. Investigation of these claims led to the discovery of numerous plant derived anti-HIV compounds which are widely distributed in nature (Singh et al., 2011) . Therefore, screening medicinal plants provides an opportunity for the discovery of HIV inhibitors with lower or no toxicity and/or side effects (Narayan et al., 2013) . Biologically active substances harvested from plants, can be found in any organ of the plant, although leaf material is most traditionally used (Narayan et al., 2013) . Various laboratory based investigations have been conducted using plant extracts and isolated compounds employing a variety of assays. Most of the tests are performed on the enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR), proteins involved in activation of viral genes or cells that are infected with viruses or pseudoviruses, and the activity determined by an indicator such as MTT or luciferase activity. The MTT assays are based on the reduction of the yellow coloured 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active cells. In metabolically active cells, blue formazan is produced which is measured spectrophotometrically to indicate cell viability in assays of cell proliferation and cytotoxicity (Cos et al., 2002; Shoemaker et al., 2004) . These targets aim to determine the inhibition or reduction of viral infection on various levels, and present various advantages and disadvantages to be considered in evaluating anti-viral activity (Table 1) . RT converts the viral RNA genome to viral DNA using its polymerase domain (RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity), while the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain degrades the RNA component from the intermediary RNA/DNA complex. The enzyme also has a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase function and most clinically available RT drugs, therefore target this enzyme. Numerous studies focused on the HIV-1 RT enzyme and various protocols have been employed measuring ethyl-3H thymidine triphosphate (3H TTP) by RT using polyadenylic acid-oligodeoxythymidilic acid (polyA-oligodT) as template primer in the presence and absence of a test substance such as isolated compounds or plant extracts (Ali et al., 2002; Bessong et al., 2005) . Various kits are used for determining the inhibition of enzymes and viral components such as the Capture ELISA kit (GenxBio Health Science, India) (Chinnaiyan et al., 2013) and HIV-RT colourimetric enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) kit obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany (Chukwujekwu et al., 2014; Eldeen et al., 2011; Kapewangolo et al., 2013; Klos et al., 2009; Tshikalange et al., 2008a; Wang et al., 2014) or a purified recombinant HIV-1 RT enzyme (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (Kapewangolo et al., 2013) . Several interactions and measures have been identified to optimise the assay conditions. It has been found that HIV-1 RT uses magnesium or manganese divalent ions as a co-factor (Bolton et al., 2002) and that palladium and iron might also affect the assay as they are responsible for irreversible inhibition of RT and subsequent reduction in virus proliferation (Filler and Lever, 1997) . Since ions of various metals are accumulated by plants and therefore present in plant extracts, these ions may be present in and might affect the outcomes. Most methodologies describing the inhibition of HIV-1 RT by crude plant extracts do not take into consideration the effect of metal ions in regulating the activity of HIV-1 RT (Bessong and Obi, 2006) . Consequently, it would be important to determine metal ions in plant extracts prior to screening in order to avoid false inhibitory observations at the screening stage. IN, in conjunction with accessory viral proteins, is required for the integration of the synthesized viral double stranded DNA into the chromosome in the nucleus of the host cell. The HIV-1 integrase (HIV-1 IN) enzyme has also been employed on extracts and compounds such as catechins in various studies using the Xpress HIV-1 IN Assay Kit (Express Biotech International, USA) or in an in vitro model (Jiang et al., 2010) . A recombinant HIV-1 IN of E. coli origin (Wang et al., 2014) and the evaluation against the 3' processing activity of HIV-1 IN have been performed on extracts and compounds (Bessong et al., 2005) . The unspecific binding of plant compounds to proteins is, however, mostly not considered. PR cleaves viral polyproteins into structural and functional components which are assembled to form progeny virions (Bessong and Obi, 2006) . The protease enzyme has also been investigated in various assays such as the fluorometric detection of HIV-PR activity using HIV-II PR HIV-FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) (AnaSpec Inc., USA) and a recombinant HIV-1 protease solution (Bachem ,  Table 1 A summary of the most popular anti-HIV assays presenting the advantages and disadvantages of each assay.
