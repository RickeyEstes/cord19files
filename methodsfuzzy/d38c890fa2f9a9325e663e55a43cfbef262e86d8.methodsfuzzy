We thus designed a panel of 172 pairs of multiplex PCR primers for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1B) . The average amplicon length is 99bp. The amplicons run across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome with a 76bp gap (76Â±10bp) between each amplicon. Since the observed efficiency of multiplex PCR is about 26% in amplifying the four DNA strands of a pair of human chromosomes, we assumed an efficiency of 6% in amplifying a single-strand of cDNA. In addition, it has already been reported that 79% of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using our technology 44 . Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully. Using the same mathematical model described above, we estimated that our specific SARS-CoV-2-designed panel can detect 1.15 copies of the virus at 95% probability (Fig. 1C) . Again, the LOD is independent of virus genome size. We also designed a second pool of 171 multiplex PCR primers. These primers overlap with those in the previous 172-primer pool. Together, these two overlapping pools of primers deliver full coverage of the entire virus genome. If using both pools in detection, the calculated detection limit is 0.29 copies at 95% probability.  In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed a userfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters were used to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specific amplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics' proprietary background removing reagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcription reagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount of human ribosomal RNA species. We sequenced a library made with 4,500 copies of N and S gene-containing plasmids spiked into 10 ng of human gDNA, which roughly represents 3,300 haploid genomes. Even though the molar ratios of viral targets and human haploid genomes were comparable, N and S genes which encompass about 4kb of targets, were a negligible fraction of the 3 billion base pairs of a human genome. If every region of the human genome were amplified and sequenced at 0.6 million reads per sample, only one read of viral target would be recovered. In fact, our results showed that 16% of the recovered bases, or 13% of the recovered reads, were within the viral N and S genes ( Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table 2 ). 80% and 78% of SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial targets were covered, respectively (Fig. 3B) , and the base coverage was significantly higher than human targets (Fig. 3C) . In contrast, only 0.08% of regions in human chromosomes were amplified. Furthermore, the human exonic regions were preferentially amplified (Fig.  3D) . This suggested that the random hexamers deselected a large portion of the human genome, while favorably amplifying regions that were more "random" in base composition. Indeed, long gaps and absence of coverage in very large repetitive regions were observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E) . On the contrary, the gaps in SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial regions were significantly shorter (Fig. 3F) , whereas the amplified targets overlapped and were longer than human targets (Fig. 3G) . The coverage was from 1000-to 10,000-fold for S and N genes, and 30-to 500-fold for the mitochondrial chromosome (Fig. 3F) . The coverage is roughly within a 10-fold range, as is observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E) . Therefore, increasing sequencing depth might not significantly improve the coverage. This 10-fold difference in coverage has been routinely observed with our multiplex PCR technology (Supplemental Table 3 and Supplemental Fig. 4) . We were able to detect 80% of the regions in S and N genes in libraries generated using 4,500 copies of plasmids, with an average base coverage of 5,000 for a total sequencing depth of 0.6 million reads. A few targets of 150 to 200 bp in length in S and N genes were preferentially amplified. Even when copy number went down to a few copies (3-14), these targets were still detected (Fig.4) . They represented 14% and 11% of the target regions when 14 and 2.8 copies of plasmids were amplified, respectively. (A) Random hexamer-adapters were used in multiplex PCR to amplify 4,500 copies of plasmids in the background of 3,300 haploid human gDNA molecules. The resulting libraries were sequenced at an average of 0.6 million total reads. Of the total bases recovered, 16% were on SARS-CoV-2 S and N genes. (B) 80% of S and N genes, and 78% of the human mitochondrial chromosome were amplified with >= 1X coverage, while only 0.08% of the human chromosomes were. (C) On average, S and N genes were covered at 2,346X, mitochondria at 77X, and human chromosomes at 20X. (D) Human exons were relatively overamplified about 4-fold higher compared to their actual ratio within the genome. (E) Gaps and long regions of absence of amplification were observed for human chromosomes. An example shown here is chromosome Y. Small gaps were additionally found in the enlarged cluster of amplification. The long absent region (red double arrow) overlapped with the repetitive regions on Y chromosome. (F) Representation of the recovered regions in S and N genes and the human mitochondrial chromosome. The coverage was from 1,000-to 10,000-fold for S and N genes, and 30-to 500-fold for the mitochondrial chromosome. (G) The length of the majority of chromosomal amplification products are clustered around 100bp, while the amplified regions for the S and N genes, as well as the mitochondrial chromosome, were significantly longer. .
