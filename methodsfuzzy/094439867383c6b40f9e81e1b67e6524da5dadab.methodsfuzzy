The increase in support for our phylogeny when morphological characters were added to the analysis was not due solely to changing from using bootstrap support of a MP analysis to using the posterior probabilities under a Bayesian approach. The Bayesian phylogeny estimated from the genetic data alone had lower levels of support than the Bayesian tree estimated from both genetic and morphological characters. It has been suggested that Bayesian posterior probabilities tend to be higher than MP bootstrap proportions for the same groups (Erixon et al., 2003) . However, it has also been suggested that bootstrap values may be a conservative estimate of support for clades when support for clades is strong (Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 2004; Rannala and Yang, 1996) and it is likely that posterior probabilities give a better estimate of support than bootstrap proportions, especially when the most complex Bayesian models are used (Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 2004) . We would have liked to compare bootstrap values of phylogenies generated by ML, rather than MP, to the posterior probabilities of the Bayesian trees but this was impractical due to computational constraints.
