MDCK (Madin -Darby canine kidney) cells were maintained in the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). MH-S (murine alveolar macrophages [AMs]) cells were maintained in ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 0.05 mM, FBS to a final concentration of 10%, and 1% PSA. For influenza virus infection in MDCK and MH-S cells, infection medium (RPMI containing 0.75% BSA, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% PSA, and 2 µg/mL L-1-p-Tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin) was used. ARPE-19 cells were maintained in the DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSA. All the cells were purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC) (Hsinchu, Taiwan) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . All the reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) was kindly provided by Professor Shin-Ru Shih in Chang Gung University. A/HKx31(H3N2) was kindly provided by Professor Hung-Chih Yang in National Taiwan University. Viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-dayold embryonated chicken eggs. The viral titer was determined as below.
