Strains used and DNA preparation. Bacterial strains used in this study included wildtype and ciprofloxacin resistant Bacillus anthracis Δ ANR, Yersinia pestis KIM5, and Francisella tularensis Schu4. B. anthracis wildtype and ciprofloxacin resistant mutant S3-8 clones were originally obtained from Dr. Lance B. Price 6 , Y. pestis wildtype and ciprofloxacin resistant mutant M1 clones were originally obtained from Dr. Luther Lindler 8 , and F. tularensis wildtype and ciprofloxacin resistance mutants were obtained from Dr. David Kulesh 4 . DNAs were extracted and purified using the Qiagen EZ1 kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Ca) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Figs 3 and 6,WGA DNA was used and WGA was performed utilizing Qiagen's REPLI-g-Midi Kit according to manufacturer's protocol. For Fig. 6 , 1 μ g of WGA DNA was spiked into 1 ml of whole blood (BioreclamationIVT, Baltimore, MD) and 10 fold serially diluted. 100 μ l of each dilution was extracted using TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the EZ1 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions For non-template controls water or, in Fig. 6 , non-spiked extracted whole blood was used in lieu of bacterial DNA. DNA concentration was quantified utilizing Qubit dsDNA BR and HS assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacterial MIP probe analysis. Probes were re-suspended in buffer TE and pooled to a final per probe concentration of 3 nM. A total of 44 probes were combined and used as a master probe mix. Probe capture protocol was performed as previously described with slight modifications 20 . The modified protocol is as follows: Total probe mix was hybridized to 10-fold serial dilutions of WGA or non-amplified extracted DNA samples (see above) of B. anthracis, Y. pestis, and F. tularensis by adding 3 nM probe to 1.5× ampligase buffer (Epicentre, Madison, WI), heat to 94 °C for 2 minutes, and then ramped to 60 °C (0.1 °C/sec temperature decrease) with a 60 min hold at 60 °C. Gap filling and ligation were performed by the addition of Phusion high-fidelity PCR master mix with HF buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 4 units Ampligase (Epicentre), ampligase buffer, and 0.4 μ M dNTPs (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT). The reaction was then incubated at 60 °C for 60 min and held at 15 °C.
