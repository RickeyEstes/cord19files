A panel of 829 samples was employed, including 415 negative sera and 414 PEDV-positive sera. They were divided into the following detailed categories: 359 field samples without PEDV exposure. Collection of serum samples was performed in 12 selected Italian farms during 2015. Farms were classified as non-exposed to PEDV based on historical data and lack of enteric signs compatible with viral diarrhoea. The observation period in each farm lasted at least four months, during which multiple faecal samples were taken and tested negative for PEDV RNA based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) described by Bertasio et al., 2016 . Sera were taken from nursery and grow-finishing pigs; 30 negative sera originating from SPF pigs; 373 field samples with PEDV exposure. Collection of serum samples was performed in 17 Italian commercial pig farms between 2014 and 2015 after the PEDV outbreaks. The PEDV infection status was first determined by the presence of enteric signs and then confirmed based on identification of both PEDV RNA by qPCR in faecal samples and PEDV antigen by a double antibody sandwich ELISA (Sozzi et al., 2010) . PEDV qRT-PCR assay were performed using primers and probes targeting the S1 gene of PEDV as previously described (Bertasio et al., 2016) . Positive samples were collected during a period from 2 to 3 weeks to 3 to 4 months after PCR positivity. In these outbreaks G1b PEDV strains with high similarity to the US OH851 "mild INDEL strains" were identified by sequencing analysis of the S1 gene from positive faecal samples . 67 collection sera from eight three-weeks old piglets obtained during two previous experimental infections. Five piglets have orally been infected with an US PEDV INDEL strain and sera sampled at 0-7-14-21 and 28 days post infection (dpi). The remaining three piglets have been infected with an Italian PEDV S-INDEL strain identified on January 2015 and sera collected at 0-1-2-4-5-6-7-8-15-18-24-31-41 and 52 dpi. According to the results obtained by using the cELISA test, i.e. positivity was detected starting from 5 to 7 dpi (Supplemental file n.2), 26 sera were considered negative and 41 positive. To evaluate the Sp of the method, known positive sera for other porcine coronaviruses were tested: 24 experimental samples with known TGEV exposure, obtained from three 5-week-old pigs orally inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue, from which sera were collected at 0, 7, 10, 17, 24, 31, 40 and 60 dpi. 11 experimental samples with known HEV exposure, obtained from hyperimmunised animals: six rabbits, one guinea pig and four pigs inoculated with HEV 741 VR ATCC, strain 67 N (Mengeling et al., 1972) .
