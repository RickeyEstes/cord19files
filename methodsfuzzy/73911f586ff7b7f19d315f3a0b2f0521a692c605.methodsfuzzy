Eight healthcare providers (six registered nurses and two physicians) volunteered for this preliminary study. All participants were given information about the purpose and intent of the study. The study protocol was approved by the Texas Tech University Health Science Center Institutional Review Board. Given the small number of participants, statistical analysis was not performed. The participants were randomized to one of two PPE ensembles that meet current (as of 10/20/14) CDC recommendations for PPE. One PPE ensemble (standard) utilized commercial components that meet current CDC recommendations. The other PPE ensemble (alternate) was composed of components already available at local hospitals or retail stores. The commercial PPE ensemble (Fig. 1) included a neck-to-ankle coverall with overlying water impermeable surgical gown, knee-length impermeable leggings, and Stryker 1 hood (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). The alternate PPE (Fig. 2 ) ensemble included two plastic gowns (worn over the front and back of the torso), rain-suit pants, a rain-suit hood cut from a rain jacket, ankle length shoe covers, and a plastic ''spark-shield'' commonly used for metal working to cover the face. Both PPE ensembles utilized double gloving, with the outermost glove a forearm length surgical glove and N-95 masks. When complete, both PPE ensembles met the CDC recommendations for PPE and no skin was exposed in either group. Subjects were then randomized to standard or high volume exposures (HVE) to simulate fluid splash. Subjects randomized to standard exposure came into contact with a training mannequin contaminated with fluorescent agents to simulate bodily fluids. Subjects randomized to HVE had standard exposure, but then also had an additional 100 ml of fluorescent agent splashed onto the front torso of their garment. The fluorescent agents used included fluorescent powder (GloGerm 1 GloGerm Co, Moab, UT, USA), liquid clothes detergent with bleach alternative (Tide 1 Proctor & Gamble Inc., Providence, RI, USA), and dissolvable fluorescent tablets (Bright Dyes Orange Dye 1 Kingscote Chemicals, Miamisburg, OH, USA). A base mixture of 500 ml of liquid detergent, 500 ml of water and three fluorescent tablets was used to create body fluids. The base mixture was combined with oatmeal, chocolate powder and crushed cereal to simulate different bodily fluids. The testing area was divided into four areas, a PPE donning area (staging area), patient encounter room, PPE doffing area, and a separate dark room for black light photography. Each participant was assisted in PPE donning by an experienced trainer. After donning PPE, participants worked in pairs to perform a series of clinical tasks to care for the EVD ''patient.'' Participants were asked to clean the contaminated mannequin, change the mannequin gown, place an automated BP cuff, and check and record the temperature. After completing the tasks, participants were assisted by the trainers in PPE removal. Finally, the de-gowned participants were examined under ''black light'' for fluorescence indicative of possible contamination. An LED black light panel, (Chauvet LED Shadow, model DMX-512 Led UV, Chauvet 1 Lighting, Sunrise, Florida) was used to illuminate. Photographs were taken with a Nikon 1 D90 Camera (Nikon Inc., Melville, New York).
