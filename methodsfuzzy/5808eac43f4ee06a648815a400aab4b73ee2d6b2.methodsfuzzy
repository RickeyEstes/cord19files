Vaccine strains. H120 Virus isolation. The study was conducted in southern China during the period from 2013-2015. Samples were obtained from the kidney, trachea, and lung of broiler chickens and broiler breeder flocks suspected of being IBV infected. Typical clinical signs of diseased birds included respiratory symptoms, nephritis, and decreased egg production. The samples were frozen and thawed three times, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 µg/mL streptomycin, and then centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min. After storage at 4 °C for 12 h, the supernatant was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos. One to five blind passages were performed until characteristic embryo changes, such as dwarfing, stunting, or curling of the embryos were observed 46 RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene. A pair of S1 specific primers (S1-F: 5′-AAGACTGAACAAA AGACCGACT-3′, S1-R: 5′-CAAAACCTGCCATAACTAACAT A-3′) was designed using the Primer Premier 5.0 software. RT-PCR was preformed using the PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit Ver. 2 (Takara, Dalian, China). The RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel and then observed using an ultraviolet transilluminator. Each RT-PCR product was ligated into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa) and transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli competent cells. Positive clones were sequenced by Shanghai Sang-gong Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 genes from all the IBV isolates were aligned using the Editseq program and analyzed for homology with 43 reference IBV strains published in GenBank using the MegAlign program. Both programs are available in the Lasergene package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The backgrounds and accession numbers of the reference strains are listed in supplemental data. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 gene was performed with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA version 7.0. The bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data. Recombination analysis of the S1 gene of variant IBV strains. The S1 gene of variant IBV strains and their parental strains were identified with RDP version 4.7 and Simplot version 3.5.1. Reference strains were used as hypothetical parental strains. Methods of detecting recombination included: RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, Maxchi, Chimaera, sisscan, phylpro, LARD, and 3Seq. The default parameters were used for each of the analyses. Cross-neutralization assays. Immune sera were produced against the vaccine strains H120, Ma5, 4/91, and LDT3-A, the attenuated strain YX10-D90, and 14 of the field isolated strains. The immune sera were prepared as described by Gao et al. 9 . To determine the titer of neutralizing antibody in the immune sera, each serum sample was serially diluted two-fold with sterile PBS and mixed with 200 EID50 of each IBV strain. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the virus-serum mixtures were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of SPF chicken embryos and incubated for 7 days. The end-point titer in each serum sample was calculated using the Reed and Muench method 42 . ARVs were calculated using the formula published by Archetti and Horsfall 43 . ARV lower than 25% were considered independent serotypes 24, 26 . The 3D antigenic cartography was constructed using an online antigenic cartography resource AntigenMap 3D (http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/software/AntigenMap/) 27 .
