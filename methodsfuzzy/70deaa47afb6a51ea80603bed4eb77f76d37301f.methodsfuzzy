A Bayesian approach was used to provide an estimation of the sensitivity (se) and specificity (sp) for three serological tests under consideration at one time. The method, described by Branscum et al. (2005) , was applied to estimate the characteristics of three conditionally dependent tests in a single population and without a gold standard. The model parameters were therefore the three sensitivities, three specificities, covariances between test results in seropositive and seronegative sera and one true prevalence. So our data y ¼ y 111 ; y 112 ; y 211 ; y 212 ; y 121 ; y 122 ; y 221 ; y 222 ð Þ consisted of the cross-classified test results for the n tested sera from the population: e.g. y 111 being the number of sera that were found positive with the three tests, y 112 the number of sera that were found positive with test 1 and 2 and negative with test 3. The 8 combinations of the cross-classified results between the three tests were defined as such. Beta distributions Be(a,b) were used as priors for the parameters of interest (sensitivities, specificities, proportion of seropositive sera). We used non informative priors for sensitivity (uniform distributions) and mildly informative priors for specificities, considering that the expected specificities of the serological test would be >0.4 with 95% certainty and with a mode equal to 0.9 according to relative specificities that we estimated between the different tests. For true prevalence, we estimated that the prior distribution should represent a prevalence >0.4 with 95% certainty and mode equal to 0.6 according to the previous information we had on sera (experimental or field sera from a farm without any report of clinical disease). The same methodology, as described by Branscum et al. (2005) , was used to define priors for the covariances (uniform prior distribution over the ranges of covariances). The models were run using the WinBUGS freeware program (Spiegelhalter et al., 1996) commanded by the R package R2Winbugs. Parameter estimates were based on analytical summaries of 10,000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler with a burn-in phase of 1000 iterations. Three parallel chains were run with different starting values randomly chosen from uniform distributions (0,1). Confirmation of the lack of convergence was required before the posterior distributions produced by the Gibbs sampler could be used. The R-CODA package (Best et al., 1995) by R software (R Development Core Team, 2008) was used to assess convergence of (Heidelberger and Welch, 1983 ) and the Raftery and Lewis tests (Raftery and Lewis, 1992) for the convergence of single chains were applied. The Gelman-Rubin (Brooks and Gelman, 1998) diagnosis was carried out to assess convergence of the 3 parallel chains and autocorrelations were also checked. All the results obtained, for the serological assays being compared, except for those using pre-diluted sera (in Table 1A and 1B) were included in these analyses.
