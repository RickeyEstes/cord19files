The mission of pharmacy profession and the role of pharmacists in healthcare have evolved toward patient-centered care in the last few decades. Pharmacists with their expertise in drug therapy and accessibility to the public have unprecedented opportunities to assume increasing responsibility for direct patient care (Bond, 2006) . New cognitive pharmaceutical services and new roles for pharmacists continue to emerge. In the era of evidence-based practice and health services, it is not just adequate to propose those new pharmacy services or new roles without evidence of their benefit (Awaisu and Alsalimy, 2015; Bond, 2006) . New pharmacy services and new roles must be proven to be feasible, acceptable, cost-effective, and increase health outcomes. Pharmacy practice research provides such evidence and can confirm the value of a new service, inform policy, and result in practice changes (Bond, 2006; Chen and Hughes, 2016) . Research evidence should be used to identify new areas for improved health service delivery and rigorously evaluate new services. The research used to generate such evidence should be grounded in robust and rigorous methodologies (Chen and Hughes, 2016) . Traditionally, common quantitative and qualitative methods such as randomized controlled trials, cohort study, case control study, questionnaire-based surveys, and phenomenology using qualitative interviews have been used in pharmacy. However, in recent years, novel and more complex methods are being developed and utilized. Pharmacy practice researchers need to know how these old and new methodological approaches should be selected, applied, and interpreted in addressing research problems. Various study designs, including, but not limited to experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, qualitative, and mixed method designs, have been used in pharmacy practice research. Furthermore, different classification systems (e.g., quantitative vs. qualitative, experimental vs. observational, descriptive vs. analytical study designs) have been used in the literature. The choice of a study design to answer a research question in pharmacy practice research is driven by several factors, including the type of the research question or the research hypothesis, expertise of the investigator, availability of data, and funding opportunities. Pharmacy practice researchers need to be competent in the selection, design, application, and interpretation of these methodological and analytical approaches. Today, many of the research methods used in pharmacy practice research have been adapted from fields such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, and other disciplines. This paradigm shift has led to a greater emphasis on the appropriate choice of a specific research design or method to answer a specific research question (Chen and Hughes, 2016) . Consequently, pharmacy practice researchers should place an emphasis on the reliability of the methods selected, the correct interpretation of their findings, the testing of a specific hypothesis, and the internal validity of their data, among other considerations. Novice and early career researchers should be familiar and have sound foundation in a variety of methods applied in pharmacy practice research, which will be covered in this chapter and other chapters in this Encyclopedia. We do believe that more experienced researchers should focus on certain methods in order to advance research in our discipline. Various classifications for research designs and methods used in pharmacy practice have been used in the literature. The following are some of the approaches for the classification of research designs: 1. Classification based on time orientation: Retrospective vs. prospective designs a. Retrospective design-A retrospective study design observes what has happened in the past. It begins and ends in the present. This design involves a major limitation as it looks to collect information about events that occurred in the past. An example of this design is retrospective case-control study. Case example: Investigators were looking for the association between acute myocardial infarction and smoking status, type of tobacco, amount of smoke, etc. (Teo et al., 2006) . Another example of a case-control study from published literature is the study investigating the association between the use of phenylpropanolamine and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (Kernan et al., 2000) . b. Prospective design-A prospective study design begins in the present and progresses forward, collecting data from subjects whose outcomes lie in the future. An example of this design is prospective cohort study. Case example: Investigators were interested to determine the long-term effectiveness of influenza vaccines in elderly people; they recruited cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated community-dwelling elderly (Nichol et al., 2007) . 2. Classification based on study purpose: Descriptive vs. analytical designs a. Descriptive design-A descriptive study describes a population/sample in terms of distribution of the variables, and frequency of outcomes of interest. Unlike analytical studies that include control (comparison) group, descriptive studies do not include a comparison group. Descriptive studies include case reports, case series reports, cross-sectional studies, surveillance studies, and ecological studies. Case example: A case report was written by a physician who contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during an outbreak in Hong Kong (Wu and Sung, 2003) . Another example is an ecological study examining diet and sunlight as risks for prostate cancer mortality (Colli and Colli, 2006 Case example: A group of investigators carried out a study to establish an association between the use of traditional eye medicines (TEM) and corneal ulcers. In this case, both case-control and cohort study designs are applicable. In an example of a case control study, Archibugi et al. aimed to investigate the association between aspirin and statin exclusive and combined and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma occurrence (Archibugi et al., 2017) . Another example of a cohort study is a study carried out by Wei et al. in which they investigated whether or not acid-suppression medicines increased the risk of bacterial gastroenteritis (Wei et al., 2017) . 3. Classification based on investigator orientation: Experimental vs. quasi-experimental vs. observational designs a. Experimental design-In experimental design (also known as interventional design), the investigator performs an intervention and evaluates cause and effect relationships. Case examples: Investigators conducted a study about the newer versus older antihypertensive agents in African hypertensive patients (NOAAH) trial (nct01030458) to compare the efficacy of single-pill combinations of newer versus older antihypertensive agents (i.e., a single-pill combination of newer drugs, not involving a diuretic, with a combination of older drugs including a diuretic) (Odili et al., 2012) . In a crossover design, a group of investigators evaluated the effect of spironolactone on nonresolving central serous chorioretinopathy (Bousquet et al., 2015) . b. Quasi-experimental design-The quasi-experimental design is very similar to the true experimental design described above and it involves an intervention. The design has been employed when randomization is inappropriate or impossible, especially when implementing complex interventions. Case examples: Prashanth et al. aimed to understand if (and how) a package of interventions targeting primary health centers and community participation platforms affect utilization and access to generic medicines for people with noncommunicable diseases using quasi-experimental design approach (Prashanth et al., 2016 (Murphy et al., 2015) . c. Mixed method designs-Mixed method design brings together qualitative and quantitative methodologies within a single study to answer or understand a research problem (Hadi et al., 2013) . Case examples: Shiyanbola et al. combined focus group discussion with a survey tool to investigate patients' perceived value and use of quality measures in evaluating and choosing community pharmacies (Shiyanbola and Mort, 2015) . The use of simulated client or simulated patient (mystery shopper) method to assess practices or behaviors in pharmacy practice has received much attention in recent times (Watson et al., 2004 (Watson et al., , 2006 . "A simulated patient is an individual who is trained to visit a pharmacy (or drug store) to enact a scenario that tests a specific behavior of the pharmacist or pharmacy staff" (Watson et al., 2006) . A review by Watson et al. demonstrated the versatility and applicability of this method to pharmacy practice research in both developing and developed countries (Watson et al., 2006) . The investigators also identified some important characteristics that should be taken into consideration in designing studies that use this technique. This method can be used to assess wide range of cognitive pharmacy services including counseling and advice provision, treatment of minor ailments, provision of nonprescription medicines, and public health pharmacy, among other things. This method can be a robust and rigorous method of assessing pharmacy practice if used appropriately (Watson et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2012) . More recent developments have documented that the simulated patient methods have been used to provide formative feedback in addition to assessing practice behavior of pharmacists and their staff (Xu et al., 2012) . In a case example, a group of investigators evaluated Qatari pharmacists' prescribing, labeling, dispensing, and counseling practices in response to acute community-acquired gastroenteritis (Ibrahim et al., 2016) . In another example, the investigators documented the state of insomnia management at community pharmacies in Pakistan (Hussain et al., 2013) .

It is important that qualitative researchers understand the differences between the characteristics of the five qualitative approaches to inquiry, in order to select an approach to inquiry and attain methodological congruence (Creswell, 2013) . The five approaches to qualitative research inquiry are: a. Narrative research: Describes participants' written and spoken stories about their experiences with a phenomenon being investigated, while considering the chronological connection of the phenomenon's series of events (Anderson and Kirkpatrick, 2016; Creswell, 2013; Czarniawska, 2004) . b. Phenomenological research: Describes the essence of participants' common experiences of a phenomenon, so that the description is a general essence rather than an individual experience (Creswell, 2013; Giorgi, 1997; Moustakas, 1994) . c. Grounded theory research: Aims to generate a theory grounded in participants' data that conceptually explain a social phenomenon, which could involve social processes, or actions or interactions (Creswell, 2013; Strauss and Corbin, 1990; Woods et al., 2016) . d. Ethnographic research: Involves describing the shared patterns of values, behaviors, and beliefs of culture-sharing participants (Creswell, 2013; Harris, 1968; Rosenfeld et al., 2017 ). e. Case study research: Provides an in-depth examination of a real-life contemporary phenomenon that researchers cannot change over time, to illustrate the significance of another general topic (Baker, 2011; Creswell, 2013; de Leó n-Castañ eda et al., 2018; Mukhalalati, 2016; Yin, 2014) . 1. Data collection methods Data collection tools in qualitative research can be categorized into the following fundamental categories (Creswell, 2013 ): a. Observation b. Documents c. Individual semi-structured interviews d. Focus groups (FGs) e. Audio-visual materials f. Emails chat rooms, weblogs, social media, and instant messaging. Research studies in pharmacy practice usually utilize single-method research designs. However, often these report numerous limitations and may not adequately answer the research question. Therefore, the combination of more than one research method to answer certain research questions has become increasingly common in pharmacy practice research (Ryan et al., 2015) . Mixed methods research design is now a popular and widely used research paradigm in pharmacy practice research fields (Hadi et al., 2013 (Hadi et al., , 2014 Closs, 2016a, 2016b; Ryan et al., 2015) . Mixed methods research allows the expansion of the scope of research to offset the weaknesses of using either quantitative or qualitative approach alone (Creswell et al., 2004; Hadi et al., 2013; Closs, 2016a, 2016b; Pluye and Hong, 2014) . Typically, qualitative and quantitative data are collected concurrently or sequentially in order to increase the validity and the comprehensiveness of the study findings (Creswell et al., 2004; Hadi et al., 2013; Closs, 2016a, 2016b; Pluye and Hong, 2014; Ryan et al., 2015) . The mixed method approach provides an expanded understanding of phenomenon under investigation through the comparison between qualitative and quantitative data (Hadi et al., 2013; Closs, 2016a, 2016b; Pluye and Hong, 2014) . This section provides an overview and application of mixed method research in pharmacy practice. However, considerations in selecting, designing, and analyzing mixed methods research studies as well as the various typologies of mixed methods research are discussed elsewhere. Johnson et al. (2007) proposed the following definition for mixed methods research: "The type of research in which a researcher or team of researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference techniques) for the broad purpose of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration." Mixed methods design allows the viewpoints of participants to be reflected, enables methodological flexibility, and promotes multidisciplinary teamwork (Ryan et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the approach allows a more holistic understanding of the research question. However, its major limitations include: need for wide range of research expertise across the research team members, highly labor-intensive, and the complexity of data integration. Scholars believe that it is challenging to provide researchers with a step-by-step guide on how to undertake a mixed methods study and that this is driven by the specific research question (Ryan et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, the investigator should precisely determine the type of qualitative and quantitative methods to be employed, the order of data collection to be undertaken, the data collection instruments to be used, and the method of data analysis (Ryan et al., 2015) . This approach encompasses a synthesis of findings from both quantitative and qualitative components, which is achieved through integration of the findings from each approach (Hadi et al., 2013; Closs, 2016a, 2016b; Pluye and Hong, 2014) . Different models or typologies for mixed methods research have been described in the literature. The most common typologies used in pharmacy practice and health services research include: concurrent or convergent parallel design, exploratory sequential design, explanatory sequential design, and the embedded design (Hadi et al., 2013; Pluye and Hong, 2014) . Scholars believe that there are several factors to consider when selecting the typology or model of mixed methods research to use. These factors include: the order of qualitative and quantitative data collection (concurrent vs. sequential); priority of data (i.e., which type of data has priority between quantitative and qualitative data); purpose of integration of the data (e.g., triangulation); and number of data strands (Hadi et al., 2013; Pluye and Hong, 2014) . In mixed methods research, integration of qualitative and quantitative findings is critical, and this research approach does not simply involve the collection of these data (Ryan et al., 2015) .
