2.1. Selection criteria for homologous overlapping genes I first extracted from the dataset of 80 overlapping genes experimentally proven (S1 Dataset from Pavesi et al., 2018) the amino acid sequence of the two proteins encoded by each overlap. For each protein, I searched for homologs against the non-redundant protein sequences NCBI database using BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1997) . When BLASTP did not detect any homolog I used TBLASTN, which compared the protein query sequence against the nucleotide collection NCBI database translated in all reading frames. I used TBLASTN because the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by one of the two overlapping frames (usually that discovered more recently) may not be reported in many viral genomes present in the NCBI database (Pavesi et al., 2018) . The selection of homologous overlapping genes was based on three criteria. The first was an equal length of the homolog. It was met in the great majority of cases (72 out of 80). In the remaining cases, the homolog was only slightly shorter than the query sequence. The exception was the overlap capsid protein/Assembly Activating Protein (AAP) of adeno-associated virus-2, whose homolog encodes an AAP 9 amino acids shorter in the amino-terminal region and 26 amino acids shorter in the carboxy-terminal region. The second criterion was a homolog yielding, for both the encoded proteins, an alignment with no insertion/deletion (indel) or with a minimal number of indels. In the latter case, I imposed the rule that indel(s) must be located at the same amino acid position in the alignments of the two pairs of proteins (see for example the overlap polymerase/2b protein of Spinach latent virus, which is the first overlap in Supplementary File S1). By imposing this rule, I could align the two homologous nucleotide sequences in full accordance with the corresponding protein sequences. The alignment of protein sequences was carried out with Clustal Omega (Sievers and Higgins, 2014) . The third criterion concerned the cases in which I found multiple homologs meeting the two criteria described above. In these cases, I selected the most distantly related homolog, with the aim to cover the largest evolutionary space. The choice to select only one homolog for each overlapping gene was due to the fact that collection of a larger sample of homologs is limited to a few overlaps, mainly those occurring in virus species that are human pathogens (e.g. influenza and hepatitis viruses or SARS and Ebola viruses).
