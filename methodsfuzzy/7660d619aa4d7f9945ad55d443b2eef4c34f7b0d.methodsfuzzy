Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) used in this study was obtained from nonasthmatic healthy subjects and patients with severe asthma in accordance with procedures approved by the Human Research Ethics Board of the University of Chicago (Institutional Review Board nos. 13198A and 15361A). All subjects were seen in a refractory obstructive lung disease clinic by an asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease expert. Subjects were consented at the time of preoperative clinic visits. Pulmonary function tests were performed with methacholine (MCh) challenge before surgery. All surgeries were elective and for noninfectious or noninflammatory reasons: most of the surgeries were performed on obese patients and were bariatric in nature. One of the surgeries was for a thyroid nodule. Most of the donors showed no symptoms of comorbidities, except asthmatic patient 4, who was given a diagnosis of kyphoscoliosis. All bronchoscopies were done for research purposes only. Detailed clinical characteristics of the donors have been provided in Tables I and II . Details of healthy control subjects are provided in Table III . BALF was concentrated 10 times with Ultracel 10K cutoff concentrating centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Temecula, Calif).
