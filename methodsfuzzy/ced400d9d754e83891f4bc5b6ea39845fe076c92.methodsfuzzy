Design of capture probes. Probes were designed for the capture of nucleic acids from the viral and bacterial feline pathogens listed in Table 3 and in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Target pathogens were chosen because they fit one or more of the following characteristics: (i) the pathogen is highly relevant to feline health, yet current assays often fail to detect or completely characterize infection due to latency and/or high mutation rate; (ii) a relatively small genome size allowed redundancy in the capture design, providing enhanced sensitivity to diversity within the taxa; and (iii) the virus family is involved in analogous pathological processes (i.e., neoplasia or anemia) in other host species. The last attribute was included to allow potential discovery of pathogens that have not yet been associated with a particular disease syndrome. Full-length and partial genetic sequences representing the known diversity of each target pathogen were downloaded from GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/). Nucleotide alignments were constructed using default parameters in Muscle (12) . Maximum-likelihood (ML) trees were built in MEGA v.5, using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model of nucleotide substitution (13) (trees available upon request). Rate variation among sites was estimated with a two-category gamma distribution, allowing for invariant sites. Cluster support was estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates. One or more sequences were selected arbitrarily for the probe sequence library from each polytomy and each monophyletic cluster of terminal nodes. All sequences in the probe library were cross-referenced to the domestic cat (Felis catus) genome using the BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT) (14) (the bobcat [Lynx rufus] and mountain lion [Puma concolor] genome sequences have not yet been reported). Sequences with greater than 80% homology to the cat genome (Felis_catus 6.2, GenBank assembly accession no. GCA_000181335.2) were removed from the probe library to prevent nonspecific capture of host chromosomal DNA. This step was especially important for the exclusion of probes complementary to the endogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) sequences that exist in the domestic cat genome. We designed separate probe libraries for the enrichment of pathogen DNA and RNA (Table S1 ; see "Sample preparation" below). Probe libraries produced by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), contained approximately 55,000 RNA oligonucleotides, 120 bp in length, complementary to the DNA or RNA sequences of interest. For each probe library, the sequences selected from phylogenetic analyses described above were uploaded to eArrayXD capture probe design software (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Each set of probes was designed at 4ϫ coverage of target sequences (individual 120-bp probes tiled every 30 bases). Although the two probe libraries were used separately for the identification of pathogen DNA or RNA, each library was designed with some probes complementary to both forms of nucleic acids for possible combined DNA/RNA enrichment. After the initial screen of samples with the DNA probe library, a second set of DNA probes (DNAv2) was designed to improve capture efficiency by decreasing off-target capture. The DNAv2 probe library contained all of the domestic cat pathogens included in the first version but did not target pathogens specific to bobcats and mountain lions and had less redundancy. The sequences included in each probe library design are available upon request. Sample preparation. Samples were selected to represent the following categories of pathogen status (Table 1 ): (i) samples known to contain one or more target pathogens based on previous diagnostic tests, (ii) samples presumed to be negative for pathogens contained in the corresponding DNA/RNA probe library for that experiment (i.e., specific-pathogen free cats, cell cultures), (iii) samples from animals with clinical presentation or serological results suggestive of pathogen involvement but for which no infectious etiology has been identified, and (iv) samples from cats experimentally exposed to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and puma lentivirus (PLV). All samples were acquired from existing frozen sample archives. No live animals were used or sampled for this study. (i) DNA library preparation (16 samples). DNA was extracted from blood, tissue, or cell culture samples from domestic cats, bobcats, and mountain lions using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). For each sample, 3 g of single or pooled DNA extracts was used to construct the DNA library according to the SureSelectXT automated target enrichment for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing protocol (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, each DNA extract was sheared to produce short DNA fragments (ϳ150 to 200 bp). Standard Illumina adaptors were ligated to the ends of each fragment, and adaptor-specific primers were used to randomly amplify the DNA libraries prior to enrichment (4 to 6 PCR cycles). (ii) RNA library preparation (16 samples). RNA was extracted from in vivo (blood, peritoneal ascites, oral swabs) or in vitro (viral culture supernatant) samples using a viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). For each sample, a minimum of 1 g RNA was used to construct the RNA library according to the SureSelect RNA enrichment for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing protocol (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The RNA library preparation protocol was similar to that for DNA, except that after fragmentation, double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was produced from the positive-sense RNA present in the extract. The isolated ds-cDNA was then used as the template for adaptor ligation and amplification as described above. Four samples did not pass pre-NGS quality control analyses (i.e., due to low concentration or quality), and therefore only 12 of 16 original RNA samples were sequenced. (iii) DNA preparation for tracking enrichment (4 samples). DNA was extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes from four domestic cats that had been experimentally coinfected with FIV and PLV for a viral pathogenesis study (15) . For each sample, a DNA library was prepared and enriched with the DNAv2 probes as described above. These samples were used for quantifying host and pathogen nucleic acids at each step of the library preparation and enrichment protocols (see "Enrichment estimation" below). Target enrichment and sequencing. DNA/cDNA libraries were hybridized to their respective custom capture probe libraries for 24 h at 65°C, and unbound DNA was removed by washing as recommended by the probe manufacturer (16) . The enriched DNA/cDNA was then separated from the capture probes and isolated. Each DNA/cDNA library was barcoded via ligation of standard 6-mer oligonucleotides (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) for multiplex sequencing. The concentration of each library was assessed using flourometric (Qubit 2.0; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc., Grand Island, NY) and electrophoretic (Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) methods, and the libraries were pooled in equal concentrations for sequencing. The DNA libraries (n ϭ 16) and cDNA libraries (n ϭ 12) were pooled separately, and a nonindexed positive control was added to the samples at a 1% concentration (bacteriophage PhiX-174 DNA). DNA libraries during the first experiment were sequenced as a 16-sample multiplex with 150-bp paired-end reads on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The cDNA libraries were sequenced as a 12-sample multiplex with 100-bp paired-end reads on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Enrichment estimation. We used real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify the abundance of the feline GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene in pre-and postenrichment samples according to established protocols (17) . GAPDH genomic DNA or cDNA was quantified using primers from reference 18 with the following 25-l reaction mixture: 12.5 l SsoFast EvaGreen SuperMix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA), 1 l GAPfwd primer (10 M), 1 l GAPrev primer (10 M), 8.5 l water, and 2 l template (ϳ40 ng). The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 10 s. This was followed by a melt curve in which the temperature was increased from 65°C to 95°C in 0.5°C increments using 10-s intervals. The relative abundances of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), FIVA, and FIVC were measured with established RT-PCR protocols (10, 19, 20) . PLVA proviral DNA was measured using the following RT-PCR mixture: 12.5 l SsoFast EvaGreen SuperMix, 1 l 8083F (10 M) (5=-GCAGCCCTGAC GGTATCC-3=), 1 l 8165R (10 M) (5=-GCAGTCTCCTCTGAACAATCC-3=), 5.5 l water, and 5 l (100 to 500 ng) template. The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 62°C for 10 s. This was followed by a melt curve with the same parameters as described above for GAPDH. PLVB proviral DNA was measured using the same PCR mixture and conditions with 1 l each of the following primers: 643F (10 M) (5=-CTGTCTGTCATGGGGAATGAGT-3=) and 773R (10 M) (5=-GTCCTGTAGCTACCAAGGCAA-3=). Feline foamy virus viral (RNA) and proviral (DNA) loads were measured using the following RT-PCR protocol: 10 l iTaq Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA), 1 l FFVgag-F (10 M) (5=-GGACGATCTCAACAAGGTCAACTAAA-3=), 1 l FFVgag-R (10 M) (5=-TCCACGAGGAGGTTGC GA-3=), 0.2 l FFVgag-TM probe (10 M) (5=-AGACCCCCTAGACAACAACAGCAACACT-3=), 5.8 l water, and 2 l template (40 to 100 ng). The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s. Fold enrichment was calculated by comparing RT-PCR threshold cycle (C T ) values for preenrichment (i.e., DNA extracts or cDNA) versus postenrichment (prepped libraries) samples via the ΔΔC T method. Log 10 -transformed fold change (ΔC T ) and fold enrichment (ΔΔC T ) values were graphed using GraphPad Prism v4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The RT-PCRs and fold enrichment calculations were performed only on the subset of samples that had a sufficient sample volume remaining of pre-and postenrichment nucleic acids. Fold enrichment was similarly estimated at each step in the library preparation and enrichment protocol from FIV-containing samples enriched with DNAv2 baits. In order to estimate the impact of enrichment on the sequencing output for targeted pathogens, 2 of the 12 cDNA libraries were sequenced without enrichment, and one was enriched using only half of the recommended concentration of capture probes. Each of these three libraries originated from the same RNA extraction as a normally enriched cDNA library that was also processed and sequenced in parallel (Tables 2 and 4 ). Bioinformatics analysis. NGS reads were preprocessed by trimming known sequence contaminants from all sequences. Reads were then aligned to the Felis catus genome using BWA short-read alignment software (21) . The reference sequence used for this experiment was assembly felCat5, which was obtained from the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu). The genome was indexed by using the BWA-SW algorithm (22) . Reads were considered successfully mapped if the read and its mate successfully aligned according to BWA. The mean and standard deviation of depth, coverage, total number of alignments, and total number of reads that did not successfully align were calculated for every chromosome of the assembly using an in-house script. All reads that did not successfully align to the cat genome given the specified criteria were aligned to the nucleic acid sequences in the corresponding capture probe library. The successful alignment criterion was whether the read itself successfully aligned to any pathogen in the database according to BWA. The pathogen database was indexed using the BWA-backtrack algorithm. Like the alignment of reads to Felis catus, the same analytics were used to postprocess the alignments to each pathogen in the database. For alignments to both the Felis catus genome and the database of pathogens, all possible alignments according to BWA were considered, thus entailing that a read can have multiple alignments. Some reads mapped to pathogen reference sequences even in the absence of pathogens being present in that sample. This was likely the result of spurious mapping of nonpathogen reads in BWA and contamination during DNA/cDNA library preparation, similar to results recently reported by Wylie et al. (4) . To differentiate true pathogen reads from false-positive reads, we calculated a "positive threshold value" by using the number of reads that aligned to pathogen reference sequences in the negative-control samples. The positive threshold value was set at 100 times the proportion of total reads that mapped to each pathogen taxa in the negative-control samples. Thus, a positive threshold value was calculated for each pathogen taxa in each (DNA and RNA) experiment. A sample was considered positive for a given pathogen taxon if the proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences exceeded the positive threshold value for that taxon.
