Clinical Samples. Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was diagnosed according to the Japanese diagnostic criteria established in 2004 [19] , which are essentially compatible with the criteria by the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Clinical Research Network Investigators in 2007 [2] . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was sampled at Tosei General Hospital from seven patients with IPF after two to four instances of acute exacerbation in each patient to allow for the diagnostic exclusion of infection, and the samples were stored at −80 • C degrees. The surgical biopsies of ten patients with stable IPF, and the autopsied lungs of eight patients with IPF who died after acute exacerbation, were obtained at Tohoku University Hospital. The diseasefree lung tissues autopsied from three patients without any chronic lung diseases were also examined as controls. These lung tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and imbedded in paraffin wax. The written informed consent obtained from the patients for using these clinical samples was approved by the ethics committee of Tohoku University. Measurement of HMGB1 and Cytokines. HMGB1 in BALF was measured by a highly sensitive and specific ELISA method (Shino-test, Kanagawa, Japan) [20] , as reported previously [6, 7] . In brief, black polystyrene microtiter plates (Corning Laboratory Science, Corning, NY) were coated with anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, and blocked by PBS-1% bovine serum albumin for 2 hours. After washing, 100 μl of 8 dilutions each of the standard and samples, 1 : 1 dilutions in 0.2 mol/L Tris (pH 6.5), 0.15 mol/L NaCl containing 1% BSA were added to the wells and incubated for 24 hours at room temperature. After washing, antihuman HMGB1 peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After another washing step, PSatto (Lumigen, Southfield, MI) was added, and its luminescence was measured with a 9000D microplate luminescence reader (DIA-IATRON, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrations of 17 cytokines in these BALF samples, consisting of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocytes chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte/macrophagecolony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), were determined using Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The total TGF-β1 in these BALF samples was also measured using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) produced by MBC Laboratories, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Virus Isolation. Each BALF sample was subjected to virus isolation by the microplate method [21] at the Virus Research Center at the National Hospital Organization (Sendai, JAPAN). In short, the specimen was placed in transport medium composed of Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 0.5% gelatin containing 500 units/ml of penicillin G and 500 mg/ml of streptomycin and was centrifuged at 4,000 g at 4 • C for 15 min. The supernatant fraction was inoculated into cultured cells of human embryonic fibroblasts, using the cell lines, HEp-2; Vero; HMV-II, MDCK, LLC-MK2 cells, which can support the growth of numerous viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, mumps virus, measles virus, human coronavirus 229E, and human metapneumovirus. After inoculation, cytopathic effects were examined daily for two weeks, and, furthermore, when no CPE was found, blind passage was performed once for another two weeks with the same system. RT-PCR was also performed for human metapneumovirus virus isolation [22] . Days after treatment Days after treatment temperature before incubation with the primary antibodies. The antibodies and the optimal dilutions used in this study were as follows: monoclonal antibodies against human HMGB1 (1 : 3,000, Shino-test), the same antibody used for ELISA, RAGE (MAB5328, 1 : 50, CHEMICON International, Inc., Temecula, CA), thrombomodulin (TM1009, 1 : 100, DAKO Company Ltd., Glostrup, Denmark), CD34 (4A1, 1 : 100, Nichirei Co., Tokyo, Japan), and antihuman von Willebrand factor (vWF) monoclonal antibody (F8/86, 1 : 1,000, Nichirei). The tissues were incubated with a primary antibody in a moist chamber at 4 • C for overnight and were further reacted with a polymer reagent (ENVISON kit; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 60 minutes at room temperature. For double immunohistochemical staining, the antigen-antibody complex was visualized with Vector Red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 1 mM 3.3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB), as described previously [15] . Morphometric Evaluation. The percentages of the distribution area of the cells immunoreactive for thrombomodulin among those immunoreactive for CD34 were estimated from 30 randomly selected color images at a magnification of 400 in each case using a digital image analysis system (Lumina Vision, Mitani Corporation, Fukui, Japan). Statistical Analysis. For analysis of two unpaired samples, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. A significant difference was defined as P < .05. All values were represented as the means ± SEM.
