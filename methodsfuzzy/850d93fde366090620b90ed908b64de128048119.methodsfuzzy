Trained field staff visited the home weekly and used a standardised form to inquire about respiratory symptoms and signs in mothers, infants and other household members for each day in the previous week. A mid-nasal turbinate swab was collected from mothers and other adult household members aged ⩾15 years with self-reported fever, plus one or more of the following symptoms within the previous 7 days: cough, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion or myalgias. Swabs were collected from all children <15 years with at least one of the following symptoms: subjective fever, cough, draining ear, wheezing or difficulty breathing, in the previous 7 days. Illness episodes were defined as symptoms that met described criteria and were separated by at least seven symptom-free days. Only individuals with ⩾7 days of symptom diary recorded, with or without illness, were included in the analyses. Households that did not have ⩾3 individuals with surveillance were excluded from the analysis as two-person households consisted of mother-infant pairs without surveillance of household members. Respiratory swabs were collected, aliquoted and transported from the Nepal field site to the University of Washington in Seattle, WA in a temperature-stable buffer (PrimeStore; Longhorn Diagnostics, San Antonio, USA). Samples were tested by a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 12 respiratory viruses, including RSV, MPV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus 1-4 (PIV 1-4), adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (CoV), HRV and bocavirus [19] [20] [21] . Influenza transmission in household was the primary aim of the trial substudy and is being analysed separately. Bocavirus was not included because of its prolonged shedding patterns. Sequencing was performed for HRV-and RSV-positive samples from household illness clusters utilizing samples with PCR cycle threshold values <33 and 30 for HRV and RSV, respectively, based on previous difficulty sequencing low viral load samples [22, 23] . Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted, and cDNA was synthesised. A hemi-nested PCR protocol was used targeting the 5 ′ untranslated region and the second hypervariable region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein coding region for HRV and RSV, respectively [22, 23] . Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.309, and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using the HKY85 model with 100 bootstrap replicates were inferred using PhyML 3.1 within Geneious [24, 25] . Sequences were considered to be the same virus type with ⩾98% identity. Sequences >200 base pairs (bp) were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers MH266546 to MH266612.
