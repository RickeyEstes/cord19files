Cell culture. The SGC7901 human gastric cancer, SHG44 glioma, SHI-1 leukemia, A549 lung adenocarcinoma, and HO8910 ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). They were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37˚C. They were selected as all these poorly differentiated cells often have aberrant terminal sugar structures of O-glycan chains. Generation and selection of cells stably transfected with pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors and pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. SGC7901 cells (2x10 5 ) were plated onto 6-well plates until they reached 70-90% confluency before transfection. Cells were transfected with 4 µg of pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors (SGC7901-T2s group) and pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors (SGC7901-T2as group), followed by selection with G418 (500 µg/ml). Individual clones were isolated and expanded for further characterization. The empty vector pEGFP-C1 was also transfected into SGC7901 cells and served as the control group. Transfection efficiency was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss; Gottingen, Germany). All plasmids were constructed and conserved in our laboratory (13, 15) . Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. Briefly, SGC7901 cells and the stably transfected clones were plated in 96-well plates at a density of cells (5x10 3 ) and 180 µl culture medium was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37˚C for 24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 h, at which time the cells were incubated with 100 µl of MTT solution (5 g/l; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The reac tion was stopped by the addition of l50 µl DMSO (Sigma) and the absorbance of samples at 570 nm was then measured. A growth curve was plotted for each sample as the log cell number vs. time, and the growth rates were derived from the slope of each growth curve. Three independent experiments were performed and the results were used for plotting the relative growth rate with SD. In vitro cell adhesion assay. The adhesion of SGC7901 cells stably transfected with sense or antisense ppGalNAc-T2 vectors was performed using standard methods. A flatbottomed 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4˚C with 0.2 ml Matrigel (200 µg/ml). Some wells were left uncoated as negative control. The plate was washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at 37˚C and then 0.5 ml suspension of tumor cells (5x10 3 ) were added. After the plate was incubated at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h intervals at 37˚C, unattached cells were removed by washing with PBS. MTT was added to each well and the absorbance value obtained by seeding uncoated wells represented 100% adhesion and all other values were divided by this to calculate percentage adhesion. Furthermore, to investigate the adhesion of cells to various extra-cellular matrix (ECM) components, 96-well plates were precoated with either 1 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (HA) or 50 1 g/ml fibronectin (FN). The adhesive ability of gastric cancer cells was also detected as described above. In vitro cell invasion assay. The invasiveness of different SGC7901 stable cells was evaluated in 24-well Transwell chambers (Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Transwell chambers equipped with polycarbonate membrane (12 mm pore size) were precoated with 6.25 mg/l Matrigel on the upper chamber. The cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 12-24 h. Cells (1x10 5 ) were seeded in each transwell insert containing 200 µl of serum-free medium with BSA. Then 500 µl of culture medium with 10% FBS was added into each well of a 24-well plate. The cells and Matrigel on the upper chamber were removed using a cotton stick after 12 h. Cell penetration through the membrane was quantified by counting the number of cells that penetrated the membrane in ten microscopic fields (at x200 magnification) per filter. The experiment was repeated 3 times.
