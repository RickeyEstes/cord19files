All subjects in the study were assigned to treatment according to a blinded randomization scheme generated by a statistician at ICON Clinical Research. For Part A, subjects were allocated to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 5 g, 15 g, or 45 g novel A (H1N1) 2009 influenza VLP vaccine, or placebo. In Part B, subjects were allocated in a 2:5 ratio (placebo:active) to receive placebo or a 15 g dose of the VLP vaccine, for a minimum inclusion of 3000 subjects overall (Parts A and B combined) in the H1N1 VLP vaccine safety cohort. Part A had a power of >80% to achieve lower bound criteria of 40% for seroconversion and 70% for seroprotection with a sample size of 250 subjects per group. For the entire VLP safety cohort of 3000 subjects minimum, and given an event rate of 0.33%, the probability of observing one AE was >99.99%. For immunogenicity analyses, geometric mean titers (GMT), geometric mean ratio (GMR), and rates of seroconversion and seroprotection, were measured and described for each of the randomized treatment groups. An exploratory analysis to evaluate HAI immune responses in subjects categorized as seronegative (HAI titer < 1:10) and seropositive (HAI titer ≥ 1:10) based on prevaccination titers was also performed. GMTs with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for HAI and MN were calculated at each time point (Days 1, 14 and 36) using the back-transformed mean of the log 10 transformed HAI or MN titer for all treatment groups. The GMR, defined as the back-calculated mean difference (postvaccination-pre-vaccination) of log 10 transformed HAI titers, was calculated at Day 14 and Day 36 for all treatment groups along with its two-sided 95% CI using a t-statistic. Seroconversion rates at Days 14 and 36 and the percentage of subjects who achieved an HAI (seroprotection) or MN titer of ≥1:40 at Days 1, 14, and 36 with corresponding two-sided 95% CIs were calculated. Confidence intervals for the point estimates were obtained using the Clopper-Pearson's exact method. Seroconversion was defined as a pre-vaccination titer <1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and a minimum of four-fold rise in post-vaccination HAI antibody titer. For Parts A and B, analysis of all AEs experienced overall were summarized for each treatment group by incidence of subjects with one or more vaccine related AE, severe or life-threatening AE, SAE, unsolicited AE, and SE. The two-sided p-value was based on the Cochran-Armitage trend test in incidence with dose (as applicable). SEs were summarized by treatment group, vaccination, A subject is counted only once per category using the event with the highest severity. incidence and severity in Part A using the total vaccinated cohort; the Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to evaluate differences across groups. A subject was counted only once per adverse event category; the event with the highest severity was used for subjects that experienced multiple events.
