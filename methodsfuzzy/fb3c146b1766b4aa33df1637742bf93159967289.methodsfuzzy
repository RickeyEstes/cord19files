Mice. BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, http://www.criver. com/) were purchased for use in these studies. C.B6-Klra8 Cmv1-r /UwaJ, referred to as Klra8, (Jackson Laboratory, http://www.jax.org/), B10.D2, and B10.D2-DAP12-deficient (DAP128) animals were bred in pathogen-free breeding facilities at the Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (Marseille, France). Experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal care and use. Protocols have been approved by the French Provence ethical committee (number 04/2005) and the US Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (assurance A5665-01). In vivo treatment protocols. Stocks of wild-type Smith Strain MCMV salivary gland extracts [14] and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived wild-type, DN-SCP-MCMV [44] , Dm157-MCMV, and m157-revertant were prepared as previously described [73] . Infections were initiated on day 0 with the i.p. delivery of 5 3 10 3 PFU (for in vivo-derived virus) or 2 3 10 5 PFU (for in vitro-derived virus). These modest doses were chosen because they do not induce lymphopenia in infected animals who harbor leukocyte numbers equal to or greater than those of uninfected controls (not shown). In addition, these doses are likely to be closer to the physiologic doses reached upon natural exposure to the virus through contact with infected animals. For the in vivo arrest of DN-SCP-MCMV replication, 200 lg of doxycycline was delivered by i.p. injection 20 h postinfection followed immediately by the addition of 2 mg/ml doxycycline plus 5% sucrose in the drinking water. 50,000 units of recombinant mouse IFN-a (HyCult Biotech, http://www.hbt.nl/) was administered by i.p. injection at 30 and 48 h post-MCMV infection. This dose was titrated in ELISA and shown to correspond to 25 ng of the ELISA IFN-a standard. Thus, since the cytokine titers measured by ELISA in the serum of BALB/c mice at 36 h post-infection range between 5 and 10 ng/ml, and the volume of the lymph and blood of an adult mouse can roughly be estimated around 5 ml, the dose of rmIFN-a injected in Klra8 mice should be similar to the physiologic levels of the cytokine naturally induced in infected BALB/c mice. NK cells were depleted by delivery of 100 lg of purified anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136) on days À1 pre-MCMV infection, and days 1 and 3 post-MCMV infection. Control mice were treated with 100 lg of mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, http://www. jacksonimmuno.com/). Uninfected mice were depleted of NK cells on the schedule of day 4 infected mice. To assess NK cell depletion, a combination of anti-DX5 and anti-TCRb staining was used in order to avoid the risk of underevaluating the numbers of remaining NK cells, as may have occurred due to a potential problem of epitope masking if the antibody used for immunophenotyping had been the same as the one used for depletion. NK cell depletions were greater than 98% ( Figure S5) . Isolation of lymphocytes. For the analysis of CD8 T cell populations, spleens were minced, passed through nylon mesh and washed in PBS, 5 mM EDTA, and 3% FCS (PBS/EDTA/FCS). For the analysis of DC populations, spleens were digested by collagenase (liberase CI; Boehringer Mannheim, http://www.roche.com/) and teased apart by repeating pipeting in PBS/EDTA/FCS. In both protocols, erythrocytes were osmotically lysed by ammonium chloride treatment. Thereafter, cell suspensions were kept in PBS/ EDTA/FCS unless specified otherwise. Total live splenocytes were counted by trypan blue exclusion using a hemocytometer. Total numbers of specific leukocyte subsets were calculated for each individual mouse as (percent of these cells in the live gate of total splenocytes) 3 (total live splenocyte numbers). CD8 T cell stimulation for IFN-c production. For intracellular IFNc detection, splenic lymphocytes were isolated and then incubated with IE-1 ( 168 YPHFMPTNL 176 ) or m164 peptide ( 257 AGPPRYSRI 265 ) (10 À7 M) pulsed P815.B7 cells at a 10:1 ratio for 6 h with brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) added for the last 3 h of culture. Cells were then harvested and analyzed for CD8a, CD43, and intracellular IFN-c protein by three-color staining followed by flow cytometry. In vivo cytotoxicity assay. Antigen-specific CD8 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was assayed as described in [74] . Briefly, splenocytes from naive mice were costained with PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich) and either 1 lM, 100 nM, or 1 nM CFSE (Molecular Probes, http://probes. invitrogen.com/). Labeled cells were then pulsed with the indicated peptides, mixed in equal ratios, then transferred i.v. (5 3 10 6 total cells) into the indicated groups of mice. Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens of recipient mice 4 h post-transfer and analyzed for PKH26 (all transferred cells) and level of CFSE expression (unpulsed or peptide-pulsed cells). Percent killing within the PKH26 þ gate was calculated by: 100 À ([(% peptide-pulsed in infected/% unpulsed in infected)/(% peptide-pulsed in uninfected/% unpulsed in uninfected)] 3 100). Quantification of viral titers and serum cytokine levels. Spleens were homogenized [14] , and viral titers were determined by plaque assay using mouse embryonic fibroblasts with centrifugal enhancement or NIH-3T3 cells [73] . Serum was collected at the indicated time points and cytokine levels were determined by ELISA for IFN-a (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, http://www.interferonsource.com/) and IL-12p70 (R&D Systems, http://www.rndsystems.com/) per the manufacturer's instructions. Abs and reagents. DX5-PE, CD43-PE (clone 1B11), CD11c-PE (clone HL3), CD8a-PerCp (clone 53-6.7), TCR-b-allophycocyanin (clone H57-597), IFN-c-allophycocyanin (clone XMG1.2), IL-12allophycocyanin (clone C15.6), and streptavidin-PE were purchased from BD Pharmingen (http://www.bdbiosciences.com/). CD8a-FITC (clone CT-CD8a) was purchased from Caltag (http://www.caltag.com/). Ki-67-FITC (clone MM1) was purchased from Novocastra (http://www. vision-bio.com/). Purified rat anti-mouse IFN-a (clone F18 and RMMA-1) and anti-IFN-b (clone RMMB-1) were purchased from TEBU-Bio (http://www.tebu-bio.com/). 120G8 mAb was provided by Schering-Plough (http://www.schering-plough.com/) and conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 using a kit from Molecular Probes. Isotype controls for each mAb were purchased from the appropriate manufacturer. The following tetramers conjugated to PE were obtained through the NIH Tetramer Facility (Atlanta, Georgia, United States): H-2L(d)/IE-1( 168 YPHFMPTNL 176 ) and H-2D(d)/ m164( 257 AGPPRYSRI 265 ). The above-mentioned reagents were used for FACS analysis in this study. Flow cytometric analysis. Cells were first incubated with 2.4G2 mAb for 20 min. Cells were then stained with mAbs specific for cell surface markers or isotype controls for 30 min at 4 8C. Cells were then washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Intracellular staining for Ki-67, IFN-c, and IL-12 was performed using the Cytofix/ Cytoperm kit (BD Pharmingen). Intracellular staining for IFN-a/b was performed as previously described [35] . Depending on the experiments, 2.5 3 10 5 to 2 3 10 7 events were collected on a FACSCalibur. The data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Isotype controls were used to set gates for the presented FACS analyses. Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel 5.0 (Microsoft Corporation, http://www.microsoft.com/) using Student's two-tailed t tests. Mean 6 standard deviation (SD) was calculated for each graph. If visually absent, error bars are too small to be depicted based on the scale of the y-axis.
