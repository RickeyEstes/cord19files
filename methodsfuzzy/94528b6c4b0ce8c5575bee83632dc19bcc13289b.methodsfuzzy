We retrospectively evaluated 15 consecutive children with ADEM and adolescents at the pediatric neurology division of Baskent University, Adana Hospital (Adana, Turkey) between June 2008 and June 2012. All children had been diagnosed using reliable clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging techniques according to the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study Group criteria 2, 5 . Patients presenting with a clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome (e.g., optic neuritis or transverse myelitis) or with clinical or radiologic evidence for dissemination in time and space suggesting MS were excluded 2,5 . Extensive workup for bacterial and viral infections was performed for all patients. Immunologic investigations were simultaneously performed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples. Besides those, investigation of CSF lactate for mitochondrial disorder and angiotensin converting enzyme for neurosarcoidosis were performed for all patients [7] [8] [9] . At the time of diagnosis, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood count, CSF analyses (cell counts and phenotypes, protein and glucose content, polymerase chain reaction tests for herpes simplex virus, oligoclonal bands, immunoglobulin-G, lactate, angiotensin converting enzyme), serum serologic tests for bacterial (salmonella, brucella, borreliosis, and mycoplasma pneumoniae) and viral infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus), and serum chemistry (serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels and immunoglobulin-G) were obtained. All physical and neurologic examinations performed in the hospital and during outpatient follow-up were performed by the same pediatric neurologist (IE). Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed as part of the initial examination in some patients and brain MRIs were acquired in all patients. Brain MRI scans were performed in all patients using a 1.5-T MR scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Imaging studies included axial contrast-enhanced T 1weighted spin echo with fat suppression images, axial and sagittal precontrast spin echo T 1 -weighted images, T 2 -weighted coronal and axial turbo spin echo image, axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, and T 1 -weighted axial, sagittal, and coronal contrast-enhanced spin echo images. Spinal MRIs were acquired in cases where there was a clinical suspicion of spinal cord involvement. All patients underwent follow-up MRI several weeks after their neurologic symptoms resolved. All children were treated with a standard protocol consisting of 3 to 5 days' treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 2 weeks and then tapering over the next 2 weeks along with symptomatic treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2 gm/kg divided over 2 days) was given for patients who continued to deteriorate. Seizures were managed with intravenous phenytoin. Antiviral and antibiotic therapy was given according to the patients' clinical status at admission. All of the patients were regularly followed at the outpatient clinic at 4 weeks after discharge and every 3 to 6 months thereafter until preparation of this article, depending on clinical conditions.
