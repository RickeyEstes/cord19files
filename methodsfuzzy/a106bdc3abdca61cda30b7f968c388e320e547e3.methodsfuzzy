In order to measure media engagement, we use a corpus of over 2.9 million geolocated, flu-related tweets collected from the contiguous United States between September 2009 and July 2015. This sample was provided by the Computational Story Lab at the University of Vermont, and is a subset of Twitter's 'garden hose' feed, representing approximately 10% of all public messages posted to the platform. In this study, we consider only tweets which contain one or more of the strings 'flu', '#flu', 'influenza' or '#influenza'. Furthermore, we will focus on 'retweeted' messages, where an individual has opted to reshare a tweet originally authored by someone else with their own followers by means of a retweet rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org R. Soc. open sci. button within the Twitter interface or by appending the string 'RT' to the beginning of the original message. Such messages account for approximately 30% of the corpus and are mainly resharings of flurelated articles from major news outlets, but can also contain retweets of messages authored by regular Twitter users. We use a deterministic SEEIIR-M model (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered with media, with two compartments for exposed and infected individuals) to model the transmission of influenza under the influence of media effects:Ṡ = −βf (I)SI, (2.1) 3)
