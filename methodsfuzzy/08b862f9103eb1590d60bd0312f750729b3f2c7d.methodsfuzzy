The patients' clinical and demographic data were collected using a secure web-based platform. RSV status was determined both by conventional methods/rapid test in the referring hospital, and by molecular techniques in nasopharyngeal secretions. For RSV assessment by molecular techniques, a nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for the study during hospitalization, using either a sterile feeding tube and injector for nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, or a sterile nylon swab (FLOQSwabsTM by Copan Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy), without culture medium. A panel of 19 viruses including RSV was sought by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods were previously described in Cebey-López et al. [11] . A peripheral blood sample for analysis was also collected from each patient at the same time as the swab, in an EDTA BD Vacutainer1 K3E 5.4 mg tube (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, Plymouth, UK). In some patients, the initial conventional bacterial test was performed on hospital admission samples, whilst PCR was performed using samples obtained after the patients were transferred to PICU and recruited into the study. PCR results were not shared with clinicians due to all PCR were performed simultaneously off-patient. Blood samples were pretreated as follows: 250ul of blood was mixed with 25ul lysozyme (100 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) and 10ul lysostaphin (1mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA), vortexed briefly and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. 0.1g lysing matrix B beads (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, California, USA) were added and the mixture was agitated at 30Hz for 2x30s using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 200ul lysis buffer AL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added and the samples were centrifuged at 5,500 rpm for 2 minutes to pellet the lysis beads. 200ul of the lysed blood sample was then transferred onto a Biorobot MDx (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and total nucleic acid extracted using silica membrane chemistry and eluted in 200ul of elution buffer AE (QIAamp DNA Blood Biorobot MDx extraction kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nested PCR was then performed to detect the presence of ten different organisms, as below ( Table 1) . The PCRs were performed as two screens, with the first round reactions multiplexed for targets 1-5 and 6-10 respectively. All first round reactions were performed in 50ul reaction volumes consisting of 20ul template (nucleic acid extracted from blood as described above) and 30ul mastermix (MyTaqHS, Bioline Reagents, London, UK) with each primer added to a final reaction concentration of 0.2uM. Thermal cycling conditions for the first round reactions were: 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 15s, 55°C for 15s, 72°C for 15s; this was performed using a TRIO block thermocycler (Biometra Gmbh, Göttingen, Germany). 1ul of first round template was transferred into 24ul of second round mastermix (MyTaqHS mastermix, Bioline Reagents, London, UK) containing second round primers at a final reaction concentration of 0.2uM for each primer and 1ul of Evagreen (Biotium, Hayward, California, USA) per reaction. Second round reactions were performed on a Lightcycler 480 (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 20s, 55°C for 20s, 76°C for 20s with fluorescence acquisition at 76°C. This was followed by a melt curve in which fluorescence was acquired from 75-95°C and melt curve analysis used to detect specific amplification. DNA extraction and PCR amplification of bacterial targets was performed by a commercial referral laboratory, Micropathology Ltd (MCP). MCP is accredited by Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd (CPA, a subsidiary of UKAS) to provide diagnostic pathology services in the UK. All molecular PCR assays are validated to CPA standards. This process includes primer specificity checking by an in-house method based on analysis of publically available sequence data to ensure that observed variation within each species is accounted for and that no cross-reactivity to other targets can be identified. The sensitivity of the PCRs for all ten targets is <5 gene copies/reaction. This was derived using a combination of quantitated PCR control material (AmpliRun, Vircell, Granada, Spain) and synthetic copies of the target amplicon, quantitated using an automated electrophoresis platform (MultiNA, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Bacteremia was defined as the positivity of PCR and/or blood culture. Bacterial superinfection diagnosis relied on the discretion of the recruiting physician according to clinical data, inflammatory markers, radiological findings and/or appropriate cultures. PCR was done after children discharge so results were not shared with clinicians. All PCR were performed simultaneously off-patient. Respiratory support was considered as either invasive (mechanical ventilation) or non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP). The severity of each respiratory episode was ranked by physician criteria (mild, moderate or severe). The respiratory distress was rated in the worst moment of the illness. Spanish national immunization program includes Hib vaccine but not pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. However average vaccination coverage with pneumococcal conjuagate vaccine is estimated to be 60-65% through the private market.
