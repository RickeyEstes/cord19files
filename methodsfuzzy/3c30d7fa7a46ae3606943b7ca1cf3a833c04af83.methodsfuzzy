Given two DNA sequences X and Y, we obtained their revised LZ-word sets RLZSet X and RLZSet Y with the revised Lempel-Ziv complexity. We then blended RLZSet X and RLZSet Y to compose anther set RLZSet XÀY . In order to highlight the influence of different LZ-words' size, we divided the RLZSet XÀY set into several mutually exclusive sets RLZSet t XÀY according to the length of revised LZ-word t. It is worthy to note that mutually exclusive sets RLZSet t XÀY rely heavily on set splitting methods. In order to evaluate the influence of the set splitting methods, we adopted the operation measure to classify HEV Genotypes with step-wise refinement of set splitting methods. HEV (Hepatitis E virus) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to Hepevirus genus under the separate family of Hepeviridea (Lu et al., 2006) . The genome of HEV is approximately 7.2 kb in length and contains a short 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR), three overlapped open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3′) and a short 3′ UTR. We retrieved a total of 48 full-length HEV genome sequences from NCBI (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Abbreviation for the strains, accession number, nucleotide length, country, and genotype of all HEV genomes (Lu et al., 2006) are described in Table 1 . And the 48 HEV genomes were distinctly clustered into four genotypes by the traditional classification (Liu et al., 2008) . This experiment aims at assessing how well the operation measure with step-wise refinement of set splitting methods performs on classification. Here, set splitting methods with the stepwise refinement (SSM) are: In relation to the clustering literature (Handl et al., 2005) , Neighbor-joining (Felsenstein, 1989) , a classic tree construction algorithm, can be considered as hierarchical methods. These results are represented in Fig. 4 . To evaluate the performance of the operation measure for HEV genotypes classification, we counted the number of misplaced HEV genotype against a gold standard. For the classification of HEV genotypes, we took the traditional classification as the gold standard (Lu et al., 2006) . The numbers of misplaced HEV genotype for the operation measure with SSM 1 , SSM 2 , SSM 3 , SSM 4 , and SSM 5 are 1, 1, 2, 1 and 0, respectively. These results indicate that the higher the refinement scheme is, the higher the operation measure efficiency is.
