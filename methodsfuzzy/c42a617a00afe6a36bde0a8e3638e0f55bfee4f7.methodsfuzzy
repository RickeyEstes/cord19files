The proposed data-driven prediction algorithm is based on the set of historical data of the spreading profiles of COVID-19 in 367 cities in China, namely, 367 sets of normalized time series of the form:Ī 4 .

Superscript "(c)" denotes data of Chinese cities. Now, suppose an outbreak occurs in city o, and only k o days of data have been obtained in normalized form asĪ where k o < K i . Then, assuming the spreading profile of city o is related to that of city i in the historical archive, as permitted by virtue of the validity of (4), we formulate the following optimization problem to predict the epidemic progression in city o: where N is the number of Chinese cities in the historical archive, w I and w J are weighting coefficients, µ L and µ U are the lower and upper bounds of the searching space, respectively. By solving the the nonlinear optimization problem, we can find the most closely resembling growth curve from the historical profiles, e.g., city i. Then, we apply the the augmented SEIR model with the profile code given in the parameter set for city i to predict the future spreading trend of city o. Furthermore, we can choose the top n best candidates with the smallest error as the candidate set for prediction, giving an average predicted propagation profile and a deviation range based on n best-fit profile codes.
