Recombinant S proteins and mAbs. The plasmid encoding the receptorbinding domain (residues 318-510) of SARS-CoV S protein Tor2 (Accession No. AY274119), fused with the Fc portion of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc), was previously described [28, 29] . RBD-Fc bearing R441A substitution (designated as RBD-R441A) was generated by mutagenesis using the QuickChange XL kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Each of the recombinant fusion proteins was expressed in 293T cells transfected with the plasmid using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol and purified by protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The full-length S protein (FL-S) of SARS-CoV Urbani (Accession No. AY278741) was expressed in expresSF +Ò insect cells with recombinant baculovirus D3252 by the Protein Sciences Corporation (Bridgeport, CT). A panel of 26 mAbs specific for the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein was prepared in our laboratory, which include 14 mAbs isolated from mice immunized with RBD-Fc [29] , 6 mAbs isolated from mice immunized with FL-S, and 6 mAbs isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Immunization of mice and rabbits. RBD-Fc and its mutant RBD-R441A were, respectively, used to immunize mice and rabbits. Four female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) per group were subcutaneously immunized with 20 lg of purified proteins re-suspended in PBS plus MLP + TDM Adjuvant (Sigma, Saint Louis, MI) and boosted with 10 lg of the same antigen plus the MLP + TDM adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Four NZW rabbits (12 weeks old) per group were immunized intradermally with 150 lg purified proteins re-suspended in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.2) in the presence of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), and boosted three times with freshly prepared emulsion of 150 lg immunogen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) at 3-week intervals. Pre-immune sera were collected before starting the immunization and antisera were collected 7 days after each boost. Sera were kept at 4°C before use. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The reactivity of mouse and rabbit antisera or anti-RBD mAbs with S proteins (RBD-Fc, RBD-R441A or FL-S) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, 1 lg/ml recombinant protein was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, serially diluted antisera or mAbs were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by four washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by washes. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). Generation of SARS pseudovirus and neutralization assay. SARS-CoV pseudovirus system was developed in our laboratory as previously described [27, 28] . In brief, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the S protein corresponding to SARS-CoV Tor2 isolate and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) by using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer Mannheim). Supernatants containing SARS pseudovirus were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection of human ACE2transfected 293T (293T/ACE2) cells. Briefly, 293T/ACE2 cells were plated at 10 4 cells/well in 96-well tissue-culture plates and grown overnight. The supernatants containing pseudovirus were pre-incubated with serially diluted mouse or rabbit antisera at 37°C for 1 h before addition to cells. The culture was re-fed with fresh medium 24 h later and incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using lysis reagent included in a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottomed luminometer plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units (RLU) were determined immediately in the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan US). Receptor-binding assays. Binding of RBD-Fc or RBD-R441A protein to soluble ACE2 was measured by ELISA. Briefly, recombinant soluble ACE2 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) at 2 lg/ml was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates (Corning Costar) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, serially diluted RBD-Fc or R441A was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After washing, the HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Zymed) was added and incubated an additional 1 h. After washing, the substrate TMB was used for detection. Binding of RBD-Fc or RBD-R441A to ACE2expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, 10
