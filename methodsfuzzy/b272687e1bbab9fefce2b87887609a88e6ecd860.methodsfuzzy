MBs have a hairpin structure that can undergo spontaneous conformational changes upon hybridization to complementary nucleic acids or protein targets, activating fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [61, 62] . For example, the dye molecule does not emit lights when it is near a quencher, and it emits when it is distant from quencher. MBs are attached to beads by electrostatic or biotin-streptavidin interactions to detect unlabeled nucleic acids in solution for multiplex detection [63] . Using beads of different sizes and MBs in two fluorophore colors, synthetic nucleic acid sequences were successfully recognized for three respiratory pathogens, including the SARS coronavirus in proof-of-concept experiments. Considering that routine flow cytometry can detect only up to four fluorescent channels, this assay approach may allow multiplex detection of nucleic acids in a single tube. However, there are several obstacles to overcome: For example, unstable interactions, random attachment of MBs, and the bulkiness of streptavidin. As a different approach, MBs were directly coupled to multilayer fluorescence-encoded beads by covalent bonding [37] . In this study, a RNA aptamer was used for thrombin detection and the MB was designed as a hairpin structure. One side of the RNA aptamer had a conjugated with a fluorescent dye, and the other side was immobilized to the beads containing quencher. By immobilization of these "apta-beacons" onto optically-encoded beads, core-shell type beads contain a fluorescent dye-encoded core and apta-beacon-coupled shell. In a model study, thrombin (100 nmol) was directly detected using this apta-beacon bead method. As illustrated in Figure 4 , the fluorophore of the MB would be separated from the quencher to allow fluorescence emission (488 nm) when the MBs on the beads bind thrombin. Before thrombin treatment, the beads showed only red color (543 nm) from the rhodamine encoded at the core layer. The thrombin-bound apta-beacon beads were easily recognized by the appearance of fluorescence without any further labeling step. However, only several RNA aptamers have been reported for protein targeting. Because the known RNA aptamer sequence for targeting protein can be used for this method, applicable proteins can be highly limited in current stage.
