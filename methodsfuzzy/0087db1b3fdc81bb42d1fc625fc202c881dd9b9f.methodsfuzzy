CrFK cells were obtained from the ATCC and a feline glial cell line (G355-5), was kindly provided by Don Blair (NIH, Bethesda, MD). PBMCs were prepared from heparinized whole feline blood by Ficoll-paque gradient purification (Lerner et al., 1995) and cultured in the presence of IL-2 and Concanavalin-A (Con-A). MCH5 cell lines were isolated by limiting dilution cloning of PBMCs from an FIV positive cat. The T-cell lines 104-C1 and 104-C7 were isolated from an FIV negative cat. The lymphoma cell line, 3201, (Tochikura et al., 1990) was obtained from Dr. William Hardy. The two continuous IL-2-independent cell lines, MCH5-4DL and 104-C1DL were isolated from their parental lines, MCH5-4 and 104-C1, respectively, after undergoing crisis in the absence of interleukin-2 and Con-A. T-cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Mediatech) containing: 10% heatinactivated FBS (Gemini Bioproducts), 200 mM, L-glutamine (Sigma), 1X non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 1X sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 1X MEM-vitamins (Sigma), 5.5Â10 À5 M -mercaptoethanol (Gibco-BRL) and 50 mg ml À1 gentamicin sulfate (Gemini BioProducts). The lines that required mitogenic stimulation also received 50 U ml À1 human recombinant IL-2 (a gift of Hoffmann±LaRoche) and 7.5 mg ml À1 Con-A (Boehringer Mannheim). The CrFK cells were cultured in DMEM (BioWhittaker) with the same supplements as described above for RPMI 1640 medium, without addition of IL-2 or Con-A. The G355-5 cells were cultured in McCoys-5A medium (Mediatech), also with the same supplements without Con-A and IL-2. FIV strains used in this study were: FIV-34TF10, a molecular clone derived from the Petaluma isolate (Talbott et al., 1989) ; FIV-34TF10orf2rep (Waters et al., 1996) , which contains an open Orf2 reading frame; FIV-PPR, a molecular clone derived from the San Diego isolate (Phillips et al., 1990) ; and FIV-PPRglial, a strain with expanded host cell range, obtained after ex vivo passage in the 104-C1DL cell line (see below). T-cells were infected at a density of 5Â10 6 ml À1 . Virus-positive tissue culture supernatants with a known reverse transcriptase (RT) unit value were used as infectious input virus. Typically, cells were infected with 400 000 cpm RT activity, defined as assayed (below). Cells were washed in Hanks-buffered saline solution (HBSS) prior to the addition of virus. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of viral supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 378C followed by a 5 min spin at 1000 rpm in a Beckman-J6B centrifuge. The virus was aspirated and the cells washed prior to culture in fresh media. Adherent cells were infected at 50% confluency in a T25 flask. Cells were washed with HBSS and 2 ml viral supernatant was pipetted onto the monolayer. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 378C and then washed 2 times with HBSS. Fresh media was then added to each flask.
