Molecular cloning and protein expression of the spike S2 protein. The DNA sequences coding the spike protein of SARS-CoV were obtained from the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (GenBank Accession No. AY291451). The coding sequence of S2 (aa 902-1255) was amplified by PCR with primers containing 5 0 -and 3 0 -restriction sites. The PCR product was digested and ligated into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET-21b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) for protein expression. The recombinant S2 protein was expressed by induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. The inclusion bodies were collected after the cells were broken by microfluidizer and dissolved in 8 M guanidine-HCl at room temperature for overnight. After purification using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, the protein was then sequentially diluted in 8, 6, 4, and 2 M urea, respectively. The protein purity was determined by 12.5% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie blue staining. Peptide synthesis and purification. Peptides SN50 (HR-N) and SC40 (HR-C), having an acetylated N terminus and a C-terminal amide, were synthesized by standard FMOC peptide chemistry. SN50 corresponds to residues 903-952 of SARS-CoV spike protein, while SC40 corresponds to residues 1148-1187. After cleavage from the resin, the peptides were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) and lyophilized. Peptides were then purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 preparative column (Waters). The identity of the HR-N and HR-C peptides was verified by mass spectrometric analysis, with molecular weights of 5490.1 and 4405.9, respectively. Polyclonal antibody preparation and immunodetection assays. The soluble recombinant S2 protein in 2 M urea was used as antigen for immunization and immunoassays. The New Zealand White Rabbits, weighing 300-350 lg, were immunized by intrasplenic injection with the recombinant SARS S2 protein at 250 lg per immunization. The antigen in 0.5 ml PBS was emulsified with an equal volume of Titer Max adjuvant (CytRx, Norcross, GA). The rabbit antisera were used for most of the subsequent experiments without purification. We analyzed the titer of rabbit sera using Western blot assay for S2 protein antigen. In general, we could obtain high titer polyclonal antibodies after 6-8 weeks of immunization. The dot blot assays for synthetic HR-N and HR-C peptides were then tested using the well-prepared antisera. Synthetic HR-N (SN50), HR-C (SC40), and HR-N/HR-C were dropped onto a PVDF membrane, which was then blocked with skim milk and incubated for 16 h at 4°C with anti-S2 rabbit antisera diluted 1:2000-3000. Bound antibodies were detected by use of horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The target peptides were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) development system. Circular dichroism spectroscopy. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on the Aviv CD 202 spectrophotometer in PBS buffer. Wavelength spectra were recorded from 260 to 180 nm at 25°C using a 0.1 cm path-length cuvette. For thermodynamic stability, the HR-N/ HR-C complex protein was measured at 222 nm by monitoring the CD signal in the temperature ranging from 25 to 100°C with a scan rate of 2°C per minute. The spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (T m ) values was evaluated. Native PAGE. Equimolar mixtures of the HR-N and HR-C peptides (each 0.6 mM) were dissolved in PBS buffer (pH 7.2). The samples were prepared with HR-N and HR-C alone as well as HR-N/HR-C (1:10) and HR-N/HR-C (1:1) in a total volume of 30 ll. HR-N/HR-C mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After the addition of an equal volume of 5· N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine (Tricine) sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.004 g bromophenol blue) the mixture was analyzed by PAGE on 4-12% gradient Tricine gel with a Tricine/ glycine running buffer (pH 8.3). Crystallization. A 10 mg/ml stock solution of the HR-N/HR-C complex was prepared by dissolving the peptides with equal molar ratio in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Initial crystallization screening was performed using Hampton Research Crystal Screens (Laguna Niguel, CA, USA) with the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Crystallization drops were set up using the stock solution mixed with various reservoir solutions (1:1) and allowed to equilibrate at 300 K against the same reservoir in a 24-well plate. Data collection and analysis. Preliminary X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at cryogenic temperatures with an R-Axis IV ++ image-plate detector (Molecular Structure, The Woodlands, TX, USA) using CuKa radiation generated by a Rigaku MicroMax007 rotatinganode generator. Higher resolution data were collected using synchrotron radiation and an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD camera at BL12B2 Taiwan beam line at SPring-8, Japan. Data were processed using the software package of HKL. Molecular modeling. The sequences of two heptad regions between SARS-CoV and MHV were aligned by using the multiple sequence alignment program, CLUSTAL W. The sequences have 56% and 28% identity (66% and 54% similarity) in the aligned HR-N and HR-C regions, respectively. The 3D models of SARS-CoV HR-N and HR-C regions of Spike protein were generated with the MODELLER program [10] encoded in InsightII (Accelrys) using MHV fusion core (PDB code: 1WDF) as the template structure. The HR-N/HR-C was assembled into the six helix bundle according the MHV fusion core structure. The model of SARS-CoV fusion core was optimized with rigid peptide backbone and 1000 steps of conjugate gradient optimization were used for energy minimization. Several structural analysis softwares were adopted to check the model quality. The distribution of the backbone dihedral angles of the model was evaluated by the representation of Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK [11] . The PROSTAT module of InsightII was used to analyze the properties of bonds, angles, and torsions. Profile-3D program [12] was used to check the structure and sequence compatibility.
