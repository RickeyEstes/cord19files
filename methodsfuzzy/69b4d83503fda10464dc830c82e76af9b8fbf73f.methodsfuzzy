Demographic and clinical information were collected prospectively. Physicians were asked to specify a diagnosis on admission (i.e., reason for hospitalization) based on their clinical judgment. Diagnoses were classified to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; including cases of rhinitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, and croup), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI; including cases of bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia), or other admission diagnoses (including, among others, cases of febrile convulsions, fever of unknown origin, and gastroenteritis). Alere i RSV and RT-PCR testing. Frozen NPS samples were tested in parallel by Alere i RSV versus a CE-certified RT-PCR (Altona RealStar RSV PCR kit) as a gold standard. All NPS samples used in this study were thawed only once. For Alere i RSV testing, 200 l of universal transport medium containing the NPS sample was added to the sample receiver containing 2.5 ml elution buffer. Two 100-l volumes were transferred to the test base for isothermal amplification. For the Altona RealStar RSV PCR assay, viral RNA was extracted from 140 l universal transport medium containing the NPS sample in 560 l elution buffer using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted in a total volume of 60 l, of which 10 l was transferred to the Altona RealStar RSV PCR master mix. RT-PCR results with a C T value of Ï½35 were considered positive. Alere i RSV log files were analyzed to report amplification time of all RSV-positive samples and to examine samples with invalid test results. Samples with invalid test results due to any kind of Alere i RSV test handling failure were excluded from the analysis. In contrast, samples with an invalid test result due to sample interference were considered false negative if the RT-PCR result was positive and as false positive if the RT-PCR reference was negative. Possible reasons for invalid test results include inhibition of the amplification reaction or delayed amplification in samples with low viral load. Notably, the manufacturer recommends retesting of samples with invalid Alere i RSV results. However, as the volume of the respiratory samples used in our study was limited to 400 l, we were unable to follow this recommendation.
