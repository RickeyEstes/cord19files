It would require more than a whole textbook to introduce all of the genotypic methods currently in use in molecular epidemiology, and such a textbook would be outdated before it could be published. A short introduction to some widely used techniques and the ''alphabet soup'' of acronyms used for molecular methods is given here to facilitate reading of this and other texts. More comprehensive introductions to conventional and molecular techniques used in molecular epidemiology can be found elsewhere [1, 26] . Most comparative genotyping methods are based on modifications of two principles: the ''cutting'' (restriction) of specific points in the DNA by means of restriction enzymes or the amplification of specific parts of DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA fragments that are obtained through amplification, restriction, or combinations thereof have a negative charge and will move through an electrical field, with small pieces of DNA moving faster than large pieces, allowing for separation of the fragments. The separated fragments appear as a banding pattern or ''DNA fingerprint.'' Because it is difficult to standardize sample processing and gel electrophoresis completely, slight variations in patterns between runs or even within runs are difficult to avoid. As a result, comparison of isolates that are run on the same gel or in the same laboratory is useful, giving rise to the name ''comparative methods,'' whereas comparison of results between laboratories, studies, or countries is difficult. Even within studies, pattern interpretation can be debatable. One article that claims environmental transmission of E coli O157:H7 from a cow to a pasture and then to children shows riboprinting results as evidence that the cow shed the strain with which the children became infected [27] . Although these investigators interpret banding patterns as being the same, the authors interpret them as being different and as evidence that the cow was not the source of infection. This example demonstrates the ambiguity of banding pattern based strain characterization and the potential for conflicting interpretations. To overcome difficulties with interpretation of banding patterns generated by comparative methods, standard protocols for strain characterization have been developed and implemented (eg, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) [28] . Some commonly used comparative methods that are based on restriction (cutting) of DNA include restriction enzyme analysis (REA) or random fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and ribotyping. In REA, the microbial genome is digested with a restriction enzyme, and DNA fragments of different lengths are visible on a gel after electrophoresis. The term RFLP refers to the fact that there is polymorphism (differences between isolates) in the size and number of fragments that are generated. The number of fragments generated by REA is often so large that it can be difficult to interpret results. This problem is overcome in PFGE by the use of restriction enzymes that cut less frequently. As a result, fewer and larger DNA fragments are generated (Fig. 2 ). DNA fragments generated by PFGE are so large that they barely move through a gel unless their ability to move is enhanced by use of specialized equipment that uses changing electric fields or pulsed fields. The need for specialized equipment and training limits the availability of this method for diagnostic laboratories. Specialized equipment is also needed for automated ribotyping. Ribotyping is based on the enzymatic digestion of DNA, followed by capture of the digested fragments on a membrane, and detection of the fragments through hybridization of DNA probes to ribosomal genes in the fragments. The method can be used with or without automation. Automation and use of prefabricated reagents reduces run-to-run variability and contributes to ease of use and short turn-around times. Ribotyping increases standardization of typing results, allowing for comparison of typing results to libraries of banding patterns (Fig. 3) . It also increases the cost of strain typing. As a very rough rule of thumb, one could say that ''you get what you pay for'' with strain typing. Generally, higher discriminatory power, speed, standardization, and ease of use are associated with a higher cost. All of these factors, the availability of equipment and trained personnel, and most important, the epidemiologic question determine the suitability of a typing technique for any given situation [29, 30] . Many PCR-based methods are used in molecular epidemiology for DNA fingerprinting and in other applications. PCR can be used for diagnostic or epidemiologic applications and it is the goal and the context rather than the method that makes it a molecular diagnostic tool or a molecular epidemiologic tool. The primers used in PCR determine which complementary sequence in the target DNA is recognized and, hence, what characteristic is detected or which product is generated. The primers can be specific for bacterial species such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes in milk or beef [31, 32] . Primers can also be selected to detect virulence genes or antimicrobial resistance genes, which may or may not be species specific. PCR can be used to generate amplicons (copies of DNA fragments) for subsequent DNA sequencing. This process is the starting point for MLST and can be used to track horizontal transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes [33] or other virulence genes [34] . A plethora of PCR-based strain typing methods exists, ranging from random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing ( Fig. 4) , which is highly versatile and can be used for nearly all known bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens, to insertion element PCR assays that are used only for typing of a specific bacterial subspecies (eg, IS900 typing of Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis [MAP]) [1] . PCR can be performed with one set of primers at a time, also known as uniplex PCR, or with multiple primer sets in one reaction vial, known as multiplex PCR. PCR can be followed by gel electrophoresis for detection of PCR products or take place in ''real time,'' that is, with detection of PCR products while they are being generated in the PCR machine, usually by means of a fluorescence-based method. Restriction methods can be combined with PCR methods. PCR can be the first step, followed by restriction of the amplified product, as in hemolysin typing of Listeria monocytogenes [35] or PCR-RFLP of Cryptosporidium parvum [36] . Alternatively, restriction can be followed by PCR, as in amplified fragment length polymorphism typing. In this last method, the ends of the fragments that are generated by restriction (similar to RFLP) are recognized by PCR primers that subsequently amplify the fragments, resulting in a higher sensitivity of detection [1] . DNA sequencing has been used for more than a decade to study the molecular epidemiology of viral infections. For RNA viruses, use of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR; not to be confused with real-time PCR, which is also abbreviated RT-PCR) may be necessary. In this process, viral RNA is reverse transcribed into copy-DNA (cDNA), which is subsequently amplified by PCR. The method is used to trace the geographic origin of FMD outbreaks in cattle [37] and Newcastle disease (NCD) in poultry [38] ; to determine the transmission potential of avian influenza viruses that jump the species barrier from poultry to humans, and to identify the origin of newly emerged or emerging viruses including HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome [6] . In molecular epidemiology of bacterial diseases, the use of DNA sequencing was popularized by the introduction of MLST in the late 1990s. With MLST, isolates are identified by sequencing of multiple genes or loci in the organism's DNA (Fig. 5 ). In a narrow sense, MLST has been defined as the sequencing of 450 to 500 base pair fragments of seven housekeeping genes [39] . Housekeeping genes encode essential cell functions. Their DNA sequence is mostly highly conserved because any change in DNA or in the proteins encoded by the gene's DNA might be Fig. 5 . Producing and using DNA sequence data. Bacteria are grown in pure culture (left) to generate material for DNA isolation. Target DNA is amplified by PCR and detected (in this case) using gel electrophoresis (second from left). DNA is sequenced using a fluorescence-based detection system that generates electopherograms (center). Sequence data are aligned so that similarities (shown in red) and dissimilarities (shown in other colors) become visible (second from right). Dendrograms display the extent of similarity between sequences (right). This information can be used for species identification, MLST, and other applications. detrimental to the cell's survival. In a broader sense, MLST comprises any method that identifies strains based on sequencing of any type or number of loci, including virulence genes [34, 40] , hypervariable genes [41] , and stressresponse genes [42] . The DNA sequence of such genes is not highly conserved. On the contrary, changes in the DNA of virulence genes and in the proteins encoded by these genes may help an organism to adapt to adverse circumstances and may thus contribute to its survival. MLST is a library typing method, irrespective of the kind of gene that is included in the typing scheme. Databases with unambiguous strain typing results are accessible on-line (eg, http://www.mlst.net/ and http://pubmlst.org/) for a number of bacterial species [43] . The combination of MLST or other strain typing methods with the sequencing of virulence factor genes or antimicrobial resistance genes allows for the study of evolution of pathogenic strains (eg, shiga-toxin producing E coli [STEC]) [34] and the monitoring of the spread of antimicrobial resistance (eg, Salmonella) [33] . DNA sequencing of housekeeping genes can be used for species identification, especially when phenotypic methods for species identification are not fully reliable, as for example, in the case of enterococci of animal origin [44] .
