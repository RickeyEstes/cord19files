Different virus input and endpoints were assessed to identify an acceptable range for testing drugs in Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells (Tables 1 and 2 ). The same experimental plates from Fig 2A-2D were used for this analysis. The fluorescence S/N ratio was calculated using a Tecan plate reader, and the percentage of EBOV-positive cells was determined using HCI. For reproducible data, we determined that the percentage of EBOV-positive cells should be kept within a range of 10 to 80% and the S/N ratio at 4 to 10. At lower S/N ratios (<4) or lower percentage of infected cells (<10%) distinguishing activity of a drug from non-activity becomes increasingly difficult. On the other hand, at higher S/N ratios (>10), when cell infection rate trends towards 80-90% and cells overgrow at later time points, the risk of a disrupted cell layer is greater. Cell layer disruption increases the variability of the assay. Therefore, the optimization of assay conditions (i.e., duration of infection, virus input) was carefully calibrated resulting in a compromise between signal strength and cell viability. Based on the data obtained from Fig 2 and Tables 1 and 2 , two optimized conditions for the fluorescence assays were selected. An MOI of 1 with 48 hpi as endpoint and an MOI of 0.1 with an endpoint of 72 hpi produced a robust signal for all 3 cell types, Vero E6, Huh 7 and MDMs (Fig 2A-2F , Tables 1 and 2). Vero E6 cells were infected with EBOV at around 17.1%, and MDMs and Huh 7 cells usually had a stronger signal with around 80% or higher of EBOV-positive cells (Fig 2C-2F ). The two conditions had a similar signal or EBOV infection
