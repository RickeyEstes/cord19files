There have been various methodologies used to study human behavior during epidemics and these offer different perspectives on lay response patterns. One approach is to study historical accounts [21] [22] [23] . These are usually told from a single personÕs perspective on a groupÕs response. While conclusions drawn from these types of texts might lend themselves to a global picture of an epidemic situation, there are potential drawbacks to using these as a basis for our present day outbreak preparation efforts. For instance, the occurrence describes peo-pleÕs reactions during a different time period (not living in our current culture) and these texts might be biased towards the view of the author. Another method of understanding lay reaction is through questionnaires/ surveys following a real-life episode [24] or a simulation of an outbreak [25, 26] . These questionnaires use pre-defined categories leading to large amounts of data on select variables of interest (e.g., whether or not people believe they would follow quarantine restrictions). The questionnaires impose a pre-determined structure onto the respondent and force the respondent to reply using the investigatorsÕ categories. In our work, participants discuss events occurring during a recent outbreak that directly affected their life (occurring in close proximity to their home). A ''storybased'' interview allows data analysis of what information was obtained through the environment (e.g., media, web searches, rumors, and conversations with friends), reactions to the information, and the actions taken in the context of the participant who experienced it. These personal accounts, or narratives, of first-hand experience are a valuable source of data that can offer insight into a situation as it unfolded over time. By studying a sequence of events told as a retrospective narrative, an investigator can see how individuals temporally and causally link events (episodes) together. This approach falls under the qualitative paradigm and is referred to as narrative analysis [27] ; these methods have to do with the ''systematic interpretation of interpretation [28] .'' Narrative analysis is commonly used as a methodological tool in health psychology [29, 30] and anthropology [31] . Stories people tell are based on their mental representations of illness or ''learned internalized patterns of thought-feeling that mediate both the interpretation of ongoing experience and the reconstruction of memories'' [32] . Narratives tell us something about how individuals understand events and construct meaning out of a situation. Illnesses are often explained by reconstructing events in a cohesive story-like manner. For example, Garro [33] discusses how people talk about illness; they link their experiences from the past with present concerns and future possibilities.
