This was a prospective study in which 20 consecutive cats presenting with PE between March 2002 and September 2003 were enrolled. Fifteen cats were referred to the Royal Veterinary College, Queen Mother Hospital for Animals (QMHA) and five cats were seen in private practices. Inclusion criteria included the presence of PE, ability to collect a blood and a PE sample no more than 2 h apart from each other and determination of the aetiology of the PE. A complete history, including prior medical treatment, was obtained. Patients that received any pharmacological treatment, which could have altered the aetiological diagnosis prior to sampling (eg, glucorticoids), were excluded. Animals that received diuretics before presentation were included. A full physical examination and complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile were performed on each cat. Pleural fluid samples, collected by thoracocentesis in all cats, were divided into three aliquots and stored in K 3 -EDTA, plain and fluoride oxalate tubes. The serum and plain pleural fluid samples were centrifuged and separated within 30 min and processed within 48 h of collection. An automated cell count and a cytological examination by a board certified clinical pathologist were performed. All biochemical parameters from the blood and pleural fluid were measured with validated feline assays using an OpeRA Chemistry Analyzer (Bayer PLC, Berkshire, UK) at the QMHA. Thoracic radiographs were obtained from all cats. When PE volume precluded good thoracic radiological assessment they were repeated post-thoracocentesis. Further tests [eg, abdominal ultrasonography or radiography, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, serum total T 4 , feline leukaemia and feline immunodeficiency virus status (by rapid immunochromatographic method, Speed Duo FeLV/FIV, Vetlab Supplies, UK), feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody titre (by immunofluorescence as previously described)] 12 were performed as clinically indicated to achieve a definitive diagnosis. One cat underwent a full post-mortem examination. The cause of PE was identified with reference to the following pre-determined criteria: a. Congestive heart failure (CHF) as a cause of PE was diagnosed if the patient had appropriate history, presence of cardiac murmur, severe structural heart disease diagnosed on echocardiography by a board certified cardiologist, moderately to severe enlarged left atrium (left atrial to aortic diameter ratio of >1.5 on 2D echocardiography from the right-parasternal short-axis heart base view) 13 and/or right atrium and other causes of PE were excluded. In one cat a full post-mortem examination confirmed in vivo findings. b. Malignant effusion required histopathological or cytological demonstration of neoplastic tissue in the pleural cavity or fluid. c. Pyothorax required positive bacterial culture, or presence of degenerate neutrophils and intracellular bacteria on cytological preparations of pleural fluid. d. Chylous effusion was characterised based on colour (milky), turbidity (opaque), fluid triglycerides > 100 mg/dl, fluid to serum triglyceride ratio > 1, fluid to serum cholesterol ratio < 1, fluid cholesterol to triglyceride ratio < 1, protein concentration > 30.0 g/l and recognition of lymphocytes or neutrophils as the predominant effusion cell type. 14e16 e. PE secondary to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was diagnosed when supportive history, signalment, clinical and clinicopathological data including non-regenerative anaemia, lymphopenia, predominance of non-degenerate neutrophils on cytological examination of the effusion, serum and fluid total protein concentration > 80 g/l, serum and fluid globulin concentration > 50 g/l, serum and fluid albumin:globulin ratio < 0.45, serum and fluid FCoV antibody titres > 1:1280 and increased serum a-1 acid-glycoprotein were present and no other causes of PE could be identified. Effusions were then classified as transudates or exudates based on their pathophysiology. Transudates were the effusions from animals with CHF. Exudates were the effusions from animals with neoplasia, pyothorax and FIP. For the purposes of this study, chylous effusions were classified in accordance with human literature as exudates. 17, 18 Parameters measured or calculated included: Light's criteria (namely pleural fluid LDH (LDHp), pleural fluid/serum LDH ratio (LDHr) and pleural fluid/serum total protein ratio (TPr)), pleural fluid total protein (TPp), PE total nucleated cells count (TNCCp), pleural fluid cholesterol (CHOLp), pleural fluid/serum cholesterol ratio (CHOLr), serum-effusion cholesterol gradient (serum cholesterol concentration minus CHOLp) (CHOLg), pleural fluid glucose (GLUp) and pleural fluid red blood cells (RBCp). Due to the clinical instability of the cats and the difficulties in collecting the samples, without further compromise to the clinical status of the patients, not all the above tests were available for each animal (Table 1) . For comparison the same effusions were also classified using traditional veterinary method based on TPp and TNCCp (transudate: TPp < 25 g/l, TNC-Cp < 1500 ml; modified transudate: TPp Â¼ 25e75 g/l, TNCCp 1000e7000 ml; exudate TPp > 30 g/l, TNN-Cp > 7000 ml). 15 The modified transudate was considered, as first suggested by Perman, an effusion resultant from an increase in hydrostatic pressure. 8, 9  *Animals that received diuretics treatment before thoracocentesis.
