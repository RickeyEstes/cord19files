Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions All the strains used in this study (Data S1) derive from strains RB266, RB323 or RB324, which are derivatives of E. coli K12 MG1655 (84) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint regulatory regions (150bp upstream from the translation initiation site) of the SOS-regulated gene sulA. Resistant mutants additionally carry different chromosomal alleles conferring antibiotic resistance. The fluorescent constructions were generated by Lambda-Red recombineering (86) (87) (88) , followed by transference to a clean background by P1 transduction (89) , and subsequent transduction of the resistance alleles. The clean deletion of rnhA was constructed by markerless recombineering using a tetR-Ptet-ccdB-cat selection/counterselection cassette as described by Figueroa
