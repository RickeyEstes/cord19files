Duplicate measurements of plasma suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF were performed using a Luminex (Luminex corp. Austin, TX, USA) multiplex assay, as described in detail previously [21] . Margins of error for suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF measurements are 10%, 12% and 13%, respectively. PCT plasma concentrations were measured using an automated sandwich immunoassay based on the TRACE (time-resolved amplified cryptate emission) technique, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Kryptor; Brahms Diagnostica, Berlin-Henningsdorf, Germany). CRP was measured in plasma by standard densiometry (Vitros 950 IRC; Johnson & Johnson, Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Rochester, NY, USA). Margins of error for both the PCT and CRP assays are 10%. Blood leucocyte and neutrophil counts were measured using the Avida 120 device (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Margins of error for these measures were 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively. The principal investigator conducted the Luminex multiplex assay; the Kryptor assay was conducted by one laboratory technician; and the CRP and leucocyte assays were conducted by the hospital laboratory technicians who were on duty when patients were enrolled in the study. Before the study we chose to use cutoff values of 60 mg/l, 0.25 μg/l and 7.5 × 10 9 cells/l for CRP, PCT and neutrophils, respectively. The cutoffs were based on previously reported findings from cohorts similar to the present one [22] [23] [24] [25] . Optimal sTREM-1, suPAR, MIF, and three-marker and six-marker cutoff values were determined using Youdens Index [26] , because of a lack of reference literature. Laboratory parameters included in the Simplified Acute Physiology Scale II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were analyzed at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark and followed routine procedures.
