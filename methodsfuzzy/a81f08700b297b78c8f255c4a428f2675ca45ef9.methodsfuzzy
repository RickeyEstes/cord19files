NSP4 Synthetic Peptides. The NSP4 short peptide construct encompassing the viroporin domain (VPD, residues 47-90) was designed ( Fig. 1 ) and synthetic peptides of the wildtype (VPD-WT) and a mutant (VPD-Mut) were provided by LifeTein LLC. Peptides were provided lyophilized in aliquots of either 0.1 mg or 1 mg stored at −20 °C. Peptides were dissolved in either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent or water to achieve a stock concentration of 1-2 mg/ml. The DMSO-dissolved peptide was used within a week and stored at 4 °C, and water-dissolved peptide was stored at room temperature (RT). Water-dissolved samples stored at RT remained active for several months and reconstituted just as well as freshly dissolved peptide in DMSO. Chemicals. Asolectin (1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-2-phosphocholine Type II-S) was purchased from Sigma (Missouri, USA). All salts (KCl, MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , BaCl 2 , NaCl), Hepes, MOPS, K-EDTA, and sucrose were also obtained from Sigma with at least >99.0% purity. Hexadecane was obtained at TCI (Oregon, USA) and pentane (high purity solvent grade) from Burdik & Jackson (New Jersey, USA). DMSO was obtained from EMD Millipore (Massachusetts, USA). For giant unilamellar liposomes, 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabama, USA). Planar Lipid Bilayer Electrophysiology. The planar lipid bilayer electrophysiological technique used a Teflon chamber (made in-house at the University of Houston) where the two halves are separated by a 0.01 mm-thick polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) film (Goodfellows). Within the center of the Teflon film, an aperture of approximately 100 μm in diameter was created utilizing a High-Frequency Spark Tester PPM MK3 (Buckleys Ltd.) adjusted to 45 kV. In order to create a hydrophobic interface to attract lipids, the aperture was treated with a 1% hexadecane in pentane solution. One and a half mL of buffer T (1 M KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) or PA (150 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) was added to each half of the chamber. Five microliters of asolectin dissolved in pentane at a concentration of 5 mg/mL was added to the surface of the buffer on both sides. Ag/AgCl electrodes were then inserted into the buffer solutions. The chamber-electrode configuration was then allowed to equilibrate before formation of a lipid bilayer over the aperture. A membrane bilayer was formed over the aperture by lowering and raising the buffer level in one of the half-chambers and monitoring the resistance on the oscilloscope. A high resistance indicated that a bilayer had formed. A transmembrane voltage of + or −90 mV was then applied to check membrane stability for 10 minutes. This was also performed to ensure that there was no contaminating channel-like activity prior to the addition of channel-forming protein. If the stability test showed no contaminants and a stable baseline, then NSP4 peptide dissolved in DMSO or water (4.0-8.0 μg) was added to one half-chamber, defined as the cis side. A membrane potential of + or −90 mV and stirring of the cis side were typically used to promote insertion. Channel insertion was detected by the appearance of channel activity. Once channel activity was detected, stirring was stopped to limit further insertions. Proteoliposome Reconstitution for Patch-clamp. A dehydration-rehydration method was used to reconstitute NSP4-VPD into asolectin liposomes as described 10 . NSP4-VPD was dissolved in either DMSO or water at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, and added to giant multi-lamellar liposomes at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:2000 (w:w), prior to the centrifugation and dehydration steps. An alternative technique for liposome reconstitution (hereafter referred to as "the cloud method") was also performed 11 and modified for our use. Asolectin was dissolved in chloroform at a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL. Two hundred μL of this stock solution were added to a 0.5 mL DRAM glass vial and dried under a nitrogen stream to form a film along the inner walls of the DRAM. Liposomes were then allowed to swell into a 1 mL solution of 0.4 M sucrose in water while incubated at 45 °C on an orbital water-bath shaker at 150 RPM for 3 hours. Once a cloud of liposomes had formed within the sucrose solution, protein was added at the desired protein:lipid ratio and further incubated overnight with shaking as above. The protein:lipid ratio ranged between 1:20 and 1:200 (w:w) using NSP4 dissolved in either DMSO or water at a stock concentration of 2 mg/mL. DRAMs were then removed from the orbital shaker and chilled at 4 °C for 2 hours in order to stiffen the liposomes for patch-clamp. Three microliters of liposomes were taken from the liposome cloud and added directly to the patch-clamp bath chamber for patch-clamp experiments. Traditional Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology. The pore-forming activity of NSP4 peptide was investigated with the traditional patch-clamp technique, as described 10 . Micropipettes of ~10 ΜΩ resistance were pulled from glass capillaries with a P87 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with buffer A (150 mM KCl, 10 μM CaCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) or buffer BA (75 mM BaCl 2 , 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2). Reconstituted proteoliposomes were incubated in buffer B (buffer A + 20 mM MgCl 2 ) to induce swelling of unilamellar blisters from the liposomes for patch-clamp experiments. The pipette was immersed in the bath with constant positive pressure and micro-manipulated to contact the blister to achieve 1.0-10.0 GΩ seal. Patches were excised with brief exposure to the air and then re-immersed in the bath solution. This solution was then quickly exchanged for either buffer A, buffer BA, or buffer CA (75 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2). All potential offsets were canceled electronically in symmetric buffer A before data acquisition. The reference electrode (World Precision Instruments) was in contact with the bath solution via a 3 M KCl agar bridge. Control experiments performed on liposomes lacking reconstituted NSP4 showed no channel activity.
