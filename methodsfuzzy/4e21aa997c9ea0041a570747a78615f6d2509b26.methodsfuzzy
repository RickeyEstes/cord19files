2.1. Study design, sample collection and primary analyses ''Kalvpaketet'' is a service package offered to farmers by The Swedish Animal Health Services (Svenska Djurhälsovården AB, Sweden). The package includes sampling, laboratory analysis and advice for herds with diarrhoeal or respiratory disease problems in young calves. Samples are collected by veterinarians in the field and analysed at SVA, Uppsala, Sweden. Submissions can comprise up to five diarrhoeal samples or nasal swabs from diseased calves, and blood samples from up to five healthy 1-to 7-day-old calves. All faecal and blood samples sent via ''Kalvpaketet'' from herds asking for Cryptosporidium analysis from 30 March 2010 to 29 March 2012were included in this study. As soon as samples arrived at SVA, a questionnaire asking about calf management and the clinical picture of the calf diarrhoeal problems was sent to the farmer (Supplementary data S1). If a herd submitted samples more than once, a new questionnaire was sent if at least 1 month had passed since the last submission or if the farmer had not answered the previous questionnaire. ''Kalvpaketet'' referrals for diarrhoeal samples can include analysis of Cryptosporidium spp., Eimeria spp., Escherichia coli F5+, Salmonella spp., rotavirus and coronavirus (BCV). Giardia cannot be requested but is analysed together with Cryptosporidium spp., as the immunofluorescent stain used in routine diagnostics (Aqua-Glo™ G/C Direct, Waterborne, Inc., USA) identifies both pathogens. Blood samples from clinically healthy 1-to 7-day-old calves were analysed for serum total protein (TP) as a measure of passive transfer. The age of sampled calves should be noted on the referral.
