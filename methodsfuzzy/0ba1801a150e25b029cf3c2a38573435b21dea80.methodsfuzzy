Cross-linking reagent bis-maleido hexame (BMH; Pierce) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 20 mM solution. Virus-like particles were prepared in PBS and aliquoted at 20-ml fractions that mock-treated with 1 ml DMSO or treated with 1 ml of 20 mM BMH in DMSO. Reaction mixtures were vortexed gently and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2X sample buffer and 5% bmercaptoethanol and incubated at 45uC for 10 min prior to electrophoresis.
