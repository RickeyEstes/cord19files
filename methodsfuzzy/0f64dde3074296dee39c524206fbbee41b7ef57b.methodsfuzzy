Triton X-100 extracts were prepared from the gIII-positive IBRV(NG)dltk parental virus, as described (Kit et al., 1990a) , and diluted 1:1600 (as determined by a titration trial coating process) with KPL (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) coating buffer, which contains 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline. Then, 0.1 ml ahquots were added to wells of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 4"C, the supernatant fluids were removed, and 0.3 ml KPL blocking solution (which contains 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer) was added to each well, and the plates were further incubated overnight at 4°C. The supernatant was again dumped and the wells were rinsed three times with TEN buffer, (6.05 g Trizma, 0.38 g NazEDTA, 8.76 g NaCl in I liter of water adjusted to a pH of 7.2). The plates were then tapped dry and stored at -20°C (Kit, M. and Kit, S., 1991). Coating buffer was added to wells designated as blank wells, but IBRV antigen was omitted. Otherwise, the blank wells were processed in the same way as the other wells.
