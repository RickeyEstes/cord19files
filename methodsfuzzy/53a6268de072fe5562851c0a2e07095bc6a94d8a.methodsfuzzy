Our dependent variable is the number of daily incidences of stroke, with each hospitalization as a result of a cerebrovascular attack (CVA, ICD-9 code 430e437) being counted as one incidence of stroke. The data on strokes in Taiwan are obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) provided by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI). All personal identified were encrypted by the NHRI before release to the public. Because the NHIRD consists of de-identified secondary data released for research purposes, this study was exempt from full review by the institutional review board. Taiwan implemented its national health insurance (NHI) system in 1995, with the NHIRD containing records of all inpatient and outpatient treatment provided under the system since then. Our selection of NHI inpatient records as the health measure for use in the present study is based essentially upon merit. Firstly, as compared to the outpatient data provided by the NHRI, which are samplingbased, the inpatient records are population-based; thus, the use of inpatient data can help to avoid potential issues of sampling bias. Secondly, we select inpatient care over outpatient care because the former has lower demand elasticity than the latter; thus, hospitalizations are more likely to reflect actual changes in health status (Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, & Leibowitz, 1987; Ruhm, 2003) . One potential criticism of the use of morbidity, as opposed to mortality, as our health measure, is that individuals may choose to receive medical services during periods of economic expansion essentially because they have more disposable income, or during periods of recession as a result of the lower opportunity costs. However, this concern is greatly reduced in our study as a result of Taiwan's 1995 implementation of the NHI system, since this means that the cost of receiving medical services should not be a major concern. Our inpatient data covers the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2007, with the original sample providing a total of 2556 observations on daily CVA hospitalization records. There were approximately 230 cases of hospitalization daily attributable to CVA during the sample period. We find that the maximum number of daily CVA hospitalizations was 367 (occurring on 18 February 2002), whilst the minimum number during this period was 94 (occurring on 25 May 2003). For our empirical analysis, the CVA observations are also divided according to gender, age and region. Our key explanatory variables are based upon the stock price index, which is provided by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization-weighted Stock Index (TAIEX), with the data being obtained from the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) website. Two effects of the stock price index are examined in the present study, the first of which is the 'level' effect, whilst the second is the 'daily change' effect; we take the daily close index as the stock market price level, and measure the daily change in the stock index as the percentage change from the open index to the close index on that day. The stock price index level measures the overall macroeconomic status and serves as a proxy of the wealth level. The daily percentage change in stock price index captures the wealth variation in the short run. Previous studies have shown that the stock investors are engaged in short-term trading in some emerging markets. Using a complete individual-level stock trading dataset of Taiwan, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) find that day trading is prevalent in Taiwan e the percentage of day trade to all trades was 23.1% during their study period, 1995e1999. Moreover, they show that the average turnover in Taiwan Stock Exchange was 294% annually. In contrast, the annual turnover in the New York Stock Exchange was about 97%. The statistics indicates that short-term stock trading plays an important role in Taiwan. Thus, the daily effect of stock price change is included in our analysis. For those non-transaction days such as weekends and holidays, we set the close index value equal to the previous transaction close index value. It follows that the daily change of stock index for a nontransaction day is zero. Incidences of stroke are known to have seasonal patterns; indeed it has been documented that the stroke incidence rate is higher on cold days (Chen, Chang, & Su, 1995; Ricci et al., 1992; Sobel et al., 1987) . We therefore use dummy variables to control for the seasonal weather effects of different months. Furthermore, dayof-the-week dummies are also included in our analysis, since certain days of the week are also found to affect the stroke incidence rate, with some studies reporting that there were more occurrences of stroke on Mondays (Jakovljevic, 2004; Kelly-Hayes et al., 1995) although this feature was not found to carry over to groups of high socioeconomic status (Jakovljevic, 2004) . The outbreak of 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' (SARS) in 2003 was a significant event which occurred during our sample period, with the Department of Health announcing the first probable case of SARS in Taiwan on 26 April 2003. As the situation worsened, the Taipei Jen-Chi Hospital was temporarily closed down on 29 April 2003 as a result of hospital-acquired infections. Although the epidemic situation worsened still further in May 2003, it was subsequently brought under control by June, and on 5 July 2003, the World Health Organization removed Taiwan from the list of areas with recent SARS transmissions. Thus, we observe a substantial drop in the number of hospitalizations during this period, a situation which may be attributable to the general avoidance of visiting hospitals in order to reduce the likelihood of becoming infected with SARS. We therefore include a dummy variable to control for the SARS outbreak during this period. The following equation describes our estimation model, autoregression with exogenous variables (ARX): where CVA t is the number of hospitalizations attributable to strokes on date t. D it is the day-of-the-week dummies, with Monday representing the reference day, and M jt is the month dummies with January representing the reference month. SARS t is equal to 1 if the observation is within the SARS outbreak period (26 April 2003e5 July 2003), otherwise 0. We include autoregressive terms to control for residual autocorrelation and determine the number of lags, p, based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The lags of the daily change term may be included in the model since the impact on health may appear with time lag. We have estimated the models with three lags of the daily change effect. However, we only find limited significant coefficients in all estimations (pooled and subgroups). Moreover, the BIC prefers the model without the daily change lags in all cases. Therefore, we do not include the lags of the daily change effect. The empirical analysis in this study is performed under EViews 6. The summary statistics of all of the variables are presented in Table 1 .
