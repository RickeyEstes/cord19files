Constructs pET3a/ 6H BBP DM expression vector was modified from the plasmid pET3a-BBP described in a previous work [28] . The mutated BBP (BBP DM ) was generated with its four internal methionine residues replaced with alanine using the QuickChange Ò SDM kit (Stratagene) with the relevant primers. Additionally, a hexa-His tag was introduced at the N-terminus of BBP to facilitate purification. The forward and reverse primers used to amplify the target gene SARS-CoV E and IBV-E are as follows: SARS-CoV E (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_004718.3, protein ID NP_828854.1): forward primer 5 0 CAGGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTAT GTACTCATTCG3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 GAGGATCCTCAGACCAGA AGATCAGGAAC3 0 . IBV E (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_004718.3, protein ID AAU14251): forward primer 5 0 CAGGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTATGT TTAATTTATTCC3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 GAGGATCCTTAGATATCA TCCACCTCTAATAG 3 0 . Both forward and reverse primers contain BamHI restriction sites. Factor Xa cleavage sequence was introduced at the N-terminus of the genes. The amplified inserts were digested with BamHI and then ligated to the similarly digested pET3a/ 6H BBP DM expression vector. The identity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants of SARS-CoV E and IBV-E constructs at cysteine residues were generated using the QuickChange Ò SDM kit (Stratagene). In SARS-CoV E, three cysteine residues at position 40, 43 and 44 (represented by the first, second and third letters, respectively) were mutated to serine or alanine, generating triple Cys mutants (SSS and AAA). In IBV E, the two cysteine residues at positions 44 and 45 were mutated to Alanine, generating a doublecysteine mutant (AA).
