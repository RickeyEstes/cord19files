Production and assay of HAV 3C protease C24S, synthesis and testing of b-lactones and model compounds Experimental procedures for enzyme production and assay, as well as the syntheses of compounds 1-5 (Table 1) have been published 16 and were followed in the present study. Enzyme inhibition and HMQC NMR experiments were also carried out according to the procedures described in the same report. Model compound 6 was prepared using the literature method. 22 Preparation and crystallization of the complex of HAV 3C with N-Cbz-L-Ser-b-lactone (1a) HAV 3C protease variant C24S (100 ml of 0.12 mM solution in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.4), 30 mM NaCl) was mixed with 3 ml of 100 mM N-Cbz-L-Ser-b-lactone in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 3 mM and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was washed in a concentrator unit with 1 mM 1a in water until the NaCl concentration was reduced to below 5 mM and protein concentration increased to 10-12 mg/ml. During the crystallization setup (hanging drops), small aliquots (2-3 ml) of the protein solution containing 2.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 1.5% (v/v) glycerol and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) were equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir solution (5% PEG 8,000, 5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Before data collection, the crystals were rinsed with cryosolvent (30% glycerol, 5% PEG 8,000, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. To make the 3C-1a-IVF triple complex, pre-grown 3C-1a crystals were soaked in solution containing 5 mM IVF for at least 1 h before they were cryoprotected and flash-cooled for data collection.
