Ten specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats from Ciba-Geigy AG, Werk Stein, Sisseln, Switzerland, were housed in a specialized facility at the University of Zurich (group 1). They were intraperitoneally infected with FIV Z2 (Morikawa et al., 1991) at the age of 17 weeks (Lehmann et al., 1991) . By the time of the study, these cats had been FIV-positive for 6 years and 9 months, but were still clinically healthy (Hofmann- Lehmann et al., 1997) . Nine cats were kept under identical conditions as age-matched FIV-negative controls (group 2). FIV was monitored by detection of antibodies (recombinant TM-ELISA, Western blot) and by virus isolation from blood lymphocytes (Lutz et al., 1988; Calzolari et al., 1995) . In addition, the cats were checked for FeLV p27 antigen by sandwich ELISA (Lutz et al., 1983) , and for antibodies by immunofluorescence assay to the following viral infections as described: FCoV (Osterhaus et al., 1977) , FeSFV (Ko Èlbl and Lutz, 1992) , FCV and feline herpes virus (FHV) (Hofmann- Lehmann et al., 1996) . Antibodies to feline parvovirus (FPV) were also determined by immunofluorescence assay. To this end, CrFK cell monolayers were infected with CPV-2 kindly provided by Dr. Daniela Fehr, Veterinaria AG, Zurich, Switzerland. They were incubated until CPE reached about 50% of the cells. Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS twice and adjusted to 50 000 cells/ml in PBS. Slides were prepared as described for FCoV (Osterhaus et al., 1977) . Sera were tested at serial four-fold diluations starting at 1:25. The assay was evaluated with samples of 29 SPF cats, vaccinated twice against FPV (Vetamun Parvo, Veterinaria AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Samples taken before vaccination yielded titers of less than 25, while samples collected 3 weeks after the second vaccination produced titers up to 1600. Lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry in platelet-free whole blood as described (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997) . The cats were fed canned and dry cat food (Whiskas and Brekkies, Effems AG, Zug, Switzerland). For the present study, the cats were clinically examined and a complete dental inspection was performed. Examination of the cats was accomplished by one of us (M.B.) not knowing the FIVstatus of the animals. Cats never received any dental care before that moment. The dental examination was performed under general anesthesia of the cats. Each tooth was probed with a dental explorer, and a complete dental record was filled in for each cat. Special attention was focused to the occurrence of subgingival resorptive lesions and painfulness of these lesions, of hyperplastic gingival tissue, gingival granulation tissue and tartar, and to signs of inflammation or increased tendency of bleeding of the gingivae. Anatomical nomenclature of teeth was applied: I1±I3incisor tooth 1±3, Ccanine tooth, P2± P4premolar tooth 2±4, M1molar tooth 1, right side upper jawquadrant I, left side upper jawquadrant II, left side lower jawquadrant III, right side lower jawquadrant IV. In order to confirm the presence of FORL that were detected upon clinical examination, one cat underwent dental radiographs after euthanasia (which was necessary for other reasons). Frequencies of clinical observations and serological results were compared, using the two-sided Fisher's exact test. Numeric data were analyzed for significant differences with the non-parametric Mann±Whitney U-test. Differences were considered significant if p<0.05.
