The core structure of HIV-1 gp41 was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (1AIK). The sequence of spike protein was downloaded from GenBank (NP_828851). Liu et al. [1] found that the region 641-1247 of SARS-CoV S protein matches to conserved coronavirus S2 domain PF01601 in HMM database, which is subsequently used in the fold prediction of S2 subunit by 3D Jury meta predictor [6] . The proteins with significant high 3D score were used as templates to construct 3D models of S2 by MODELLER program [7] . The quality of 3D model was evaluated by PROQ program [8] and 'correct' models were chosen for structure comparison with gp41 by LGA program [9] . The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEIN-EXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).
