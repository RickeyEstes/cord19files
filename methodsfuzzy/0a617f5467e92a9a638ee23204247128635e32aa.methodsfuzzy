Consider brain tissue, O = [0, L] Ã— [0, L], with a tumor initially occupying a sphere, and astrocytes and ramified/activated microglia in the tumor microenvironment. A tumor cell either proliferates or migrates under certain biochemical conditions of miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle activation and biomechanical binding to ECM from LAR-CSGAG regulation in response to nutrients (oxygen and glucose) and CSPG ECM according to the reaction-diffusion model. While mechanical movement of the tumor cell, astrocytes, and microglia is governed by the cell-based mechanical model, their migration direction is influenced by random motility and chemotaxis. On the other hand, the dynamics in the reactiondiffusion model depend on individual-cell components. A schematic of the hybrid model is shown in Fig 2. The multi-scale hybrid model contains the following components: (1) intracellular signaling pathway of a tumor cell (miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle, LAR-CSGAG), (2) cell-based mechanical model (tumor cell, astrocytes, microglia), (3) reaction-diffusion model of extracellular biochemical players (oxygen, glucose, CSPG, Chase-ABC). In the next section, we introduce an intracellular model of cell proliferation and migration via miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle.
