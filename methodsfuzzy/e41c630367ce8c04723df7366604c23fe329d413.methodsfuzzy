Surveillance during the Hajj is a case-based surveillance. Data are collected from all hospitals located in the Hajj area. For example, during the 2012 Hajj season and due to the emergence of MERS-CoV a few weeks before the Hajj, 14 the KSA MoH utilized the case definition of MERS-CoV. The main objectives were the following: to monitor MERS-CoV closely during this mass gathering event, to detect any cases among pilgrims and local residents in a timely manner, and to collect information about the virus in the area in which the first case was located if this were to occur. Clinical samples were taken from all suspected cases during 2013 Hajj season and tested for all possible viral etiologies including MERS-CoV; all samples tested negative for MERS-CoV. 15 In addition, following the 2013 Hajj, a cohort of 129 French Hajj pilgrims were systematically sampled with nasal swabs prior to returning to France and were screened for MERS-CoV. The majority of them (90.7%) had respiratory symptoms and none tested positive for MERS-CoV. 16 Respiratory illnesses are common among pilgrims. The most common viral respiratory tract infections are influenza and rhinovirus. 17 The estimated incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) during the Hajj ranges from 20% to 80%, depending on the type of method used to confirm the diagnosis. 15 During the 2009 Hajj season, the emergence of pandemic H1N1 was of great concern. There was no increased risk of this virus during the Hajj season. 17 A cohort survey was conducted in collaboration between France and Saudi Arabia during the Hajj 2012. 18, 19 Participants were followed up and sampled before departing from France to the KSA, during their pilgrimage in the KSA, and just before leaving the KSA. 18, 19 Nasal swabs were collected from participants and tested for 11 respiratory viruses and four bacteria by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Of 165 participants who had nasal swabs collected before departing to the KSA, eight (4.8%) were positive for one virus or more, including rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, and 7.3% had Streptococcus pneumoniae. 18, 19 Among symptomatic pilgrims, 27 (38.6%) were positive for one or more viruses. 18 The rate of S. pneumoniae carriage was 7.1% in the country of origin and 19.5% before departing from the KSA. 19 These data indicate the risk of acquiring respiratory tract infections during the Hajj and the potential for the spread of the acquired organisms upon returning home. 18, 19
