2.1. Economic impact assessments of disease (and relevance of broad stakeholder engagement) The conventional scope of estimating economic impact of disease events in humans has often been limited to basic direct costs (health care) and limited indirect losses (e.g., wages not earned and informal health costs such as patient transport). Disease burden may be captured in health metrics (e.g., number of deaths or Disability-Adjusted Life Years). While meaningful for the health community, it is increasingly becoming evident that this limited scope of analysis does not provide a comprehensive view of economic consequence of disease events, including contagion avoidance behaviors, to inform decision-making by a wider range of stakeholders and connect to broader economic development agendas. Direct and indirect economic impacts of disease events are affected by disease preparedness and prevention (practices that mitigate risk), the event itself (e.g., business continuity, supply chain disruption, trade and travel bans, public contagion avoidance behavior), and the event aftermath (e.g., long-term employment loss, permanently closed markets or farms, long-term stigmas associated with specific animal products, impacts of childhood lost education or being orphaned, etc.). In 2016, the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine highlighted the importance of applying the societal perspective beyond only a health sector perspective when considering economic impacts of disease as well as potential interventions [6] . Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed an economic impact guide as a framework within which broader economic impact of diseases can be calculated [7] , and a proposed framework to analyze economic consequences of biothreats has been developed that examines broader impacts, including human behavior, speed of resilience, and the "fear factor" dynamic that may cause irrational behaviors aimed at disease avoidance [8] . These are preceded by an extensive body of work from the animal health sector that thinks of disease as an issue beyond the veterinary sector, emphasizing the need for assessing economic impacts throughout a system to be inclusive of also the costs of expenditure and reaction to a disease outbreak or disease presence in addition to direct costs (in the case of livestock, for example, accounting for not just production but also productivity, and costs that are 'invisible' and thus often unaccounted for, such as effects on herd structure from diminished calving rates, effects on market access, animal and human welfare, etc.) [9] [10] [11] Impacts may be incurred upstream or downstream; understanding these different implications can therefore help to determine total costs of diseases and optimize the net benefits of decisions taken for prevention and control [12, 13] . The World Bank has reported significant costs of diseases that occur at the human-animal-environment interface and necessitate a One Health approach, with a high global return value for investing in prevention through strengthening veterinary and human health capacity [14] . Taking multi-sectoral approaches to disease risk reduction and management can inform on possible economic outcomes (positive or negative) that may be incurred to any given sector(s) from various prevention and control strategies [15] . We illustrate cases where indirect impacts of infectious disease impacts have been significant. Though such impacts have been rarely appreciated to date, the recognition of nontraditional stakeholders in biological threat impact analysis advocates for their investment and involvement in risk assessment, preparedness, and/or intervention efforts. In particular, these can help inform stakeholders for inclusion in multi-sectoral national action plans for health security and similar budgeting processes that engage finance ministries and legislative bodies that can allocate resources to optimize 'whole-of-society' outcomes.
