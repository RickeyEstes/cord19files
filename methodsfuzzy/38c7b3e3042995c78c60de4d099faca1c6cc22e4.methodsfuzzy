Precipitation of macromolecular proteins such as viruses by high molecular weight polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG), pioneered by Yamamoto et al (1970) for bacteriophages, is an effective concentration method because the viruses are slowly precipitated in a cold, high-salt environment which protects them from chemical and physical denaturation. PEG precipitation is more gentle than physical concentration by ultracentrifugation or molecular sieve filtration. These are also done in the cold, but ulltracentrifugation often packs the virions so tightly, even atop sucrose cushions, that they cannot be resuspended without significant loss of virus, and ultrafiltration requires magnetic mixing to keep the filter cleared and loses a great deal of virus trapped in the filter itself. PEG is also more effective, in our hands, than ammonium sulfate precipitation, although the latter has been used with good results for astroviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses and many others (Ashley and Caul 1982; Tannock 1973; Wadey and Westaway 1981; Minor 1985) . The PEG precipitation procedure outlined below has been performed with good results for coronaviruses (Hierholzer 1976; Lanser and Howard 1980) , rhabdoviruses (Obijeski et al 1974) , parainfluenzaviruses (Hierholzer et al 1993) , respiratory syncytial virus (Anderson et al 1984; Cash et al 1977; Hierholzer et al 1994) , rubella virus (Fuccillo and Sever 1989) , and picornaviruses (Hasegawa and Inouye 1983; Hierholzer et al 1984
