Cells CEF cells and Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and Lglutamine (GIBCO BRL/Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). A20.2J murine B cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, Lglutamine and antibiotics. Plasmid DNA constructs and DNA preparation cDNA encoding SARS-CoV structural proteins were generated by reverse transcription of SARS-CoV HKU39849 (Accession No. AY278491) using superscriptII (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), followed by amplification using expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche diagnostics), as described previously (Ohnishi et al., 2005) . These DNA fragments encoding E, M, N and S proteins were cloned into the vaccinia virus transfer vector pDIsgptmH5, which also harbored E. coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, under control of a vaccinia virus p7.5 promoter in the cloning site of pUc/DIs (Ishii et al., 2002) , to generate pDIsSARS-E, pDIsSARS-M, pDIsSARS-N, and pDIsSARS-S, respectively. To construct transfer vectors to generate rDIs expressing E/M, E/M/S, or E/ M/N/S, DNA fragments encoding M, N and S proteins controlled by the mH5 promoter of the vaccinia virus (Wyatt et al., 1996) were inserted into pDIsSARS-E SmaI, NotI and SacI sites, respectively, thus generating pDIsSARS-E/M, pDIsSARS-E/M/S and pDIsSARS-E/M/N/S (Fig. 1) . A plasmid expressing S driven by the EF-1α promoter was constructed using pEF-BOS-bst (Yoshizawa et al., 2001) , and designated pEF-S-bst.
