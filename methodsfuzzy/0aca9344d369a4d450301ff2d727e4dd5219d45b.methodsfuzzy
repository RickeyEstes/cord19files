Research material obtained from Polish local rapeseed oil refinery was the diatomaceous spent bleaching earth waste (SBE 0 ), collected directly from filters after the refining of vegetable oils at fat processing plants, and the same waste being stored for 3 years (SBE 3 ) in two plastic screw top barrels, at a constant temperature of 20Â°C without aeration and moistening. From each barrel, three samples were collected from a depth of 30 cm. The initial waste (SBE 0 ) had the form of a loose, grease mass of yellow colour and characteristic oily odour. The stored SBE (SBE 3 ) had the form of a loose grey-brown mass with a characteristic odour of rancid fat. Determinations were made from averaged samples. Each measurement was repeated two times. If the results were significantly different, a third measurement was performed. The obtained results were analysed statistically, using analysis of variance and testing the factors with the Duncan's test with the use of Satistica 5.5 software (StatSoft).
