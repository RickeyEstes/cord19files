In silico VS uses computational models to describe macromolecule-ligand interactions. A multitude of methods exist for this purpose, which can mainly be categorized into 2D and 3D approaches. Descriptor-based methods (2D methods) rely on the calculation and comparison of scalar molecular properties and aim at identifying molecules that are similar with respect to their calculated molecular attributes. The selection and weighing of descriptors relevant for a certain target binding can be performed using machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks or by linear correlation of measured biological activity (quantitative structure-activity relationships, QSAR) with selected calculated descriptors. Recently, most computational approaches for the discovery of anti-viral compounds rely on 3D methods, which aim to describe the steric and chemical complementarity of the 3D conformations of a macromolecular target and the binding ligand ( Fig. 1 ). There are two approaches for developing 3D models: Either from (i) the experimentally determined 3D structure of a disease-relevant macromolecular biological target (structure-based design) or (ii) from a set of ligands, which are supposed to bind to the same target at the same location (ligand-based design). For structure-based design, Xray crystallography is the main source of information, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [4] is an excellent data source for such approaches. Ideally, the binding pocket location is already known, which is the case when a ligand is co-crystallized with the target structure. Ligand-based design, by contrast, is employed for those cases, where no structural information on the target is available. It requires a set of already known biologically active molecules, whose common binding location should be verified experimentally, for example, by mutational studies. This allows the search for novel potential ligands that show a similar 3D overlay either in terms of molecule volume (molecular shape) or in terms of chemical functions (such as hydrogen bond donors, acceptors, lipophilic areas or charges). 2D and 3D methods differ in terms of computational performance and applicability: 2D methods show substantially lower calculation times and therefore are mostly used as first classification filters to reduce the number of molecules to screen in later stages. Structure-based 3D approaches position the putatively active ligand in the relevant binding site and are therefore frequently able to provide ideas for further chemical optimization of the compound (lead optimization). Ligand-based 3D approaches show the same advantage to some extent, because an overlay to known active compounds is provided, which can help in analyzing aspects important for lead optimization. Protein-ligand docking is the most important structurebased 3D approach, which aims at predicting the binding mode of a ligand for a protein with known 3D structure, assuming the protein binding site to be mostly rigid and the ligand to be flexible. There are several docking tools available, which have been reviewed recently [5] . They differ in terms of algorithms used for ligand placement and scoring. These include ligand fragmentation and incremental reconstruction approaches (e.g. FlexX [6] ), algorithms based on molecular shape (e.g. DOCK [7] , FRED [8] ), genetic algorithms (e.g. GOLD [9] and AutoDock [10] ), systematic search (e.g. Glide [11] ), Monte Carlo optimization (e.g. LigandFit [12] ) and surface-based molecular similarity (e.g. Surflex [13] ). While ligand placement works reliably for sampling possible ligand binding geometries, scoring functions are not working dependably for all targets [14] , mainly due to the impossibility to estimate entropic effects correctly. Nevertheless, manually developed empirical scoring functions tailored for a defined application scope are still useful, and due to the visualization of a binding hypothesis docking remains one of the methods that provides many ideas for rational lead optimization. 3D pharmacophore modeling is based on the concept that a three-dimensional arrangement of chemical features (such as hydrogen bonds, charges, lipophilic areas) forms a pattern that describes the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule. The advantages of pharmacophore models are their easy interpretability and way of modification, which allows e220 researchers to incorporate their knowledge about a specific binding mode into a transparent, but still highly descriptive model. The careful arrangement of chemical feature markers in 3D space to search molecules that fulfill the required interactions is one of the most successful approaches of VS and has led to many success stories for retrospective explanation of ligand affinity and subsequently to prospective ligand design [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . While ligand-based pharmacophore creation has been introduced in the early days of molecular modeling, structure-based 3D pharmacophore design has been introduced more recently: The program LigandScout [21] [22] [23] derives pharmacophores from protein-ligand complexes, interprets ligand geometries, assigns correct hybridization states and applies a set of rules that classifies plausible protein-ligand interactions. For subsequent VS, a computationally efficient pattern-matching algorithm was implemented that allows for geometrically highly accurate VS. Other programs such as catalyst [24] , MOE [25] and phase [26] use cascading n-point pharmacophore fingerprints for pharmacophore-molecule superpositioning. The simplicity of 3D pharmacophore representations also means that the complete biophysical nature of drug interactions is not addressed. Understanding the limitations of this approach is essential for its successful application. Shape-based similarity screening is a purely ligand-based method, which allows searching for 3D analogs of a single compound. Despite its simplicity, it is a very powerful and frequently used filtering method due to its straightforward way of use. One of the most popular programs for shape-based search is ROCS [27] , which implements an algorithm based on Gaussian spheres to compare molecular volume. ROCS additionally uses a basic pharmacophore-like similarity scheme to include chemical information in their overlay results. All these methods have successfully been used for recent discovery of anti-viral compounds by screening different compound databases for compounds with previously unknown antiviral activity. In the following we will give an overview about success stories for the prospective discovery of antiviral compounds using rational drug design techniques and VS.
