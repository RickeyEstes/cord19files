The neural-network-based infectious disease screening radar system We redesigned our previously developed system 10,17 to improve its portability and stability. The main advantage of this portable system is that it can be used in confined spaces such as inside an aircraft. 18 The system consists of three biosensors, namely, a thermograph to monitor facial temperature (NEC/AVIO Infrared Technologies Co., Ltd., C-200, Japan), a 10-GHz microwave radar for the noncontact determination of the respiration rate 19 (new-JRC, NJR-4175, Japan), and a finger-tip photo-reflector to measure the heart rate (Rohm, RPR-220, Japan). All of the Figure 1 A pulse oximeter module was used to measure the SpO 2 levels. The respiration rate was measured using the 10-GHz respiration radar by monitoring the respiratory motion of the chest, the heart rate was measured by a finger-tip photoreflector, and the facial temperature was measured by means of thermography. The thermograph was placed 45 cm from the subject's face, and the respiration radar was placed 30 cm from the subject's chest. biosensors were integrated into a single instrument body measuring 27 cm long, 28 cm wide, and 10 cm thick. The system is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The signals from the biosensors are sent to a laptop computer, where they are analyzed and displayed in real time. The software environment was developed in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA) for recording the signals and in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for calculating the neural network based discriminant function. Within 10 s, the pulse waves, respiratory curves, and facial thermal image are displayed on the laptop screen. The screening results (i.e. '0 Z Non-influenza', '1 Z Lower-risk influenza', or '2 Z Higher-risk influenza') are obtained by the neural network and fuzzy clustering algorithm, based on the derived multiple vital signs (Fig. 2) .
