Animals. The study protocol was approved (Approval: R-2012-785-020) by the National Committee for [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Additionally Vero cells are endorsed by ISO experts to be suitable to test cytotoxicity of certain compounds and materials of medical devices 75 .The cell line was cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) of a mixture of 100 IU/mL penicillin/50 µg/mL streptomycin. For the cytotoxicity analysis, confluent logarithmic growth phase cultures were used after 10,000 cells/100 μL were seeded in each of the wells of Precision-cut hamster intestine slices preparation. The entire process was performed at 4 °C under sterile conditions, in the shortest time of surgical manipulation in order to minimize the autolysis of the intestinal tissue due to ischemia. Briefly: the hamsters received an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (64 mg/ 100 g of weight). Once in deep anesthesia, the colonic portion of the large intestine was carefully removed and divided into fragments of three centimeters long. These fragments were placed into Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KB buffer) at 4 °C, and were washed with the same buffer to remove the intestinal content, and then the superficial adipose tissue was carefully removed. Afterwards, the intestinal fragments were tied using surgical thread at one end, while on the opposite side was filled with low melting point agarose at 37 °C and placed in KB buffer at 4 °C for the agarose solidification. The fragments of intestine filled with agarose were placed in the tissue embedding unit of the Krumdieck tissue slicer in order to prepare regular agarose cylinders. These cylinders were placed in the sample holder of the Krumdieck tissue slicer, and intestinal tissue slices with thickness of 300-400 μm were prepared, always under constant recirculation of KB buffer at 4 °C gassed with carbogen (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ). The slices were collected in KB buffer at 4 °C to remove the external ring of agarose with aid of a spatula. Figure 1 shows general aspects of the process to prepare both intestinal and hepatic slices.
