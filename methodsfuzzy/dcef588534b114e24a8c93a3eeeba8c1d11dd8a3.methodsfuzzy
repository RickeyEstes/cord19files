Cell lines, plasmids and reagents HEK 293T/17 cells and human lung epithelial A549 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown as previously described [55] . Wild-type CHO cells and CHO-NPC1 2 cells, a gift from Dr. L. Liscum (Tufts University) [44] , were grown in Alpha-MEM (Quality Biological Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. The A549, MDCK, HeLaH1 and CHO cells stably expressing IFITM3 or IFITM1 were obtained by transducing with VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses encoding wild-type IFITM3 and IFITM1 or with the vector pQCXIP (Clontech) and selecting with puromycin, as described previously [2] . The pR8DEnv, BlaM-Vpr, pcRev, HIV-1 Gag-iCherryDEnv and pMDG VSV G expression vectors were described previously [37, 55] . The YFP-Vpr was a gift from Dr. T. Hope (Northwestern University). The pCAGGS vectors encoding influenza H1N1 WSN HA and NA were provided by Donna Tscerne and Peter Palese, and the pCAGGS BlaM1 (WSN) plasmid was a gift from Dr. A. Garcia-Sastre (Mount Sinai). Vectors expressing phCMV-GPc Lassa and pcDNA3.1-Ebola GP (Zaire) were gifts from Dr. F.-L. Cosset (Universit√© de Lyon, France) [56] and Dr. L. Rong (University of Illinois) [57] , respectively. U18666A was from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Poly-Llysine, filipin, sulphorhodamine B Bafilomycin A1 and the Cholesterol Kit were from Sigma-Aldrich. AlexaFluor-488 amine-reactive carboxylic acid, vybrant-DiD (vDiD, 1,19-dioctadecyl-3,3,39,39-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt), Hoechst-33342 and Live Cell Imaging buffer were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). CypHer5E Mono NHS Ester was from GE Healthcare (Pittsburgh, PA). Antibodies used were rabbit anti-IFITM3 (to N-terminus) from Abgent (San Diego, CA), mouse anti-IAV-NP and goat anti-IAVpolyclonal antibodies from Millipore (Billerica, MA), rat antimouse-IgG-FITC from eBioscience (San Diego, CA), and goat anti-rabbit-Cy5 from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA).
