One ml of plasma was centrifuged at 5,0006g at 4uC for 5 min with subsequent filtration of the supernatant through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove residual host cells. Viral RNA was isolated using the Qiagen QIAamp MinElute virus spin kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that carrier RNA was omitted. The eluted RNA was treated with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and double stranded DNA was generated using the Superscript double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) primed with random hexamers. DNA was purified using the Agencourt Ampure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and approximately 1 ng of DNA was subjected to simultaneous fragmentation and adaptor ligation (''tagmentation'') with the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit (Roche Titanium-compatible, Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). DNA was subsequently cleaned using the Agencourt Ampure XP system, briefly PCR amplified with primers to add Roche/454 titanium-based adaptors onto each fragment (15 cycles) , and cleaned again with the Agencourt Ampure XP system. DNA fragments were then sequenced using the GS Junior pyrosequencing system (Roche 454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). To analyze pyrosequencing data, raw sequences were first screened to remove redundancy using Galaxy software (http:// usegalaxy.org). The remaining reads were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark), trimmed to remove Nextera-specific transposon sequences as well as short and low quality reads, and assembled using the CLC de novo assembler. Both singleton and assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) were queried against the GenBank database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank) using the basic local alignment search tools blastn and blastx [12] , with an e-value cut-off of 10 and word sizes of 11 and 3 for blastn and blastx queries, respectively. Once initial non-host contigs were assembled, a short sequence gap between two aligned fragments was filled by conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. Briefly, PCR amplicons were generated with the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with specific primers designed based on pyrosequence data. Thermocycling conditions included cDNA synthesis at 50uC for 30 min and denaturation at 95uC for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94uC for 2 min, annealing at 55uC for 30 s, and extension at 68uC for 1 min. A similar sequence gap at the 39 terminal open reading frame of one contig was filled by 39 RACE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis with an oligo(dT)-containing adaptor primer was performed at 42uC for 50 min, followed by amplification of the target cDNA with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a specific primer designed based on pyrosequencing data as well as the abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP) (59 GGCCAGGCGTCGACTAGTAC). Thermocycling conditions included an enzyme activation step of 3 min at 94uC followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94uC for 30 s, annealing at 55uC for 30 s, and extension at 72uC for 1 min. Specific primer sequences are available upon request. Amplification products were run on 1% agarose gels, purified (MinElute, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and directly sequenced with the DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) on an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
