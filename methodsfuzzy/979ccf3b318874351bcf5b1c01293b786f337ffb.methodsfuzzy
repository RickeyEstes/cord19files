Attribution is the primary goal in microbial forensics by comparison of data obtained from evidentiary samples to reference samples. Both biological and non-biological signatures can be sought for attribution, investigative leads, or exclusionary purposes. Microbial forensic evidence may reside in a wide range of samples matrices, including food, water, air filters, swab and swipes, soil, animal tissue, and clinical samples (e.g., tissue, sputum, blood, stool, urine). Therefore, an analyst must have a variety of sample processing methods available to address the demands of myriad possible samples and scenarios, and methods need to be as robust as possible. In addition, traditional forensic evidence, such as fingerprints, human or animal DNA, and fibers and hair can be analyzed. So the analyst must consider collecting and analyzing evidence in a manner that preserves other forms of evidence beyond those of the purview of microbial forensics. Detection methods in the microbial forensic workflow can range from culture, microscopy, immunoassays, mass spectrometry, real-time PCR, microarray, genetic typing, whole-genome sequencing, and beyond. While the focus of this chapter is on genetic signatures for biological threat agent identification, non-biological signatures, such as those that infer the culture method used, manufacturing processes, time of production, and methods of dissemination can be quite informative for developing investigative leads Velsko, 2011. For example, non-biological signatures pertaining to silica, growth media, and purity indicated that the anthrax spores in the 2001 attack were not weaponized in a sophisticated manner and likely were cultured from at least two batches, providing investigative value National Research Council, 2011. In addition, biological evidence other than genetic signatures of threat agents, such as host immune response, can provide invaluable information for investigative leads regarding if a suspected perpetrator took prophylactic antibiotics or other antidotal substances, inferring the handling, manufacture, or possession of a biothreat agent Schutzer, 2011. Culture is still considered the gold standard for pathogen detection Peters et al., 2004 . However, culturing cannot provide resolution, many times beyond the genus or species level, and because there can be a substantial lag time due to growth requirements of the microorganism, it may not be efficient for response especially when the safety of individuals is an immediate concern. Moreover, about 99% of microorganisms cannot be cultured by current methods; therefore culturing is not a reliable method for fastidious and possibly novel/uncharacterized microorganisms. In addition, the microbes may have been Figure 1 General schematic approach to epidemiological and microbial forensic investigations. exposed to environmental insults and may no longer be viable. So even if the microorganism was one of the few that could be cultured, no information would be obtained if it were nonviable. Ideally, attribution seeks characterization of biological threat agents with resolution at the strain/isolate level. While culture and immunoassays are sufficient methods for initial testing and sample screening, nucleic acid typing often is more resolving. MLVA (multi-locus variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis) analyzes polymorphisms found in minisatellite regions within bacterial genomes and has been shown to be effective at discriminating among strains of highly monomorphic species, such as B. anthracis Keim et al., 2000; Keim et al., 2004 and Yersinia pestis Klevytska et al., 2001; Pourcel et al., 2004 . MLVA was the method used to identify the Sterne strain used in the Aum Shinrikyo Anthrax release Keim et al., 2001 and the Ames strain used in the Amerithrax attack Keim et al., 2011 . This level of characterization, although not sufficient for individualization of isolates obtained from evidence, did provide a good investigative lead, as the Ames strain is not typically found in nature and is far more prevalent as a laboratory strain Keim et al., 2004; Keim et al., 2011 . Since these genetic markers cannot resolve at the isolate level, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and other genetic signatures are sought for better attribution. One approach for SNP marker detection is use of microarrays, which consist of potentially large numbers of short oligonucleotide probes on a solid support. Microarrays, which can be highly efficient screening and characterization tools, have been developed specifically for bacterial and viral detection, and can achieve species to strain level identification Gardner et al., 2010; Leski et al., 2009 . However, at the isolate level the variant sites, if they exist, on the genome are unknown and may not be detected with an a priori array design. An unbiased more comprehensive genome scanning method is needed to extract the most resolving information possible. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) is one approach that may be able to identify those species/strain/isolate markers that would enable better attribution. WGSS is a sequencing approach which does not require any prior knowledge of the sequence being determined. Because WGSS is unbiased in its identification of markers, it can provide the capability to detect any number of genetic markers, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, duplications, genome rearrangement, virulence genes, pathogenicity islands, plasmids, horizontally transferred elements, and evidence of genetic engineering. Initially, WGSS was performed using Sanger sequencing Sanger et al., 1977 . This approach requires the use of cloning vectors, has relatively low-throughput, is time consuming and rather expensive. WGSS was performed to attempt to characterize different isolates of the Ames strain including an isolate from the first known victim of the 2001 anthrax attack Read et al., 2002;  however no genetic differences were observed between the evidence and reference samples. It was not until the astute discovery of late-forming spore morphology variants by a microbiologist that a potential distinguishing characteristic could be exploited for attribution purposes Keim et al., 2011 . Pure cultures of some of the morphology variants were prepared and sequenced enabling detection of genetic variants specific to each morphology variant Keim et al., 2011 . Sequencing many samples was cost-prohibitive as it cost on average approximately $140,000 to perform WGSS on a single sample in Cummings & Relman, 2002 . Therefore, based on genetic data from a limited number of sequenced samples, real-time PCR assays were developed to detect these different genetic signatures of the variants Keim et al., 2011 . These PCR-based assays, being easier to perform and far less costly, were used to screen over a thousand (N Â¼ 1077) repository samples collected from laboratories inside and outside the US housing the Ames strain Keim et al., 2011 . The results eliminated the vast majority of Ames samples collected and strongly indicated an association to a flask containing B. anthracis, known as RMR1029, at the USAMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases) Keim et al., 2011; National Research Council, 2011 . This flask contained a mixture of the same colony morphology variants as was seen in the Amerithrax evidence Keim et al., 2011; National Research Council, 2011 . While real-time PCR enabled analysis of a large number of evidentiary samples, the approach was limited to only the few variants that the assay was designed to detect. Therefore, any other variants that may have existed within the approximately 5 million bases of the B. anthracis genome would go undetected with such a focused assay. This inability to scan the entire genome in a single assay was a limitation of the technology just a decade ago. Today, identifying genetic signatures and typing a large number of samples are more feasible with next-generation sequencing technologies.
