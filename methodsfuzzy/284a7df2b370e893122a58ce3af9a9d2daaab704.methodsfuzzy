Chemicals X-gal, nocodazole, vincristine, PYR-41, and MG132 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo) and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). AraC (Sigma) was dissolved in sterile water. Recombinant IFN-α solution was from Sigma. X-glu (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was dissolved in DMSO. Compounds were diluted to their final concentration in cell culture medium or in a 1:1 mixture of 2 × Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 1.7% agar (X-gal; X-glu) immediately prior to use. Recombinant viruses were generated using previously described methods (Gammon et al., 2010) . Briefly, BSC-40 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well dishes and then infected for 1 hr with the appropriate VACV strain (see below) at a MOI of 2 in 0.5 ml of PBS. The cells were then transfected with 2 µg of linearized plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opt-MEM media (Invitrogen). The cells were returned to the incubator for another 5 hr, the transfection solution was replaced with 2 ml of fresh growth medium, and the cells were cultured for 24-48 hr at 37°C. Virus progeny were released by freeze-thawing, and the virus titer was determined on BSC-40 cells. To identify recombinant virus, plaques were stained with X-gal or X-glu (both at 0.4 mg/ml) in solid growth media. PCR was used to confirm insertions/deletions in the resulting recombinant viruses. ΔA51R, ΔA51R FREV , ΔA51R/ΔJ2R, ΔA51R/ΔJ2R FA51R , and ΔA51R/ΔJ2R FMVAA51R strain construction The plasmid pZIPPY-NEO/GUS (Dvoracek and Shors, 2003) was used to clone an ∼500 bp PCR product (using primers: 5′-ACTAGTCGAACCGGGAAAGAGAAGAT-3′ & 5′-AAGCTTGTATGTAACTATTAA GATTT-3′) containing sequences flanking the 'A50R' side of the A51R locus as well as an ∼520 bp PCR product (using primers: 5′-CCGCGGATTAAGATTGCTCTTTCGGT-3′ & 5′-AGATCTTAAAGTTATCT GCTCCCTCT-3′) containing sequences flanking the 'A52R' side of the A51R locus. The 500 bp PCR fragment was cloned into pZIPPY-NEO/GUS using SpeI and HindIII restriction sites and the 520 bp PCR fragment was cloned into the resulting vector using SacII and BglII restriction sites. Rescue of this vector (now called pZIPPY-A50R H +A52R H ) leads to the deletion of nts 157628-158568 in the VACV-WR genome (GenBank accession: NC_006998). The deleted region is replaced by a p7.5-promoted neomycin resistance (neo) gene as well as a bacterial gusA gene under the control of a modified H5 promoter. To generate the ΔA51R strain, pZIPPY-A50R H +A52R H DNA was transfected into cells infected with VACV-WR and recombinant viruses were selected by blue coloration in the presence of X-glu. A ΔA51R revertant strain (ΔA51R FREV ) was constructed by rescue of a plasmid (synthesized by Invitrogen) encoding an N-terminal Flag-tagged A51R gene flanked on either side by ∼500 bp of VACV-WR sequence. Rescue of this plasmid (pA51RFREV) into the ΔA51R background introduces the Flag-A51R gene into the A51R locus, placing it under the natural A51R promoter. Selecting clear plaques in the presence of X-glu led to the isolation of these revertant viruses. To generate the ΔA51R/ΔJ2R strain, the previously described transfer vector, pSC66 (Gammon et al., 2010) was used to insertionally-inactivate the J2R locus. This pSC66 vector was also used to introduce a codon-optimized (see below), Flag-A51R gene into the J2R locus of the ΔA51R strain, creating the ΔA51R/ΔJ2R FA51R strain. Similarly, pSC66 was also used to transfer a codon-optimized (see below), Flag-A51R gene from VACV-MVA into the J2R locus, generating the ΔA51R/ΔJ2R FMVAA51R strain. Recombinant viruses were selected in the presence of X-gal as previously described (Gammon et al., 2010) . All virus strains were plaque-purified a minimum of three times in BSC-40 cells and were analyzed by PCR and sequence analysis to confirm deletion/insertions (data not shown).
