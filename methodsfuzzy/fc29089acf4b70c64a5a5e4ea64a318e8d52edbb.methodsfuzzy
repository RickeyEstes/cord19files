Cell culture and transfection MALME-3M melanoma (ATTC# HTB-64) and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma (ATTC#HTB-22) cells were cultured in growth media containing RPMI-1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine, following a standard 3 T3 protocol (Todaro & Green 1963) . Albumin-associated lipids were obtained by adding GIBCO TM AlbuMAX II from Invitrogen at a concentration of 1.6% w/v in RPMI media containing 10% FBS. To induce cell transdifferentiation, cells were cultured with albumin-associated lipids, whereas mock-treated cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS. After 24 hours cells were trypsinized, collected in plastic tubes and centrifuged at 5000 rpm. CLTC-targeted siRNA and scrambled siRNA (control siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon (Dharmacon RNA i Technologies). Sequences from CLTC-targeted siRNA and control siRNA were commercially provided. Cells were seeded according to the manufacturer's protocol in serum-containing media without antibiotics and transfected with either 50 nM siRNA or 50 nM control siRNA with DharmaFECT (Dharmacon RNA i Technologies) in antibiotic-free media for 72 h.
