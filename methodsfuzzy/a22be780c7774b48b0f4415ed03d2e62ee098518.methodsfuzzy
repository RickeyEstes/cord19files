After the removal of constant descriptors, multilinear regressions (MLR) were built with Weka 3.6.5 [57] [58] [59] to select descriptors by the M5 method, using the training set. In accordance with this preliminary work, 232 descriptors were selected from CDK collection. In the quest for QSAR classification models with the minimum possible number of descriptors, feature selection was further performed with the CFS (Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection) algorithm [60] implemented in Weka 3.6.5. This heuristic takes into account the usefulness of individual descriptors for predicting the activitiy (i.e., overall biological, antitumor, or antibiotic) together with the level of intercorrelation among them. The experiments for comparing the descriptors for each one of three models were conducted with the AttributeSelectedClassifier routine of Weka with the CfsSubsetEval option as descriptor evaluator and the BestFirst or GreedyStepwise option as search method. This procedure selects descriptors with the CFS algorithm within a ten-fold cross-validation procedure and k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm as ML technique.
