Reagents and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) and were used without further purification. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica Gel 60F254 pre-coated plates. Preparative HPLC was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (19 Â 100 mm; Sun-Fire Prep C18 OBDÔ, 5 mm) with a binary solvent system: a linear gradient of CH 3 CN in 0.1% aqueous TFA at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. Compounds were detected at 254 nm and 230 nm. All solvents used for HPLC were HPLC-grade. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL 400 MHz spectrometer, a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer (300 MHz), or a BRUKER AV600 spectrometer (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Chemical shifts (d) are expressed in ppm using solvent as an internal standard. The multiplicities of the resonance peaks are indicated as singlet (s), broad singlet (bs), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), and multiplet (m). The J values are given in Hz, and the relative number of protons was determined by integration. The solvent used for each spectrum is reported. High-resolution mass spectra (ESI or EI) were recorded on a micromass Q-Tof Ultima API or a JEOL JMS-GCmate BU-20 spectrometer. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on LCMS-2010EV (SHIMADZU).
