The study was conducted at a 350-bed general hospital, which also accepts referred patients. The hospital provides medical care for about 160,000 individuals eligible for medical care. The hospital has 5 intensive care units (cardiac, medical, surgical, pediatric, and neonatal) [22] . All admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia from suspected MERS-CoV was an acute febrile respiratory illness (fever, cough, or dyspnea) with radiographic evidence of pneumonia [22] . We collected data for all suspected patients using a standard Microsoft Excel data collection sheet. Both electronic and paper medical records were reviewed. We recorded the age and the date of admission and the MERS-CoV and influenza results. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare Institutional Review Board (IRB).
