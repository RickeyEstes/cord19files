After obtaining the ethical approval, we retrospectively reviewed charts of 387 patients with cystic fibrosis of all age groups who were screened for detection of viruses during respiratory exacerbation from January 1, 1984 to June 1, 2016. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory viruses were extracted and analyzed according to the standard method [10, 11] . Multiplex PCR test for the detection of respiratory viruses and bacterial cultures were collected and processed according to standard methodology. Samples were collected following standard hospital precautions [9e11]. The T-Test was used to calculate the continuous variables, median, mean, and standard deviation. All values were expressed in mean Â± standard deviation (SD), and the results were presented at a level of significance of P < .05. 2.6. Method used to assess lung capacity PFT was done according to standard procedure. FEV1 more than 70 is considered mild, between 60 and 69 is moderate, between 50 and 59 is moderately severe, between 35 and 49 is severe, and less than 35 is very severe [15] .
