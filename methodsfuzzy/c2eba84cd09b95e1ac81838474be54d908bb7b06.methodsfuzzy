Virus. The Vero E6 cell line was used for propagation of SARS-CoV (Frankfurt-1 strain) [20] . Vero E6 cells were maintained in MEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ICN Flow), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL) (complete medium), and passaged every 3 days. The inoculum of SARS-CoV was the culture medium from infected Vero E6 cells collected at 3 days post-infection and filtered through a cell strainer to remove cell debris, and then stored at À80°C. The virus titers were determined in 96-well microplates with Vero E6 cells as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50 /ml using KarberÕs method [21] . Infection with SARS-CoV. In addition to Vero E6, the following cell lines were examined for infection by SARS-CoV: human oligodendroglioma-derived cell line OL [22] which was generated at the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, USA [23] ; rat glioma-derived cell line C6 [24] ; human intestine-derived cell line CaCo-2; canine kidney-derived cell line MDCK; rabbit kidney-derived cell line RK13. All these cells were similarly infected with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. After adsorption for 1 h, the cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. For reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect SARS-CoV genome RNA, total RNA was extracted from infected cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was reverse-transcribed with Super-Script III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the primer 5 0 -TCTTGATGGATCTGGGTAAGGC-3 0 (complementary to nucleotides 15, 878 in open reading frame 1ab). The cDNA was amplified from the viral genomic RNA with ExTaq (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) using primers 5 0 -GAATCCTGACATCTTACGCG-3 0 (nucleotides 13,871-13,890) and 5 0 -TGTTAGGCATGGCTCTGTCA-3 0 (nucleotides 15, 236) . For the detection of mRNA for SARS-CoV S protein, cDNAs prepared as described above with oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) were amplified using primers 5 0 -GGAAAAGCC AACCAACCTCGATCTC-3 0 (nucleotides 23-47, corresponding to the common leader sequence) and 5 0 -ACTACATCTATAGGTTGA TAGCCCT-3 0 (nucleotides 22,084-22,108). For detection of the mRNA for N protein, the same cDNAs were amplified using the same leader primer and the primer 5 0 -AGGAAGTTGTAGCACGGTGGC AGC-3 0 (nucleotides 28,585-28,608). The primers were prepared according to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV reported previously [25] . For RT-PCR to detect mRNA of ACE2, total RNA was extracted from uninfected cells with TRIzol. The cDNAs prepared with oligo(dT) primer from Vero E6, CaCo-2, and OL cells of human and monkey origins were amplified using forward primer (5 0 -ATGTC AAGCTCTTCCTGGCTCCTTC-3 0 ) and reverse primer (5 0 -CTA AAAGGAGGTCTGAACATCATCAG-3 0 ) for human ACE2 (Accession No. NM_021804). The cDNAs prepared from C6 of rat origin with oligo(dT) primer were amplified using forward primer (5 0 -ATGTCAAGCTCCTGCTGGCTCCTTC-3 0 ) and reverse primer (5 0 -TTAGAATGAAGTTTGAGCATCATCAC-3 0 ) for rat ACE2 (Accession No. NM_001012006). As a control for the input RNA, levels of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) were also assayed using forward primer 5 0 -ACC ACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -TCCAC-CACC CTGTTGCTGTA-3 0 . The intensity of each band was quantified with NIH image software. Antibodies specific to SARS-CoV. Murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3A2 recognizing SARS-CoV S protein was obtained by immunizing mice with SARS-CoV particles that were purified by centrifugation of the conditioned media of infected Vero E6 cells collected at 3 days post-infection through 20% (w/v) sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In addition, the following anti-SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) were purchased: rabbit PAb to the Nterminus region of SARS-CoV S protein (Cat. No. AP6009b; AB-GENT, San Diego, USA) and rabbit PAb to the C-terminus region of SARS-CoV N protein (Cat. No. AP6005b; ABGENT). Immunofluorescence (IF). The infected cells were trypsinized, and the resulting single cells were smeared and then fixed with cold acetone. The fixed cells were reacted with murine MAb 3A2, then with the second antibody, fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, USA). Membrane IF and flow cytometry for ACE2. For membrane IF and flow cytometry, the unfixed cells were reacted with anti-ACE2 PAb (anti-human ACE2 ectodomain antibody; Research and Diagnostic Systems) followed by second antibody, then subjected to IF microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE E-600) and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton-Dickinson). Western blotting. Uninfected or infected cells were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer and the resulting samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then Western blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, USA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV S and N PAbs. As a control, the membrane was incubated with murine MAb to a-tubulin (Sigma; clone B-5-1-2). After washing with PBST, the membranes were reacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated second antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), respectively.
