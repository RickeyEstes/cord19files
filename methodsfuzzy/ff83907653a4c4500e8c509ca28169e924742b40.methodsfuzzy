The only region of CENP-B capable of localizing the protein to the centromere was that contained in the first 158 amino acids as defined by pCNPBl-158. Deletions that removed 28, 35, 47, 200, 464, and 500 amino acids from the amino terminus of CENRB abolished the ability of the protein to assemble at chromosomal centromeres but did not prevent these proteins from accumulating in the nucleus (data not shown) . All of these constructs produced proteins consistent with the expected sizes when total protein isolated from transfected cells was subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig . 6 B) . We have examined the distribution of protein encoded by the smallest amino-terminal deletion (pCNPB28-599 ; Fig .  1 C) in the greatest detail . This construct deletes ti5% of Figure 5 Chromosome spreads showing the ability of the amino-terminal domain of CENRB to localize an exogenous protein to centromeres . Cells transfected with pCNPBl-158TRPE were spread after methanol/acetic acid fixation and stained with the antibody to the El tag using a previously described procedure (Eamshaw et al ., 1989) . The variability of stainingbetween different chromosomes is reminiscent of that observed when antibodies monospecific for CENRB are used to detect the endogenous protein (Earnshaw et al ., 1987) . The cell atthe lower left was not transfected . the CENRB open reading frame, which corresponds to -18% of the centromere localization domain identified by pCNPBl-158. Protein expressed by pCNPB28-599 displayed a diffuse staining pattern in interphase cells that was predominantly nuclear although some slight cytoplasmic staining was also observed (data not shown) . Numerous examples of mitotic cells expressing high levels of the truncated protein were also observed . In no case, however, did this protein localize to centromeres of mitotic chromosomes (confirmed by double staining with human anticentromere antibodies) . Instead the protein displayed a diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 7) . These experiments demonstrate that the amino-terminal 28 amino acids of CENP-B are essential (though possibly not sufficient) for the localization of this protein to centromeres. This rules out the possibility that other centromere localization signals exist outside of the first 131 amino acids on CENRB. No additional phenotypes resulting from the expression of any carboxyl-terminal portions of CENP-B were observed in these experiments .
