ing hybrid somatic cells retain all of the rodent chromosomes while losing a random subset of the human chromosomes. A few generations after fusion, clones can be identified with stable subsets of the human chromosomes. All chromosomes, human and rodent, normally remain functional. With a broad enough collection of different hybrid clones, it is possible to establish a correspondence between the presence or absence of a given human gene and the presence or absence of each of the 24 distinct human chromosomes. From this pattern one can infer the particular chromosome on which the gene resides. With the above outline in mind, it is of interest to determine the minimal number of distinct hybrid clones required to accurately and unambiguously assign a gene to a particular human chromosome. Such collections or panels of hybrid clones ideally should be designed to detect and correct a small number of errors in assays for the human gene or its protein product. By using some ideas from algebraic coding theory and probability, we contrast such minimal panels with the random panels typically generated by molecular geneticists. In developing some of the logical and mathematical consequences of the somatic cell hybrid technique, it seems prudent to state explicitly its underlying assumptions. Some violations of these assumptions will be noted below. The major assumptions are: (a) The human gene G to be mapped is present on exactly one chromosome. (b) Any rodent analogue of G is distinguishable from G at either the protein or the DNA level. (c) Each of the 24 distinct human chromosomes (22 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes) is either absent from a clone or is cytologically or biochemically detectable in the clone. (d) All cells within a clone share the same chromosome constitution. (e) The presence or absence of G can be accurately detected in each clone. Although assumption (a) is generally satisfied, a few human genes are scattered at multiple dispersed sites within the human genome; the gene encoding ribosomal RNA is a case in point [9] . Assumption (b) can be fulfilled if the human gene G and its rodent analogue are distinguishable by either electrophoresis of their gene products or by hybridization of an appropriate human DNA probe. Assumption (c) is easily met because human chromosomes can be accurately identified by a combination of human specific isozyme marker assays and karyotypic analysis using standard banding procedures. Violations of this condition usually result from the presence of unrecognized chromosomal aberrations such as insertions, deletions, translocations, and fragmentations. However, such chromosome aberrations are often intentionally employed for the regional mapping of genes on a specific chromosome. Assumption (d) can be violated if some of the cells in a clone continue to undergo human chromosome loss. For this reason several cells from a clone should be karyotyped. It is the maximal subset of human chromosomes in the clone which is relevant to gene localization. As a safeguard, ambiguous clones should be disregarded. The last assumption, (e), causes the most trouble. For instance, ambiguities can arise when phenotypic polymorphism in structural genes cannot be distinguished from phenotypic polymorphism in associated regulatory genes [6] . In addition, not all genes are constitutive in the sense that they are expressed at all times in all cell types [32] . Use of DNA probes to detect the human gene neatly circumvents both of these problems. Finally, laboratory error can enter into both enzyme and probe hybridization assays. The method of in situ hybridization carries the technique of human probe hybridization one step further. If a human cell is karyotyped and radioactive grains corresponding to the hybridized probe cluster predominantly on a given chromosome, then the gene is declared to reside on that chromosome. In practice, the independent results of somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization tend to reinforce each other [22] . In the current paper we will be concerned solely with issues of redundancy and efficiency in the somatic cell hybrid method. It has long been appreciated that certain redundancies in panels of somatic cell hybrid clones can self-detect and self-correct phenotyping errors representing violations of assumption (e) [17] . We will attempt to explain the utility of these error detection and correction capabilities as well as the amount of effort necessary to generate at random panels of clones for such purposes. These randomly generated panels we contrast with minimal panels suggested by algebraic coding theory. We also provide a practical solution to the combinatorial problem of selecting small, informative panels from larger existing collections of clones. As examples, we select good panels of sizes 5 through 20 clones from 189 published clones. 


Section:human gene localization by somatic cell hybridization has been actively applied for two decades since the pioneering work of weiss and green [43]. in brief outline, the method involves the formation of interspecies hybrid cells by fusing normal diploid human somatic cells with permanently transformed rodent cells-usually mouse or chinese hamster [6, 181. the result-
