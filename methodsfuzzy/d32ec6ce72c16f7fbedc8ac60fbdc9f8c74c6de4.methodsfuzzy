Clinical data. Prostate cancer tissue specimens (n=37) were obtained between July 2014 and December 2015 from Linyi People's Hospital (Linyi, China), from patients aged between 35 and 68 years who were diagnosed with prostate cancer without any therapy. These tissue samples were collected with the consent of the patients. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Linyi People's Hospital. The clinical stages of the patients were clarified according to the tumor nodes metastasis staging system. Adenoma (n=3), Stage 0/I (n=8), II (n=10), III (n=12) and IV (n=4). Mice, cell and prostate cancer models. C57BL/6 black mice (8 weeks old; male n=25; female n=25; weight ~20-25 g), were purchased from Sun Yat-sen University Experimental Animal Center (Guangzhou, China) and were used as control mice. A total of four B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice, (8 weeks old; male n=2; female n=2; weight ~20-25 g), which highly express CXCL9, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Ben Harbor, ME, USA). In total, 54 mice were used in this study. They were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles at 26-28˚C and 50-65% humidity and a normal diet (including 4% fat and 0.07% cholesterol) and water ad libitum. DMAB (3,2'-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl), was used as a chemical carcinogenic agent. The mice were enrolled and initiation with subcutaneous injection of DMAB (150 mg/kg b.w.) once a week for 3 weeks to construct the prostate cancer model. The mice were anesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate solution (3 ml/kg, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and then the blood samples were collected. Then the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the prostate tissues were collected and stored. Animal experiments were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Linyi People's Hospital. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The prostate tissues of each mouse were fixed using 10% formalin at room temperature for 24 h. Subsequently, the tissues were cut into paraffin sections (5 µm) and stained with hematoxylin for 5 mins and eosin for 30 sec at room temperature, mounted in a 50% glycerol solution in distilled water to prevent autofluorescence (Mikrochem, Bratislava, Slovak Republic) and evaluated with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany; magnification, x400) equipped with a CELLscan System (Scanalytics; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, US). Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to a conventional protocol (13) . The paraffin-embedded prostate tissue sections were incubated in a dry oven at 63˚C for 1 h. De-paraffinization and rehydration were then performed. The sections were incubated with 30-50 µl anti-IL-6 (SAB3300071), anti-TGF-β (SAB4502958) and anti-PCNA (WH000511M2) antibodies (dilution 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) overnight at 4˚C. The sections were washed with PBS buffer three times, each time for 5 min. A total of 30-50 µl HRP conjugated IL-6 (A0192), TGF-β (A0277) and PCNA (AF1363) secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Beyotime, Shanghai China) was added to the tissue section and incubated at 37˚C for 1 h. The sections were washed with PBS buffer three times, each time for 5 min. Excess liquid was dried around the tissue and then placed flat into the moist chamber. A working solution of 3,3'-diaminobenzidene (30-50 µl; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to the sections and incubated at room temperature for 1-5 min. After the color was developed, the sections were rinsed with distilled water to stop the reaction. A positive results was defined as the presence of staining in 10% or more of cells. The stained tissue sections were reviewed and scored separately by two pathologists blinded to the clinical parameters. Flow cytometry. Blood samples were collected from different mouse organs, such as, orbital cavity (1 ml), caudal vein (50-100 µl), spleen (30-50 µl) and bone marrow (80-120 µl). Then red blood cell lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was added to the blood samples, and centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was discarded and the bottom part of the precipitation was washed with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) 3 times at room temperature, each time for 5 min. Anti-CD4-FITC antibody (F1773; 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added in the dark and incubated for 30 min and centrifuged at 350 x g for 5 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitation was washed 3 times with 0.5% BSA, the supernatant was removed and the precipitation was re-suspended in 200 µl 0.5% BSA. The protein was detected using FACSCanto™ II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Immunofluorescent staining. The prostate tissue was fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then washed 3 times with PBS before permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS) for 10 min, also at room temperature. The paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions and then incubated for 20 min in 3% H 2 O 2 to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, the sections were heated in target retrieval solution (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 15 min in a microwave oven (Oriental Rotor, Tokyo, Japan) to retrieve the antigen. Subsequently, the sections were blocked with 2% BSA at 4˚C for 15 min (D3308; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and incubated with CD4+ (AF1792) and CD8+ (AF1417) primary antibodies (1:100; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) overnight at 4˚C, and stained with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody anti-CD4+-FITC antibody (F1773) and anti-CD8+-FITC antibody (F0772; 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, images were captured with Leica SP5 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and the number of positive cells and field area ratio were calculated with Image J software version 1.48 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) (14) . Western blotting. Tissues were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) with a protease inhibitor, complete EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The protein lysate sample was extracted from tumor tissue of mice, and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10-15 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was measured using BCA Protein Assay Kits (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The protein sample were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to Immobilon-PSQ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Then the membrane was blocked in 2% BSA, at 4˚C for 15 min with TBS containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated with the anti-IL-6 (SAB3300071) and anti-TGF-β (SAB4502958) antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at 4˚C overnight. Finally, the membrane was incubated with HRP conjugated IL-6 (A0192) and TGF-β (A0277) secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 50-90 min. The protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins were semi-quantified using Image J software version 1.48 (National Institutes of Health). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Total RNA was extracted from prostate tissues of the patients by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed with random primers using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China). RT-qPCR was performed with SYBR-Green PCR Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). PCR cycles were run on the iCycler IQ Multi-color Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) and the cycling conditions were 95˚C for 30 sec, 1 cycle; 95˚C for 5 sec and 62˚C for 20 sec, 40 cycles. The primers used for amplification were: CXCL9 F, 5'-AGG GTC GGC TGT TCC  TGC ATC-3' and R, 5'-TTC ACA TCT GCT GAA TCT GGG  TTT A-3'; GAPDH F, 5'-GCA CCG TCA AGG CTG AGA AC-3' and R, 5'-TGG TGA AGA CGC CAG TGG A-3'. Relative expression level was calculated using the 2 -∆∆Cq method (15) . GAPDH was employed as an endogenous control. The data analysis was performed based on the sample threshold cycle (Ct) value from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 19.0 statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The results of immunohistochemistry were analyzed by Image Pro Plus software version 1.48 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. One-way analysis of variance was conducted followed by Bonferroni method as a post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Kaplan-Meier survival plots were generated and comparisons were constructed with log-rank statistics. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
