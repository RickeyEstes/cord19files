Epidemiologic methods for etiologic studies are designed to uncover disease and exposure relationships in human populations wherein the study groups cannot be experimentally manipulated. Individual studies must be evaluated in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of the study design, the summation of epidemiologic evidence from a variety of studies, however, requires different standards. Circumstances that allow an exposure associated with a disease to be judged a cause of the disease have been best described by Hill (107) . First is the strength of the association. Second is the consistency of the observation. The evidence for causality is more persuasive when the association has been repeatedly observed under various circumstances by independent investigators using different methods. Third is the specificity of the association. When a specific exposure is associated with a certain disease, there is a 154 strong argument for cause and effect. In light of multicausation of most diseases, however, the lack of specificity does not irrevocably discount A causal hypothesis. Fourth is the temporal relationship of the exposure and disease. Cross-sectional and case control studies are poorly equipped to settle this issue. Fifth is evidence of a dose-response gradient. Sixth is the plausibility and coherence of the hypothesis. The hypothesis should not conflict with generally accepted medical theory. Completed, ongoing, and proposed epidemiologic studies discussed in this report must be individually evaluated according to the strengths and weaknesses of their design. Conclusions regarding an etiologic role for formaldehyde in disease processes must be drawn while considering findings against Hill's (107) points.
