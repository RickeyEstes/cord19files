We used a dynamic epidemic model of HIV in people who inject drugs to assess the potential effect of integrated harm reduction and HIV services for this population in Russia. Full methodological details are in the appendix. A dynamic and deterministic model of HIV transmission in this population was developed, incorporating injecting and sexual transmission in people who inject drugs. People who inject drugs enter due to injecting initiation and exit due to cessation of injecting or death (overdose, HIV-related death, or non-HIV background mortality). The model was stratified by HIV disease stage (uninfected, acute, latent, pre-AIDS, AIDS), ART status, risk (low or high, defined as history of incarceration on the basis of survey data for both settings), sex, and harm reduction access (off or on). We assumed no baseline coverage of any harm reduction and minimal ART coverage (26% of HIV-infected people who inject drugs in 2014). We modelled harm reduction scale-up through exploring different scenarios of harm reduction programme availability: high coverage NSP only, non-naltrexone MAT only, or combined NSP and MAT service, either alone or integrated with expanded ART for people who inject drugs. NSP and non-naltrexone MAT were assumed to reduce injecting-related HIV transmission risk. Non-naltrexone MAT was additionally assumed to increase ART recruitment rates, reduce treatment drop-out, and reduce rates of fatal overdose. However, we also incorporated increased mortality risk within the first 4 weeks of MAT initiation and discontinuation. ART was assumed to reduce HIV-related mortality, as well as sexual and injection-related transmission. The model was calibrated to two cities with differing epidemic profiles in Russia: Omsk (high but expanding HIV epidemic in people who inject drugs) and Ekaterinburg (very high but stable HIV epidemic). For each setting, the model was calibrated to multiple timepoints of HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs, stratified by sex and risk (incarceration history, when available), ART coverage in 2014, proportion high risk (ever incarcerated), and the estimated proportion of transmission related to sexual risk. Because of uncertainty, most parameters were sampled from underlying distributions, generating 100 parameter sets. For each parameter set, the model was calibrated to the data using an optimisation solver and minimising the sum log likelihood. For each of these 100 calibrated parameter sets, model scenarios were run and projections presented as means and 2·5-97·5% intervals. We examined the effect of the following intervention scale-up scenarios: (1) no harm reduction base-case; (2) NSP for 50% of people who inject drugs; (3) MAT for 25% of people who inject drugs; (4) MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs; (5) combination NSP-MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs; and (6) combination NSP-MAT for 50% of people who inject drugs integrated with scaled-up ART for HIV-infected people who inject drugs on harm reduction (recruited at three times current rates). We tracked the effect on HIV infections and fatal overdoses in people who inject drugs. The percentage of new HIV infections and fatal overdoses in people who inject drugs averted in the next decade was calculated by comparing the cumulative projected number of events from 2018 to 2028 with intervention scale-up compared with the base-case. ART=antiretroviral therapy. NSP=provision of clean needles and syringes. MAT=medication-assisted therapy. HCV=hepatitis C virus. These modelling exercises show multiple health benefits that could be achieved through integrating services for HIV and other health conditions, and they also highlight the crucial need for settingspecific approaches to integration. In settings such as Kenya and South Africa, with generalised HIV epidemics and increasing burden of underdiagnosed and undertreated NCDs, integrated communitybased screening could yield substantial benefits in identifying and treating hypertension, diabetes, and HIV. The realisation of such benefits, however, will be limited by the capacity of the healthcare system to provide appropriate treatment. In settings like Nigeria with low antenatal care coverage and substantial mother to child HIV transmission, integration of PMTCT and family planning services could reduce HIV infections in infants and in the population as a whole as well as prevent unintended pregnancies. Increasing PMTCT coverage will require both access to and uptake of care. The former might require substantial infrastructure and human resources investments, and the latter could benefit from scaleup of peer support or congregation based interventions. In countries with concentrated epidemics in FSW and MSM, integrating testing and treat ment for sexually transmitted infections and HIV should be considered. Modelling in India suggests that this approach would be costeffective in addressing HIV and syphilis infections in both sex workers and MSM. Although we have modelled a streamlined approach, a more comprehensive intervention such as Avahan could prove more costeffective. In some countries, few or no services are available for integration for highly affected populations. For example, in Russia, where there is a high concentration of HIV in people who inject drugs, the harm reduction, drug treatment, and HIV services for this population are either illegal or reach few in need. As such, there is an urgent need in Russia first for legal changes and capacity building to provide basic health services for people who inject drugs, ideally in an integrated programme that could reduce HIV, HCV, fatal overdose, and mass incarceration. Future work should consider the optimal integration strategy in each country based on HIV epidemiology and the healthcare system, and models of integration will be improved through increased understanding of barriers and facilitators of integration and will depend on how well Scenarios include no harm reduction or ART (base case), expansion of NSPs to 50% coverage in PWID (NSP 50%), expansion of MAT to 25% or 50% of PWID (MAT 25%; MAT 50%), combination MAT and NSP to 50% of PWID (MAT+NSP 50%), or combination MAT and NSP to 50% of PWID integrated with ART recruited at three times the base-case recruitment rate of HIV-infected PWID on harm reduction per year from 2018. Observed HIV prevalence data in PWID shown as black circles and 95% CI; dashed lines are 2·5-97% uncertainty bounds. Box plots indicate the median (middle line) projections, 25-75% percentile range (boxes), and 2·5-97·5% percentile range (whiskers), and median estimates reported above box plots. PWID=people who inject drugs. ART=antiretroviral therapy. MAT=medication-assisted therapy. NSP=needle and syringe programme. different integration scenarios can achieve economies of scope and scale. The potential benefits of integration are substantial, but they are only realisable with the bridging of nowsiloed healthcare strategies.
