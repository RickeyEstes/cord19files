Full-length genomic sequencing. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the South Korean patient diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection were collected and used for viral RNA extraction with the QIAamp viral RNA minikit. Fortyfour sets of specific primer pairs were designed and used to amplify the complete genome, followed by Sanger sequencing; meanwhile, the extracted viral RNA was also used for next-generation sequencing with the Ion Torrent PGM after random amplification. Phylogenetic analysis. We downloaded all (n Ï­ 92) available fulllength genome sequences of MERS-CoV from GenBank and used RAxML (20) for phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome, the ORF1ab gene, and the S gene, respectively. One thousand bootstrap replicates were run. Furthermore, the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method, implemented in BEAST (21) , was used to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor. Twelve different model combinations were applied. For all the analyses, we used the general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was run for 50 million steps. Trees and parameters were sampled every 5,000 steps, with the first 10% removed as burn-in. Genetic recombinant analysis. Similarity plots and bootscanning analysis were generated by SimPlot (22); a sliding window of 200 nucleotides was used, moving in 20-nucleotide steps. Singlenucleotide-difference analysis was used to confirm the recombination event. Nucleotide sequence accession number. The full-length virus genome (30,144 bp) of ChinaGD01 was deposited in GenBank under accession no. KT006149.
