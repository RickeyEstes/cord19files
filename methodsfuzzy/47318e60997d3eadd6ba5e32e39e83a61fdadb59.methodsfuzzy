In 2008, three separate organizations compared binding affinity prediction methods on a defined data set using identical force field parameters [32] . [32] , shows the correlation between observed binding affinity and computed binding free energy for the four methods. While the computational time required for each method conformed to expectation, and each computational method produced results that correlate somewhat with experimental values, there were significant differences in the scale and shifts from the origin of the vertical axis. MAPLE CAFEE produced the best agreement with a difference from observed affinities within 0.5 [kcal/mol] (an error of 1.4 [kcal/mol] is a good benchmark for computational accuracy since the error of experimentally measured affinity is in this range). Virtual drug discovery Mitchell and Matsumoto 555 Setup molecular models for protein, ligand, and water and assign the force field parameters Equilibrate the system in the intial pose with a molecular dynamics run Compute the non-equilibrum work term between bound and unbound equilibrium states Estimate the most likely representative binding free energy between micro states Sum up all the micro binding free ene rgi re to get the total binding free energy
