Salmonellas are spread by direct or indirect means. Infected animals are the source of the organisms; they excrete them and infect other animals, directly or indirectly, by con tamination of the environment, primarily feed, and water supplies. The farm animal may be infected in different ways: by animal toanimal transmission, especially of host adapted serovars; by contaminated animal feed; and by a contaminated environment (soil, birds, rodents, insects, and water sup plies). In most cases transmission is over short distances, i.e., within the same pen or room, with some transmission between rooms and buildings on the same site but with limited transmission between sites. 27 Usually infection spreads from pen to pen, but it may be over some distances caused by fomites or vectors. Transmission of Salmonella between swine farms by the housefly has been shown. 28 Liquid wastes from infected animals may contaminate the envi ronment directly. Bacteria may also be dis seminated during the transport of infected animals and during the holding of animals in a lairage before slaughter. In both situations, the excretion of salmonellas is exacerbated by the stress imposed. When all animals become ill at the same time it is likely that a common source is involved such as water, feed, bedding, or con tamination from one source. It is always higher in continuous flow systems in which there is no allin/allout systems with clean ing and disinfection. Slatted floors are much better than simple drainage gutters. Salmonellas can be isolated from piggery wastewater, and the recirculation of contam inated water through the piggery serves as a constant source of the organism. Housing of finishingage pigs in barns with openflush gutters may contribute to increased shedding of Salmonella compared with pigs housed on partially slotted floors. Methanogenic fer mentation in waste ponds does not eliminate Salmonella from piggery waste; acidogenic fermentation with the production of free acid can destroy salmonellas and other potential pathogens. During slaughter, fecal contamination of the carcass commonly occurs and can be carried through all slaughter procedures up to the processing of the raw products. Air borne transmission can be a primary mode of infection of STM. Studies have shown that the organism can survive in air long enough to present a significant hazard of airborne spread. In a study in Germany of 50 finishing herds with Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica (YE), and S. enterica, 29 the sam pling of feces, the direct environment, indi rect environment, and flies and pests revealed the information shown in Table 723 . Respectively, for the three groups, 22 herds (80%), 12 herds (48%), and 7 herds (12%) were positive for both Campylobacter and YE, for both Campylobacter and S. enterica, and for both Y. enterocolitica and S. enterica, respectively. Campylobacter and YE were found more often in the low S risk group. This study provided evidence that the pigs' environment should be studied when implementing control studies. The organism is found in hamsters, ferrets, foxes, hares, deer, emus, ostriches, and pri mates. Colonization of rodents and wild rodents has been described. 6 The significance of these alternative hosts has not yet been ascertained. The role of vectors is not clear, but the main source of infection is the incoming pig (both growing pigs and adults). Gilts can be shedders and carriers, and the organism can probably survive in the extra cellular world for 1 to 2 weeks at 5°C to 15°C. It may be transmitted on boots, other fomites, and by insects and flies. 7 The method of transmission between pigs is assumed to be the fecal-oral route. 8 B. hyodysenteriae is present in the feces of affected pigs. Infection is by ingestion, and transmission is enhanced by conditions leading to fecal-oral cycling. Spread of infec tion within a group is slow, taking up to 7 to 14 days, and it may spread to other pens of pigs over a 2 to 3week period. Pigs that have recovered from clinical disease with or without treatment may become carriers and still have the ability to shed the organism and infect incontact animals for 50 to 90 days. Clinical disease may initially be precipitated by stress, but infection subsequently spreads by direct contract. The frequency of shed ding varies with time, and only a small pro portion of a convalescent population may be expected to be carriers. Every method of fecal transmission is a likely source (trucks, people, clothing, boots, etc.). The exact mode of transmission of the TGE virus is uncertain. Virus shedding in the feces of infected pigs usually ends at or within a few weeks of recovery, although recovered pigs may harbor the virus in pul monary or intestinal tissue for periods of more than 100 days. The shedding period is thought to be 14 days. After weaning, the pig is no longer protected by specific secretory IgA antibody of the sow's milk and is highly susceptible to infection if the rate of infection is high in the weanling population. The weanling pig is a major reservoir of infection for continuous infection in the herd. Feeder pigs with no clinical signs can be an impor tant reservoir of the virus. The virus has also been isolated from pharyngeal swabs taken from farmraised sows sent to slaughter. Epidemics commonly follow the introduction of pigs into a herd, and the carrier pig is a major source of infection. Fre quently, the disease first appears in older pigs in the herd and then subsequently spreads to newborn pigs and sows in the farrowing area. Spread is much more rapid in a continuous-flow system of production compared with an all-in, all-out system, whereby groups of pigs of the same age or production stage are handled as groups and their housing facilities are cleaned and disinfected before and after being occupied. Visitors and their boots, transport vehicles, equipment, and starlings have also been incriminated in the transfer of infection to new locations. Starlings may act as vectors in spreading the disease to adjacent farms. The virus can also multiply in houseflies (Musca domestica), and they may be a vector. Feral pigs are not a significant reservoir for the TGE virus in the southern United States but are capable of becoming infected and developing virusneutralizing antibodies against the virus. Subpopulations of infected pigs may exist within the herd, and although shedding normally lasts for 14 days, it is possible for animals to be infected for 100 days. Once the infection has gained access to a herd, transmission occurs by both oral and respiratory routes. The speed of spread without direct contact indicates that the virus can be spread by aerosol. Respiratory transmission appears significant in adults, and replication in the respiratory tract is fol lowed by excretion in nasal secretions and milk within 1 day of infection and also in feces. Excretion in milk results in rapid transmission to suckling piglets, which in turn may excrete large quantities of the virus within 2 days of infection. Infection generally occurs through minor abrasions on the feet but may occur through other routes. The incubation period is 2 to 14 days, and the virus may be excreted before the onset of clinical signs. During and for a short period following the viremic phase, the virus is excreted in oral and nasal secretions. It is excreted in feces for periods up to 3 weeks, and vesicular fluid and shed vesicular epithelium are potent sources of infection. A chronic infection with shedding of virus for periods up to 3 months has been described. Contact within a contaminated environment may lead to viremia within 1 day and clinical signs within 2 days. Large amounts of virus are shed in the immediate vicinity of infected pigs. Trans mission occurs by direct contact or contact with infected food or water or infected feces, and the disease spreads rapidly between pigs within the same group. Airborne transmis sion of the virus is not a feature, and the spread between groups of pigs is less rapid than that which occurs with FMD. The resis tance of the virus and its persistence within the environment allows spread by mechani cal methods such as trucks and contami nated boots. Areas that have housed infected pigs may remain infective for a considerable period of time. The potential for conta minated communal livestock trucks and markets to spread infection is considerable because of the occurrence of minor foot abrasions that occur during the movement of pigs and the presence of persistently infected organic matter. In the UK epidemic in the 1970s, the major methods of spread were movement of pigs (48%), contaminated vehicles (21%), feeding contaminated waste (15%), and contact at markets (11%). Other methods included movement of equipment or person nel, local spread, and recrudescence of previ ous infection. The outbreaks were fewer in the summer when less pork was consumed, and this resulted in much reduced pig movements. The disease may be sufficiently mild to escape clinical detection. This, plus the occurrence of subclinical infection, and the reluctance of farmers to report suspicions of its occurrence, facilitates spread by the movement of infected pigs to other farms or through markets. Vertical transmission has not been demonstrated. The disease may also be spread by the feeding of uncooked garbage, but it is believed that more of the virus is needed to infect pigs via this route. Pigs killed during the incubation period of the disease or with subclinical infection possess a considerable amount of virus in body tissues. There is little reduction in infectivity with cold storage, and the virus can persist in pork and pork products indefinitely. The sources of infection are infected live pigs and infective pork. Infected pigs excrete the virus in saliva and feces but not in the urine for 12 hours before vesicles develop and for 1 to 5 days afterward. Raw garbage contain ing infective pork scraps is the most common medium of spread from farm to farm. On infected premises the disease is spread by direct contact and, although the virus is resis tant to environmental influences, spread by indirect means does not occur readily. Pigs frequently become infected, as evidenced by the development of immunity, without evidence of clinical disease. Ingestion of infected material is sufficient to produce infection. The isolation from marine animals of an identical virus, which is capable of producing a disease identical to vesicular exanthema when inoculated into pigs, has led to the hypothesis that the primary reservoir for vesicular exanthema is in marine animals. Epizootics in pigs may have been initiated by the feeding of marine meat or garbage con taining marine animal products. Salmonellas are spread by direct or indirect means. Infected animals are the source of the organisms; they excrete bacteria and infect other animals, directly or indirectly, by con tamination of the environment, primarily feed and water supplies. The farm animal may be infected in different ways: by animal toanimal transmission, especially of host adapted serovars; by contaminated animal feed; and by a contaminated environment (soil, birds, rodents, insects, and water sup plies). Liquid wastes from infected animals may contaminate the environment directly, including streams, rivers, and pastures. Bac teria may also be disseminated during the transport of infected animals and during the holding of animals in a lairage before slaughter. In these situations, the excretion of salmonellas is exacerbated by the stress imposed. The mixing of young susceptible calves and their subsequent transportation is an efficient mechanism for the rapid dissemina tion of Salmonella. Saleyards and dealers' premises can serve as reservoirs of infection despite cleaning and disinfection. Many vehicles and markets are contaminated with Salmonella. The introduction of infected carrier animals into a herd is a common cause of outbreaks of clinical salmonellosis in dairy herds that are expanding in size. The organism can persist for an average of 14 months in the environment where calves are reared. Salmonella spp. do not survive for more than 5 days in bovine urine not mixed with feces but will survive in dried bovine feces for up to 6 years. After a clinical outbreak of salmonellosis, for example, in a dairy herd raising its own replacements, the premises cannot be declared to be Salmonella free solely on the basis of freedom from clinical cases over the next few years or on the basis of comparatively high herd performance. In large dairy herds with modern free stalls that recycle water in their manure flush systems, it may be possible to isolate Salmonella serovars for several years following an outbreak of clinical salmonel losis. The organisms may be found in recy cled water samples, bulk tank milk filters, and the feces of calves and adult cows. During slaughter, fecal contamination of the carcass commonly occurs and can be carried through all slaughter procedures up to the processing of the raw products. Milk can be contaminated directly by cows that excrete the organism in the udder, especially those cattle infected with SD and S. Muen ster, both of which have adapted to colonize the bovine mammary gland. Although S. Typhimurium is not usually excreted in milk, except during the febrile stage of clinical disease, it has been reported to have been persistently isolated from the milk of a healthy cow. S. Enteritidis has been isolated from milking filters, milk from a bulk tank, and milk from onequarter of a 5yearold dairy cow that persistently shed the organ ism in the milk for several months. Milk is most likely to become contaminated by feces, either from an animal with clinical salmonel losis or from a healthy carrier animal, during the milking process. Additional sources of contamination during milking are use of pol luted water or contaminated equipment. Workers who lack personal hygiene skills and have clinical salmonellosis or are chronic shedders of the organism may also contami nate milk supplies. Airborne transmission can be a primary mode of infection of S. Typhimurium. Studies have shown that the organism can survive in air sufficiently long to present a significant hazard of airborne spread. A variety of rapid Salmonella detection methods such as electrical conductance/ impedance immunomagnetic separation, ELISA, and DNA probe PCR methods are available. Many of these methods have been developed for the use in human foodstuffs but have not been fully validated for environ mental or fecal samples. Samples containing fecal material present a problem for PCR based methods because of the presence of inhibitors of the PCR reaction in the test sample matrix. 33 In most cases selective or nonselective enrichment stages and DNA extraction techniques are required when using DNAbased methods, resulting in more steps and operator time for the isola tion procedure. The intestinal tract is the site of multiplica tion of the rotavirus and the virus is excreted only in the feces. Infected feces may contain as many as 10 10 virus particles per gram. Rotaviruses are considered to be highly contagious; studies in pigs showed infection can be achieved with as little as 90 virus particles. Because rotaviruses are stable in feces and relatively resistant to commonly used disinfectants, it is extremely difficult to prevent gross contamination of animal housing once infection has been introduced. The adult animal is the primary source of infection for the neonate. The sur vival of the bovine rotavirus in air and on surfaces is directly influenced by the level of relative humidity. The rotaviruses generally survive well in an aerosol state, and medium range of relative humidity and air may be one of the vehicles for dissemination of the virus. The virus is excreted by both calves and adult cattle in large numbers (up to 10 10 /g of feces) and excretion may last for several weeks. Transmission is by the fecal-oral route via contaminated feces or fomites. The minimal infectious dose in cattle does not appear to have been determined, but as few as 90 virus particles were found to be sufficient to induce infection in piglets, making this a highly infectious pathogen. Even under openrange conditions, there is a rapid spread of the virus throughout calves that come into frequent contact with each other, particularly during the calving season. Calves are infected after birth from the dam's feces or from other infected diar rheic calves. Pregnant cows excrete the rota virus intermittently throughout pregnancy, from one calving to the next, and provide a direct source of infection for the newborn calf. Both subclinically infected and diarrheic calves infected by rotavirus can be a source of infection for other incontact calves. The mechanisms of VSV transmission are still not entirely understood. Vector-borne transmission is considered the epidemio logically most relevant route, although trans mission through direct skintoskin contact is likely to contribute to the spread of the disease within a herd. 4 There is strong epide miologic evidence corroborating the assump tion of vectorborne transmission. Apart from an obviously seasonal pattern of disease occurrence, the disease incidence was deter mined to be increased with an increasing population of potential insect vectors, with proximity of affected animals to running water as well as with a lack of use of shelters. 4 Biological transmission by bloodfeeding insects, which have been demonstrated repeatedly to be abundant on casepositive premises, also indicates that the insect vector hypothesis is plausible. Biological transmission of VSV has been verified in blackflies (Simulium vittatum), phleboto mine sandflies (Lutzomyia spp.), and biting midges (Culicoides spp.). 4 Mechanical trans mission through flies (Musca domestica, and M. autumnalis) and eye gnats (Hippelates spp.) on which the virus has been isolated may also occur. Experimentally, VSVNJinfected blackflies readily transmitted the virus to domestic swine. Transmission was confirmed by seroconversion or by the pres ence of clinical VS. Vectorborne virus transmission has been debated because viremia, which is considered to be essential for disease trans mission by bloodsucking insects, is not commonly observed in animals infected with VSV. As in other domestic animal species in which viremia has not been detected naturally or experimentally, viremia did not occur in the pigs experimentally infected by infected blackflies. Furthermore, the natural vertebrate host required to maintain the virus between outbreaks has not been iden tified. Antibody to VSV has been demon strated in a large number of wildlife species in Central America, but their significance as wildlife reservoirs remains to be deter mined. Feral pigs are believed to be the reservoir and amplifying host on Ossabaw Island. Another proposed hypothesis is that VSV is actually a plant virus that would be ingested with forages and then undergo an adaption process to infect its host. 1 Mediate or immediate contagion occurs by contact or ingestion of contaminated materials, especially in large intensive dairies where there is a great deal of communal use of water and feed troughs. It also occurs by the ingestion of contaminated pasture. Spread within dairy herds also appears to be aided by milking procedures. The importation of embryos from infected areas is considered a minimal risk for introduction of infection. Convalescent cattle have been suspect as perpetuating disease and spreading it with movement to other herds. VSV has been iso lated from convalescent cattle 38 days after the disappearance of clinical signs, and disease can recur in convalescent cattle. Viral RNA can be detected in the tongue and draining lymph nodes of cattle 5 months after experimental inoculation, but there is no evidence for the longterm persistence of replicationcompetent virus in cattle. The source of infection is the feces of clini cally affected or carrier animals, and infec tion is acquired by ingestion of feed and water contaminated with sporulated coccid ial oocysts or by licking the hair coat con taminated with such oocysts. Unsporulated oocysts are passed in the feces and require suitable environmental conditions to sporu late. Moist, temperate, or cool conditions favor sporulation, whereas high temperatures and dryness impede it. Depending on the species of coccidium, oocysts sporulate at a range of 12°C to 32°C (53.5°F-89.5°F) and require oxygen. They can resist freezing down to approximately −7°C to −8°C (19.5°F-17.5°F) for 2 months, but −30°C (−22°F) is usually lethal. 1 It has been suggested that oocysts might sporulate in the winter months on the hair coats of animals contaminated with feces. This may explain the continual production of several different species of coc cidia during the cold winter months, when sporulation on the ground is not possible. 1 Dry conditions and high temperatures also destroy sporulated oocysts within a few weeks, but the oocysts may survive for up to 2 years under favorable conditions. Tempera tures of >35°C, humidity of <25%, and sunlight for at least 4 hours are fatal for E. zuernii. Ingestion of the sporulated oocysts results in infection. Large numbers of oocysts usually arise by continual reinfection and a buildup of the degree of environmental contamination. This is most common when calves or lambs are crowded into small pens or confined in feedlots. Lambs can become infected within a few weeks after birth from lambing grounds heavily contaminated by the ewes. Overcrowding of animals on irri gated pastures, or around surface water holes in drought conditions, may also lead to heavy infections and disease. Feeder lambs and calves brought into feedlots from sparse grazing may carry a few oocysts, which build up into heavy infections in the lots, particu larly if conditions are moist. In such situa tions, clinical signs of the disease usually appear several weeks to a month after the animals are confined. Young calves and lambs on pasture may shed large numbers of oocysts for long periods, which results in a buildup of coccidial populations. In cow-calf herds, the prevalence and intensity of oocyst excretion can vary with time, resulting in peak values around the time of parturition (periparturient rise). Sows do not play a significant role in the transmission of I. suis infection from one generation of piglets to the next through contamination of the farrowing pen. Oocysts of I. suis cannot usually be found in the feces of sows on swine farms where neonatal coc cidiosis occurs.
