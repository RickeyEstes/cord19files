The data about the SARS outbreak (e.g. cases, death tolls, spread around globe) has been derived by triggering search queries on various online medical journals, Pubmed.gov, who.int 10 , cdc.gov 11 etc. On completion of the data-collection phase, the analysis about factors causing the emergence of SARS virus in society has been carried out. These factors are then modelled using the agent-based modelling approach by using the NetLogo simulation software 14 . People are the agents in our epidemiology-based model and an artificial breed of population is randomly created. The person's immunity, current health condition, and closeness with other agents in the environment have been modelled. This model uses the data and alerts which were issued by the WHO 10 and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 11 during the SARS epidemic. Based on these data, several SARS stages have been inferred as shown in Table 1 The emergence of SARS virus is quite interesting, for instance it took less than 2 days for the SARS virus to migrate from China to Canada 12 with important societal consequences. Due to this property of spreading fast, studying SARS emergence by modeling and simulation can be helpful in developing an algorithm for task allocation in distributed systems. Task allocation is the system property that emerge within the distributed system following insights from the SARS pandemics. In this research we have followed an unorthodox approach of assuming the spread of SARS virus among the population as the assigned task to the system, and the number of patient getting infected or sick due to virus are interpreted as completion of the task.
