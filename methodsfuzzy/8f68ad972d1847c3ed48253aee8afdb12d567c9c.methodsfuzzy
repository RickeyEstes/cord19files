After aspiration of the growth medium, MDCK-SIAT1, HEP-2, and Intestine 407 cells grown in 8-well chamber slides (Fisher Scientific, Italy) were incubated with samples (1 h, 37°C). After restoring the E-MEM, incubation was carried out in E-MEM for 24 h before IIF with mAbs against HADV, HPIV, HRSV, and influenza virus (IV) (Argene/ BioMérieux), as described above. HADV, HEV, HPIV, HRSV, and IV isolation was performed in LLC-MK2, MDCK-SIAT1, HEP-2, Intestine 407, MRC-5, and Vero cells grown in 24-well plates (Sigma-Aldrich). After aspirating the E-MEM, cells were incubated with samples (1 h, 37°C). After restoring the E-MEM, incubation in E-MEM was continued until the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE). If the cells showed no CPE after 7 days, they were scraped, and cell suspension was collected for a second inoculation. When CPE was observed, cells were scraped in PBS and cytocentrifuged, before IIF. When CPE suggested HEV infection, neutralization assays were performed.
