We propose a model based on ordinary differential equations used for explaining influenza viral kinetics [20] . Our model represents the dynamics of simultaneous infection in the human respiratory tract with two viruses, V 1 and V 2 . The model equations are Target cells : Eclipse cells : Infected cells : Model parameters and variables are described in Table 2 . As shown in Fig 9 , V 1 and V 2 infect the susceptible uninfected target cells, T, at rates β 1 and β 2 . We assume that one cell can only be infected by one type of virus at a time, i.e. V 1 and V 2 cannot simultaneously infect the same cell. The newly infected cells enter an eclipse phase, E 1 or E 2 , where infected cells take some time to produce viral components. This delay accounts for intracellular processes related to the synthesis of viral nucleic acid and proteins, viral assembly, maturation and budding. After an average transition time 1 k 1 or 1 k 2 , the cells become productively infectious cells, I 1 and I 2 , which produce viruses at rates p 1 and p 2 . The lengths of time over which infectious cells produce viruses are denoted by 1 d 1 and 1 d 2 after which the infectious cells die. Virus is cleared at rates c 1 or c 2 . We assume both viruses attack the same type of target cell population, which is not always the true as respiratory virus infections also depend on the expressions of cell surface receptors [47, 49, 50] . Also, target cell regeneration is neglected here because infections are short compared to the time it takes for cells to regenerate [45] . No explicit immune response is considered in this model since accurate information about its role in viral infections is still lacking [44] . Finally, this model assumes exponential distributions for eclipse and infectious transition times, which is known to be biologically unrealistic [26, 53] , but simplifies the computation and should not affect the qualitative predictions of the model. Our model is similar to those of [27, 54] except that they include non-exponential distributions as well as non infectious virus particles in their models.
