A descriptive clinical and laboratorial study was conducted with all cases with confirmed diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) among HIV-infected individuals attended at CRT/ STD/AIDS. Confirmed cases of influenza A were defined as patients with a positive PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay) for influenza A (H1N1). The PCR test at nasopharyngeal secretions was collected at admission to the service among those with symptoms suggestive of influenza, such as high fever, cough, myalgia, sore throat and respiratory distress. The samples were sent to Adolfo Lutz Institute (ALI), the reference laboratory for diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) in SÃ£o Paulo, for analysis. Data was prospectively collected. A protocol with patient information as identification, epidemiological history of exposure to H1N1, data related to the HIV infection (including use of antiretroviral and adherence to them, history of immunization against seasonal influenza in the past year, tobacco use, comorbidities, signs of influenza and related symptoms) were collected. Results of radiological and laboratory tests of each patient were also included. These questionnaires were completed by infectious disease specialists who were providing care to patients. We used the same instrument for inpatients and outpatients evaluation. The questionnaires were reviewed by the principal investigator and when important data were missing, it was retrieved from the medical records. Body mass index (BMI) of all patients were calculated to determine if there was obesity or not. In this study, any patient with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m 2 was considered obese. The case definition of pneumonia was the presence of acute pulmonary infiltrate associated with the presence of one or more of the following signs or symptoms: dyspnea, fever, hypoxemia, cough and chest pain. The obtained convenience sample of eighteen patients with positive PCR were followed-up. No pregnant patient was included in our study.
