In this section we discuss methods to study the structural and functional properties of disordered proteins in cellular environments. These include in silico molecular simulations (section 5.1), high-resolution in-cell NMR spectroscopy (section 5.2), fluorescence imaging methods (section 5.3) and Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy (section 5.4).
