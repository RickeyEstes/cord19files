Although poxvirus DNA is non-infectious it is possible to reactivate denatured poxviruses by homologous or heterologous helper poxviruses. This phenomenon reported decades ago (61) ( Fig. 3) is similar to the use of A phage arms followed by ligation with the insert/library and packaging in vitro. In the vaccinia case the arms are those of vaccinia and the packaging occurs in vivo due to the helper fowlpox virus. The advantage of this system is that it eliminates the need for cloning into insertion vectors and offers potential to clone large fragments or toxic 14 . Vaccinia Virus Recombinants 327 genes that could not be cloned in bacteria, as well as the possibility of generating eukaryotic expression libraries.
