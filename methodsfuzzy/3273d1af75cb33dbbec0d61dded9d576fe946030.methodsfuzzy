In order to estimate the evolutionary relationship between two nucleotide sequences, we introduced the r-value (Pearson correlation coefficient) [30] for calculation using pairwise distance matrices. As the basic data for certain algorithms to construct the trees, the pairwise distances determine the tree topology [31] . Therefore, the correlation coefficient between two distance matrices can be used to estimate the similarity of two trees ( Figure 2 ) [23, 24, 32] . Here, we firstly used this statistical method to estimate the evolutionary correlation levels between genome sequences and individual gene sequences so as to choose the proper consensus region for inferring the exact genetic relationship between viral isolates. The calculation was performed as described below: Evolutionary pairwise distance matrices were constructed with MEGA (version 5) based on the former multiple sequence alignments, using the Tamura 3-parameter model method [33] . For gene X from its whole genome Y, the evolutionary linear correlation coefficient r (Pearson's correlation coefficient) between them was calculated according to the following equation [30] : where X ij represents the distance from i virus strain to j virus strain in distance matrix of gene X; X represents the mean of all X ij values; Y ij represents the distance of strain i to strain j in the distance matrix of genome Y; Yrepresents the mean of all Y ij values; and N represents the number of viral strains in the matrices. The significance of the computed r value was assessed by estimating the probability of obtaining the observed value of r by chance (p-value). The correlation coefficient r-values between genes and the complete genome of each virus were respectively calculated based on all the sets of strains collected.
