Graphical methods to display sequences have the advantage of visual indications of trends and inherent features. The familiar dot-matrix type of graphs have been widely used to determine systematics in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The dots plotted on a 2D grid with the sequence running along the positive x-and negative y-axes produce a pattern (Gibbs and McIntyre, 1970) that is useful in determining sequence similarity, direct repeats, inverted repeats, etc., and such plots have also been used in RNA secondary structure predictions theories, for example, complementary sequences in a RNA structure in the dot-matrix analysis of nucleotide sequences of potato tuber spindle viroid (Fig. 1 ). In the case of proteins, one of the more widely used molecular graphs is the hydrophobicity-polarity lattice graph to model structure-activity relationships and folding dynamics in 2D/3D spaces (Jiang and Zhu, 2005; Chikenji et al., 2006) . In continuing developments in the field, a new pseudofolding molecular graph or network-type representation has been proposed recently . Numerical characterization of sequences have also been targeted at the challenging problem of determining evolutionary relationships in protein families; for example, the multiplicity of voltage-gated sodium channel proteins from one for the bacteria (e.g., Bacillus halodurans) to 10 in humans, the development of the globin genes, the growth of differences in the highly conserved histones. Popular software like PHYLIP (Retief, 2000) , MEGA (Tamura et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2008) , etc., are available for phylogenetic analysis, based generally on complex multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms. Graphical methods like k-tuple, dot-matrix method (Gibbs and McIntyre, 1970) , etc., are found as an integral part of MSA algorithm, and other graphical methods assess the extent of similarity/dissimilarity between protein sequence and serve as inputs to the software packages to generate the phylogenetic trees. Bai and Wang (2006) derived the phylogenetic relationships for selected proteins using their 3D graphical representation where the amino acids are plotted on the corners of a dodecahedron. From the curve of the protein sequence obtained as a walk within this 3D space (Fig. 6) , they derive a quotient matrix similar to the DD matrix discussed earlier for the DNA plots (Li and Wang, 2005) , from which they can calculate the distance matrix between a set of protein sequences. The application of a similar procedure to a set of nine nerve genes from various organisms led to the generation of phylogenetic trees (Fig. 7) . While usual methods of generating such trees are difficult due to the varying lengths of the sequences, the matrix method with leading eigenvalues do not have such problems and generates fairly acceptable relationships, although some of the details show, as the authors point out, that the method requires further refinement. The method is also useful in that it allows visible inspection of protein sequence characteristics and thus is good for comparative study of proteins too. Li et al. (2009a) proposed a 3D graphical representation of protein sequences where the amino acids were classified into five separate groups based on their interactions. Thus, in terms of the one-letter code of amino acids, Group 1 consisted of the amino acids C, M, F, I, L, V, W, Y; Group 2 of A, T, H; Group 3 of G, P; Group 4 of D, E; and the last Group 5 of S, N, Q, R, K. Representing each group by one amino acid, a protein sequence can be reduced to a sequence of five letters only, which can then be used to generate a random walk in a 3D Euclidean space where the steps are in designated cardinal directions (Fig. 8) . Taking a cue from the work by Gonzalez-Diaz et al. (2005) , they use the charge information of the amino acids and the number of amino acids at each node of the walk to define four charge coupling numbers for each sequence from which, after some combinatorics, they generate a 60-component vector for each sequence. Applying this technique to beta-globin protein sequences from 15 species, they were able to quantitatively assess the similarities and dissimilarities between the proteins from comparison of the sequence vectors. This also led to generation of a distance matrix which, though not explicitly shown by the authors, can be used to draw the phylogenetic tree for this protein family. The results obtained by the authors' prescription are analogous to established data. Thus, GRANCH methods are seen to be useful techniques to represent protein characteristics that can be easily computed while avoiding complications arising out of the need for multiple alignments (Altschul, 1989; Gotoh, 1993) and other modeling assumptions. The usefulness of these approaches and the reasonable agreement that we observe with standard results provide a good basis to investigate new phenomena such as viral issues which are the subjects of the next section. 1. The 2D Method of Liao et al. (2006) As mentioned earlier (Section II), Liao et al. (2006) constructed 2D graphs with the four R-groups of the amino acids at predetermined angles on either side of the x-axis. For each nucleotide sequence, they constructed three separate graphs for the three reading frames of the gene sequence. For each graph, they defined a geometric center of mass x 0 , y 0 and a covariance matrix CM as where the summations are over the subscript i which runs from 1 to N, the length of the sequence. The covariance matrix CM is a 2 Â 2 square matrix with a leading eigenvalue l. Thus, for the three graphs of each sequence there will be a set of three geometric centers of masses and three leading eigenvalues. From these eigenvalues, they defined a distance measure for two sequences i and j as which can be used for studies of evolutionary relationships between species without having to make any evolutionary model assumptions or multiple alignments of the sequence. 2. The 2D Method of Li et al. (2008) Another 2D graphical method has been described by Li et al. (2008) where they ascribe a 60-component vector to each of the proteins and construct a distance matrix where i and j refer to two different sequences and r ¼ 1,2,3,. . ., 60. This structure allows them to generate a phylogenetic tree in similar fashion to Liao et al. Taking a cue from the graphical representations of DNA sequences, Nandy et al. (2009) proposed an abstract 20D Cartesian coordinate system to generate a protein sequence walk by plotting one point for each amino acid in the sequence along a designated axis for that acid as shown in Table I ; the choice of association is equivalent for all residues and can be arbitrarily assigned but once assigned will be fixed for the duration of the computation. The walk as per the sequence will result in a series of points in the abstract 20D space generating a curve, each point on the walk being specified by 20 coordinate values. For example, for a protein sequence like MVHLTPEEKS the coordinate of the end point will then be (0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0) and the exercise can likewise be performed for any protein sequence. Unlike some of the 2D graphical representation of DNA and protein sequences, there are no degeneracies or path retracements in this representation and all amino acids are represented on equal footing. While the disadvantage of this method is clear that the graph cannot be visualized, numerical characterization of the sequences can be easily computed as described below and used for comparison between sequences irrespective of sequence lengths . The quantification procedure in this representation characterizes a sequence by a weighted center of mass approach first used for DNA sequences with the CM coordinates given by here the x i 's are the coordinate values of each point on the abstract curve and N, a normalization factor for the m i 's, is the number of amino acids in the protein chain. Using these weighted averages, the procedure defines a protein graph vector p R (m 1 , m 2 ,. . ., m 20 ) and a protein graph radius S  17  Threonine  Thr  T  18  Valine  Val  V  19  Tryptophan  Trp  W  20 Tyrosine Tyr Y Again, the distance between two sequences i and j can be defined as where the sum is taken over all 20 coordinates. Obtaining a distance matrix from comparison of a family of sequences can enable generating a phylogenetic tree to study evolutionary relationships, again, as in all GRANCH methods, without having to introduce multiple alignments or any other model dependencies. Nandy et al. (2009) has successfully applied this algorithm in tree construction for human globin variants and between voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms. It is to be noted that this numerical characterization method refers strictly to the identities of the amino acids and is transparent to their chemical properties, that is, no distinctions are made between residues that are mutationally conservative or nonconservative, between polar and nonpolar residues, between basic and acidic residues, etc., and all residues are treated at par. As in the case of the g R for the DNA sequences, the p R values also are found to be sensitive to changes in the amino acid sequences (Ghosh et al., , 2010 , and equal values of the p R imply exact duplication of the amino acid composition and distribution along the sequences.
