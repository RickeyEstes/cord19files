The participants were interviewed by two research nurses in a semistructured manner for sociodemographic, medical, and psychiatric data. After then, the participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (SSS). These three rating scales measure the levels of depression, anxiety, and social support, respectively. The SARS cohort was also interviewed on their psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak with the 41-item questionnaire derived from the ethnographic investigations. The questionnaire asked about the worries, perceived risk, and behavioral responses toward the SARS outbreak. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was good (Cronbach a coefficient, .90), and the content validity was supported by the ethnographic inquiry, from which the questionnaire items were drawn. The BDI is a 21-item self-report rating scale commonly used to measure the severity of depression. Its validity and reliability have been thoroughly documented [18] . The Chinese version has also been shown to have good reliability and concurrent validity [19] . Based on previous data and informed clinical experience, we used a cutoff of 14.5 to identify depression of clinical significance [20] . The cutoff was determined before the study began. The STAI is a 40-item self-report rating scale for state and trait anxiety. It is the most commonly used rating scale for anxiety. Its validity and reliability have been carefully evaluated [21] . The Chinese version has been shown to possess comparable psychometric properties [22] . Because the STAI is used to measure intensity of anxiety (rather than to identify probable clinical cases), no cutoff score has ever been recommended. The SSS is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire developed by the Rand and Medical Outcomes Study teams to measure social support. The scale measures positive social interaction, as well as tangible, affectionate, and emotional/informational support. It has good reliability and validity [23] . The Chinese SSS has been validated, showing satisfactory psychometric properties [24] .
