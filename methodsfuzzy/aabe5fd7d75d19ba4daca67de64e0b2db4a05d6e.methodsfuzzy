A mixture of DBU (250 mL, 1.7 mmol) or N-ethylpyrrolidine (86 mL,0.6 mmol) and 92% perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride (410 mg, 1.2 mmol) was stirred in toluene (1 ml) at room temperature for 10 min. A solution of 3 (300 mg, 0.8 mmol) in toluene (3 ml) was added and the resulting mixture was heated at 90 C for 4 h (TLC control in ethyl acetate). The mixture was evaporated and the residue was chromatographed on a silica gel column in a gradient of hexane (100%) to hexane e ethyl acetate (2:9). The yield of 5: 150 mg (50%, reaction with DBU) or 126 mg (42%, reaction with NEP), yellow oil. 1 H, and 13 C NMR data were identical to those described in Method 1.
