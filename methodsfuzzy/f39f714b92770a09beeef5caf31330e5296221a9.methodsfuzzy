Methods currently available to detect respiratory viruses include immunologic techniques, FA, culture, and molecular methods. Although rapid and potentially useful for cohorting patients, immunologic techniques, specifically EIA, lack sensitivity and specificity to compete with the other methods mentioned. FA is more rapid than culture and can be more rapid than molecular methods. FA results can be subjective, require trained personnel to perform interpretation, and lack the sensitivity of culture and molecular amplification. Culture is the only method that will allow survival of a viable isolate that could be used in further studies, such as susceptibility testing. Molecular methods are typically regarded as the most sensitive and will detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. They are also more likely to detect multiviral infections. Molecular methods can detect nonviable viruses; therefore, a positive result may not predict whether an agent is communicable. When using commercially prepared multiplexed molecular reagents, close attention must be paid to the limitations noted in each package insert, such as potential cross-reactions. For instance, primers designed to anneal to rhinovirus may also anneal to enterovirus; therefore, a positive rhinovirus reaction may have to be confirmed by another method, if this distinction is considered clinically important. In other multiplexed assays, it may be recommended that negative results are confirmed by other methods (Luminex, 2008) . False-negative results may also occur due to the emergence of undiscovered viruses or polymorphisms in target sequences. For instance, some molecular reagents not only detect influenza A, but also type the virus. When using these reagents, if influenza A virus is detected but the type cannot be determined, a novel strain may be the reason. In this case, the sample would need to be secured from further manipulation and the proper governmental public health authorities would need to be contacted for further direction. The cost of any diagnostic test is an important consideration when determining which assay to use in the laboratory. It is important to include in these costs the expenses related to performance verification studies, prior to test implementation. Performance characteristics of FDA-cleared kits, other commercial reagents, as well as LDAs must be verified by each clinical laboratory before placing an assay into clinical service. LDAs typically require a more extensive, more costly validation process for the clinical laboratory than commercially produced tests. While the cost of a molecular assay can vary widely, ongoing reagent costs per test in a molecular LDA are usually less than with a molecular commercial assay. When calculating the total cost per assay, the labor involved in producing, aliquoting, labeling, and verifying the performance quality of the assay reagents before placing them into service, as well as troubleshooting the large number of variables in a multiplexed assay, can be extensive and should be included in the cost per test calculation. At the same time, packaging of commercial kits/reagents can be misleading. The actual cost per test can be substantially elevated over the vendor's proposed cost once the expense of performing the quality control required by regulatory agencies is included. Packaging configuration will increase the cost per test if the laboratory's test volume does not allow for optimal use of reagents. Also of note, patents exist for some genetic targets and royalties or licensing fees have to be paid for performing many molecular diagnostic tests. Such fees are often included in the cost of commercial kits, but they must be paid separately when using LDAs. Perhaps the preferred way to use these new multiplexed molecular methods at this time is in algorithms using both conventional and molecular methods. This concept is discussed in a later section of this chapter.
