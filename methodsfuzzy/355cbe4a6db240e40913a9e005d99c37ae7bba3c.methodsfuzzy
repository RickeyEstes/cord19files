Plasmid construction and purification of HCV NS3/4A, SARS-CoV 3CLpro, and PLpro The genes of full-length HCV NS3 (HCV polyprotein residues 1027-1657) with a His-tag at the N terminus and NS4A (residues 1658-1711) were codon optimized, synthesized (BioBasic), and cloned into a pETDuet-1 vector for coexpression. Rosetta 2(DE3) cells (Novagen) containing the recombinant plasmid were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, and the NS3 and NS4A were overexpressed together by 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 25Â°C. Harvested cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (1 mg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail in buffer A: 50 mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-MCE, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol). The His-tag fused NS3 was purified by a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of buffer B (50 mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-MCE, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol) followed by S-200 size exclusion column chromatography for further purification with buffer C (50 mM Hepes [pH 7.6], 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol). The 3CLpro (SARS-CoV polyprotein residues 3241-3544) and the PLpro (residues 1541-1855) genes were prepared by codonoptimized gene synthesis and cloned into pGEX6p-1 and pET15b vectors, respectively. Overexpression and purification of 3CLpro and PLpro were similar to that of NS3 with minor adjustments to buffer components and steps for each protein. The Vernalis lead-like library (96,000 compounds) of the ZINC database (version 7.0) [24] was screened using a multistep screening protocol to select 181 compounds for purchase and enzymatic assay-based testing for inhibitory activity against the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV. A dynamic pharmacophore model was developed based on a multiple protein structure ensemble extracted from extended molecular dynamic simulations on the PLpro enzyme. The 96,000 compounds were screened using this pharmacophore model followed by a second filtering step of flexible docking using GOLD (version 4.0). Clustering using MOE (MACCS) was performed on the top-scoring compounds from the previous two screening steps to select 181 compounds for purchase. Compounds screened for the inhibition of the NS3/4A protease of HCV were from the clean lead-like subsets of the ZINC database (version 7.0) [24] . A multitiered docking protocol was used, with Surflex-Dock and eHiTs progressively used to screen the library to choose 192 compounds for purchase and testing (details will be published elsewhere). The Vernalis lead-like and Clean lead-like subsets of the ZINC database (version 7.0) were screened for prioritizing compounds for experimental testing against the 3CLpro enzyme. The screening protocol employed tiered docking with consensus scoring along with dynamic pharmacophore-based screening. The tiered docking protocol involved docking with Surflex-Dock, followed by clustering to generate a representative set of diverse compounds. The representative sets were further redocked with GOLD followed by rescoring using Amber-Dock. Finally, the compounds were ranked using a rank-sum consensus method. The pregenerated conformations of each molecule of the representative set were compared with the pharmacophore model generated using computational solvent mapping (CSM). The top-scoring commercially available compounds from the pharmacophore hits were visually inspected to eliminate reactive compounds and those that did not efficiently span the binding site. Finally, 186 compounds were ordered for experimental assays.
