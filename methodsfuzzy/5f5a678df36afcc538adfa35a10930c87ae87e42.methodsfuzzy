This was a series of prospective cases between January 2013 and February 2014, which included all patients with acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus in a population over 18 years of age. Throat swabs were taken and assessed for the presence of the coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E. These swabs were used as the only respiratory sample to avoid potential difficulties in the interpretation of the results based on the sample type. The throat swabs were sent to the laboratory in a viral transport medium (MTV, Vircell, Granada, Spain). Only one sample per patient was considered. The samples were processed to detect the various respiratory viruses using a real-time genomic amplification technique (commercial real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit), which provides simultaneous and differential detection of 16 different respiratory viruses (Anyplex RV16, Seegene, South Korea). Blood cultures were performed for patients with suspected pneumonia, and serological determinations for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were conducted. The medical records and epidemiological data of the patients with coronavirus were reviewed. The statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and Student's t-test for paired data. Values of p < .05 were considered significant.
