We performed prospective molecular testing for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 on all respiratory specimens ( Respiratory specimens were centrifuged, and supernatants were analyzed for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by Seeplex respiratory virus detection kit from Seegene. RNA was purified by use of QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Specimens were tested for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by use of Seeplex system, which applies dual specific oligonucleotide (DPO) technology, which produce greatly improve specificity without any false-positive. DPO contains two separate priming regions joined by polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure, which itself is not involved in priming but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5'-segment that initiates stable priming and a short 3'-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool that blocks extension of nonspecifically primed templates, thereby generating consistently high polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specificity, even under less-than-optimal PCR conditions. An internal control was included to check for any problem ocurring during PCR. The hMPV and HCoV-NL63 genes did not cross-react with influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) PIV1, PIV2, PIV3; rhinovirus A; or adenovirus. Positive reverse transcriptase-PCR for hMPV and HCoV-NL63, respectively, was rigorously verified by the Mayo Clinic Laboratory (United States). The clinical data were analyzed and were expressed as percentages where applicable.
