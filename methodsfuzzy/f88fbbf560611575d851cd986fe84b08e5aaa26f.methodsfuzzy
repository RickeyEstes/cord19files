Between December 1990 and August 1993, stool specimens were collected from 554 bovines randomly selected at 30 dairy and beef cattle farms in Arag6n (northeastern Spain). A minimum of five animals per farm were tested. On average, 10% of the total number of animals on each farm were sampled. For each bovine, a single faecal sample was taken from the rectum by using a disposable plastic bag. In calves with diarrhoea, disposable plastic containers were used and the faeces classified according to the consistency: soft, semiliquid or liquid. Animals were classified based on the age range: suckling calves less than 1.5 months old (78), weanling calves aged 1.5-4 months (121), fattening calves and heifers aged 4-24 months (t30) and adults (225). Fresh stool specimens were processed by the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique (Young et al., 1979) and smears of the concentrate (20 I~1) were stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique (Henriksen and Pohlenz, 1981) . The complete surface of the smear was examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts at × 200 and × 400 magnifications. Infection intensities were evaluated semiquantitatively according to the average number of oocysts in 20 randomly selected fields at × 200 magnifications: few (0-1 oocysts per field), moderate (1-5 oocysts per field) and many (more than 5 oocysts per field). This method has been shown to be as accurate as haemacytometer counting (Kao and Ungar, 1994) . Additionally, wet mounts and iodinestained preparations of the sediment were examined by light microscopy for gastrointestinal parasites. Infection rates between different age groups and between diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic bovines were compared by using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, according to the number of expected values. Significance was determined at P < 0.05.
