A systematic literature review of studies on bats in China published between 2000 and 2017 was carried out from August to September 2017. We searched the ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR, Elsevier, and Wiley Online Library databases for papers on "bat" OR "Chiroptera" AND "China". Articles published in Mandarin were searched in the Chinese Scientific database (http://www.cnki.net/) using the same keywords in Mandarin. In addition, we tracked the references cited in the articles to recover papers published in journals that are not indexed in any of these databases. From each publication, we extracted the following information: year of publication, species studied, language (Chinese or English), collecting localities of bats in China (provinces), research topic, destination of voucher material, habitat where the study was conducted (cave, artificial roost, forest, laboratory), and methods used for species identification (morphology, molecular, and echolocation). All species, provinces, and research topics addressed in each paper were computed and treated as independent cases. We categorized the papers into seven main research topics: 'biogeography', 'conservation', 'ecology', 'genetic', 'parasitology/disease', 'physiology/anatomy', and 'systematic/taxonomy' (Table 1) . We update species names following Simmons (2005) and recent revisions. Rhinolophus monoceros and R. cornutus are treated as subspecies of R. pusillus following Li et al. (2006) . Myotis latirostris is allocated in the genus Submyotodon and Myotis ricketti is considered a junior synonym of Myotis pilosus (Ruedi et al., 2015) . Myotis taiwanensis is considered subspecies of Myotis fimbriatus following Ruedi et al. (2015) . Myotis watasei is considered synonym of M. rufoniger and Myotis flavus is treated as subspecies of M. formosus . Previous records of Myotis daubentonii in China refer to Myotix petax (Matveev et al., 2005) . Falsistrellus affinis is allocated in the genus Hypsugo (Görföl and Csorba, 2018) . Thainycteris is considered a valid genus (Francis et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2017) and all Chinese records of Kerivoula titania and Kerivoula hardwickii are attributed to K. furva (Yu et al., 2018) . All Chinese records of Hipposideros bicolor and Rhinolophus rouxii are respectively attributed to H. pomona and R. sinicus (Zhang et al., 2009a) . Hipposideros terasensis is considered subspecies of H. armiger (Thong et al., 2012) . The records of Barbastella leucomelas in China were treated either as Barbastella beijingensis or Barbastella darjelingesis depending on the collecting locality (Benda et al., 2008; Kruskop et al., 2019) . The few records of Miniopterus fuscus and Miniopterus australis were considered misidentifications as these species have no reliable records in China. The Chinese records of Miniopterus schreibersii were treated as M. fuliginosus or M. magnater based on the collection locality (Li et al., 2015) . We consider Plecotus auritus and P. austriacus restricted to Europe (Spitzenberger et al., 2006) and the records of Plecotus from Beijing and Henan provinces are tentatively assigned to P. ognevi. To evaluate trends (proportion and number of publications) on studies of Chinese bats in the last 18 years in relation to research topics, Chinese provinces, and taxa, we used descriptive statistics, bar plots, and Kendall' Tau b coefficient. Pearsonś Chi-squared (X 2 ) was used to test the evenness distribution of the number of publications per research topic, per species, and per Chinese province. As we anticipated an unbalanced distribution of publications per species, we selected five parameters as explanatory variables to understand why some species are more studied than others using quasi-Poisson generalized linear models in R software (R Development Core, 2017). The parameters are: 1) total species distribution, 2) species distribution in China, 3) IUCN threatened status, 4) Chinese threatened status, and 5) presence in caves. Species distribution was calculated in square kilometers based on IUCN spatial data maps (http://www.iucnredlist.org/ technical-documents/spatial-data) using ArcGIS 10.2. The threatened status was based on the most recent assessments of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2017) and the China Mammal Red List . Species that were recently described or underwent recent taxonomic changes were not included in this analysis. Presence in caves was retrieved from Luo et al. (2013) and our own survey. Lastly, we assessed via quasi-Poisson generalized models, whether province area (in square kilometer), province bat diversity and the presence of a bat research unit (institute or university) are correlated with the number of publications per province. The number of species per province was calculated by overlapping the IUCN species geographic ranges using ArcGIS 10.2. Two-hundred and nine studies (35.2%) mentioned the methods used to identify species. The majority of the studies relied only on morphology (63.6%), while exclusively molecular-based meth-ods were applied in 18.6% of the studies. Complementary methods were applied in 35 studies, including molecular and morphology (13.8%), morphology, echolocation, and molecular (1.4%), molecular and echolocation (0.9%). 274 papers mentioned the habitat where the bats were sampled, the majority was focused on caves (63.7%), followed by forests (17.2%), artificial roosts (10.8%) and captivity (8.1%). From the 182 publications that mentioned collecting of bats, only 21.4% listed the final destination (i.e., museum collection) of the voucher material.
