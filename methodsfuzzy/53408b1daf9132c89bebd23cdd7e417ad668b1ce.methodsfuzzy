Study area and sampling. Mazandaran province is one of the 31 provinces of Iran and is located along the Caspian Sea in Iran's Region 3, just east of Gilan province, west of Golestan province, and north of Tehran and Semnan provinces (36.5656째N 53.0588째E). Mazandaran is a major producer of poultry, and poultry farmers in this region provide an important economic addition to the traditional dominance of agriculture. For serology, we collected 460 sera from backyard chickens (9 cities, Table 1 ) during October to December 2014; and for molecular detection and characterization, we collected cecal tonsils from 75 chickens. ELISA. Poultry sera were assayed for IBV antibodies using a commercially available blocking ELI-SA (Biocheck), and antibody titers obtained from samples were also evaluated. Laboratory results of IBV ELISA were entered and managed using Microsoft Excel (Windows 2010). Descriptive statistics for the ELISA antibody titers were performed using the same program. RNA extraction. Viral genomes were extracted from cecal tonsil samples (CinnaPure RNA, Sinaclone, Iran) according to manufacturer's instructions. The extracted viral RNA was contained in a 1.5 mL sterile RNase and DNase-free microtube and stored at -70째C until further use. cDNA synthesis. Viral RNA was reverse transcribed using Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific); cDNAs were stored at -20째C until use.
