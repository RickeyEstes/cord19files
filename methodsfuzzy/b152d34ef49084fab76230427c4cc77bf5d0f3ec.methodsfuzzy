Care Integration Project). Four organizations participated in the pilot study that tested the format of the assessment tools, CCPs and SMGs and the documentation and education processes. The obtained written feedback was used to revise the resource materials, documentation, and educational processes before full implementation. Self-Administered Surveys. In the spring of 2004, frontline health professionals who actively participated in the full implementation of the PCIP were invited to complete a self-administered survey. By this stage, frontline users had been engaged with the PCIP for up to 18 months. Respondent demographics, career history, and clinical experience were collected. This survey measured user impressions of the PCIP, clinical application, relevance and changes to their practice, and any barriers experienced at the time of implementation or afterward. The responses also were used to guide the focus group sessions that followed. The survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency calculations for categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables). Focus Groups. Two independent focus groups were conducted to: 1) capture information regarding the development of the project; and 2) capture information regarding the processes of implementation and usefulness of the different components of the project. Members of the Development Working Groups participated in the focus group sessions held in September 2002. Frontline registered health professionals involved in implementing the PCIP participated in the focus groups held in the spring of 2004. To ensure objective analyses, an independent facilitator was hired to conduct and analyze all of the focus groups. Focus group discussions were tape-recorded and notes taken. These records were then transcribed verbatim. The facilitator confirmed any questionable comments and/or gaps with the focus group attendees.
