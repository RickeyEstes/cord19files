Expevimenral design. The experimental design was based on published guidelines (OECD, I98 1). Three groups of animals were exposed to ADSS; there was a sham-exposed group exposed only to filtered air. Animals were exposed to smoke inside whole-body chambers, using nose-only restraint tubes. A further group of animals was kept as chamber controls (without tube restraint) and as sentinels for the detection of disease. There were 48 animals per sex in each of the five groups. Animals were exposed 6 hr per day for 14 consecutive days. The groups were "stagger-started" at intervals of I day. Animals in satellite groups were kept for a further 14 days without treatment to assess reversibility. and there is a large amount of background inhalation data available in the scientific literature. Within 5 days of delivery, 5 animals per sex were randomly chosen and killed for collection of sera, which was tested for the following antibodies to disease: Reovirus Type 3, cilia associated respiratory bacillus, Kilham's rat virus, Toolan's H-l virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Sendai, rat coronavirus/ sialodacryoadenitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Antibody testing was made on sera obtained from 5 animals per sex at the beginning and end of the inhalation part of the experiment, and at reversibility (total of 20 animals per sex). The lungs from the sentinel animals were taken and examined histopathologically to ascertain health status. Within a week of delivery, the animals were allocated into five groups each of 48 animals per sex, such that the body weights in the groups were as homogeneous as possible. The mean (*SD, II = 240) weight of males at randomization was 142.1 f 7.9 g; in females the mean was 148.4 + 7.9 g. During the week after allocation into groups, animals were tail-tattooed (Animal Identification and Marking Systems. Piscataway, NJ) with their permanent identification number. The animals were housed and cared for in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and amendments (Public Law 91-579), as set forth in CFR Title 9, Part 3 Subpart E, Specifications ,for the Humane Handling. A 30-port smoke generator (CH Technologies, Westwood, NJ) similar to that described by Baumgartner and Coggins (1980) and by Ayres ef al. (1990) was fitted with an aluminum cone ( Fig. I) for collection of sidestream smoke (SS). The smoke generator was placed in a sealed cabinet with a HEPA filter attached. Mainstream smoke was generated under Federal Trade Commission conditions (except butt length: seven puffs were taken instead of burning to a fixed butt length) and was discarded. Sidestream smoke was drawn from the cone into a common plenum, using 3-in.-diam. (76.2 mm) PVC tubing throughout. Different amounts of SS were drawn from the plenum for each chamber and mixed with dilution air drawn from the room through HEPA filters (Fig. 2) . Room air was HEPA-filtered "upstream." The sham and sentinel animals were kept in chambers that were not attached to the plenum. Animal exposure apparatus. The whole-body inhalation chamber has been described previously (Moss et al., 1982) and is available commercially (Lab Products. Maywood, NJ). Each chamber was operated at a flow rate of I6 cubic feet/min (in excess of I5 air changes/hr). The conical nose-only restraint tubes (Baumgartner and Coggins. 1980 ) are also commercially available (CH Technologies, Westwood. NJ); they were used to minimize contamination of the pelt with deposited ADSS which could then be absorbed dermally or ingested during preening (Langard and Nordhagen, 1980) . Tubes for males were 73 mm in diameter and 263 mm long; for females the diameter was 62 mm and the length I68 mm. Both tube types had inlets 22 mm in diameter. The ventilation slots on the restraint tubes were covered with duct tape. On exposure days, individual animals were taken from their cage in the chamber. placed inside a nose-only restraint tube, and replaced in the tube into the same cage. The orientation of the tube was such that urine and feces passed from the tube, through the wire floor of the cage, and onto paper-lined catch pans placed under each of the trays.
