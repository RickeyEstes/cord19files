Clinical efficacy Judgment of the clinical efficacy Based on the ''Evaluation criteria for clinical trials of antimicrobial drugs in the pediatric field'' [6] of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, changes in the main clinical symptoms and findings were used to classify the clinical efficacy into the four grades of ''excellent,'' ''good,'' ''fair,'' and ''poor,'' or ''impossible to judge.'' Judgment at the final observation If clinical efficacy was confirmed at the end of treatment, and it was considered unnecessary to additionally administer antimicrobial agents or prohibited concomitant drugs based on the clinical symptoms and findings, until the final observation day or thereafter, the disease was judged as ''cured.'' If it was necessary to administer a new antimicrobial drug for the disease, it was judged as ''not cured.'' If neither of these judgments could be made, the disease was ''impossible to judge.''
