GFP-tagged (strain AD169), wild-type (H-WT) and H162A mutant (HΔDUB, or DUB-mutant WT-HCMV and DUB-mutant HCMV were kind gifts from Professor Wade Gibson, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. AD169 is extensively passaged, fibroblast adapted laboratory strain of HCMV, which is non-pathogenic; Knockdown experiment: HFFs were transfected with shRNA of MyD88 (Clone D1) or STING (Clone A8), obtained from Sigma Aldrich and selected on puromycin. The transcript level of myd88 and sting was analyzed through qPCR. HCMV infection (5 MOI) was done to knockdown cells for 3 days and on 3 dpi cells were harvested to isolate RNA for real time analysis of IFNβ transcripts. The shRNA against GFP (sh005) was taken as knockdown control. Transfection. Transfection was done using Lipofectamine 2000 or 3000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection related to immunoprecipitation, after 6-7 h post transfection, MG132 was added to the transfected cells to a final concentration of 0.5 μM and incubated for further 30-40 h. Glucose uptake assay. Glucose uptake assay was done as previously described. 61 Cells were seeded at a density of 0.1 x 10 6 cells/well into 48-well plates in 200 μl culture medium and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then incubated in Luciferase based promoter Assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector, expression plasmids containing genes for either, MyD88, STING, TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1 or IRF7 (250 ng/well, 24-well plate), UL48N (250 ng/well, 24-well plate), UL48NΔDUB or UL48NΔNLS (250 ng/well, 24-well plate), along with 100 ng of IFNα4, IFNα6, IFNβ and ISRE promoter containing Firefly luciferase expression plasmid and Renilla Luciferase containing plasmids (pRL-TK, 5 ng/well) as depicted. Luciferase assay was done with total cell lysate containing abovementioned promoters and gene constructs by using Dual-Glo, Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence of each sample was measured by the Glomax (Promega). Wound-healing assay. IMR32 Cells were grown at 100% confluence and transfected with designated plasmids (1 μg/well, 12-well plate, or as indicated). A sharp wound was created using 200 μl pipette tips, 6 h post transfection. Wounds were visualized at × 10 Sigma Aldrich objective lens under the bright field microscope and three random images were captured for few days as indicated. Wound width was measured and plotted as a line graph using GraphPad Prism Version 5. Matrigel invasion assay. Matrigel invasion assay was done as demonstrated at http://www.abnova.com Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunoblotting. For deubiquitination studies, each plasmid was taken 2 μg in concentration for transfection into cells grown in 35 mm culture dish. Cells were treated with 0.5 μM MG132, 6 h post transfection. Cells were harvested after 36 h. of transfection with standard cell lysis buffer supplemented with 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (obtained from Sigma Aldrich) and 10 mM NEM (N-Ethyl Maleimide). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting were done as described previously. 62 Immunoblotted nitrocellulose membrane was imaged with LI-COR system. For endogenous protein detection, mock or HCMV-infected HFFs (grown in sixwell plate) were lysed in 30 μl of standard cell cell lysis buffer and~8 μg of protein was loaded to each well. ImageJ image analysis. Western blot densitometry: an area of interest was selected on the smeary part above the protein bands shown in the immunoblots. Mean density of the selected area was then calculated. Microscopy. The mCherry-tagged UL48N and UL48NΔNLS were transfected in the HeLa cells. After 24 h of transfection, cells were fixed and stained with DNA staining reagent Hoechst 33342. Localization of pUL48 and pUL48NΔNLS was visualized at × 63 with Apotome-AXIO fluorescence microscope by Zeiss. HCMV infection (GFP fluorescence) was visualized with Inverted microscope Vert.A1 (AXIO) by Zeiss. I-IFN receptor blocking. The IFNARα/β receptor was blocked as described previously, 63 using anti-IFNAR chain2 antibody (Clone#MMHAR2, Cat# MAB1155) from Merck. Upon blocking for 4 h, HFFs were infected with HCMV. Statistical analysis. Statsitical analysis was done with the help of GraphPad Prism, version 5. In the bar graph, differences between two groups were compared using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test, whereas the differences between three or more groups was calculated by using one-way analysis of variance by Newman-Keuls test. Differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-valueo0.05, **P-valueo0.01 and ***P-valueo0.001, ns, non-significant difference (P-value40.05).
