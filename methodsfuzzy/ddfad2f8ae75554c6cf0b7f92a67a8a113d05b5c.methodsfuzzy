Selection of the area of studying the home range of feral cats were made by taking into consideration areas where it is judged that there will be frequent contact between feral cats and wild animals in rural areas or city outskirts; areas judged that there will be frequent contact between feral cats and residents and their pets; livestock farms where there were epidemics in the past; and areas where there are largescale habitats for migratory birds. The selected areas were Jukchon-ri in Hwandeung-myeon, Iksan-si of North Jeolla Province, Jangshin-ri in Yongji-myeon, Gimjae-si of North Jeolla Province, Yongheung-ri in Gobu-myeon, Jeongeubsi, North Jeolla Province, Gangjaeng-ri in Damyang-eub, Damyanggun of South Jeolla Province, and Shindae-dong in Heungdeok-gu, Cheongju-si of North Chungcheong Province. All of these regions experienced stamping out in livestock farms due to the onset of HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza). Gangjaen-ri in Damyang-eub, Damyanggun of South Jeolla Province and Shindae-dong in Heungdeokgu, Cheongju-si of North Chungcheong Province are located near the upstream of Yeongsangang (Riv.) and Geumgang (Riv.), respectively, which are both habitats for winter migratory birds. There are many people who visit the river banks and the hiking and biking trail on the terrace land of rivers, providing it higher potential for frequent contact between feral cats and wild animals or humans. Furthermore, Jukchon-ri in Hwangdeung-myeon, Iksan-si of North Jeolla Province, Jangshin-ri in Yongji-myeon, Gimjae-si of North Jeolla Province, and Yongheung-ri in Gobu-myeon, Jeongeubsi, North Jeolla Province are located near fowl farms and habitats for migratory birds, giving it high possibility for contact between feral cats and wild animals, and in particular, with wild birds. Thus, these areas have higher risks of spreading diseases by feral cats. While the capturing of feral cats were examined using their tracks in the study areas, areas frequently having movement of feral cats were selected through interviews with local residents. The capturing trap used was the Tomahawk Live Trap (25×30×81 cm) and chicken and ham were used as bait. After installing the traps, they were checked twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon) and the baits were replaced. After collecting the captured cats, the traps were removed.
