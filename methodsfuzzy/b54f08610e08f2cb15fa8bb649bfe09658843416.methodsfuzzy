We evaluated the performance of the MATLAB implementation of proposed algorithm ''Signal Tool for the Analysis of the Relationship between Sequences'' (i.e., STARS) in terms of computational time with respect to ClustalW and UCLUST. While ClustalW is not strictly a clustering method, we used it for comparison because it is one of the most commonly used tools to evaluate the similarity of multiple sequences. We employed a CPU Intel XEON E5-1650 at 3.50 GHz with 16 GB RAM. 2 Table 1 list the processing time in seconds for the three methods for sets of 8, 17, 35, 70, and 141 sequences of COXI. The time required to transform the 141 sequences from strings of characters to their corresponding PSDs was 0.921 s and it is not considered in Table 1 since this is performed only one time. Note that the time required by STARS is significantly smaller with respect to ClustalW. UCLUST is time-constant at 1 s for every experiment, however, note that the number of clusters generated by this method was practically the same number of sequences (i.e., the method assigns a cluster to each sequence). This is because UCLUST requires a sequences identity range of at least 40% for amino acids and 65% for nucleotides (Edgar, 2010) . Table 2 list the processing times of five datasets of different number of sequences with different length where UCLUST generated a number of clusters different from one cluster for each sequence. Dataset A consisted of 31 sequences of Mammals with average length of 16,695 nucleotides labeled into to seven groups; Dataset B consisted of 38 sequences Note that the computational time required for performing the clustering of the sequences' PSD data is smaller when compared with UCLUST for the same number of clusters for datasets A, B, and D. In the case of dataset E, we could not achieve a result using UCLUST (i.e., the program throws a fatal error) indicating that the data was too big.
