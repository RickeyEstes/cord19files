In this section, we have discussed the methodology that we have used for simulation experiments. We first discuss, one by one the various parameters taken in our model. Also we explain, how we have computed these parameters and finally how we have given the methodology used to predict a new outbreak with the help of a flowchart suggested by Li et al. [21] . • In our model, we have used the random float number R which we have generated in our program by using random number generator. Why do we need R in our model? As we know the outbreak of bird flu is a probabilistic instance and not a deterministic one, even though f (r), D(n), N (n) contribute much to P (n, r), we cannot definitely assure that there will be a certain outbreak of bird flu in a region but can only say that there is enormous possibility or danger for an outbreak to take place. So an additional random parameter R is introduced to reflect the uncertainty. . By means of fitting the above data by curve fitting method, we obtained an approximate formula as follows: where t represents the air temperature. In our simulation, we studied the epidemic for one week till it reached India, that is for a short duration. Hence the temperature change may be taken as a linear approximation regarding the epidemic duration, that is, in which t 1 and t 2 are two constants that can be determined by fitting the average temperature of the various countries through which the virus reached India. In this model t 1 = 0.2 and t 2 = 2.2286 (started on February 13, 2006) . So the relation between the lifetime of the virus and the epidemic duration shall be a compound form of (2) • I (n) stands for the resistibility of poultry on the nth day. Obviously the resistibility will increase with the artificial interventions and the control measures. We assume the increase abides by law similar to Sigmoid function 1/(1+e −x ). Thus I (n) assumes the following form: Apparently, this is a modified sigmoid form. When n = 0, I (0) = 1, and when n = ∞, I (n) = B; which indicates the resistibility is impossible to approach a very big number [21] . • f (r) is the distribution of the probability that infected poultry products are transported a distance r. The basic idea for taking the above mentioned form of f (r) stems from Howlett [19] . The researchers at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self Organization have used the dispersal of dollar bills within the United States as a proxy measurement of human movement (since people cannot be tracked while banknotes travel with the people). They analyzed the data on the peregrinations of more than half-a-million US dollar bills recorded over a five-year period on an online bill-backing system (http://www.wheresgeorge.com) and give a simple model that only depends upon two parameters. Since the poultry products are also imported and exported very frequently, to various countries, we can assume its transport to be very similar to the human movement. So the probability that
