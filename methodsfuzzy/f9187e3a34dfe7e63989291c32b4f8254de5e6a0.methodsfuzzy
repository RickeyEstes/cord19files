Overall workflow of iProt-Sub iProt-Sub represents an advanced version of PROSPER [29] . Importantly, the improvement of iProt-Sub over PROSPER is reflected by the following: (1) larger coverage of more proteases. iProt-Sub can be used to predict protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites for 38 different proteases, whereas PROSPER covered 23 proteases; (2) use of a wider range of sequencederived features. iProt-Sub uses 11 diverse types of sequencebased features (4562-dimensional); (3) application of a more effective feature selection technique to filter out irrelevant and noisy features. iProt-Sub uses the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) [42] algorithm to identify more informative features to enhance the predictive performance: (4) improved predictive performance. Through an effective feature extraction, selection and model learning strategy, iProt-Sub consistently achieves improved predictive performance for predicting the substrate cleavage sites for all tested proteases and (5) completely redesigned interface. The new iProt-Sub Web server now provides a more user-friendly and interactive interface that enhances user experience. The overall flowchart of the iProt-Sub methodology is shown in Figure 1 . SVM is an efficient machine learning algorithm suitable for solving binary classification, multiple classification or regression problems. The version of SVM best suited to predicting numerical outcomes is support vector regression (SVR). In this application, we used SVR to construct the prediction model to estimate the cleavage probability of substrate cleavage sites for a given protease. Owing to its excellent generalization capabilities, SVR has recently been applied in a growing number of applications in bioinformatics and computational biology, including cleavage site prediction [15, 29, 30] , residue accessible surface area [95] , protein B-factor [96, 97] , half sphere exposure [98] , disulfide connectivity [99] , residue depth [54] , torsion angles [29] and protein expression-level prediction [100] . It demonstrates competitive performance compared with other machine learning approaches, especially when dealing with realvalued prediction tasks. The SVR classifier is able to find a linear discriminative function of the form: where U is a basis function that maps the D-dimensional feature vector to a higher dimension. It is noteworthy that although f x ð Þ is a linear function of U x ð Þ, it can itself be a nonlinear function of x, which reflects an attractive advantage of using kernel methods [101] . SVR assumes that the best discriminative function is the one that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes of samples. For implementation of the SVR algorithm, we used the LibSVM software package [102] with the regression mode. The model performance was fully evaluated by using 5-fold crossvalidation and independent tests. The model parameters were optimized using the benchmark training data set, and the predictive performance of the SVR models for each protease was evaluated by performing 5-fold cross-validation using the benchmark data set and independent tests using the independent test data set. In particular, for each major sequence encoding scheme, we trained a corresponding SVR model. In addition, we have also concatenated all the initial features and generated an all feature-based model (referred to as ALL-Fea). We also performed feature selection experiments to identify a subset of optimal features for the cleavage site prediction of each protease, and accordingly trained a selected feature-based model (denoted mRMR-FS).
