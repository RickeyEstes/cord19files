Elucidating the source and route of transmission may be labor and time intensive. For example, the investigation that elucidated the source of the listeriosis outbreak described earlier involved a case-control study of 17 cases conducted by five states, two local health departments, and the CDC to identify potential common sources. The root source--a supplier of processed deli meat--was identified by visiting 13 stores to identify the supplier that they had in common (CDC, 2000c) . Environmental Investigations. Much of the dramatic decrease in U.S. crude death rate in the early part of the 20th century can be attributed to sanitary improvements in water, food, and sewage management (CDC, 1999a) . Outbreaks may result when these practices break down or are not adhered to. An environmental investigation may examine water and food sanitation, underground water, surface water, agriculture, and domestic or wild animals. When there is reasonable possibility that a facility may be involved in an outbreak, investigators request that sanitarians conduct an inspection or review of a facility. Sanitarians (also known as environmental health specialists), using a body of science developed through the past century, routinely inspect and advise food service facilities and recreational and potable water facilities to ensure that environmental safeguards are in place to prevent outbreaks and a return to 19th-century rates of infectious diseases. The sanitarian can quickly determine whether the facility is operating with no violations or practices that would cause an outbreak. If stronger evidence becomes available that a facility or specific environment is involved, the investigators may initiate a more extensive environmental investigation (Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2005a,b) . More generally, an environmental investigation, depending on the problem at hand, explores the environments that provide reservoirs where agents can reside and multiply. When the causative biological agent and the source are unknown, as was the case during the 1976 Legionnaire's outbreak, an environmental investigation can be far-ranging. Food service inspection and investigation methods are well developed as the result of accumulated experience with thousands of foodborne outbreaks. Hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) is a "science based method to identify or prevent hazards which contribute to foodborne disease" (Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2005a) . Critical control points include the appropriate heating and cooling of food. The value of the HACCP method is that it can identify likely points in a path of transmission well in advance of full characterization of an outbreak. A malfunctioning refrigerator, for example, is both a clue to the potential source of an outbreak (staphylococcus can elaborate a toxin, which is heat stable and therefore not neutralized by subsequent cooking) as well as a point for immediate correction to prevent future problems. If a specific food is implicated by survey methods or microbiological analysis, the sanitarian will look very carefully at food preparation steps. The investigators of the 2001 anthrax outbreak conducted environmental investigations in postal processing and distribution centers, offices, and homes to determine the presence of Bacillus anthracis and the paths by which it spread. For the environmental investigation related to the most unusual casethe 94-year-old woman in Connecticut discussed earlierspecialists assessed the patient's activities in her home and searched for letters she received in the prior two months, in addition to conducting sampling in and on the periphery of her home by using swabs on surfaces and high-efficiency particulate ~ air vacuums (Griffith et al., 2003) . Molecular subtyping identified the isolate from the 94-year-old woman as matching the isolates from the other anthrax patients infected through mail. The investigators did not find matching isolates in the woman's home or in any of the places she regularly visited. They did learn by going through her garbage that she regularly tore her bulk mail in half before discarding. And they found that bulk mail that was processed and delivered by her local mail distribution center had been processed in another post office in the 24 hours after heavily contaminated letters. Evidence that at least some of that bulk mail was cross-contaminated came when matching isolates were found on her local bulk mail processing machines. Investigators believe this woman's advanced age, medical condition, and habit of ripping junk mail in half before discarding it contributed to infection from a very low level of contamination of the mail she received. This explanation was the simplest and most biologically plausible. The anthrax environmental investigations led to routine use of biohazard detection systems (BDSs) (Military Postal Service Agency, 2004) to identify mail contamination before mail distribution to the public.
