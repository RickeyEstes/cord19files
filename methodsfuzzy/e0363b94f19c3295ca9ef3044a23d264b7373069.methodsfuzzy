Six genome sequences of coronaviruses and the annotation information were downloaded from the web site of NCBI RefSeq project (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq/). These coronaviruses include avian infectious bronchitis virus (NC_001451), bovine coronavirus (NC_003045), human coronavirus 229E (NC_002645), murine hepatitis virus (NC_001846), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (NC_003436), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (NC_002306). A total of 48 genes were extracted from the above six genomes and used to train the gene-finding algorithm. Currently, 15 genome sequences of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains are available in the GenBank database, of which there are 11 complete and four partial genomes, respectively. The former includes SARS-CoV TOR2 (Accession No. AY274119), Urbani (AY278741), HKU-39849 (AY278491), CUHK-W1 (AY278554), BJ01 (AY278488), CUHK-Su10 (AY282752), SIN2500 (AY283794), SIN2748 (AY283797), SIN2679 (AY283796), SIN2774 (AY283798), and SIN2677 (AY283795), whereas the latter includes SARS-CoV BJ02 (AY278487), BJ03 (AY278490), BJ04 (AY279354), and GZ01 (AY278489), respectively. The gene-finding algorithm presented in this paper is based on the Z curve [13] , which is a graphic representation of DNA sequences. The Z curve method has been used to recognize protein coding genes in the budding yeast genome [14] . A new ab initio gene-finding system for bacterial and archaeal genomes has been developed recently, based on the Z curve method [12] . Here the method with some modifications is used to recognize protein coding genes in coronavirus genomes, which is presented briefly as follows. Suppose that the occurrence frequencies of the bases A, C, G, and T (U) at the first, second, and third codon positions in an ORF are denoted by a i ; c i ; g i , and t i , respectively, where i ¼ 1; 2; 3. The four numbers, a i ; c i ; g i , and t i , are mapped onto a point in a 3-dimensional space V i with the coordinates Then, each ORF may be represented by a point or a vector in a where the symbol È denotes the direct-sum of two subspaces. The nine components u 1 -u 9 of the space V are defined as follows: To train the system, two sets of samples are needed, which are positive samples corresponding to protein-coding genes (seed ORFs) and negative samples corresponding to non-coding sequences. In the Z curve method, essentially, the gene recognition is based on the com-positional asymmetry of three codon positions in coding sequences. It was shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in RNA viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes [15] . Coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae and the G + C content of the published coronavirus genomes ranges from 37% to 42% [7] . Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the published coronavirus genomes have similar codon usage. Based on this consideration, it is possible that gene-finding parameters derived from some published coronavirus genomes may be applied to recognize genes in other coronavirus genomes. Because the SARS-CoV genomes are relatively small (%30 kb), it is difficult to obtain enough seed ORFs from its own genome. Therefore, we used some other published coronavirus genomes to train gene-finding parameters. Consequently, the genomes of avian infectious bronchitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E, murine hepatitis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respectively, were used, in which 48 seed ORFs were selected. The detailed information about the 48 seed ORFs is described in Table 1 of the supplementary materials (see: http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/). Below we describe the strategy to produce the negative samples. It is a rather difficult problem to produce an appropriate set of noncoding sequences in coronavirus genomes, because the amount of noncoding DNA sequences in these genomes is too few to be used. A method to produce negative samples has been developed previously and it has been shown to be an effective way to solve the problem [12] . The same method is still used in the current study. In this method, a negative sample is just derived from a seed ORF. Generally speaking, if the regular structure of a coding sequence is completely destroyed, it is transformed into a non-coding one. Therefore, the negative sample may be simply obtained by shuffling the corresponding coding sequence sufficiently (20,000 times in current study). The resulting random sequences from all 48 seed ORFs were used as non-coding sequences. The major difference is that the former has some regular structures, whereas the latter is a random sequence. In fact, a random sequence is not a non-coding sequence, but it is a good approximation. As shown below, this approximation generally results in good genefinding results. The Fisher linear equation for discriminating the positive and negative samples in the 9-dimensional space V represents a superplane, described by a vector c which has nine components c 1 ; c 2 ; . . ., and c 9 . For more details about Fisher discrminant algorithm, refer to, for example [14] . Based on the data in the training set (including the positive and negative samples), the vector c and the threshold c 0 are obtained. The decision of coding/non-coding for each ORF and negative sample is simply made by the criterion of c Á u > c 0 =c Á u < c 0 , where c ¼ ðc 1 ; c 2 ; . . . ; c 9 Þ T , u ¼ ðu 1 ; u 2 ; . . . ; u 9 Þ T , and "T" indicates the transpose of a matrix. The criterion of c Á u > c 0 =c Á u < c 0 for making the decision of coding/non-coding can be rewritten as ZðuÞ > 0= ZðuÞ is called the Z score or Z index for an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence. Finally, the strategy to deal with overlapping ORFs used here is similar to that described in the previous paper [12] .
