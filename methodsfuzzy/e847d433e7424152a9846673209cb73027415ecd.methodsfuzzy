Methods: Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the test panel to CLSI reference (REF) panel. Strains tested included staphylococci obtained through NARSA (53 strains with reduced susceptibility to Va and 3 VRSA) and 50 Enterococci (CDC challenge set with 25 VRE). An additional 172 isolates of S. agalactiae, S. bovis, and recent Staphylococci and Enterococci were evaluated. All testing included turbidity and Prompt inocula, and three read methods: WalkAway and autoSCAN-4 instruments, and manual. In addition, the three NARSA VRSAs and one additional VRSA were tested at CDC and MicroScan panels read manually. Results: Testing with revised Va formulation showed 3 VRSA to have MICs >16 lg/ml at 16 h with WalkAway or manual read, and >16 lg/ml at 18 h with the autoSCAN-4. Testing of the fourth VRSA at CDC showed a stably resistant morphotype giving MICs of >16 lg/ml with manual read. Results obtained were equivalent to REF for 100% sensitivity in detection of VRSA isolates. Combined results for all strains tested were >97% in essential agreement and >93% in categorical agreement (M100-S15) with REF. There were no very major or major errors. Conclusion: The revised formulation of Va on MicroScan Dried Overnight Panels showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Va resistance was detected in all VRSA available at the time of comparative testing and VRE without overcalling resistance in Vasusceptible GPC. Aim of the study: Rapid identification and antibacterial susceptibility testing of micro-organisms isolated in blood cultures (BC) can be valuable for clinical management of sepsis. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of a scheme based on direct identification and susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci by direct inoculation of specially treated fluid collected from positive Bactec 9240 culture bottles into BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (PHX system; BD) . Results were compared to those obtained by usual standard procedures. Materials and methods: 100 positive monomicrobic blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus spp. excluded) collected between March 2005 and August 2005 were assessed in the study. Shortly, a Serum Separator Tube (Vacutainer SST-II; BD) filled with fluid aspirated from a positive BC bottle was centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor. After discarding the supernatant, the bacterial layer was resuspended and then inoculated dropwise into a PHX system ID broth in order to obtain a suspension matching a McFarland 0.5 standard. The remaining of the panels setup and loading was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results: By comparison with the identification obtained by standard procedure, direct method by Phoenix system correctly identified 27/36 (75%) Staphylococcus aureus, 12/20 (60%) Staphylococcus epidermidis, 18/30 (60%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus other than S. epidermidis and 9/14 (65%) Enterococcus spp. Among the 1378 antibiotic-isolate combinations of antimicrobial susceptibility tested, 97.7% showed category agreement. The number of very major, major and minor error was 4 (0.3% of false susceptibility), 4 (0.3% of false resistance) and 21 (1.5% of all antibiotic-organism combinations) respectively. Conclusion: For gram-positive cocci, the rapid direct method combining BD Phoenix System and Bactec cultures does not provide acceptable bacterial identification, but the susceptibility results obtained more rapidly are accurate for routine use and can be valuable in the clinical management of sepsis. We used gyrB RFLP analysis to type 102 clinical S. maltophilia isolates from two Western Australian hospitals, and 50 environmental S. maltophilia isolates from hospital wards and unrelated sites (non-hospital). Results: All 152 isolates were typable by this method. Fifteen genomic groups were identified at a 100% similarity level, with 33.6% of isolates identified as a single gyrB RFLP-type. The second most common type included 23.7% of the isolates tested and the S. maltophilia type strain (ATCC 13637). Environmental isolates from non-hospital sites were more diverse than isolates from hospital sites which may indicate selection of certain gyrB RFLP-types in a hospital setting. Two gyrB RFLP-types were found exclusively in hospital environmental samples and clinical specimens; these types may be involved in nosocomial infections. The second most common gyrB RFLP-type from clinical isolates was also common in environmental samples from the intensive care unit but not in other environmental samples. Additionally, four gyrB RFLP-types were found only in clinical specimens. These five gyrB RFLP-types may be more likely to cause infection than the three types that were found only in environmental samples. Conclusions: As a typing system for S. maltophilia, gyrB RFLP analysis showed excellent typability and reproducibility, and was rapid, easy to perform, and easy to interpret. Relatively low discriminatory power means broad genomic groups are identified and the characteristics of these groups can be investigated. In this study, gyrB RFLP analysis revealed distinct differences in gyrB RFLP-types present in hospital and non-hospital settings, and clinical specimens. Objectives: Mycobacterium kansasii is an opportunistic pathogen of human disease. The aim of this study is to analyse clinical isolates of M. kansasii isolates from Taiwan by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with restriction enzyme AseI and compare the results to those from Europe, Japan, and the United States. Methods: From August 1999 through January 2003, a total of 40 clinical isolates of M. kansasii from 40 patients were collected from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a tertiary referral medical centre in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Control strain was ATCC 12478 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Clinical isolates were analysed by PCR restriction enzyme analysis (PRA) of the 441-bp Telenti fragment of the hsp-65 gene and PFGE of genomic DNA with restriction endonuclease AseI. Isolates were considered clonal if they exhibited six or less band differences as defined by Tenover et al. for outbreak strains. The Gene Profiler program (Scanalytics, Inc., VA, USA) calculated the similarity index by setting the fragment length error tolerance at 2% and 0.4 DNA difference. Results: With AseI, only 32 clinical isolates were typable and separated to 9 clusters of genotypes. And 22 of 32 isolates (68.8%) generated one major cluster, including 3 similar genotype patterns (Figure) . They were genetically related according to the definition described by Tenover et al. (1995) . This major clone was indistinguishable from the major pattern seen in the studies of Europe, Japan, and the United States. Conclusions: This study demonstrated one major clone of M. kansasii present in Taiwan, which has the indistinguishable pattern. Compared with the studies of Europe, Japan, and the United States, a major genotype is spreading worldwide and it should be potentially pathogenic. Bacterial pathogenesis -I Objective: Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are emerging resistance determinants in Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is known, that colimycin (colistin), the old polymyxin derivative is active in vitro against the pan-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. In this work, we present an outbreak due to colistin and carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a Greek tertiary hospital. Methods: Six multi-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were recovered from four patients over a two-week period between September and October 2005, in our ICU. The source of the specimens was: 1 from blood culture, 2 from bronchial secretions, 1 from pleural fluid, 1 from pus and 1 from IV catheter. Commercial ID panels identified the strains and susceptibility to a broad panel of antimicrobial agents was determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines. E-test also determined resistance to colistin and carbapenems. Isolates were investigated for the presence of the blaVIM-1 allele by PCR. Class 1 integrons were detected and molecularly characterized by sequencing. Results: All isolates were found resistant to the following antimicrobial agents tested: aminoglycosides amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin-, piperacillin, piperacillin/ tazobactam, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavoulanate, carbapenems imipenem, meropenem, quinolones ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, moxifloxacin-, trimethoprim/sulfa and colistin. Three isolates were found susceptible to aztreonam with MIC of aztreonam 2 mcg/ml. The blaVIM-1 gene was detected in all strains. The same class 1 integron was found in all strains. Its sequence analysis revealed the presence of other antibiotic resistance genes, apart from the blaVIM-1 allele. Conclusion: This is a rare report of a nosocomial outbreak caused by colistin resistant P. aeruginosa producing MBL. Resistance to colistin was correlated with the increased use of colistin over the last year in ICU, due to prevalence of MBL mediated carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa in ICU patients. All isolates harboured class 1 integrons, which means a rapid spread of the resistant genes in nosocomial environment. Control measures (hand hygiene and restriction of colistin use) resulted to disappear the above colistin resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous bacteria prevalent in the nature. This microorganism is opportunistic pathogen. P. aeruginosa has often been reported as the cause of outbreaks of nosocomial infections in hospital units. P. aeruginosa strains exhibit high rates of resistance to antibiotics and are frequently multidrug-resistant. Objective: The aim of this paper was the epidemiological investigation of the group of twenty P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients treated in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Materials and methods: Twenty P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from respiratory track, wounds and urine. Eleven of them derived from three patients: six came from patient No. 1, two from No. 2 and three from No. 3. They were isolated in different time during hospitalisation. The isolates were identified in the ATB system (bioMerieux) using ID 32 GN strips. The antibiotic susceptibility was performed using diskdiffusion method. RAPD-PCR analysis of investigated strains were carried out with primers ERIC-2 and PAL-2. Results: Examination of RAPD fingerprints using ERIC-2 primer in the group of six strains isolated from patient No. 1 revealed no differences in genotypes, despite the fact that they presented different phenotypes of antibiotic susceptibility. Whereas primer PAL-2 revealed two clusters of genotypes. RAPD analysis of two strains obtained from patient No. 2 using two primers enabled to characterize strains of nondistinguishable genotype. Genotyping of strains of patient No. 3 using ERIC-2 primer showed no differences between isolates, whereas PAL-2 primer confirmed the occurrence of two clusters of genotypes. In the group of nine P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different patients analysis of ERIC-2 fingerprints displayed seven clusters of genotype. One of them included three isolates from different patients. PAL-2 showed six unique patterns. One of them included two strains, second genotype included three P. aeruginosa strains. All isolates were acquired from different patients. Strains number 19 and 20 isolated from remaining patients were nondistinguishable using both primers. Conclusions: Current study indicated a high degree of genetic diversity among P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients of ICU. Our investigations confirmed among patients subjected to longer treatment during stay in ICU lack of changes in genotypes in comparison with phenotypes connected with their antibiotic susceptibility. The study population involved a total of 439 patients that referred to the NRITLD, the referral tuberculosis centre in Iran; during March 21st, 2003 to March 21st 2004. The isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains have been characterized by performing susceptibility tests against four first-line antituberculosis drugs and were then subjected to spoligotyping characterization. PCR was used for detection of pcaA gene and its nucleotide sequence was also determined. Results: Spoligotyping of M. tuberculosis strains resulted in 140 different patterns that divided into three evolutionary groups (É , É É , É É É ). One hundred twenty-two (87.1%) of these spoligotype isolates were unique and reported for the first time. The remaining18 (12.8%) spoligotype patterns were previously reported from other geographical regions of the world. Interestingly, 6.3% of the strains belonged to the Beijing family. The MDR (multi drug resistance), double and triple resistance were seen in group É of evolutionary scenario. The pcaA gene was detected in M. tuberculosis clinical isolates but not in saprophyte strains such as M. kansasi.
