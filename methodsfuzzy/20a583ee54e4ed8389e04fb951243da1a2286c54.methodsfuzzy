There are some methodological aspects to which the cost-eff ectiveness of vaccines is particularly sensitive. First, the defi nition of the analytical viewpoint is crucial. Guidelines for economic evaluation, as used by most advisory committees, generally focus on direct health-care costs and do not consider indirect costs to society (eg, the value of lost productive and leisure time from illness or caregiving). These indirect costs can be very large for infectious diseases that aff ect virtually the entire population, even for generally benign illness. For example, the cost-eff ectiveness of childhood VZV vaccination is unlikely to be thought acceptable from the health-care budget perspective, but is possibly cost-saving from a societal perspective. 8, 11, 27 Second, the use of quality-adjusted life-years is widely advocated as the best measure currently available for valuing health states. However, standardised quality-oflife estimates for short-term diseases in young children are virtually non-existent, and the appropriate methods to measure them are subject to debate. [28] [29] [30] Additionally, the impact of a child's illness on the quality of life of caregivers can be substantial, just as it is for lifethreatening and severe chronic diseases in adults (eg, cancer). 31 However, such indirect quality-of-life losses are typically not accounted for. These impacts have the potential to change decisions, for instance on rotavirus vaccine. 32 Finally, the peace of mind off ered through the reassurance of vaccine protection is a quality-of-life improvement of prevention programmes that is routinely ignored in economic evaluation. 33 A third issue is the impact that discounting has in accounting for time preference. Discounting is a technique that aims to put costs and benefi ts occurring at diff erent timepoints on the same basis of comparison. Discounting scales down future events, such that, the further into the future they occur or the higher the discount rate, the less important they are to a decision maker in the present. In health economics, there is continued debate about whether the discount rate for health outcomes should be lower than or equal to that for costs. 34, 35 For curative therapies, most benefi ts accrue immediately or shortly after the intervention is initiated, and the cost-eff ectiveness of these interventions is therefore largely independent of these methodological disagreements on discounting. Conversely, the costeff ectiveness of most prevention programmes is highly sensitive to discounting because of the long time spans over which benefi ts accrue. A slight decrease in discount rate-eg, from 5% to 3%-could change the costeff ectiveness of vaccination from unacceptable to attractive. Country-specifi c recommend ations on discount rates vary to the extent that a vaccine could be deemed cost eff ective in one country and cost-ineff ective in another for this reason alone (table 1). In the standard discount procedure, as recommended in all guidelines known to us, the discount rate is constant, implying that preferences between outcomes are held constant through time and depend only on the length of the time interval between them. One can argue that discounting at a constant rate exaggerates the importance we give for the present over the future. [46] [47] [48] This assertion is backed by psychological empirical evidence, which suggests that the diff erence between equidistant outcomes is thought less important the further into the future the outcomes occur. 47 So-called "slow" discounting procedures could be used for cases in which the discount rate decreases and falls close to zero for the more distant future (eg, 3·5% for years 0-10, 1·5% for years 11-20, 0% thereafter), thus yielding a higher present value of benefi ts. 49, 50 Additionally, time preference may exist only to the time until risk exposure, and not the time until health consequences from risk exposure arise (eg, cervical cancer is the health consequence of a much earlier exposure to HPV). 51 Adjustment of the discount procedure to account for these aspects is not current practice, but would substantially improve the estimated cost-eff ectiveness of prevention versus cure. 49, 50 Currently, policy makers are presented with very wide cost-eff ectiveness ranges for preventive public-health actions when sensitivity to discounting is illustrated to them. In 1968, Baumol 52 noted the "sorry spectacle" that economists provided through their diverging understandings on this subject, and his assertion that "little help is provided to the decision maker who is confronted with such an enormous range of Finally, the equity impact of vaccination is far less predictable than for most drugs. Generally, the less healthy or less wealthy are those least likely to be vaccinated, and thus more likely to experience the eff ect of herd immunity from other people receiving vaccination. As shown for measles in Bangladesh, 53 this eff ect is often equitable, but the reverse may also occur for poorly executed vaccination programmes. 54 The redistribution eff ects on health and wealth are thus less straightforward in the prediction of decisions on vaccination compared with those used for therapeutic medicines.
