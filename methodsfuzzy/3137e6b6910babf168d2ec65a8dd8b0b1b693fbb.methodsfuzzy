All clinical samples were processed through the hospital laboratory. Blood cultures were ordered for each case-patient, and, after the outbreak was detected, stool was tested for the following pathogens: Clostridium difficile via toxin test (n 5 7), norovirus (n 5 7), rotavirus (n 5 6), and other enteric pathogens (n 5 6). Information regarding test results and their accompanying dates was collected from hospital medical records. Anaerobic testing of stool or environmental samples was not available through the New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Division or local private laboratories limiting the ability to identify anaerobic pathogens. When the cluster was identified, the nursing and dietary staff immediately isolated all remaining commercial feeding products for possible testing. Human milk fortifier (HMF) (Enfamil; Mead Johnson, Glenview, IL) and single-use liquid formula with and without iron in 20-and 24-calories/oz formulations were among the isolated products and were sent to New Mexico Scientific Laboratory Division for aerobic bacterial contamination testing. HMF, used to increase levels of nutrients and calories in expressed breast milk, was available in single-use, 0.71-g packets of dry powder. Because of the limited volume in each HMF packet, contents from multiple packets sharing the same prefix lot code were combined to produce sufficient volume for testing. Microsoft Excel, 2003, (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) was used for all data management, descriptive analyses, and cluster analysis.
