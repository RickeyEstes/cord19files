The use of EBV to immortalize human memory B cells has been reported more than 30 years ago but impact in the field has been modest because of the low efficiency of B cell immortalization and difficulties in cloning the immortalized B cells [27] [28] [29] . As a matter of fact the method was abounded in last years in favour of alternative methods such as humanization of mouse antibodies [30] , selection from phage-display libraries [20, 21] , or immunization of mice carrying human Ig loci [19] . We recently found that addition of a TLR agonist such, for instance, the TLR9 agonist CpG, can increase more than 100-fold the efficiency of EBV B-cell immortalization and facilitate cloning of immortalized B cells [31 ] . This method fully exploits the potential of the human immune response. In particular it is possible to select donors that have mounted particularly effective antibody response to the target pathogen by analyzing serum antibodies and then immortalize their memory B cells for the rapid isolation of B cell clones producing monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies secreted in the culture supernatant can be screened using both binding and, importantly, neutralization assays. In this context is worth emphasizing that not all antibodies that bind to a viral glycoprotein have also neutralizing activity, since not all epitopes are displayed on the infectious viral particle. The B cell clones isolated using the EBV method are stable and secrete antibodies at high rate (10-50 mg/L in the culture supernatants) which facilitates antibody production for preclinical studies (Figure 1 ). As a proof of principle we have been able to rapidly isolate 35 monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS coronavirus from memory B cells of an infected donor [31 ] . Interestingly, some of these antibodies have potent neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo. Recently, four of these antibodies have been shown to neutralize all SARS coronaviruses available including three human and two animal isolates (B. Rocks, D. Corti et al., submitted). For two of such antibodies the epitopes recognized have been mapped to the receptor-binding site, while a third antibody recognizes a distinct site. Based on these findings it would be possible to formulate a cocktail of two to three antibodies that are both broadly neutralizing and recognize non-overlapping epitopes in order to provide broad protection and minimize the risk of selecting escape mutants. In a similar process, we have isolated from a small sample of frozen PBMC from two patients recovered from H5N1 infection, several human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize H5N1 both in vitro and in vivo [32 ] . Notably, these antibodies can work also in a therapeutic setting since they protect mice even when given three days after injection of lethal infectious dose. In addition several antibodies were found to neutralize both clade 1 and clade 2 H5N1 viruses. Besides the above applications in response to emerging pathogens, the method finds is also suitable for the characterization of the antibody response against complex pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum. In this case, human monoclonal antibodies have been isolated to characterize the response against VAR2CSA a molecule that mediates adhesion of infected erythrocytes to placental endothelium [33] . Other project ongoing in the authors' laboratory on HCV, HIV-1 and CMV and Dengue virus, further demonstrate the general applicability of the method. The application of the B cell immortalization method may go far beyond infectious diseases. Indeed, several studies have shown that autoantibodies to cytokines can be produced by patients with inflammatory diseases and even by normal individuals [18] and that a small fraction of cancer patients mount an antibody response to antigens expressed by tumor cells [34] . It is possible that autoreactive antibodies isolated from such donors may find applications as diagnostics or therapeutics. 526 Pharmaceutical biotechnology
