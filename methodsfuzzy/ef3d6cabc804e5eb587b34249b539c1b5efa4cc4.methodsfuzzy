Viral and bacterial strains. The 10 ng ml −1 M-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec). THP− 1 MDMs were obtained by culturing cells with 10 ng ml -1 phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Invivogen, Toulouse, France) for 72 hours. Human airway epithelial cells (HAEC, bronchial cell type) originated from a 54-years old woman with no pathology reported (batch number MD056501) were provided by Mucilair (Epithelix, Geneva, Switzerland). Sterility, tissue integrity (TEER), mucus production and cilia beating frequency have been certified by the company. Gene expression profiling. Total cellular mRNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse-transcription of total mRNA was performed using the RT 2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Hilden, Germany). The expression of 84 genes involved in the human innate and adaptive immune responses was evaluated using the RT 2 profiler ™ PCR Array (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The Δ Δ Ct method was applied to calculate the fold changes in gene expression for each gene relative to uninfected control cells using the web-based RT 2 profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (SABiosciences).
