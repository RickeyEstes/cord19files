Nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens from influenza patients are received directly from sentinel primary care physicians participating in virological surveillance schemes in the community. Samples are also received from community, hospitalised and fatal cases are forwarded to the Tunisia National Influenza Centre for diagnostic and further characterisation. A total of 7350 specimens from influenza patients were collected in Tunisia during 2009-2010 season and 894 specimens during 2010-2011 season. The samples used in this study were taken from 50 patients including 42 respiratory specimens from severe (patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome) and fatal cases, as well as from 8 cases with mild clinical outcomes. Mild cases presented with at least one of the following influenzalike illness symptoms: fever of at least 38°C, cough, rhinorrhea, headache, or abdominal symptoms (i.e., diarrhea and vomiting). Viral RNA was extracted from respiratory samples (Oro-pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs) using commercially available QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit QIAGEN as per manufacturer's instructions. For initial detection of Influenza A virus, amplification of matrix protein (M) gene was carried by real time RT-PCR CDC protocol [13] . For subtyping of Influenza A positive samples, the HA gene (segment 4) of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were analyzed by specific real-time PCR using "Influenza virus A 1 Real Time RT-PCR Kit" (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co. Ltd). In order to identify the Changes in HA amino acid diversity in individual cases, genetic characterisation is performed by targeted haemagglutinin (HA) sequence analysis and/or partial genome (931 nucleotide residues) sequencing for a subset of isolates. All viruses analyzed were amplified and sequenced according to the protocol of National Influenza Centre Madrid [14] . Primers PHA1+ (5'-GGGGTTAGCAAAAGCAGGRG-3') and PHA1− (5'-CAWCCRKCIAYCAKICCWKICCAICC-3') were used for RT-PCR and H1 + SSEQB (5'-AAYAAYTCIACYGACAC TG-3') and H1-ASEQ (5'-CCCTCAATRAAACCRGCA AT-3') for nested PCR. The sequences were analyzed using the maximum composite likelihood method and the MEGA version 4.0 software package with 500 bootstrap replicates [15] . Nucleotide sequence accession numbers: The nucleotide sequences of HA determined in this study can be found in GenBank databases under the indicated accession numbers JN037697 to JN037779 (http://WWW.ncbi.nih. gov/genomes/FLU/SwineFlu.html).
