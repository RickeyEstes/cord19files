Plasmids and antibodies. To construct the p17 gene of ARV S1133 strain, purified double-stranded RNA genome was used as template to generate cDNA by reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward and reverse PCR primer sequences used were as follows: 5 0 -CGTTGGATCCTGGTAAGCACAATGCAATGGCTC CG-3 0 , 5 0 -CTTCAAGCTTGGTCAGCCGTTCATAGATCG-3 0 . The underlined sequence indicates BamHI and HindIII cleavage sites, respectively. In the RT-PCR test, 1 lg of purified dsRNA was denatured in boiling water for 10 min, chilled on ice for 5 min, and then used as a template. RT-PCRs were performed according to procedures provided by Perkin Elmer (Branchburg, NJ, USA). Reverse transcription was carried out at 50°C for 60 min. PCRs were subjected to 35 cycles consisting of denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and extension for 90 s at 72°C, and one final extension cycle at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and then ligated into the corresponding site of pcDNA 3.1(À) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogene, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The p53 dominant negative mutant expression plasmid was purchased from (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). p53-luciferase reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). p53 and p21 cip1/waf1 mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The actin mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Oncogene (Darmstadt, Germany). Anti-rabbit conjugated with FITC antibody was purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against p17 was produced by Genesis Biotech in Taiwan. Cell culture and transfection. Vero, BHK, 293, and HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with EarleÕs salt and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Cells at 70% confluence were transfected with plasmids using SuperFect transfection reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. Following incubation for the indicated time period, cells were harvested for further analysis. Immunofluorescence staining. 2 · 10 3 monolayer cells were grown on coverslips and were transfected with p17 expression plasmid or control vector. For a 48 h incubation, the monolayers were washed twice with PBS and fixed in methanol at À20°C for 30 min. Then blocking was carried out in 10% FBS in PBS solution at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times, p17 rabbit polyclonal antibody was diluted 200· in blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing for three more times, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit-FITC antibody in blocking buffer with 500· dilution. The indication of nucleus localization was according to the propidium iodide (PI) counter staining protocol (Molecular Probe, Carlsbad, CA, USA). FITC was detected by using the 488 nm excitation line and analyzing the emission between 500 and 535 nm. The absorption maximum for PI is 535 nm and the fluorescence emission maximum is 617 nm. Trypan blue dye staining. 2 · 10 5 cells were seeded onto a 35 mm tissue culture plate. After transfection with indicated plasmid, cells were washed and additionally incubated for various time periods. Cells were collected by trypsinization and suspended in cultured medium. Viable and non-viable cells were then determined by direct counting using a hemocytometer in the presence of 0.5% trypan blue. The doubling time was calculated by the following formula: T (double time) = time duration · log 2/log (newly harvested cells) À log (number of cells originally plated) [29] . MTT assay. MTT assay was performed with modification of methods described by Carmichael et al. [4] . Cells were plated in 48-well plates at a concentration of 5 · 10 3 . Transfection was described above. Following incubation with various time periods, and tetrazolium-based compound (MTT) was added into individual wells at a final concentration of 125 lg/ ml. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Following incubation, the media were removed completely, 100 ll DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan dye. The purple formazan solution was transferred to 96-well plates and immediately read at 540 nm with a spectrophotometer (Biotek Instruments, Burlington, VT, USA). ID 50 was defined as 50% reduction of 540 nm absorbance. LDH assay. 5 · 10 3 cells per well on a 96-well plate were cultured overnight. Transfection with 0.2 lg pcDNA3.1(À) or p17-pcDNA3.1(À) expression plasmid per well. Following incubation for the indicated time periods, cells were harvested for LDH analysis and cytotoxicity was determined according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. The kit was purchased from Roche (Nutley, NJ). Briefly, 100 ll test sample mix with 100 ll reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 25°C under light protection. The LDH activity detected in the cultured supernatant cells correlated to the proportion of lysed cells. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm. DNA fragmentation analysis. Cells transfected with indicated plasmid or infected with ARV S1133 strain were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The supernatant was collected and incubated with RNaseA at a final concentration of 500 lg/ml for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequently, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 500 lg/ml. The mixtures were then incubated overnight at 55°C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in TE 8.0 , and subjected to 1.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. Total RNA was reacted with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized using 5 lg of total RNA as the template and oligo(dT) 20 as primers as described in the manufacturerÕs protocol of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The cDNA mixtures were subjected to PCR using Taq polymerase (Promega) and oligonucleotide primer pairs specific to the cDNA for p27 kip , p15 INK4b , p21 cip1/waf1 , and p16 INK4a and actin [19] . So that amount of specific PCR product semi-quantitatively reflected the level of mRNA. The number of PCR cycles was restricted to 28-30, representing the late exponential range for PCR product [27] . The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Thirty micrograms of total protein from the supernatant was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated (4°C overnight shaking) with first antibody. The dilution fold was according to the manufacturerÕs instruction. The blots were then incubated with HRPconjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) at room temperature for 2 h. The labeled bands were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents and exposure to X-ray film. Luciferase assay. p53-luc, contained a p53 response element, located upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene). pcDNA3.1(À) or p17-pcDNA3.1(À) with p53-luc and pRKbetaGAL were transfected into the designated cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested. Luciferase and b-galactosidase activities were quantified by the Luciferase Assay System and the b-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega), respectively. The luciferase activity was normalized to b-galactosidase activity to account for the transfection efficiency.
