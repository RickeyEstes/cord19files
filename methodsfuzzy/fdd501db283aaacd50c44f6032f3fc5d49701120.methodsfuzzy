Cell viability/cytopathogenic effect (CPE) reduction assays are usually employed for the initial identification of molecules with activity against CHIKV (Bassetto et al., 2013; Bourjot et al., 2014; Cruz et al., 2013; Delang et al., 2014; Jadav et al., 2015) . The advantage of this type of cell-based assay is the possibility of discovering/identifying new antiviral targets. It also allows evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of putative antiviral molecules. African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells are the most commonly used cells in these assays. Other cell types used for screening for CHIKV antivirals include baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-239T) cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and human hepatocarcinoma (HuH-7) cells. These commonly used cell lines have however no clinical relevance in CHIKV disease. Human muscle satellite cells (Ozden et al., 2007) or macrophages may be more relevant cell lines, but they are not suitable for high-throughput screening campaigns. Virus-induced CPE can be scored microscopically and/or quantitatively measured by colorimetric assays such as resazurin fluorescence reduction assay (Cruz et al., 2013; Jadav et al., 2015) , the MTS/PMS method or neutral red dye uptake (Khan et al., 2011) .
