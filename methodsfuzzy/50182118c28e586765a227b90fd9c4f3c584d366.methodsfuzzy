These studies were approved by the Harrow District Ethical Committee at Northwick Park. Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 years were recruited and housed in isolation at the Common Cold Unit in groups of two or three according to our usual practice. They were observed daily clinically under double-blind conditions. The symptoms and signs were used to make a diagnosis of a common cold and to construct a clinical score. They used standard paper handkerchiefs which were collected and weighed to give a daily nasal secretion weight (Beare and Reed, 1977) . Psychological scores for extroversion/introversion and obsessionality of each volunteer were determined as these can influence the clinical and virological response to infection (Totman et al., 1980; Broadbent et al., 1984) . Lyophilised interferonoL-2a (Roferon-A, Roche) was reconstituted to contain 10 million units/ml in 0.5% human serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline which, on its own, constituted the placebo. Both interferon and placebo were prepared fresh on alternate days and dispensed in a Mistette Mark II spray which delivered 0.1 ml per activation. The virus challenge consisted of a bacteriologically sterile MRC5 tissue culture fluid of the RSS-2 strain of RSV of the 11th passage containing 105.5 TCIDs0/ml (McKay et al., 1988) . 104s TCIDs0 failed to produce symptoms in any of 10 volunteers challenged so the dose chosen represents less than 10 cold-producing doses. Virus was isolated by inoculation of nasal washings into roller tube cultures of HEp-2 cells in the presence of anti IFN~ antiserum (2000 units/ml when receiving medication and 200 units/ml when medication ceased). Virus was detected and identified by specific immunofluorescence of cells scraped from the tubes. Antiviral antibody was detected by an ELISA test based on a test for coronavirus antibody previously described (Callow, 1985) . Frozen and thawed virus-infected tissue culture, clarified by centrifugation, was used as antigen and similarly treated, uninfected cultures acted as a control. Both were bound directly to microtitre plates. Suitable dilutions of serum were bound and IgG detected with a phosphataselinked antibody probe. Antibody titres were calculated by a computer programme and expressed in terms of arbitrary units assigned to a reference human serum which was titrated in parallel in every set of assays. A 1.5-fold rise represented an increase twice that of the standard error of the test and was regarded as significant. Antibody measured in this way is not a good predictor of susceptibility to infection.
