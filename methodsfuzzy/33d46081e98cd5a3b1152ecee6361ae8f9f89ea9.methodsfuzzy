Two consecutive randomized placebo-controlled trials of maternal influenza immunization were conducted in two annual cohorts in Sarlahi District of southern Nepal from April 2011 to May 2014 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01034254) [10] . Women were enrolled in the second trimester of pregnancy and followed with weekly home-based visits until 180 days postpartum. Symptom information was captured by recall over the previous week at each visit. Maternal respiratory illness required reported or measured fever (>38°C) with at least one other symptom: cough, myalgia, sore throat or rhinorrhea. Infant respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficult or rapid breathing, or a draining ear. Participants who reported protocol-defined respiratory illness had mid-nasal swabs (NS) obtained by field workers during weekly visits. An RSV illness episode was defined as the presence of any symptoms occurring for a minimum of one day with a mid-nasal swab obtained and RSV detected on PCR assay, with a minimum of 7 symptom-free days separating illness episodes. Incidence of RSV was calculated using days of follow-up from enrollment until end of study or loss to follow-up. Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected at enrollment and at weekly visits, and birthweight was measured at a postpartum home visit. Birthweight was included in the analysis if obtained within the first 72 hours after birth. Low birthweight was defined as weight < 2500 grams. Preterm birth was defined as birth at < 37 weeks completed gestation. Gestational age was calculated based on last menstrual period according to previously published methods [11] . Small-for-gestational age was defined according to the Alexander criteria [12] . A household was defined as the persons sharing a common cookstove. Household density was defined as the numbers of persons/room in the household. Statistical testing was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests to compare clinical and sociodemographic characteristics (SAS 9.3, Cary, NC). Mid-nasal swabs were transported in a temperature-stable nucleic acid buffer (Primestore, Longhorn Diagnostics, Austin, TX) to the field laboratory, where they were aliquoted and stored at 4°Celsius until transport to the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory in Seattle, WA, U.S.A [13] . RSV testing was performed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [13] . Specimens with RSV detected were additionally tested for quantitative viral load and subtype [14] [15] [16] . IRB approval for the study was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Seattle Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University, and the Nepal Health Research Council. Oral consent was obtained from study participants due to low literacy rates in the population. This procedure was approved by the IRB.
