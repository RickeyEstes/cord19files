We conducted a population-based study using data obtained from all admission records of the NHIRD. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance program, implemented in 1995, provides compulsory health insurance that covers more than 99% of the population. National Health Insurance Research Database includes almost all outpatient and inpatient medical records, including information on patient characteristics, such as age, sex, dates of clinical visits, date of admission, and diagnostic codes. The cases of ARDS were obtained from whole-population inpatient data in NHIRD between 1997 and 2011 and were defined using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Taiwan.
