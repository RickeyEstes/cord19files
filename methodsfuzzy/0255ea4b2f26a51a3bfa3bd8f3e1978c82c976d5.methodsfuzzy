Preparation of chemicals. Super purified HiPCO SWNTs (Lot # HS28-037) were purchased from NanoIntegris, and SWNTs samples were extensively purified before use (49) . Single-stranded RNA strands, Cy3-tagged single-stranded RNA strands and all primer sequences were purchased from IDT and dissolved in 0.1M NaCl before use. 100K MWCO Amicon spin filters were purchased from Fisher Scientific. The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: sodium dodecyl sulfate (molecular biology grade), sodium chloride, Tris/HCl, EDTA, NP-40, glycerol, BSA-Biotin and NeutrAvidin. RNAse A was purchased from Takara Bio. All PCR reagents and All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint materials, and molecular biology grade agarose were purchased from Bio-Rad. UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water from Invitrogen was used for qPCR, and EMD Millipore Milli-Q water was used for all other experiments. The sonicated solution incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 16,100g for 1 h to remove bundled SWNT and any leftover metal catalyst precursor from SWNT synthesis. Any RNA that was not bound to SWNTs was removed via spinfiltering 8 times with 100K Amicon filters, and the SWNT concentration of RNA-SWNTs was determined by measuring the carbon nanotube absorbance at 632 nm. Absorbance spectra of RNA-SWNTs were collected with Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus, and fluorescence All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint spectra of RNA-SWNTs were collected with a near-infrared spectrometer (Princeton Instruments IsoPlane 320 coupled to a liquid nitrogen-cooled Princeton Instruments PyLoN-IR 1D array of InGaAs pixels). RNA concentration on suspended SWNTs was determined by measuring the amount of RNA in flow-through solutions after each spinfilter step via absorbance at 260 nm, and subtracting the total amount of free RNA washed from the total amount of RNA added. In more detail, for each suspension, we start with 1 mg of SWNTs and 2 mg of RNA in 1 Internalization imaging with confocal and nIR fluorescence microscopy. The aantisense siRNA strand was utilized in the internalization study. After infiltration of 100 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Next, hybridized double-stranded RNA in solution (if any) was eluted with 100K spin filters and the zeta potential of the remaining RNA- were extracted as described in (24) . After quantification of the total extracted proteins by a Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo, Prod# 22660), 0.5 µg of normalized total proteins from each sample were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 hour using 7.5% BSA in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween20) buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary GFP antibody as required (1:2000 dilution, Abcam, ab290). After extensive washing, the corresponding protein bands were probed with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000 dilution, Abcam, ab205718) for 30 min.

The intensity of GFP bands were quantified with ImageJ software. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments for gene silencing. Two-step qPCR was performed to quantify GFP gene silencing in transgenic Nb plants as described in (24) . The target gene in our qPCR was mGFP5 (GFP transgene inserted into Nb), and EF1 (elongation factor 1) as our housekeeping (reference) gene. Primers for these genes can be found in Supplementary Table 3 . An annealing temperature of 60˚C and 40 cycles were used for qPCR. qPCR data was analyzed by the ddCt method (51) as described in (24) . For each sample, qPCR was performed as 3 reactions from the same isolated RNA batch, and the entire experiment consisting of independent infiltrations and RNA extractions from different plants was repeated 3 times (3 biological replicates). Single molecule TIRF to image RNA protection by SWNTs. The a-antisense siRNA strand was utilized in this assay. 10 μM 5' labelled Cy3-RNA was added to an equal mass of SWNTs. The RNA-SWNT suspension and removal of unbound RNA followed the same protocol as described in 'Quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments for gene silencing'. The positive control comprised of the same sequence that was 5' Cy3 labeled, and 3' biotin labeled. 6-channel μ-slides (ibidi, μ-Slide VI 0.5 Glass Bottom) were initially washed by pipetting 100 μL of 100 mM sterile NaCl solutions into one reservoir and removing 60 μL the other end, leaving just enough solution to fully wet the channel. Each subsequent step involved depositing the desired solution volume into the reservoir and removing the equivalent volume from the other end of the channel. Slide preparation was done as described by Kruss and Landry et al. (52) with some All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Briefly, 50 μL of 0.25 mg/mL BSA-Biotin was added to coat the surface of the glass slide for 5 minutes. Next, 50 μL of 0.05 mg/mL NeutrAvidin was added, followed by 50 μL of 1.0 mg/L RNA-SWNT, which non-specifically adsorbs to NeutrAvidin. For the positive control, 50 μL of 200 pM biotinylated Cy3-RNA was added in place of RNA-SWNT. The addition of each component comprised of a 5-minute incubation period, followed by flushing the channel with 50 μL of NaCl solution to remove specimens that were not surface-immobilized. Each channel was exposed to 50 μL of 10 μg/mL RNase A for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the channel with 50 μL NaCl solution. Slides were imaged with a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 microscope immediately following incubation with RNase A.
