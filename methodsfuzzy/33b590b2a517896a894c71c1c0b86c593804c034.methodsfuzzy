Standard molecular biology techniques were performed as described elsewhere [56, 57] . Genomic DNA was obtained from plate-grown bacteria using the Easy-DNA™ kit (Invitrogen™ Life Technologies™). Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase was used in cloning experiments per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen™ Life Technologies™). A 2.2-kb amplicon encompassing amino acids (aa) 25-750 of the B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA protein (GenBank accession number EF423807) was generated with primers P1 (5'-CGC CAC GTG AAT GGG ACC GTC AAC TCG -3'; PmlI site underlined) and P2 (5'-GGT TAA TTA AAG ATT AGT GAT CTT CAC GGG -3'; PacI site underlined). This DNA fragment was excised from an agarose gel, purified with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science), restricted with the endonucleases PmlI and PacI (New England Biolabs® Inc.), and ligated into the PmlI and PacI sites of the vector pETcoco-1 (specifies N-terminal His-tag, EMD Millipore), yielding plasmid pELHisBoaA. This plasmid was sequenced to verify that no mutations were introduced during PCR and to confirm that the protein expressed from pELHisBoaA corresponds to residue 25-750 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA joined to six N-terminal histidine residues. Plasmid DNA used as template in sequencing reactions was obtained with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). A similar approach was used to obtain the plasmid pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027 (expresses residues 392-1068 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BPSL1631-BMA1027 ORF), and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 (specifies residues 25-690 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BPSS0908-BMAA1324 ORF). The PCR products cloned into pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027, and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 were amplified with primers P3 (5'-CCC AAG CTT CAG CTT TAC ACG CTC CAG -3'; HindIII site underlined) and P4 (5'-GGT TAAT TAA AGC AAC TGG CCG ACG TTG AC -3'; PacI site underlined), and P5 (5'-CCC AAG CTT GGC GAG AAC GCC TAT GCC GGC -3'; HindIII site underlined) and P6 (5'-GGT TAA TTA AAG GAC CTT CTG ATC CGT GTA CTG -3'; PacI site underlined), respectively. Genomic DNA was used as the template in all PCR-based cloning experiments. The designation BPSxxxxx-BMAxxxxx refers to the locus tag numbers of the ORF under study in the annotated genomic sequence of B. pseudomallei strain K96243 [58] and B. mallei ATCC23344 [54] , respectively, which are readily available through NCBI.
