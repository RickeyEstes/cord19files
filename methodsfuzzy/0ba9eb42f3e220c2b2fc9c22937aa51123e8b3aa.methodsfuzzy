Fig. 6(a)-(c) shows the aerosolized E. coli, C. famata, and virus phage removal efficiencies of different methodologies, respectively. The data mentioned above had been subtracted by the removal efficiency of blank experiments, which ranged from 0.002 to 0.009 for E. coli, from 0.0067 to 0.074 for C. famata and from 0.057 to 0.061 for virus phage. According to the results of ANOVA, the differences in removal efficiencies between different removal methods (Method N, PF, NPF, UPF, and NUPF) were significant (p < 0.01). Generally, the order of E. coli removal efficiency of different methodologies was the Method NUPF > NPF > UPF > N â‰ˆ PF, while those of C. famata and vir phage were both the Method NUPF > NPF > UPF > PF > N.
