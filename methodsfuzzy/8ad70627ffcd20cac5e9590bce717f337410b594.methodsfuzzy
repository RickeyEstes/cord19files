To identify relevant articles for this review, we began by introducing the following search terms: (1) health personnel, health care provider, physician, doctor or nurse and (2) acute stress response, traumatic stress, traumatic stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder in PubMed and PsychINFO. We also manually searched the reference lists from relevant publications, and the Journal of Traumatic Stress (special issues included). Finally, we screened the European Traumatic Stress Research Database for relevant ongoing studies. Inclusion criteria for eligibility were as follows: peer reviewed articles; published from inception to 2009; written in English, French or German; based on original research; and included a clearly defined control group. If more than one study reported on the same data, the paper with the most complete and relevant information was selected. Excluded were studies with military or mental health providers representing the high-risk group and articles that primarily reported on secondary traumatic stress, vicarious trauma, or compassion fatigue. The review was performed taking guidelines for meta-analyses into account (Berman & Parker, 2002; Stroup, Berlin, Morton, Olkin, Williamson, Rennie et al., 2000) . To diminish reporting bias and error in data collection, two independent reviewers used a standardized form (Berman & Parker, 2002) to abstract the data; disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. In cases where the available information in the articles was insufficient, additional data were obtained from the principal investigator. The reported means and standard deviations (SD) were used to express the association between critical incidents and the prespecified primary outcome (i.e. post-traumatic stress symptoms) and the secondary outcomes (i.e. anxiety and depression). Because the quality of the studies retrieved can distort results in a meta-analysis, each study chosen for review was assessed by two independent researchers using a standardized form (Berman & Parker, 2002) . Studies were rated regarding: quality of information (5 items, e.g. Was the paper published in a peer reviewed journal?, or Was the purpose of the trial indicated?); information about funding (3 items, e.g. Were the investigators independent of the funding agency?); study design (3 items þ 1 adapted item; e.g. Was the design appropriate to the study questions?, or the adapted item Was exposure/non-exposure to the stressor clearly defined?); study outcomes (2 items, e.g. Were the outcomes clearly defined, including the methods of measurement?); study subjects (2 items, e.g. Did the subjects meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria?); control subjects (1 item, i.e. Were the control subjects comparable to the participants?); implementation (2 items, e.g. Were inclusion and exclusion criteria strictly adhered to?); method (1 item, i.e. Were social and psychological scales validated?); statistics (2 items, e.g. Were the analytic methods clearly described and appropriate?); and response (1 item, i.e. Was there a high rate of non-response?). Items from the original form that did not apply to this metaanalysis were eliminated a priori. The topics were evaluated as a percentage of the items that scored positive. Finally, an overall consensus score was calculated for every study. Heterogeneity among studies was examined, using the I 2statistic. I 2 is based on Cochran's Q and describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to between-study variation rather than chance. Observed heterogeneity initiated further analyses in an attempt to explain the findings. Ideally, there is no heterogeneity at all (I 2 ¼ 0). When heterogeneity is high, the analytical approach requires applying a random effects model, which involves the assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not identical. I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% represent low, moderate and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) . Publication bias was examined with a funnel plot. A funnel plot, in which effect sizes are plotted against participants per study, is used as a visual aid to detect publication bias. A symmetric funnel arises from a well-balanced dataset; an asymmetric plot suggests publication bias (Egger, Davey Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997; Light & Pillemer, 1984; Normand, 1999) . Standardized Mean Differences (SMDs) (Normand, 1999) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the impact of critical incidents on the outcomes (i.e. post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression) in exposed versus nonexposed health professionals. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed to gain insight into studies that reported deviating results. Similar to Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988) , SMD values equal to .20 were considered to indicate a small effect, SMD values equal to .50 a medium effect, and SMD values equal to .80 a large effect.
