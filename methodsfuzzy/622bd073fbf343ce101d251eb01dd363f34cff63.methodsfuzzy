The proposed method is essentially determined by two factors: the expression of concentration at an arbitrary point in each room (which is related to supply air concentration and emission rate of contaminant source), and the mass balance relationship in each AHU. No matter how complex a ventilation system with air recirculation may be, the calculation method will attribute to the two factors. Therefore, the validation of the proposed method is in nature the validations of the concentration expression in the room and the mass balance relationship in AHU. Obviously, the mass balance must be satisfied, while the expression of concentration at an arbitrary point in the room was also well validated by Yang [20] . Therefore, the reliability of these two expressions should make the proposed method reliable. To further verify the proposed method based on the above analysis, we conducted both experimental validation and numerical validation of ventilation system with air recirculation. Experimental validation was conducted in a generic ventilation system, while numerical validation was made in a more complex ventilation system. A main advantage of the proposed method is the reduction in computing time. Here the computing speed of the proposed method is compared with the iteration method, which is also based on the case in Fig. 5 . In this case, the proposed method only needs 48 min (CPU: Intel Pentium(R) Dual, 3.00 GHz) and 5 simulations: accessibility distribution of AHU 1, accessibility distribution of AHU 2, accessibility distribution of AHU3, accessibility distribution of direct fresh air and accessibility distribution of whole contaminant source. While the iteration method will need 101 min CPU time and 12 simulations (Table 8 ). Fig. 7 shows the computing time consumption change with case number. As the case number increases (e.g. changes of emission rate of contaminant source, concentration of direct fresh air or the ratio of fresh air), the proposed method will still only need 5 simulations to obtain the accessibility indices and consume the same 48 minutes. The following calculation of sup- ply air concentration and final concentration distribution (by Eqs. (19) and (11)) will hardly need time. But for the iteration method, the computing time will increase in proportion with the increase of case number, because it is necessary to do the CFD simulations repeatedly when boundary condition changes. Since it is inevitable to do a large number of case simulations when contaminant dispersion features are studied in a complex building, the proposed method can be much more efficient than the iteration method.
