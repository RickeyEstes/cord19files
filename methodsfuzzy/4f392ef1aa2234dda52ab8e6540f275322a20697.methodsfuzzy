Antibodies and Abl kinase inhibitors. The mouse monoclonal anti-IBV S antibody (9B1B6) recognizes the lumenal domain and was a kind gift from Ellen Collisson (Western University of Health Sciences) (29) . The rabbit polyclonal anti-IBV S antibody to the Cterminus was previously described (26) , as was the rabbit polyclonal antibody to SARS S (anti-SCT) (24) . Rabbit anti-GFP (A-6455) was obtained from ThermoFisher. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Membranes were washed 3 x 5 min in TBST and rinsed in 1X TBS. Bands were visualized using the Licor Odyssey CLx and quantified using Image Studio software. The density of three IBV S bands, corresponding to S0, S2 and S2', was measured and the percent for each band was calculated from the total S for each treatment condition. .
