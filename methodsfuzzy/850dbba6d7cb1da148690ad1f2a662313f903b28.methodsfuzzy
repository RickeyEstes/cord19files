The patient is made comfortable in the bed at an angle of 30Â° or more. A full-face mask is positioned over the face in such a way that the nasal portion of the mask fits just above the junction of nasal bone and cartilage (Figure 1 ). Nasal mask may be used in those patients who do not tolerate full-face mask. The strap of the mask is fastened in such a way that 1-2 fingers can be passed through the headgear and the face. The mask is examined for patient satisfaction, leak and skin abrasion. In case the patient is given CPAP, the default pressure is set at 4-6 cm water. Gradually the pressure is raised in 2-3 cm increments to 10-15 cm water or more. If the patient is given bi-level positive pressure ventilation, initial settings given to the patients are as follows: inspiratory pressure support (IPAP) 10 cm water, and expiratory pressure support (EPAP) 5 cm water. IPAP is gradually increased at increment of 2 cm over next 30-60 minutes to maximum requirement (usually 15-20 cm water). 2 Clinical parameters including pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) are monitored continuously; and arterial blood gas levels (ABG) are determined 1 and 12 hours after the start of treatment, and as and when found indicated. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is adjusted to maintain SpO 2 > 90%, patient's comfort, minimal air leak, and respiratory rate of less than 25/minute. Approach to weaning involves increasing periods off-mask ventilation. Once the patient's condition has stabilised, the mask may be removed for short periods, and supplemental oxygen administered. Patient is closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress and fatigue. Periods off the ventilator lengthen as the underlying condition improves and the patient shows acceptable vital signs, good gas exchange, and no respiratory distress. Another approach to NIPPV weaning involves gradually reducing CPAP or EPAP to a minimum level (less than 5 cm water). Once the minimum level has been reached, NIPPV can be discontinued. Patient ventilation asynchrony is observed when there is a major air-leak, or when the ventilator fails to sense inspiratory effort or onset of expiration. Asynchrony should be dealt with patience and persistence. Patient is reassured and encouraged to let the machine breath for him. The modes that can be used with both conventional mechanical ventilator and non-invasive ventilator include assistcontrol ventilation (ACV) and pressure-support ventilation (PSV). Controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV) and synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) cannot be used in NIPPV. Similarly, bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation can be used by NIPPV, but not with conventional mechanical ventilation.
