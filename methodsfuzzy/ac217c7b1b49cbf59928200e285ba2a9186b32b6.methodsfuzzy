For the methodological quality evaluation, we adopted the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. 7 The items included random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment, as well as incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. The possible evaluations for each item were applicable, nonapplicable, and unclear, corresponding to low, high, and unclear risks of bias, respectively. Two investigators (YH and JS) assessed the quality of each study independently and cross-checked their assessments. In case of disagreement, the evaluation was determined through discussion or submission to a third researcher (JH).
