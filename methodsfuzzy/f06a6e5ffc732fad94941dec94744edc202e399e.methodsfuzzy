The final diagnosis was reviewed for all cats entered in the computerized patient database of the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM) between December 22, 1986 and December 22, 2002 . Cats with FIP were identified using the coding terms 'feline infectious peritonitis' or 'FIP'. Final diagnosis in all cases had been determined by the attending clinician; criteria used for diagnosis and results of antemortem or post-mortem diagnostic test results were not reviewed. Breed, sex, and reproductive status of all cats evaluated at the NCSU-CVM during the 16-year study period were reviewed; all cats of unknown breed were excluded. Mixed breed cats of all hair lengths (domestic shorthair, mediumhair and longhair) were considered a single breed (termed 'mixed breed') for data analysis purposes. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable studied for the FIP population and for the total cat population. Descriptive statistics for cat age at time of evaluation were calculated only for FIP-affected cats. Breed, sex, and reproductive status differences were compared using the Fisher's exact test; values of P less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated for each variable.
