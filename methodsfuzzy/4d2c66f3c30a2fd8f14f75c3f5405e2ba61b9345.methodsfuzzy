In 896/1564 examined samples (57.3%) at least one parasite was detectable by microscopical methods. Giardia-cysts were detected in 112/1564 examined samples (7.2%). The Giardia-positive calves were between 3 and 130 days old (mean = 46.5 d, median = 42 d, n = 101) with the highest rate of cyst excretion (28.4%) in 61-90 days old animals ( Figure 2 ). It is significant, that the age had a nonlinear influence on the probability of being infected with Giardia spp. and the odds of being infected with Giardia spp. increased slowly up to 8 times from about 12 days to 30 days ( Figure 3 ). There was no seasonal influence on the odds of being infected with Giardia spp. (Figure 4) . A mono-infection with Giardia spp. was diagnosed in 46 calves (2.9%) whereas a mixed-infection was found in 15 samples (1.0%) for Cryptosporidium spp. and in 51 samples (3.3%) for Eimeria spp. (Table 1) . Cryptosporidium-oocysts were detected in 646/1564 examined samples (41.3%). They had the size and morphology 15 (Figure 2 ). It is significant, that the age had a nonlinear influence on the probability of being infected with Cryptosporidium spp. and the odds of being infected with Cryptosporidium spp. increased up to 4.5 times until an age of 10 days. After that the odds decreased continuously and was approaching zero at about 30 days (Figure 3 ). There was no significant seasonal influence on the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp. (Figure 4) . Eimeria-oocysts were detected in 208/1564 examined samples (13.3%). The Eimeria-positive calves were between 5 and 331 days old (mean = 55.0 d, median = 49 d, n = 192) with the highest rate of oocysts excretion (52.6%) in 61-90 days old calves (Figure 2 ). It is significant, that the age had a nonlinear influence on the probability of being infected with Eimeria spp. and the odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. increased continuously up to 30 times from about 20 days to 60 days (Figure 3 ). There was a significant seasonal influence on the frequency of Eimeria spp. (Figure 4 ): the odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. in March and April decreased by about half and increased up to 2.3 times between July and September. The distribution of mono-and mixed-infections is presented in Table 1 .
