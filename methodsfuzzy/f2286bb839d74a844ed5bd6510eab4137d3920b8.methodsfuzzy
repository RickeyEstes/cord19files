Children and adolescents (<20 years of age) with underlying hematological malignancies treated at the Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, were eligible for this study. Among them, those who complained of respiratory symptoms such as a cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, sore throat, and dyspnea, with or without fever, and in whom a multiplex PCR test for RVs was performed between December 2016 and November 2017 were enrolled. Patients in whom respiratory symptoms developed 6 months or more after the completion of anti-cancer chemotherapy or 2 years or more after HCT were excluded. Patients in whom hematological malignancies were newly diagnosed and anti-cancer chemotherapy had not been administered prior to the development of respiratory illnesses were also excluded. Patients in whom RVs were identified and not identified were categorized into Groups I and II, respectively. The medical records of the enrolled patients were reviewed retrospectively and the clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between groups. The patients in Group I were sub-divided into those with upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) and the clinical and laboratory characteristics were also compared between the two subgroups. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul St. Mary's hospital with a waiver of informed consent (Approval Number: KC18RESI0302).
