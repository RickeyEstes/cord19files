Expression Profile of Cell Death Genes in Ultrasound-Treated, Mild Hyperthermia-Treated, and Oscillatory Shear Stress-Treated Cells Microarray datasets were collected from National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) -GEO Dataset (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/) databases and analyzed with GEO2R (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/geo/geo2r/). The numbers of GEO datasets that are as follows: GSE10212, GSE45487, GSE70662, GSE10043, GSE39178, GSE60152, GSE28546, GSE90, GSE3181. The detailed information of these GEO datasets was shown in Table 1 . Two hundred and ninety nine cell death regulators that participate in 13 different types of cell death were analyzed in our study, and 91 cell death regulators regulate multiple cell death types. Of note, several cell death forms are reported recently, including MPT-driven necrosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, mitotic death, and anoikis. All detailed information of these cell death regulators and 13 types of cell death was shown in Table 2 .
