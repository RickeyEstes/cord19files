A read-out system capable of monitoring changes with subnanometer resolution is crucial for detecting the nanomechanical motion induced by the biochemical recognition process. In addition to supplying high sensitivity and accuracy, the signal read-out is critical in the realtime measurements acquisition and, in the final biosensor, integration of microsystems. To avoid the influence of external factors, such as non-specific binding or temperature changes, a reference cantilever is typically used. For that reason, and for detecting several analytes at the same time, the read-out schemes have to enable the use of arrays of microcantilevers. There are several techniques suitable for the cantilever response read-out: optical beam deflection, piezoresistivity, piezoelectricity, interferometry, and capacitance are among the most important (Lavrik et al., 2004; Ziegler, 2004) . However, the majority of the biochemical applications carried out with cantilever-based sensors are based on the optical beam deflection method, due to its high sensitivity. A variation of this optical method has been recently developed using an array of a new type of optical waveguide microcantilevers (Zinoviev et al., 2007) . These cantilevers act as a waveguide for conducting light, and it is possible to collect the exit light with a second waveguide or with a photodetector. In this case, the cantilever bending is related to the reduction in intensity of the collected light with respect to the input light.
