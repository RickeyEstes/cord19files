Pooled relative frequency (RF) and its corresponding 95% CI was used to evaluate the prevalence of viral infection in COPD disease. The inverse of the Freeman-Tukey Double arcsine transformation of relative frequencies to calculate a pooled RF [10] . The heterogeneity and the variation in the pooled estimations were assessed by using Cochran's Q test and I2, respectively, and significance was considered at P < 0.05 level [11] . The pooled RF was made in a random effect model while heterogeneity existed between the individual studies and otherwise this pooled effect sizes were derived from a fixed effect model. However, sensitivity analysis was done by successively removing a particular study or group of studies (if any) that had the highest impact on the heterogeneity test. A funnel plot was established for checking the existence of publication bias. The funnel plot asymmetry was measured by Egger's linear regression test and Begg's test (P < 0.05 levels were considered statistically significance for publication bias) [12] . Finally, the sub-group analysis was used on the detection method, kind of sample, geographic continents, year of publication, and type of virus. All statistical analyses were conducted by using data analysis and statistical software (STATA) (version 11.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
