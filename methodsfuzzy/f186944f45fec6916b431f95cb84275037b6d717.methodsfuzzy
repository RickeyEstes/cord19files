Protein expression, refolding, and purification In general, unlabeled proteins were produced in LB broth while labeled proteins were produced in M9 minimal media supplemented with required combinations of 15 N-ammonium chloride, 13 C-glucose, and 99% D 2 O for NMR studies. All proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells, grown at 37°C, and protein expression was induced using 0.1 mM isopropyl β,D-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density of approximately 0.6 (600 nm). CypA was purified as previously described 49, 63 while both CD147 and the extracellular region of syndecan-1 were purified as described below. Unless otherwise noted, all columns and resins were used on an AKTA FPLC purchased from GE Healthcare. For CD147, all constructs were PCR-amplified from the previously described vectors 24 and ligated into the pET15b vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA) using NdeI and BamHI. All primers contained the appropriate restriction sites with six base-pair overhangs for cleavage prior to ligation. All CD147 proteins were refolded at 4°C as follows. For a typical 2-L growth, cells were lysed via sonication in 35 ml of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, centrifuged at 12,000g in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor (Sorvall, Asheville, NC), and the insoluble fraction was collected. The insoluble fraction was sonicated to homogeneity in 35 ml of denaturation buffer (5 M guanidine, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2-mercaptoethanol), centrifuged again, and dialyzed into refolding buffer (1 M arginine, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl) for 48 h. Samples were subsequently dialyzed into 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 300 mM NaCl for at least 12 h and centrifuged to remove any precipitation. The soluble refolded proteins were then further dialyzed into 50 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole for purification via Ni Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted in the same buffer supplemented with 0.4 M imidazole. Eluted proteins were cleaved overnight with thrombin; purified via a pre-packed S-100 size-exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mM NaPO 4 , pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM imidazole; and then applied to a 1-ml benzamidine column in the same buffer to remove residual thrombin. For syndecan-1, the extracellular region that corresponds to residues 23-251 was PCR-amplified from the commercially available plasmid (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) and ligated into the pET15b vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) using NdeI and BamHI sites. Primers contained the appropriate restriction sites for cleavage prior to ligation. While there was no measurable expression of this pET15b-syndecan-1 from this constructed vector, subsequent insertion of streptococcal protein G (GB1) led to high protein expression. This was accomplished by PCR amplification of the 56-residue GB1 encoding region (vector described below) with NdeI restriction sites both 5′ and 3′ and subsequent insertion into the single NdeI-digested pET15b-syndecan-1 plasmid. Upon confirming that the GB1 sequence was inserted correctly, all further syndecan-1 purifications utilized this pET15b-GB1-syndecan-1 fusion that was entirely found in the soluble expressed fraction both before and after thrombin cleavage that released syndecan-1 residues 23-251 (with an N-terminal Gly-Ser). For a typical 2-L growth, cell pellets were lysed with 35 ml of 50 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole and applied directly to a Ni Sepharose column in the same buffer. All subsequent purification steps were identical with that of the CD147 proteins described above.
