Sample description. The term "clinical sample" is used to describe primary nasal swabs in viral transport media, while "viral isolate" or "culture isolate" is used to describe culture harvest from zero passage virus (i.e., brief exposure to culture only during viral isolation). For paired clinical sample/culture isolate sequencing, 200 l of nasal swab viral transport medium from nine patients from 2015 to 2016 with an HPIV-3 cycle threshold (C T ) of Ͻ25 was inoculated onto primary rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) cells (Quidel Diagnostics) and incubated on a roller drum at 37°C. The tubes were assessed for cytopathic effect daily and confirmed via hemadsorption with 1% guinea pig red blood cells (RBCs). Positive cultures were harvested and stored at Ϫ80°C. Deidentified bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab samples from 23 patients from 2016 used for prior clinical testing were stored at Ϫ80°C and subjected to mNGS. In addition, 95 culture harvests for which viral isolation was performed for prior clinical testing of BAL fluid samples, nasal swabs, and sputum samples from 2009 to 2016 at the University of Washington Virology Laboratory were also stored at Ϫ80°C and subjected to mNGS. Culture harvests from 2009 to 2016 were performed using the same protocol detailed above for the 2016 paired sequencing experiment. Use of excess deidentified clinical specimens was approved by the local University of Washington institutional review board (IRB) (Protocol STUDY00000408). Sample metadata, including GenBank accession numbers for consensus HPIV-3 genomes, are available in Table S1 in the supplemental material and associated with NCBI BioProject 338014. mNGS and amplicon sequencing. mNGS was performed as previously described (49) . RNA was extracted from 100 l of thawed culture harvests and clinical samples using the Zymo Viral RNA kit (Zymo Research) and treated with Turbo DNase I (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min at 37°C (50) . Doublestranded cDNA was made using random hexamers, SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher), and Sequenase v2.0 (Thermo Fisher) and cleaned using Zymo-5 DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research). mNGS libraries were produced by adding one-third volume of NexteraXT (Illumina) and finished with 19 cycles of dual-indexed PCR amplification and cleaned using 0.8ϫ Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter) (51) . Libraries were sequenced using one 192-bp and two 300-bp runs on an Illumina MiSeq system. Libraries from the matched viral isolates were prepared twice in independent library preparations and sequencing runs to control for artifacts of library preparation. Amplicon sequencing was performed to investigate linkage between mutations recovered during mNGS. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using 35 cycles of the default parameters (melting temperature [T m ], 55°C) in the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with PCR primers HPIV3-7477F (F stands for forward) (5=-TACAGATAGGGATAATAACTGTAAA-3=) and HPIV3-8635R (R stands for reverse) (5=-GCTTTGCTCCTAAGTTTTTTATATT-3=). Amplicons were purified using 1.0ϫ Ampure beads, and dualindexed TruSeq libraries were prepared using the Kapa HyperPrep kit with eight cycles of PCR amplification (52) . Sequence data alignment and analysis. Sequencing reads were adapter and quality trimmed using cutadapt and then aligned to the HPIV-3 reference sequence (NC_001796) with Geneious v9.1.7. Consensus genomes were extracted for original patient samples, and culture sample sequencing reads were aligned to the sample consensus. Consensus genomes were visualized and mutations and minor alleles with coverage of Ͼ50ϫ and minor allele frequency (MAF) of Ͼ5% were called using Geneious 9.1.7. The known locus of RNA editing in the phosphoprotein gene was not included among the variant nonsynonymous alleles, nor were adenosine deaminase-like changes present on the same strand in P0 virus (affecting minor variants at R192G and I210V in CI-1 in Table 1 ). Phylodynamic analysis. For phylodynamic analysis, coding nucleotide sequences from the 118 newly generated HPIV-3 genomes sequenced were extracted, concatenated, and aligned using Genious v9.1.7 and MAFFT (53) . The resulting alignment was used to generate a Bayesian Skyline tree with an uncorrelated relaxed clock and Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano (HKY) substitution model with gamma plus invariant site heterogeneity model (four gamma categories) and three codon partitioning in BEAST v1.8.4 with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) length of 10,000,000 iterations (54) . Tree generation trace information and evolutionary clock rates were gathered and analyzed using Tracer v1.6.0 (55). The resulting trees were annotated and compiled using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4 and then annotated and scaled in FigTree v1.4.2. The same phylodynamic protocol was also performed on all complete HPIV-3 genomes present in NCBI NT as of 17 August 2017. Recombination detection was performed using RDP4's RDP, Chimaera, MaxChi, GENECOV, SiScan, and 3Seq algorithms with default settings (29) . To determine whether culture-associated HN amino acid changes were present in our paired sample sequencing, we downloaded all partial and complete HPIV-3 HN sequences from NCBI NT as of 17 August 2017. Metadata on whether specific sequences originated from clinical sample or culture material were gathered from the NCBI GenBank sequence record and associated manuscripts in PubMed. However, it is not always possible to determine whether there was brief exposure to culture conditions prior to sequencing. To show how the background of HN protein sequence could influence the amino acid mutations selected during culture, a majority consensus amino acid sequence of HN protein from each putative clinical sample was extracted and aligned using MAFFT. A neighbor-joining tree was created using the Genious tree building algorithm, Jukes-Cantor distance method, and 100,000 replicates. Functional characterization of HPIV-3 HN. The HN mutants examined in this study were generated through site-directed mutagenesis of the previously constructed pCAGGS mammalian expression vector with the CI-1 HN gene (4) . Plasmids were Sanger sequence confirmed prior to usage. Transfections with plasmids were performed in HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cell surface expression of each HN was measured through standard immunofluorescence assay procedures using monoclonal antibodies against HPIV-3 HN and used for normalization as appropriate. Two monoclonal anti-HN antibodies used here (VT-3G9-B9 and VT-10F7-B11) were custom-made by Aldevron using DNA immunization. Briefly, a cDNA encoding HPIV-3 HN was cloned into expression plasmids (pEGFP) (56) . Groups of laboratory rats (Wistar) were immunized by intradermal application of DNA-coated gold particles using a handheld device for particle bombardment (gene gun). Serum samples were collected after a series of immunizations and tested in flow cytometry on HEK cells transiently transfected with the above expression plasmids. Antibody-producing cells were isolated and fused with mouse myeloma cells (Ag8) according to standard procedures. Measurement of fusion promotion. The ability of individual HNs to promote fusion was measured through a ␤-galactosidase complementation assay as previously described (26, 40) . HNs were paired with the F protein from a lab-adapted strain (5), transiently transfected in HEK 293T cells, and then cell fusion was quantified. Lab-adapted F partner molecules were used as previously described (4, 5) , since fusion is minimal when CI HN and F are expressed in pairs, and does not allow for quantitative comparisons. Measurement of neuraminidase activity. Neuraminidase activity of HNs were measured as previously described (7, 41) . HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with individual HNs, collected through detachment with 5 mM EDTA, washed with Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with 1 g/liter D-glucose and 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate (Gibco), then resuspended in CO 2 -independent medium (pH 4.7) (Gibco). Cells were then added to 2=-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-␣-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid, sodium salt hydrate (4-MUNANA) at a 1:1 ratio for a final concentration of 10.2 mM. Fluorescence was measured every 2 min for 1 h at 37°C with a microplate reader (Tecan). Measurement of RBC release. The ability of HNs to release bound RBCs was measured as described previously (9, 26) . RBCs were bound to cells for 30 min at 4°C and washed to remove unbound RBCs. CO 2 -independent medium (pH 7.5) was then added to the cells, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for the appropriate times before being collected and replaced for the next time point. After 120 min, RBCs that remained bound to the cells were lysed with ACK (ammonium-chloride-potassium) lysing buffer (Gibco) and quantified by measurement of absorbance at 410 nm. Immortalized cell culture. CV-1 (African green monkey kidney) and 293T (human kidney epithelial) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Cellgro; Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Recombinant virus production and analysis. rHPIV3 clinical isolate 1 (CI-1)-EGFP is a recombinant virus generated with a plasmid coding for the majority consensus sequence of HPIV-3 CI-1 (4, 5, 7) obtained by deep sequencing and containing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression cassette between P and M viral genes. All mutants were derived from this unique sequence. Recombinant viruses were generated by reverse genetics in the rHPIV3-CI-1-EGFP-F K108 background using a modification of methods previously described (57) . Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in six-well plates. The following day, the cells were transfected using ProFection mammalian transfection system, calcium phosphate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with 10 g of pFLC plasmid encoding the full-length viral genome, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 P, 40 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 L, 200 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 N, 200 ng of pCAGGS-T7 polymerase, 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted HN, and 100 ng of pCAGGS-HPIV3 lab-adapted F (4). The following day, supernatant fluids were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Two days after transfection, the cells were mechanically detached by pipetting up and down and overlaid onto CV-1 cells in a 10-cm culture dish. Cultured cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy until 70% of the cells were infected. The medium was replaced with DMEM without FBS, and cells were incubated for up to 2 days at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Supernatant fluid was collected, centrifuged at 300 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, aliquoted, and kept at Ϫ80°C until use. All recombinant viruses were sequenced at this stage using the same mNGS methods detailed above on 50 l of supernatant fluid to confirm the correct CI backbone and HN mutation sequences before use in experiments. Viral propagation in human airway epithelia. The HAE EpiAirway AIR-100 system (MatTek Corporation) consists of normal human-derived tracheo/bronchial epithelial cells that have been cultured to form a pseudostratified, highly differentiated mucociliary epithelium closely resembling that of epithelial tissue in vivo. Upon receipt from the manufacturer, human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were transferred to six-well plates (containing 1 ml medium per well) with the apical surface remaining exposed to air and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . HAE cultures were infected with 5,000 PFU of recombinant clinical isolate 1 EGFP (5) (referred to as CI-1-EGFP-F K108) at the apical surface for 90 min at 37°C. The wild type (wt) CI-1-EGFP-F K108 or CI-1-EGFP-F K108 harboring single mutations in HN (i.e., P241L, R242K, H552Q, S554N, or L555F) was used. At 90 min, the medium containing the inoculum was removed, and cultures were placed at 37°C and fed each day with 1 ml medium via the basolateral surface. Viruses were harvested by adding 200 l of 1ϫ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium chloride (MatTek Corporation) per well to the HAE cultures' apical surface and equilibrating for 30 min at 37°C. The suspension was then collected, and viral titers were determined as previously described (58) . This viral collection was performed sequentially with the same wells of cells on each indicated day postinfection. Viral propagation in CV-1. CV-1 cultures were seeded in 24-well plates. Seventy percent confluent cells were infected with 5,000 PFU of recombinant CI-1-EGFP-F K108 (wt or harboring single mutations in HN [i.e., P241L, R242K, H552Q, S554N, L555F]) at the apical surface for 90 min at 37°C. After 90 min, the medium containing the inoculum was replaced with 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The supernatant fluid was then collected, aliquoted, and replaced with the same volume of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, and viral titers were determined as previously described (58) . This viral collection was performed sequentially with the same wells of cells on each indicated day postinfection.
