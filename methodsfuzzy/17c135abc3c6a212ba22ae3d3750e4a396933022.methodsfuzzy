Computational designing of proteins can be classified as follows: 1) template-based designing in which three-dimensional (3D)  Peptide design methods have been categorized as ligand-and target-based design methods. In the ligand-based designing procedure, information derived from peptides is used to design novel therapeutic peptides. In the target-based method, information derived from target proteins is specifically utilized. Typically, a hybrid approach including both ligand-and target-based design is utilized. 13 Ligand-based peptide design The ligand-based design has been classified as follows: 1) sequence-based, 2) property-based and 3) conformationbased design. Sequence-based approach uses the information of conserved regions and analyzes the multiple sequence alignments. This method is directed by the hypothesis that conserved regions are functionally and structurally significant. 13 Computational tools allow the ligand-based peptide design, although they lag behind bioinformatics strategies developed for protein designing. 13 Recently, using a method based on a PAM250 matrix, the relationship between a series of 35 collagen peptides and antiangiogenic activity including proliferation, migration and adhesion was analyzed. 74 The PAM250 matrix captured information of mutation rates among all pairs of amino acids. Based on the results, regions at the C and N termini of the peptides were detected to be significant for an ideal activity and suggested as two distinct binding sites. The approach showed the potential worth of the sequence-based peptide design. 74 In another report, a computational platform called SARvision was developed to support sequence-based design. SARvision signifies an important step for peptide sequence/activity relationship (SAR) analysis. Moreover, it pools the improved visualization abilities with advanced sequence/activity analysis. 75 Compared to small molecules, property-based design methods for peptides are in the early stages of development. In a recent study, the Î”G decomposition per residue and the physicochemical characteristics of amino acids, such as hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity and volume, were used  GrowMol is a combinatorial algorithm employed in the peptidomimetics design. GrowMol searches a variety of probable ligands for the binding sites of a target protein 125 and produces molecules with the chemical and steric complementarity for the 3D structure of binding sites. This method was used to generate peptidomimetic inhibitors of thermolysin, HIV protease and pepsin. By using the X-ray crystal structures of pepstatin-pepsin complexes, GrowMol predicted therapeutic peptidomimetics against the aspartic proteases. The algorithm created some cyclic inhibitors bridging the side chains of cysteine residues in the Pl and P3 inhibitor subsites. The binding modes were checked using X-ray crystallography. 125, 126 LUDI is another interesting software referring to the de novo methodology. 127 By using natural and non-natural amino acids as building blocks, the software designed peptidomimetics against renin, thermolysin and elastase. 127 Conformational flexibility of each novel peptidomimetic was searched through sampling the multiple conformers of each amino acid. 127 Peptide-driven pharmacophoric hypothesis is the most perceptive computational technique discovered in the peptidomimetics design. The method is especially useful when the X-ray structures of protein-protein complexes exist. 28 The main idea is to adapt the hot spot concept into the associated pharmacophoric feature concept. With a pharmacophorebased virtual screening process, this strategy can determine novel type 3 mimetics. 128 In fact, the side chains of each amino acid can be simply categorized based on the conventional pharmacophoric characteristics, such as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, aromatic ring and charged and hydrophobic centers. For example, in a report, pharmacophore model directed synthesis of the non-peptide analogs of a cationic antimicrobial peptide identified an anti-staphylococcal activity. 129 To make a pharmacophore hypothesis, a model of RNA III-inhibiting peptide (RIP), a well-known heptapeptide inhibitor of the staphylococcal pathogenesis, was utilized. Through the virtual screening of 300,000 commercially available small molecules based on the RIP-based pharmacophore, Hamamelitannin was discovered as a non-peptide mimetic of RIP. Hamamelitannin is a tannin derivate extracted from Hamamelis virginiana. 28, 129 In another study, two rounds of in silico screening were performed to discover potential peptidomimetics able to mimic a cyclic peptide (cyclo- [CPFVKTQLC] ) that is known to bind the anb3 integrin receptor. 130 At the end of the process, the most potent representatives were at least 2,000 times better than the original cyclopeptide (around 2 mM). 130 In a prosperous instance, virtual screening was done by using multi-conformational forms of a large commercial library. A target-based pharmacophoric model mapped the CD4-binding site on HIV-1 gp120. The pharmacophore hypothesis was made based on a homology model of the protein cavity. In a cell-based assay, two of the top scoring molecules were detected as micromolar inhibitors of HIV-1 replication. 131
