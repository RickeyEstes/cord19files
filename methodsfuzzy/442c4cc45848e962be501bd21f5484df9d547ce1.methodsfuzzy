New samples from Vietnam and Taiwan. As a prelude to sequencing, a large number of grouper samples (nearly 200) were collected as part of routine Veterinary surveillance, from different species and hybrids from the National Broodstock Centre for Mariculture Species, NBCFMS in Cat Ba, Haiphong, Northern Vietnam in September 2015 and from Qieding, Kaohsiung, Taiwan in July 2015 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) and tested for the presence of NNV using primers from Nishizawa et al. 20 . Samples were taken, typically, at a time there were general mortalities of larvae, but other than being alive or dead, no other distinctive behaviours were noted; i.e. larval fish in this study looked normal. Note: the lack of symptoms for larval fish infected with NNV was also reported 21 . RNA extraction and sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using Trisure reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bioline, AUS). cDNA synthesis was conducted from the total genomic RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a genomic DNA elimination reaction was performed by mixing a solution of 2 µL of dissolved template RNA (500 ng/µl) with 2 µL g DNA Wipeout Buffer 7x and 10 µL RNase-free Water with an incubation at 42 °C for 2 minutes, then placed immediately on ice. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 42 °C and then incubated at 95 °C for 3 minutes with the reaction mixture with final volume of 20 µL: 4 µL Quantiscript RT Buffer, 1 µL Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, 1 µL RT Primer Mix and 14 µL genomic DNA elimination. The RNA2 segment of nervous necrosis virus was amplified using the set of primers described in Ransangan and Manin 3 . The forward and reverse PCR reactions were conducted separately in a 50 μL total volume consisting of 25 μL MyTaq ™ Red Mix (Bioline, AUS), 19 μL Rnase-free water, 2 μL each primer (10 µM) (forward and reverse) and 2 μL cDNA. The amplifications were performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro Thermal Cycler with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 30 Collation of published sequences. Genbank (the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) was searched in various ways for NNV sequences. First, the complete coding RNA sequences for the NNV RNA2 gene from a giant grouper host (GB accession number AY721615) was blasted against all sequences in Genbank, and over 500 sequences recovered with at least 25% similarity. All complete coding RNA sequences from all groupers in the Indo-Asian region were retained along with those from any other species that had similarity (to AY721615) at least equal to the most distant NNV from a grouper host, these non grouper species included mostly barramundi (Lates calcarifer). Second, Genbank was searched for "Grouper" and "NNV" and "RNA2", and all NNV complete coding RNA sequences from the Indo-Asian region collated. A total of 75 sequences were collated. To this we added (details following) a further four unpublished sequences reported for the first time here from Vietnamese humpback grouper (C. altivelis) and three from Taiwanese Giant x Tiger hybrids (E. lanceolatus ♂ x E. fuscoguttatus ♀) (Supplementary Table S2 ). Only the protein encoding region of the sequences was used for analyses. Full protein capsid encoding sequences of all 82 sequences, published and new, is given in Supplementary Table S2 . Analyses of sequences. Alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed using CLUSTAL W 22 . In the 1017 bp ORF encoding the coat protein there were 230 variable nucleotide sites which were considered, and referred to, as "loci" for the following tests. Analysis of molecular variance (GenAlEx 23 ) assessed the probabilities for differences among regions over all loci, and for each locus separately. Each region group needed at least two cases for statistical testing, so for example, the testing for region differences would have had 13 regions considering the 82 samples ( Fig. 1) . A region typically corresponds to a country, such as Japan or Taiwan, but for large countries where sites were separated by significant geography, such as North vs South China and East (Borneo) vs West (Peninsular) Malaysia, regions within countries were considered. To address the possibility of lack of independence of some samples arising from a short term spread and propagation of a new infection of one viral genotype in a given hatchery, the data were also analysed at each of various culling steps that attempt to remove potentially non independent samples within hatcheries. First, 15 samples that had the exact same sequence (genotype) as another case from the same location, same year and same species were removed; 67 samples were available after this culling. The second culling included given samples that came from the same location, year and host species as another sample (leaving only one sample per species in a given place and time); 55 samples were available after this round of culling. The intention was to remove cases that may represent propagation in a hatchery, so an exception to the rule is that wild fish samples even if from the same species and location were not culled at this stage. Last, the third culling was for samples that came from the same site and same year as other samples; 40 samples remained after this round of culling. At this stage, even different wild fish were culled if they came from the same site at the same year. Similar culling procedures applied when testing for "species" grouping, and for "year" grouping. When a group contained only one case after culling, the single case was pooled with a neighbouring group (for region and year) or included in a group termed "other" for the species analyses. Construction of phylogenetic trees based on RNA2 nucleotide and amino acid sequences were conducted by MEGA 7 24 using the maximum likelihood method. Statistical ANOVA model. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model assessing jointly effects of location, species and year on "percent RNA sequence relatedness" to a consensus sequence take the following form: Where y ijklmn = observations, i.e. "percent RNA sequence relatedness" to a consensus sequence µ = mean Analyses were conducted using SPSS software. Relative synonymous codon usage analysis. Relative synonymous codon counts were calculated for each of the main host fish species groups, namely, grouper and barramundi, using MEGA 7 24 and counts were compared for differences between groups using a Chi Square test. Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS). Phylogeny-trait (geographic location) associations were tested including 80 sequences (2 Australian samples were removed since they were appeared to be outliers) using Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS) software 25 . Posterior sample of trees (PST) were obtained through Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using BEAST software 26 . BEAST was run for 10 million MCMC chain lengths (sampled every 1000 generations; burn-in 10%) with the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano + Gamma (HKY + G) model, assuming coalescent constant population priors with relaxed lognormal clock 27 . The convergence for all parameters (effective sample size >200) was assessed using TRACER v1.6 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). The resulting trees were used to test whether each region was a monophyletic clade (i.e. assessed for phylogeny-trait statistics considering 10 geographic regions -India, Malaysia 1, Malaysia 2, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, China South, China North, Korea and Japan) using BaTS software 25 . , Japan = Japan. † Different groups that were culled to reduce impact of pseudo-replication, see details in following text. Abbreviations for column 4: F = fish, FW = fish wild, FY = fish wild yearling, C = cell culture. Additional tests for regional differences were conducted using Bayesian Tip-association Significance (BaTS) tests; the association index and the parsimony score statistic assessing regional differences among all samples were both statistically significant (P < 0.05) as were tests of monophyletic clade (MC) sizes for each region, except for Japan and South China. Supplementary Fig. S3) , with an average similarity between pairs of 98.1%, and the most distant pair had 91.5% identity. This maximum distance involved Australia bass which has a rather atypical sequence from all other sequences. Removal of this one outlier showed the average similarity between pairs was 98.3%, and the most distant pair had 96.0% identity; comparable similarity percentages restricting the data set just to groupers (n = 39) were 98.5% and 96.5% respectively. There were 230 nucleotide positions of the 1017 that varied over the cds, and most analyses focused on these variable nucleotide positions (Supplementary Table S4 ). Characteristic attributes. Regional grouping. Regional differences were evident for a large number of nucleotides positions. Analysis of molecular variance tests (AMOVA 23 ) recorded, out of 230 polymorphic sites, 38 nucleotide positions statistically significantly from zero considering region at P ≤ 0.05; an additional 36 at P ≤ 0.01; and the probability when testing all loci together was ≤0.01 (data showing significance levels for each nucleotide position of Fig. 1 are in Supplementary Fig. S5 ). While there were 1017 nucleotides in the complete coding sequences in each of the 82 samples considered, only 230 contained two or more nucleotide variants at a given nucleotide position and would qualify as candidates for statistical testing. However, of the 230, just, 102 contained three or more different alleles; every case of P ≤ 0.01 was restricted to nucleotide positions where there were three or more different bases at a given nucleotide position; this probably reflected the power of the statistical test and relationship with level of polymorphism. Thus we can say that of 102 moderately polymorphic nucleotide sites (with at least three variable nucleotides), more than half recorded statistically significant differences among regions. Every Indonesian and East Malaysian (Borneo) sample invariably had the same (less common) nucleotides at positions 100, 581, 596 and 942 (although a smattering of samples from other regions also had the same nucleotides as some of these positions). These characteristic attributes, hereafter referred to as "CATS", were present in two different grouper species as well as barramundi, were present in multiple sites within Borneo and evident in all (and different) years and collection times (2007 to 2009). Considered separately, each of the "CATS" in highly statistically significant ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5) , and together, with a single exception (AY721615), they comprise a diagnostic genotype unique for Borneo and Indonesia irrespective of host fish species. "CATS" were also evident for Vietnam, and all samples share the same nucleotides at positions 136, 223, 235, 407, 494, 749, 917, 963. Together they comprise a diagnostic genotype almost unique to Vietnam but interestingly all samples from Norther China share, with one exception (596), the same genotype for these "CATS", and the Chinese samples come from three different species (flounder, sole, grouper) and from three different years (2006, 2012, 2013) . While four of the five Vietnamese samples came from the same species, same location and same year (Humpback grouper, North Vietnam, 2015), the fifth, with the same "CAT" genotype, came from a different species and different year (Orange Spotted Grouper, 2007). Together with the data from Northern China, this described genotype would indicate these samples are not randomly drawn from a general population, nor are they solely outcomes of propagation in a given hatchery (although the four Humpback Grouper samples may be). Other "CATS", where only one nucleotide is found in all samples in a given region, are highlighted in darker grey in Fig. 1 ; "CATS" where a given country mostly has one nucleotide at a given position is highlighted in medium grey, and signature genotypes, that characterise a region, composed of a number of "CATS" are given in light grey (see accession numbers HQ859930, HQ859935, HQ859938, HQ859939). Culling to reduce impact of "pseudo-replication". Removing all 15 samples that had identical sequences to other same species samples from the same site and year (cases designated by a "3", column 5, Fig. 1 ) left 67 remaining sequences for analysis (cases designated by a "0", "1" or "2", column 5, Fig. 1 ); this made little change to the probabilities for regional differences recorded using all 82 samples (Supplementary Fig. S5) . Likewise, removing a further 12 hatchery samples which came from the same location, year and host species as other samples (cases designated by a "2", column 5, Fig. 1 ), left 55 samples for analysis (cases designated by a "0" or "1", column 5, Fig. 1 ), but did not substantially alter the pattern of significant cases among regions ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Wild fish were except from culling at this step as the intention was to remove cases of pseudo-replication in the hatcheries. The last culling was for a further 15 samples that came from the same site and same year as other samples (cases designated by a "1", column 5, Fig. 1 ), leaving 40 samples for analysis (cases designated by a "0", Fig. 1 ). Even wild fish meeting these criteria were culled at this point. With these 40 samples, the incidence of significant cases was reduced somewhat, but even in this most extreme vetting, AMOVA analyses showed there were still a total of eight cases (nucleotide positions) with statistically significant differences among regions at P ≤ 0.05, a total of eight cases (nucleotide positions) with statistically significant differences among regions at P ≤ 0.01 and the test over all loci (all nucleotide positions) was significant (P ≤ 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). After culling, there were only 65 nucleotide (allele) positions with three or more different nucleotides (the rest of the 230 were now monomorphic or had one to two nucleotide differences among the 40 samples). So we can say that of 65 moderately polymorphic nucleotide sites (with at least three variable nucleotides of the 40 NNV samples), more than 10% (i.e. eight) recorded highly statistically significant nucleotide differences among regions even under extreme culling (which is about a ten fold higher rate of highly significant cases than that expected by chance alone). Species grouping. Species differences at given nucleotide positions were also detected considering all samples, albeit at about half the incidence as that detected above for regional differences (AMOVA recorded 16 nucleotide positions statistically significantly from zero, P ≤ 0.05; 21 with P ≤ 0.01 and the overall probability when testing all loci together was P ≤ 0.01 (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). There appeared to be a high degree of coincidence in the probability levels for nucleotides considering regions and considering species (r = 0.637, P < 0.001, considering all 230 nucleotide positions). "CATS" that were predominately restricted for one fish host species were not typical, with some rare exceptions (e.g. nucleotide 193); within countries, "CATS" are shared across species, e.g. barramundi and grouper share common "CATS" in East Malaysia and Indonesia (Fig. 1) . On the other hand, with one exception (Column 6, Fig. 1 ), different species did not have completely identical RNA2 sequences. The various culling steps to reduce "pseudo-replication" culminated in the most extreme culling with 40 samples remaining (cases designated by a "0", Fig. 1 ) and relative few cases of statistically significant differences among species, namely five cases of statistically significant nucleotide differences among species, only one at P < 0.01 from among 65 moderately polymorphic nucleotide sites (i.e. those with at least three variable nucleotides). Such an incidence of statistically significant results could be accounted for by chance or Type I error. The test over all loci was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Year grouping. Yearly differences were also detected considering all samples, again at about half the incidence as that detected above for regional differences (AMOVA recorded 14 statistically significantly from zero, P ≤ 0.05; 26 with P ≤ 0.01 and the overall probability when testing all loci together was P ≤ 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S5) . Again, there appeared to be a high degree of coincidence in the probability levels for nucleotides considering regions and considering years (r = 0.642, P < 0.001, considering all 230 nucleotide positions). The various culling steps to reduce "pseudo-replication" culminated in the most extreme culling with 40 samples remaining (cases designated by a "0", Fig. 1 ) and then there was only one case of a statistically significant difference among species, namely one at P < 0.01 from among 65 moderately polymorphic nucleotide sites (i.e. those with at least three variable nucleotides). The test over all loci was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). For some regions, the same "CATS" were recorded over years, for example, the "CATS" at nucleotides position 144 for Singapore were evident from 1991 through to 2000, and several "CATS" for North China (nucleotide positions 135, 222, 234, 405, etc.) were evident from 2006 to 2012. Analogous results were evident for Vietnam and Western Malaysia (Borneo) but not for India. On the other hand, with one exception (Column 6, Fig. 1 ), different years did not have completely identical RNA2 sequences.
