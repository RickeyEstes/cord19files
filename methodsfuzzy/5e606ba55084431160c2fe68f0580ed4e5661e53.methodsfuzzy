The pathogens responsible for waterborne diseases and human diseases has become an emerging concern based on the epidemic and pandemics blooms occurred in some regions of the world such as Asia and Africa [136] . Methods such as activated carbon or chlorination have disadvantages such as hazardous chemical waste. Disinfection with ozone is an effective but costly way because it requires in-situ generation or a previous generation. Plasma-driven reactions also emerge as a new way to eliminate recalcitrant pollutants as well as a pretreatment in wastewater plants with bacterial sludge [16, 235] . UV light can help to control the proliferation of pathogens. The efficiency of disinfection depends on the capacity of the cellular components for the absorption of light from each microbe. Natural solar irradiation has also been used for disinfection processes. Photocatalytic materials based on TiO2 remain as an effective alternative for water disinfection air and surfaces, and can be boosted with some chemicals like ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and so on. Photo-disinfection is the ideal platform with sustainable and biocompatible features to prevent and control the proliferation of microbes. Also, it can be incorporated into a real water treatment plant as a pre-treatment or secondary disinfection step and as an active antibacterial ceramic in washing machines, clothes, hospital artifacts and auto-cleaning surfaces in restaurants and toilet facilities [236] .
