To compare the quality of high-throughput assays the Z'factor is frequently employed [14, 43] . In addition, the assessment of measurement procedures can be based on traditional statistic parameters like signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N), signal to background ratio (S/B), and coefficient of variation (CV) ( Table 1) . CV is the ratio of mean to variance and often used as quality control for assays [44] . The S/B-ratio is a criterion that indicates whether the level of the signal is sufficiently high above the background. The rule of thumb for a good HTS assay is S/B >3. However, fluctuations in both the signal and the background are not considered. In contrast, the S/ N-ratio takes into account the standard deviation of the background. The higher the S/N ratio, the less do background fluctuation influence the desired signal. Both measures indicate whether a sample could be distinguished from the background, however they don't quantify to what extent the positive and negative controls can be distinguished. Therefore methods have been explicitly developed to evaluate high-throughput screenings, like Z'-factor and the Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD) [45] . J.H. Zhang (1999) defined the Z'-factor based on the normal distribution and the 3-sigma rule of thumb [43, 46] , which implies that 99.7% of all samples lie within less than three standard deviations distance from the mean. The Z'-factor has become a common metric for HTS quality control as it allows to decide whether an assay is suitable to just distinguish positive samples from negative ones (Z'>0,5) or whether it can distinguish well performing samples from poor ones (Z'>0,8) [14, 43, 47] . The strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) takes the mean difference of negatives and positives in proportion to the standard deviation. SSMD gained recognition in screening e.g. for antiviral drugs [48] . In 2007, X.D. Zhang derived the SSMD under the condition of independence of both distributions through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and method of moment (MM). Finally, for increased robustness against outliers, the median of absolute deviation (SSMD R ) can be used. In this work, we applied for the first time these different SSMDs for evaluation of a biocatalyst screening assay. SSMD have already been used in RNAi screening and cell-based systems Table 1 . Overview of statistical measures for evaluation of HTS assays. σ = standard deviation; μ = mean; m = median; pos = data set of positive controls; neg = data set of negative controls; n = sample size; F k = cumulative density function for data set k; max j = maximum distance between two distributions; SSMD = Strictly standardized mean difference; x i = ith value of the (ordered) data set x. All enzymes and chemicals used in the assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) and Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Reagents were dissolved in 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) unless stated otherwise. For all buffers and solutions deionized water was used. Expression and purification of para-nitrobenzyl-esterase 13 (pNB-Est 13) Expression was performed in E. coli BL 21 codonplus using a pET-22b vector system with a pelB-leader sequence for export to the periplasm of E.coli. After transformation cells were cultivated at 180 rpm and 30°C in shaking flasks in 400 mL LB-medium. After the OD600 had
