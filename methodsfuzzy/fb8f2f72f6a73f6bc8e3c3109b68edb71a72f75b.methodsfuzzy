Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. 12 As for uncultivable viruses, we compared RV16 and RV15. If the results between RV16 and RV15 were concordant, they were considered to be a true positive without sequencing. However, if the results between RV16 and RV15 were discrepant, singleplex PCR and sequencing with specific primers was performed as a confirmatory test. The main outcomes of this study were the sensitivity and specificity of culture and RV16 and RV15 assay. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). (Table 1 ). In our study, RSV A and rhinoviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus (Table 1 ). In our study, two (100%) of two quadruple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 assay only, while 9 (45%) of 20 triple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 alone. The results remained the same at repeated tests, singleplex PCR, and confirmatory sequencing analysis. Table 1 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of influenza viruses, RSV and HRV. It also shows that coronavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus accounted for about 13.1% (63/482), 10.4% (50/482) and 12.7% (61/482) respectively, followed by enterovirus and bocavirus at around 2.3% (11/482) and 4.4% (21/482).
