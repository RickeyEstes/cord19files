As stated, to this day there has been no record of terrorist events in Portugal. Other European countries such as Luxembourg, Monaco, Lithuania, Andorra, Malta, Montenegro, San Marino, and Slovenia are safe countries as well. However, none of these countries kept a record of tourism arrivals or receipts. With a large international recognition and several tourism awards granted to its many regions, cities and destinations, Portugal has been one of the countries with the best performances in tourism. The country has experienced an average annual growth of 11% in tourists' arrivals since 2010 (World Tourism Organization, 2018) . In 2017, Portugal received > 14.5 million international tourists and 9.3 million domestic tourists. The arrivals had a massive impact on tourism receipts that have been growing in a sustained way over these last few years and amounted to > 17 billion American dollars in 2017 (Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica, 2019; World Tourism Organization, 2018). This growth is directly connected to the strategic positioning of the "Destination Portugal" brand that, in recent years, has brought Portugal and other specific Portuguese destinations several international awards. Over the last years, Portugal has won several international awards at the World Travel Awards: i) Portugal "World's best tourist destination" (for the 3rd year in a row); (ii) Lisbon "World's Best Citybreak destination"; iii) Madeira "The Best Insular destination" (for the 4th year in a row); iv) Sintra-Monte da Lua Parks "The Best example of Heritage Recovery"; v) Portugal "The Best European and World Golf Destination" (for the 5th year in a row); vi) "Turismo de Portugal" considered the World's Best Tourism Organization, among many others. The image of Portugal as a safe tourism destination has led to an exponential increase in tourist arrivals. In fact, Portugal was the third safest country in the world in 2017 (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2018) and is currently a huge European tourist attraction. Portugal was the country chosen for this study because of its importance and potential and especially because it is regarded as a safe country with no record of terrorist events since ever. In the next subsections, sample and data will be presented. Data includes tourists' arrivals in Portugal, sorted by region of origin, and the number of terrorist attacks that have occurred in the selected European countries, from 2002 to the end of 2016.
