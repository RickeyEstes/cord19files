Expression, purification, and crystallization of P [14] VP8 * and its complex with A-type oligosaccharides, and structure determination, using RRV VP8 * structure (PDB id: 1KQR) as a molecular replacement model, and refinement were carried out as described in the Supplementary Methods section. Diffraction data were collected at Baylor College of Medicine using Rigaku FR-E+ SuperBright rotating anode. See Table S2 for data collection and refinement statistics. The carbohydrate-binding specificity of P [14] VP8* was investigated using glycan array v4.2 with 511 glycans in replicates of 6 (Consortium for Functional Glycomics Protein-Glycan Interaction Core (H) (http:// www.functionalglycomics). GST-tagged VP8* bound on the glycan array was detected using a fluorescent-labeled anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Infectivity assays were performed as previously described 3, 27 .
