Data were routinely collected from the weekly epidemiological report of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the period from 2016/week 4 to 2018/week 30. The extracted counts included newly suspected weekly cases for both positively and negatively testing specimens, as well as the number of fatal cases reported per week. For both cases and deaths, the corresponding week of the report represents the week in which the illness onset and death events occurred, respectively (i.e. fatal cases were not reported as a function of the week of illness onset). We did not use the available data for previous time periods (2012 -2016) owing to irregular reporting and removal Figure 2 . Cross-map causality for shared seasonality of environmental variables with the Lassa fever incidence. Red circles show the unlagged crossmap skill. Box-plots show null distributions for cross-map skill expected from random surrogate time series that share the same seasonality as the true environmental variable. The single filled circle indicates that the measured causality is significantly better than the null expectation ( p , 0.01). As for the use of convergent cross-mapping, please see literature [20, 21] . (Online version in colour.) To access weekly data on climatological variables (i.e. precipitation, temperature, relative and specific humidity, precipitable water), we used publicly available gridded NCEP/ NCAR Reanalysis data [27, 28] . The chosen reference point was set to coordinates 6.758 N 6.258 E, located in Edo state, Nigeria. Historically, Edo state was characterized by a high prevalence of LF infection. It was also marked as highly hazardous for LF transmission owing to an average annual rainfall of 1786 mm [22] . Additionally, we used monthly data records over a longer time period for the same location that were provided by another source: a publicly available dataset of the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit [29] . While the former was used for correlative analysis of rainfall patterns and available incidence data from the last 6 years, the latter was used only to generate the historical characteristics of rainfall, as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S4. (b) Estimation of the incubation period and the time from illness onset to death We fitted the distributions of the incubation period f and the time from illness onset to death h, which were essential for describing the epidemiological process, to gamma distributions. The analysed dataset included the cases and transmission events during a nosocomial outbreak in the Evangel Hospital in Jos, Nigeria, in 1970 ( fig. 1 in [19] ). In total, the number of described cases was 23 with probable time intervals of exposure, the date of illness onset and the date of death. To determine the best-fit parameters for both distributions, we applied a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. The 95% credible interval (CrI) for each fitted parameter of the two distributions was determined as the 95% high-density interval [30] .
