Tick surveillance: The tick surveillance was undertaken at 14 fixed points and in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City (Fig. 1A) from May to September 2011, to identify tick populations and tick species in human habitats in Kyoto City. We chose 14 surveillance points located on the mountainsides of the northern (A to E in Fig. 1A and Table 1 ), western (F to K) and eastern (L to N) parts of Kyoto City. The vegetation at these locations consisted mainly of short grasses. Ticks on the plants were captured by a standard flagging method [26] . Ticks were also collected from 5 wild boars hunted in Yamashina-ku (O) for the harmful wildlife control. Adult and nymph ticks were placed in sample bottles containing wet filter paper and taken back to our diagnostic laboratory. They were anesthetized with chloroform. Tick larvae were placed into 70% ethanol. Each tick species was determined by its morphological index [33] . (Table 2) . One hundred and ninety four ticks (96.5%) were identified as H. longicornis. Twenty four, 30 and 140 ticks were male, female and nymph, respectively. Of these, 21 ticks were captured from 5 wild boars. Two H. flava nymphs, 4 A. testudinarium nymphs and 1 adult D. taiwanensis female were also examined. To extract DNA from the ticks, collected ticks stored in 70% ethanol were washed with distilled water. These ticks were placed on slide glass and covered with 100 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After placing cover glasses on top, they were crushed using the head of a tooth pick. The fluid was collected and stored at −80°C until used as a DNA template. A PCR was performed using the genus-specific primer pair of RpCS877, 5′-GGGGGCCTGCTCACGGCGG and RpCS1258, 5′-ATT-GCAAAAAGTACAGTGAACA for the rickettsial citrate synthase (gltA) gene [25] . The reaction was carried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq (TAKARA BIO, Otsu, Japan) with a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 2 µl of template DNA, 200 µM each of dNTP and 1 µM each of primer. Following initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, 5 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 60 sec, annealing at 53°C for 60 sec and extension at 72°C for 60 sec were performed. Then, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 60 sec, annealing at 60°C for 60 sec and extension at 72°C for 60 sec were followed. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 7 min. The Rickettsia 17-kDa genus-common antigen (17K antigen) gene was also amplified using the primer pair R1; 5′-TCAATTCA-CAACTTGCCATT-3′ and R2; 5′-TTTACAAAATTCTA-AAAACC-3′ [1] . Nested PCR was performed with a primer pair, Rj5; 5′-CGCCATTCTACGTTACTACC-3′ and Rj10; 5′-ATTCTAAAAACCATATACTG-3′ to detect the sequence of R. japonica DNA using the 100 times diluted PCR products which were amplified with primer pair of R1 and R2 as a template [9] . The reaction was carried out using TaKaRa Ex Taq with a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 2 µl of template DNA, 200 µM each of dNTP and 1 µM of each primer. After initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 57°C for 2 min and extension at 70°C for 2 min were carried out. The final extension was performed at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Wizard ® SV Gel and PCR and Clean-Up System; Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), and the sequences of amplified products were determined by cycle sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis: The sequences obtained were evaluated and aligned with each other and those of previously characterized rickettsiae in GenBank by using BLASTn [4] . Multiple alignment analysis was carried out using the pro-gram ClustalW [6] . Phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the approximately 450 bp of partial sequence of 17K antigen gene using the Genetyx 11.1 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor joining method.
