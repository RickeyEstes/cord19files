Steam sterilization. Steam sterilization involves the use of saturated steam under pressure in an autoclave to achieve sterilization. This is the most effective form of sterilization, is nontoxic and inexpensive, and as a result is the most widely used as well. The use of steam under pressure allows lower temperatures to be used for shorter periods of time when compared with dry heat sterilization (Table 11 -4). The most common temperatures used for steam sterilization are 121°C (250°F) and 132°C (270°F). Cycle times vary depending on the autoclave used and whether items are wrapped or unwrapped, but are generally less than 30 minutes (see Table  11 -4). There are two basic types of autoclaves: gravity displacement autoclaves, and high-speed prevacuum sterilizers. Gravity displacement autoclaves admit steam at the top or sides of the autoclave, which displaces air through a drain vent at the bottom of the chamber (Figure 11-1) . High-speed prevacuum sterilizers rapidly pump air out of the sterilizer before steam is admitted. This leads to rapid penetration of steam into all surfaces. As a result, cycle times can be reduced to less than 15 minutes. Drying times are also reduced with prevacuum sterilizers. Sterilizers should be located away from potential sources of contamination, such as sinks, trash disposal, or high-traffic areas. Before steam sterilization is performed, instruments should be cleaned thoroughly to remove organic and inorganic material, and then dried. All jointed items should be opened or unlocked, and items should not be crowded in the autoclave, so that steam can circulate freely. At least 3 inches should be left between the autoclave wall and items to be sterilized. The manufacturer's instructions for autoclave operation should be followed. The efficacy of autoclaving must be tested for every autoclaved item, with additional quality control performed on a periodic basis. Autoclave indicator tape is routinely used; although this only indicates conditions on the outside of the package. Steam indicator strips should be included in each surgical pack and evaluated by the person opening the pack. Biological indicators provide a more definitive assessment of autoclave efficacy and should be used periodically (e.g., weekly) and the results documented. These consist of a standardized population of bacterial spores, usually on a filter paper strip or contained within a vial. The strip is then sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture, or cultured in-house, to ensure that the spores have been completely inactivated by the sterilization process. Any indicator failure should result in immediate inspection of the autoclave. Sterilization indicators should never be used as a substitute for proper autoclave operation and careful preparation, packing, and loading of equipment to be sterilized. After steam sterilization, instruments should be allowed to dry before they are removed, which typically takes an additional 30 minutes. Items should then be stored in a location and manner that prevents further contamination. Flash sterilization. Flash sterilization refers to the rapid sterilization of unwrapped instruments and is usually performed as an emergency procedure in an operating room setting when time is insufficient to perform the preferred sterilization of wrapped items. In general it is performed for 3 minutes at 270°F and 27 to 28 lb/in 2 . Each instrument must be carefully protected to ensure it does not become recontaminated during transport back to the operating room, usually in a "flash pan." Flash sterilization has occasionally been associated with intraoperative infections and should not be used for routine disinfection purposes. Gas sterilization. Gas sterilization is used for sterilization of heat-and moisture-sensitive instruments but can have significant toxicity. Gases that can be used for sterilization include formaldehyde, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide vapor, and ozone gases. The most commonly used gas in veterinary medicine, ETO, has strong alkylating properties and causes protein coagulation, enzyme inactivation, and damage to nucleic acid. When compared with heat sterilization, ETO sterilization takes longer (24 hours or more including the time required to allow ETO to diffuse out of packages at the end of sterilization) and is more expensive. In addition, it only achieves surface sterilization and requires sophisticated equipment and trained staff. The gas is extremely flammable, irritates the eyes and mucous membranes, is mutagenic and carcinogenic, and has a misleadingly pleasant smell.
