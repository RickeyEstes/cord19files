The full laboratory methods of the general study from which this analysis has been performed are detailed elsewhere. 20 Blood samples were cultured using an automated blood culture system (BD Bactec; BD, New Jersey, USA), and bacterial isolates identified by Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (PHX system; BD) or colony morphology and biochemical tests. The detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B was also studied by real-time PCR using a published in-house assay. 21 The presence of DNA/RNA of influenza viruses A and B, RSV A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4, rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), coronaviruses (CoV) 229E, NL63, and OC43, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis in nasopharyngeal aspirates was also systematically investigated by means of the TrueScience RespiFinder Pathogen Identification Panel (Applied Biosystems, New York, USA).
