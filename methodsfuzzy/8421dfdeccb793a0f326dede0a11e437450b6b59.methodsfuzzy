Cell lines for the cell-cell membrane fusion Five stable cell lines (CHO-ACE2, CHO-SG, CHO-E2G, C2C12-SG, and C2C12-E2G) were established from the cell line CHO-K1 and C2C12 (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]). C2C12, 293 and Cos7 (ATCC) cell lines were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g L À1 glucose, 0.1 mg ml À1 streptomycin, 100 U ml À1 penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone), in addition to 1 mg ml À1 G418 (Gibco/BRL) for the stable cell lines. The constructions of CHO-SG and CHO-ACE2 were described previously [5, 8] . The HCV E2 gene (the ectodomain of E2 protein from HCV polyprotein amino acid sequence 364-673) was amplified from the template HCV-S1 [9] (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] accession no. AF356827) with primers E2F (5 0 -GCAGATCTGCCACCatggtggggaactgggctaag-3 0 ) and E2R (5 0 -GCatttaaatTCTGCCACTCTGTCGTAGAC-3 0 ). The PCR fragment was double digested with BglII/SwaI and inserted into the plasmid pEGFP-N1-S-EGFP [8] with the same treatment. The ectodomain of S-EGFP was replaced with the ectodomain of E2 to produce E2-EGFP, and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains plus 20 amino acid residues in the outward juxtamembrane region of S protein were fused with the E2 protein. Stable cell lines of CHO-E2G, C2C12-E2G, and C2C12-SG were established by using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent and G418 for the selection. High-yield clones were selected by using a fluorescence microscope fitted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter.
