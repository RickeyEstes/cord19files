We examined exhaled air dispersion during NIV using a human patient simulator reclined at 45° in a negative pressure room with 12 air changes/h by two diff erent helmets via a ventilator and a total facemask via a bilevel positive airway pressure device. Exhaled air was marked by intrapulmonary smoke particles, illuminated by laser light sheet, and captured by a video camera for data analysis. Signifi cant exposure was defi ned as where there was Ն 20% of normalized smoke concentration. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion during application of NIV on a high-fi delity human patient simulator (HPS) (HPS 6.1; CAE Healthcare, Inc) via two diff erent helmets (PN530L; Sea-Long Medical Systems Inc, and StarMed CaStar R; Intersurgical Ltd) using a SERVO-i ventilator (MAQUET) with double-limb circuit and fi lters. In addition, we studied the deliberate leakage from the exhalation port of a total facemask (Koninklijke Philips N.V.) during NIV via a bilevel positive airway pressure device and a single-limb circuit fi rmly attached to the HPS ( Fig 1 ) . Th e experiments were conducted in a negative pressure room, with 12 air changes/h (ACH) ( Fig 2 ) . Th e experimental design and method of data analysis have been described in detail in our previous studies on exhaled air dispersion related to the application of NIV, 12,13 oxygen masks, 14,15 jet nebulizer, 16 and mask ventilation. 17
