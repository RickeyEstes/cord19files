The human cell line Henle 407 (ATCC CCL-6) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO Laboratories, Germany). For immunofluorescence studies, cells were seeded onto 12 mm-diameter glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates (Inter Med Nunc) and infected during 3 h with overnight grown cells of S. flexneri aroD strain SFL124-27 at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 (bacteria:cell). This aroD strain was preferred in the invasion experiments because of the ease of handling with a relatively lower level of containment. Infected cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-saline buffer (PBS) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in the same PBS. Bacteria and the LamB-A6 protein were stained using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against S. flexneri Y (Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany) and the monoclonal antibodies (Mab) 6A.A6 that binds to the coronavirus A6 antigen (Ingenasa SA, Madrid) as first antibodies and fluorescein-labeled goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and TRITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse (Dianova, Germany) as secondary antibodies. Coverslips were washed, mounted, and cells were examined by epifluorescence with a Zeiss axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). For immunoseparation experiments, cells were grown on 100 mm Petri dishes (Inter Med Nunc) and infected with bacteria as described above.
