Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the best-studied arthropods in the context of NIRVS and were therefore used as validation organisms for our NIRVS identification pipeline. Our count in Ae. aegypti (n = 276) (Figs 2-4) was considerably more than Palatini et al. (2017) (n = 122) who used a similar BLAST-based approach, and a recent version of the same genome (AaegL3.0) (Palatini et al. 2017 ). Our results may reflect a more extensive range of query viruses (n = 1,933 vs. n = 425). Alternatively, Whitfield et al. (2017) reported 472 NIRVS in Ae. aegypti, but used a long-read based genome assembly for NIRVS identification. Since the current AaegL5.0 assembly is based on short-read technology, highly repetitive NIRVS-rich regions may be masked (Dudchenko et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . These variable figures suggest that the number of NIRVS reported is not definitive but is contingent on filtering parameters and the quality of host genome assembly. In Ae. albopictus, we reported 276 NIRVS (Figs 2-4) , also higher than Palatini et al. (n = 72) , yet they used a genome from a different source (Foshan strain as opposed to C6/36 cell line used in our study). However, the true number of NIRVS in Ae. albopictus is probably as high as or higher than Ae. aegypti, as it contains an even higher proportion of TEs (Chen et al. 2015) , including LTR retrotransposons which may be responsible for NIRVS formation. Despite the discrepancies, both studies report similar NIRVS characteristics. These NIRVS were dominated by insertions from the structural gene-coding regions (N and G) of negative-sense viruses (predominantly mononegaviruses), with fewer insertions from Ã¾ssRNA and dsRNA viruses. This indicates that the methodology of the current study, which identified NIRVS without generating excessive false positive hits, is robust.
