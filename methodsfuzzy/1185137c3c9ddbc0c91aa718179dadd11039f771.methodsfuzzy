Plasmids. We employed pCAGGS-based expression plasmids encoding vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (VSV-G), wild-type (wt) MERS-S or cleavage site mutants 748 SSVR 751, 748 ASVA 751, 763 NYT 765, 884 ASAA 887 and 748 ASVA 751 + 884 ASAA 887 that have been described previously 10, 16, 21, 23 . Additionally, MERS-S-proteins containing single amino acid exchanges at the cleavage sites of the S1/S2 border, ASVR (R748A) and RSVA (R751A), or the S2′ site, ASAR (R884A) and RSAA (R887A), were generated by overlap extension PCR (S protein mutants are summarized in Fig. 1 ). For all S proteins, we constructed versions with or without a C-terminal V5 tag. Further, we generated expression plasmids for human TMPRSS2 and human DPP4 N-terminally linked to DsRed (DsRed DPP4) by PCR-based methods and inserted the respective open reading frames and into the pQCXIP vector. In case of the expression vector for TMPRSS2, the vector encoded selection marker for puromycin resistance was exchanged by that for blasticidin resistance taken from the (pcDNA6/TR) vector. The integrity of the PCR-amplified sequences was verified by automated sequence analysis (Microsynth Seqlab). Cell culture. 293T Antibodies. The following antibodies were used as primary antibodies: Anti V5 (Invitrogen), anti β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti VSV-M (Kerafast). As secondary antibody, an anti-mouse HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugated antibody was employed (Dianova). All antibodies were diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween20 (PBS T) and 5% skim milk.
