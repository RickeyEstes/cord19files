A variety of histological, immunological, and molecular diagnostic techniques are available for the detection of TSV, and these are thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Lightner, 1996b (Lightner, , 1999 . Routine H&E histology of Davidson's AFA-preserved shrimp tissue (Bell and Lightner, 1988; Humason, 1972 ) is a standard diagnostic tool used for the identification of TSV-induced pathology. Observation of the pathognomonic acute-phase lesion in cuticular epithelium (Fig. 3A ) by light microscopy is sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of TSV infection Hasson et al., 1995 Hasson et al., , 1997 Hasson et al., , 1999a Lightner, 1995 Lightner, , 1996a Lightner et al., 1994 Lightner et al., , 1995 . An ISH method for detecting TSV in shrimp tissue has been developed that employs two TSV-specific, digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes (1.3 and 1.5 kb) complementary to the TSV genome (Mari et al., 1998) . Positive ISH reactions in shrimp histological sections produce a blueblack precipitate within the cytoplasm of TSV-infected cells. One advantage of ISH over routine H&E histology is the greater diagnostic sensitivity, as TSV can be detected in shrimp with mild acute infections that may not be obvious by routine histology. In addition, ISH can detect TSV both in asymptomatic and chronically-infected shrimp in which the only histological abnormality is the presence of ectopic or LO spheroids. As LO spheroid development has been associated with at least six different shrimp viral diseases, demonstration of TSV in spheroids by ISH is necessary for a confirmatory diagnosis of this disease (Hasson et al., 1999c) . Overfixation of TSV-infected shrimp tissue with Davidson's AFA fixative can result in acid hydrolysis of RNA and produce false-negative ISH results. This problem can be avoided by using a fixation time of 24 hr and prompt tissue embedding or preservation in a neutral pH fixative . An ELISA-based dot blot test for the detection of TSV capsid protein by use of a TSV-specific monoclonal antibody has been described (Poulos et al., 1999) , and the procedure has been modified for the IHC detection of TSV in histological sections (Dr. Luis Matheu Wyld, personal communication, 1998 ). IHC has advantages over ISH in that it is a rapid assay (4 hr versus 36 hr for ISH), more economical, and its TSV detection sensitivity is equivalent to ISH assay. The principle drawback with this technique is that the current commercially available antibody detects the original TSV type strain or isotype but not the Mexican strain identified in L. stylirostris (Erickson et al., 2002; Robles-Sikisaka et al., 2002) . Detection of viruses by their propagation in cell lines is a routine diagnostic tool used in clinical virology laboratories Toullec, 1999) . A variety of shrimp primary cell cultures have been developed, but an immortalized shrimp cell line has yet to be achieved. As a result, diagnosticians continue to rely on in vivo bioassays for shrimp virus detection and amplification (Lightner, 1996a; Toullec, 1999) . A crustacean cell line established from crayfish (Orconecte limosus) neuronal cells has been reported (Neumann et al., 2000) and is available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). There have been no reported attempts, however, to propagate TSV or other shrimp viruses using this cell line.
