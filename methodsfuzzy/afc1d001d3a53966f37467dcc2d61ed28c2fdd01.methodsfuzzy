2.1. Bacterial strains, growth conditions, and growth rates S. pneumoniae were grown at 35 â€¢ C, 5% CO 2 , on trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep's blood (BD-Diagnostic Systems), or in Todd-Hewitt, 5% Yeast Extract liquid media. Strains used in this work were low passage carriage isolates selected from our S. pneumoniae collection. Strain FG23 is part of a collection of samples taken from healthy children in a prospective study of pneumococcal carriage among PCV7 recipients in Texas between 2000 and 2001 [29] . Strain MIB02102 is from a collection of samples isolated from healthy children in a study of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae colonization, and risk factors for carriage in children less than 3 years of age in Michigan [44] . Both strains belong to ST199. Strain FG23 is serotype 19A and strain MIB02102 is serotype 15B/C. While some studies consider 15B and 15C separately [45, 46] , the coding regions for serotypes 15B and 15C differ only by a single TA tandem repeat [47] , which results in a single difference in the O-acetyl structure [28, [47] [48] [49] . As serotypes 15B and 15C can interconvert, we consider 15B and 15C together in our analyses as is done in other studies [28, 31, 50] . Strains were typed previously by multilocus sequence typing [13] as described by Enright and Spratt [51] .
