Autopsy material from 8 SARS patients, accessioned at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, formed the basis of this study. Clinical and autopsy reports were reviewed. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of lung tissue were reviewed on each patient (range, 3 to 108 slides; mean, 27 slides) for multiple histological features (Table 1) . These features were scored as present (ϩ) or absent (Ϫ) and, when present, were graded for percentage of tissue involved (1, 1% to 24%; 2, 25% to 49%; 3, 50% to 74%; 4, 75% to 100%) and degree of involvement (1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked). In 8 cases, representative tissue sections of lung prepared from paraffin blocks were stained with Brown-Brenn gram stain, Brown-Hopps gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen for acid-fast bacteria, and Grocott's methenamine silver for fungi. Microorganisms were determined to be present (ϩ) or absent (Ϫ). Immunohistochemical staining (Table 2 ) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue of a representative section of lung from each case. The antibodies were pretreated when necessary with protease or heat-induced epitope retrieval. This was followed by automated immunostaining with either the Ventana stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique or the Dako stainer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) using a link polymer system. Both automated stainers used 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the chromogen. Negative controls in which the primary antibody was omitted and positive controls on tissues with known positive immunoreactions for each antibody were used. AE1/AE3/CK1 (pancytokeratin), CD68, and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) immunostains were studied for multiple histological features. Adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 immunostains were noted to be positive (ϩ) or negative (Ϫ). At the AFIP, RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues in 8 cases, as described previously. 5, 6 Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV RNA was performed using published primers 7 and using methods as described previously. 6 The Defense Medical Research Institute and Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, performed initial RT-PCR tests on fresh autopsy lung tissue in all 8 cases.
