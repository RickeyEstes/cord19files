We use data from two sources: a time series of clinic admissions for diarrheal disease and a community based survey of healthseeking behavior. Clinic surveillance covers a collection of health centers and district hospitals from four districts in the Maradi region of Niger including Aguie, Guidan Roumdji, Madarounfa, and the city of Maradi. A total of 9590 cases of diarrhea in children under 5 were recorded from December 23, 2009 to March 31, 2012 (118 weeks). For each patient age in months, village of origin, date of consultation were recorded. Also noted were potential symptoms including temperature, duration of diarrhea before consultation, presence of blood in the stool, presence and duration of vomiting, and level of dehydration. In each case a rapid test was administered for detecting rotavirus. Using the rapid test, 2921 cases tested positive for rotavirus. A subset of 378 cases testing positive for rotavirus were also genotyped. While 32 separate strains were identified, more than two thirds of positive cases were of strains G12P [8] or G2P [4] . The distributed nature of Niger's healthcare system is a challenge for surveillance. Roughly a third of all health centers in these districts were included. Notably absent were the many local health posts staffed by community health workers. To estimate both the fraction of cases seeking care at a health center, and the fraction seeking any level of care, a second source of data is needed. We use a community survey [27] of children approximately under 5 years old to get estimates of these reporting rates. A total of 2940 children under 5 were selected for inclusion in the cluster survey from households across the four districts. Clusters were allotted according to the population of each village from census data. Sampling weights accounted for household composition and the relative populations of the districts. Among those surveyed, 1099 caregivers reported at least one episode of diarrhea during the recall period of 27 days. Respondents reported whether they sought care at a health structure. We use the reporting rate of severe diarrhea, which is defined as the presence of acute watery diarrhea and the presence of two or more of the signs of loss of consciousness, sunken eyes, and an incapacity to drink or drinking very little. From the cluster survey we determine that an estimated total of 42.9% of caregivers who reported severe diarrhea consulted at a health center 95%CI : ð33:1%; 52:7%Þ ð Þ . The rest either sought care at a district hospital, local health post or did not seek care at a formal health structure. This estimate is used as a proxy for the reporting rate of rotavirus. More specifically, this information is used to construct an informative prior for our Bayesian approach (as described in the supplementary material).
