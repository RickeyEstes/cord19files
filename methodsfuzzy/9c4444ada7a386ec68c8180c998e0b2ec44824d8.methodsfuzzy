Cell culture and treatment. according to the method described by Gong et al (17) , a total of 20 3-week-old female Sprague-dawley rats (laboratory animal center of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) were sacrificed by the intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and BMScs were extracted from femurs and tibias by aseptic manipulation. cells were expanded in minimum essential medium (α-MEM; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 1% penicillin G-streptomycin and cultured in 5% CO2 at 37˚C. BMSCs at a density of 80-90% were passaged and cells at passage three to six were used in the following experiments. For osteogenic induction, basic medium was supplemented with 10 -7 mol/l dexamethasone, 10 -2 mol/l sodium β-glycerophosphate and 50 µg/ml l-ascorbic acid. The medium was changed every 3 days for BMSc differentiation. each experiment was performed in triplicate. all the experimental protocols involving animals were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Tongji Medical college, Huazhong university of Science and Technology (iacuu no. S496; date of permission, october, 31, 2017). icariin (purity >98%; abcam) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then stored at -20˚C without light. Subsequent experiments used a dMSo concentration of ≤0.1%. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The effect of icariin on cell proliferation was evaluated using the ccK-8 assay. Briefly, BMScs (5x10 3 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates and treated with icariin (10 -10 -10 -3 mol/l) for 48 h at 37˚C. Subsequently, cell proliferation was assessed using the ccK-8 reagent (nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering institute), according to the manufacturer's instructions, at a wavelength of 450 nm using an elx800 multifunctional microplate reader (BioTek instruments, inc.). The concentration of icariin used to treat the cells that were analyzed by rT-qPcr and western blotting was based on the results of the ccK-8 assay. Flow cytometry. After reaching confluence, BMSCs at passage 3-4 were used for flow cytometric analysis. First, the cells were incubated with trypsin for 1 min at 37˚C, and then the cell pellet was collected by transient centrifugation at 400 x g at room temperature for 5 min. next, the cell pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS and then centrifuged at 400 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µl ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 20 min at 4˚C. Additionally, the cells were treated with Rat Fc block (cat. no. 550271; BioLegend, Inc.) for 20 min at 4˚C. Finally, the cells were identified by negative expression of CD34 [phycoerythrin (Pe)-labeled; cat. no. 128611; Biolegend, inc.] and cd45 (FiTc-labeled; cat. no. 202205; Biolegend, inc.) and positive expression of cd73 (FiTc-labeled; cat. no. 127219; Biolegend, inc.), cd90 (Pe-labeled; cat. no. 205903; Biolegend, inc.) and cd105 (Pe-labeled; cat. no. 120407; Biolegend, inc.) using a FACSscan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed by FlowJo software (version X; FlowJo llc). The reaction conditions were as follows: 95˚C for 15 sec, 60˚C for 20 sec and 75˚C for 10 sec after denaturing DNA templates at 95˚C for 10 min; 40 cycles. The 2 -ΔΔcq method (18) was used to determine the relative expression levels. Western blotting. Total protein was extracted with riPa buffer (Sigma-Aldrich; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to standard protocols. cell lysates with 50 µg of total protein (quantified using the bicinchoninic acid assay) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and then blocked in TBST with 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal mouse antibodies targeted against: cat. no. ab34710; abcam) and β-actin (1:1,000; cat. no. ab8227; Abcam) at 4˚C overnight, and then followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; cat. no. aSP00001; dako; agilent Technologies, inc.) for 1 h at room temperature after washing. The immunoblots were visualized and detected using the ecl system (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Protein expression was quantified using Fusion Solo software (version 4; Vilber Lourmat Deutschland GmbH). Transient transfection and luciferase assay. BMal1 short hairpin rna (shrna) interference lentiviral vector was constructed and synthesized by Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd. The BMAL1 shRNA interference target sequence was 5'-ACA CGC AAT AGA TGG GAA A-3', and a scramble sequence 5'-TTC AAG ATC CTC AAT TAT A-3' was used as a negative control. BMSCs were cultured in 6-well plates with specific media to appropriate confluence and then transfected with the virus assisted with 6 µg/ml polybrene for 12 h at 37˚C. The viral supernatants were removed and the culture was continued in complete medium. BMSCs were grown to 30-70% confluence and then transfected with BMal1, BMal1-shrnas or empty vector overnight. The following day, the cells were co-transfected with pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids (10 ng; Promega Corporation) and firefly luciferase reporter vectors (50 ng), using lipofectamine ® 2000 (invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) as the delivery system and a control. Cells were lysed after a 48-h transfection and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega corporation). ALP and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining. BMScs were seeded at a density of 1x10 5 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated with osteogenic medium. According to the manufacturer's instructions, alP staining was assessed using an alP staining kit (nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering institute) on day 7. after osteogenic induction for 14 days, the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Then paraformaldehyde was removed and the cells were washed three times with ddH 2 o. Finally, the cells were stained with 0.04 M arS for 30 min at room temperature, and then rinsed twice with ddH 2 o and visualized under a light microscope (magnification, x40). For quantitative analysis of arS staining, the absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a UV spectrophotometer. Results of arS are expressed as µg/mg protein with average and standard deviation. Statistical analysis. data are presented as the mean ± Sd. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 17.0; SPSS, inc.). differences between groups were analyzed using an unpaired Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
