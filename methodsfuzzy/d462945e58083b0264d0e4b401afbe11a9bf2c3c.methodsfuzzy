The records of the Regional Virus Laboratory were inspected and a list prepared of patients showing a rise 24fold in antibody level (by complement-fixation test)12 against one of the common respiratory agents, between the first and second specimens of paired sera. From this list 103 individuals were chosen (from November, 1976, to March, 1977) on the basis of having been diagnosed as having an acute upper and/or lower respiratory infection, the onset of which was 8 or fewer days before submission of the first blood specimen. Individuals with chronic viral infections and/or bacterial infections were eliminated from the study. The antigens in the test were as follows: influenza A (soluble), influenza B (soluble), parainfluenza, type I. parainfluenza, type II, parainfluenza, type III, adenovims, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, psittacosis group, and myoplasma pneumoniae. In every case, the clinical condition was sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization of the patient. Most patients manifested bronchitis, tonsillitis or pharyngitis. Their ages ranged from 6 mo to 60 yr. About half were under the age of 15 yr and the rest between the ages of 16 and 60 yr. Clinical histories were taken, particularly noting the patients' infections (recent and past) and atopic state. All patients were screened for allergies using a radioallergosorbent test Piscataway, N. J.). All samples were examined in duplicate. In our hands, a 20% variation was found for IgE levels over the range used in this study considering both kit-to-kit variation as well as variation with the same kit. All kits were standardized not only with the standards provided with the PRIST kit but also with several sera whose IgE levels were over the working range. Each pair of acute and convalescent sera were always run with the same kit. A change of 20% or more in IgE level was considered significant. The Phadabas RAST for IgE antibodies was determined for acute phase samples for all patients against the more common allergens found in the Ottawa area, such as tree (maple, birch, oak, elm), grass (sweet vernal, meadow fescue, rye grass, timothy), weed (short ragweed, western ragweed, wormwood, mugwort, Russian thistle), mold (A/rernaria, Asprrgillus, Cladosporiutn), animal (cat, dog), food (egg, milk, fish), and house dust allergens. An individual was considered positive to RAST if a 2+ reaction was found for one or more allergens. Fig. 1 . It was found that 59% of patients had a decrease in IgE level of 20% or more, 27% remained the same, and only 14% showed a rise of 20% or more for this immunoglobulin. Fig. 2 shows a scattergram summarizing the IgE levels of the nonatopic population as a function of time after onset of infection. For each patient, acute and convalescent IgE values were plotted. Fig. 3 shows a similar scattergram for the atopic patients. For the nonatopics (Fig. 2) , 2 populations of patients emerged, one segregating at IgE levels greater than 60 U/ml (nonatopic I) and the other, below this value (nonatopic II). Figs. 4 and 5 show the average IgE value for a given time after onset of infection for the nonatopic and atopic groups respectively. Decreases in IgE levels were observed for the high and low nonatopic groups as well as for the atopic group of patients. It can be seen (Figs. 4 and 5) that decreases in IgE occurred from the time of onset of symptoms up to 3 wk after symptoms, after which the IgE values leveled off. Table I shows the geometric mean values of IgE for nonatopic groups I and II as well as the atopic group during the acute and convalescent phases of infection. It can be seen that IgE levels decreased for all 3 groups but more dramatically for nonatopic I.
