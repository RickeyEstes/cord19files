Virus, experimental animals, and cells. The specific-pathogenfree (SPF) chicken embryos were purchased from Shangdong Institute of Poultry Science, Shandong, PR China. Chickens were hatched and housed in a SPF environment at the Laboratory Animal and Resources Facility, Sichuan University. The nephro-pathogenic IBV SAIBk strain was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs, and then harvested allantoic fluid 36 h post-inoculation. The 50% chicken infection dose (EID 50 ) was determined by inoculating serial 10-fold dilutions of virus into 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin at pH 7.2 and were kept at 37°C with 5% carbon dioxide. Multi-epitope genes selection. The nucleinic acid sequences of S1, S2 and N gene of the IBV SAIBk strain were obtained from GenBank (Accession No. DQ288927). The epitope sequences of the three genes were analyzed according to ExPasy network software (http://www.ExPasy.org) and reported references, and then seven T-and B-cell epitopes from S1, S2, and N protein (S1: 24-150,240-255,290-400,532-537; S2:1-65; N:1-120, 290-410) were selected (Table 1) . Design and construction of the multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine. The seven multi-epitope minigenes were paiallelled as a single chimeric gene separated from each other with the GA/GP spacers with an unique open reading frame by using Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOEing) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ( Table 1 ). The constructs included a Kozak sequence at the N-terminus and CpG motif in the middle of the chimeric gene to enhance immune response. The multi-epitope chimeric gene was then incorporated into expression vector pVAX1 (Invitrogen, USA) designated as pVAX-F, which was confirmed by endonuclease digestion assay and DNA sequencing. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Six-well tissue culture plates were seeded with COS-7 cells (10 6 /well). Monolayer of 80-90% confluent cells was transiently transfected with the plasmid pVAX-F and empty plasmid by using Lipofactamin Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS), fixed with 100% acetone for 10 min at À20°C and washed once again with PBS. Diluted primary and secondary antibodies were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, respectively. Primary antibodies used were antiserum of rabbit to IBV, and secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugatedgoat-anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Immunization of chickens with plasmid DNA vaccine. The plasmids pVAX-F and pVAX1 amplified in Escherichia coli DH5a were extracted using the alkaline lysis method, then purified by PEG8000 precipitation. For DNA immunizations, chickens at 7day-old were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15 each).The chickens were immunized intramuscularly with 150 lg of plasmid pVAX-F(group 1), and 150 lg of empty plasmid pVAX1 (group 2). Another group administered with 0.5 ml of IBV inactive vaccine (group 3), and chickens injected with 0.5 ml PBS as control (group 4). All groups were boosted with an equivalent dose at 14 days after the initial inoculation. For DNA immunizations, chickens at 7-day-old were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15 each). Detection of anti-IBV specific antibodies. Sera were collected after booster vaccination until challenge, and pre-vaccination sera were also collected. Total serum immunoglobulinG (IgG) specific for IBV was measured by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The test sera were diluted by 1:500 and then manipulated according to the instruction of IBV antibody detection ELISA kit (IDEXX, USA), and the optical density at 650 nm was measured in an ELISA microplate reader. Every test serum was run in triplicate in each assay, as well as including negative and positive control sera. Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Peripheral blood samples from immunized chickens were collected from the wing vein 7 days after the booster. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and adjusted to 1 Â 10 7 cells/ml. One-hundred microliters of cell suspensions (1 Â 10 6 cells) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with both mouse anti-chicken CD4-PE and mouse anti-chicken CD8-FITC (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) simultaneously. The samples were processed on fluorescence activated cell sorter. Protection against virulent challenge. All of the chickens were challenged with 100EID 50 of the IBV SAIBk strain in 0.1 ml by the nasal-ocular route at 35 days after the booster, and were examined daily for 2 weeks for the clinical symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, ataxia, dyspnea or death. Dead chicks were necropsied to confirm the death due to IBV infection. Chickens in each group were euthanized at 14 days post challenge, then necropsies were performed immediately and kidney tissues were collected for further detection of virus by RT-PCR.
