We removed linezolid from all wards, so it had to be obtained via pharmacy. We adapted a system of mandatory order forms 1 for UK use; these require prescribers to complete details of patient, infection, prescriber, previous agents and microbiology/ID approval. All sections must be completed before dispensing; forms can be faxed to prescribers and back to pharmacy, or filled by pharmacists via telephone. The system also applies at evenings and weekends. We compared linezolid usage before and after its introduction. Results: Usage decreased from an average of 3.6 patients per month in the first 15 months, to 2.8 in the next 11 months. Comparison of audit forms with pharmacy dispensing data shows that forms were completed for all 31 patients. We have complete audit data for each patient, including clinical specialties, sites of infection and organisms. There was evidence of microbiology/ID approval for 30 of the 31 patients. Conclusion: Introduction of mandatory order forms curtailed our growth in linezolid use, and provides a system for ongoing monitoring and feedback of usage patterns. We are now extending this system to other anti-infectives. Methods: The effects of TD-6424 and four comparator antibiotics (vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and moxifloxacin) were assessed for bactericidal activity against staphylococcal biofilms. The experiments were carried out using Sorbarod biofilms. Strains tested included methicillin-susceptible and resistant strains of Stahphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, as well as GISA strains. Bacteria were exposed to the antibiotics at exponentially decreasing concentrations, representing parenteral administration and also at a constant concentration, representing an IV infusion. Concentrations used correspond to peak serum levels and the rates at which drug concentrations were decreased correspond to their elimination half-lives. A 68 year old man with type II D.M. and myelodysplastic syndrome (M.D.S.), requiring regular blood transfusions and regular desferrioxime infusions, was admitted with a five-day history of a painful swollen left index finger-the site used for blood glucose monitoring. Pus from the finger was sent to microbiology. Over the course of 48 hours the patient deteriorated rapidly and died despite antimicrobial therapy. A postmortem was performed. Results: Postmortem findings showed evidence of fungal septicaemia. There were infarcts in the kidney, spleen and brain, severe pericarditis, necrotising areas in the myocardium and severe meningitis. Thrombi in the coronary arteries contained numerous fungi. The morphology of the fungi on histological staining suggested a zygomycete. The pus from the patient's finger yielded C. bertholletiae, but this result was only available post mortem. Conclusions: This case highlights the rapidity at which invasive zygomycosis can progress. Two cases of cutaneous zygomycosis acquired by inoculation due to C. bertholletiae have been reported previously, raising the possibility that the infection may have been introduced by home blood glucose monitoring in this case. Patients in whom such procedures are required, particularly those with other risk factors, may be at increased risk of infection. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) by Staphylococcus aureus is common and associated with increased mortality, due to compromisation from co-morbidities. Whilst elimination of nasal carriage of S. aureus is known to be a useful health protection measure in some patient groups, its status and role in diabetes mellitus is controversial and unknown in DFU patients. We therefore sampled the anterior nares and ulcers of 98 DFU outpatients to isolate S. aureus. Macrorestriction with Sma I was used to distinguish or match ulcer and nasal isolates from individual patients. As a control, 111 healthy individuals (medical students) at the same institution had nasal swabs taken for culture to determine a baseline carriage rate. Of the 98 DFU patients, 38 (38.7%) were nasal carriers of S. aureus. All but one patient had S. aureus isolated from their ulcers. This was significantly different from the controls, 28 (25.2%) of whom were carriers ðP , 0:05Þ: 78.9% of DFU isolates were penicillin-resistant, compared to only 12.3% of S. aureus in baseline controls. Macrorestriction determined that 35 (92.1%) of the 38 DFU patients with nasal carriage had the same strain of S. aureus in their ulcer ðP , 0:001Þ: The positive and negative predictive values of a nose swab as a simple measure to determine whether a DFU is likely to be infected or not, were 85.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is therefore linked to infection of DFU and protocols for its eradication are required to protect these patients against infection. Out of the 20 who were PCR positive, 14 had CMV disease and 6 had infection (of which 4 received pre-emptive treatment). 24 of the 34 patients under PCR surveillance received aciclovir prophylaxis however 10 of these patients developed CMV disease. The mean interval between transplant and CMV PCR positivity was 77 days in the aciclovir group and 44.6 days in the patients who did not receive prophylaxis. The cost of managing patients with CMV according to current protocol was £46,884 as compared to £51,015 if all the high-risk patients were to receive ganciclovir prophylaxis with the caveat that 15% of these patients will still end up with CMV disease. Conclusions: No significant difference was noted between the cost of managing high-risk patients as per the current protocol and if all these patients were to receive ganciclovir prophylaxis instead. Prophylactic aciclovir does not prevent CMV disease/infection but may delay it. lncidence of CMV infection/disease and rate of adverse outcome was higher than expected in the study group. Objectives: To evaluate our protocol of CMV surveillance and pre-emptive treatment with oral ganciclovir in CMV mismatched liver transplants. Protocol compliance was in doubt and there was no consensus on whether pre-emptive therapy or universal prophylaxis is the optimal approach against CMV infection. Methods: Retrospective database analysis and casenote review of liver transplants (January 2000-December 2002) was performed. Management of CMV-mismatched patients (D þ R 2 ) was assessed against the agreed protocol. This comprised regular CMV-QPCR monitoring for three months, twice-weekly for inpatients then weekly following discharge. 14 days pre-emptive oral ganciclovir was to be given in the event of a single high viral load (VL) (10 5 copies/ml) or a VL increasing by 0.5 log in sequential samples. Therapeutic intravenous ganciclovir was indicated if there was evidence of CMV disease. Results: 100 liver transplants were performed. Of 15 CMV mismatches, 14 survived and were evaluated. In 3/14 (21.4%), CMV-QPCR remained negative.11/14 (78.5%) developed positive titres (10 4 -10 6 copies/ml). 3 out of the 11(27.2%) with positive titre had evidence of CMV disease at time of first positive VL and were successfully treated with intravenous ganciclovir. 8/11(72.7%) had no evidence of CMV disease initially; 3/8 received neither pre-emptive nor therapeutic ganciclovir, 4/8 were given intravenous then oral ganciclovir and all 7 remained well. 1/8 developed serious CMV disease after delayed preemptive treatment and required intravenous ganciclovir. Conclusion: Of 14 evaluable CMV mismatches, agreed protocol was strictly followed in only 6/14 (42.8%)cases. In the remaining 8 (57.1%), 50% were given unnecessary oral or IV ganciclovir. Compliance with the protocol was poor. After discharge, followup in out-patients or in distant referring centres lead to delays in CMV surveillance. Lack of confidence in the protocol may have resulted in some unnecessary use of intravenous ganciclovir. Following review, we have now introduced prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir (90 days) for all CMV-mismatched liver transplants. A standard pro-forma was used to collect patient data including age, sex, primary diagnosis, type of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, respiratory symptoms, specimens collected, laboratory diagnosis, antimicrobial agents used (antiviral, antibacterial etc) and outcome of these infections. The 2 £ 2 chi square test was used for statistical calculations.
