Method. An equimolar mixture of 1H-indole-2,3-dione (1) (1 mmole), malononitrile/ethylcynoacetate (2) (1 mmole), and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3dioxane-4,6-diones (3) (1 mmole) taken in absolute ethanol (15 mL) in presence of ZnO nanoparticle (30 mg) was refluxed for 10-11 hrs Progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and solidified within an hour. The resulting solidified mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (5 mL) and the catalyst was separated. The filtrate was evaporated on rota-evaporator to give a solid, which was dried and recrystallized from ethyl acetate. All the synthesized compounds were identified by their melting point, IR, 1 HNMR, 13 CNMR, and mass spectral studies. The spectroscopic characterization data of (4a-f/5a-f) are given below.
