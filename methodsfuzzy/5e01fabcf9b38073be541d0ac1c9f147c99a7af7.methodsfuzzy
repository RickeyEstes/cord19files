Bellucci et al. [35] used a variety of physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrogen-bonding propensities, secondary structure propensities) of proteins and RNAs to predict the interaction propensities for individual residues in the RNA and protein sequences of a potentially interacting pair. Because the catRAPID server [http://tartaglialab.crg. cat] does not directly report predictions as to whether or not a specific RNA-protein pair is expected to interact (the "partner prediction problem"), we were not able to directly compare our results with their method [35] . Pancaldi and Bähler et al. [36] also employed RF and SVM classifiers, but their method uses more than 100 different features of mRNA and proteins, extracted from the literature or computed from the protein and RNA sequences to make predictions. Examples of such features include mRNA half-life, predicted protein secondary structure, Gene Ontology annotation, relative abundance of each amino acid, codon bias. Using a dataset of 5,166 positive mRNA-protein RPI partners derived from Hogan et al. [10] , and 5,166 randomly generated negative examples of mRNA-protein pairs, Pancaldi and Bähler reported an average accuracy of 70% in 2-fold cross-validation tests using an RF classifier based on 500 trees, and 68% using an SVM classifier using an RBF kernel with optimized parameters [36] . They also reported that 5fold and leave-one-out experiments gave comparable results. We performed 10-fold cross-validation experiments on the same dataset using RPISeq-RF, which uses only sequence information. Our RF classifier achieved an accuracy of 68%, based on 500 trees, results comparable Figure 1 Performance of RPISeq classifiers in predicting RPIs.

The area under the curve (AUC) of each ROC is shown next to the curve. The AUC for a perfect classifier is 1, and for a random classifier = 0.5. to the 70% reported for the RF classifier of Pancaldi and Bähler [36] . Our SVM classifier, using a normalized polykernel, gave less accurate predictions (61%) than the SVM of Pancaldi and Bähler (68%) [36] . In the Pancaldi and Bähler study, only 5,166 out of a total of 13,243 positive mRNA-protein pairs were actually used for prediction, because some of the features required by the classifiers were not available for the remaining 8,000 pairs [36] . When we tested our method using all 13,243 pairs for cross-validation, the prediction accuracies increased to 78% for the RF and 65% for SVM classifier. Taken together, our experiments indicate that the sequence-based method proposed here and the multiple feature-based method of Pancaldi and Bähler have comparable performance in predicting mRNA-protein interactions. Further, our results suggest that sequences of mRNAs and proteins carry sufficient information to allow reasonable predictions regarding whether or not a given mRNA and protein interact. Because feature information required by the method of Pancaldi and Bähler may not be available in many cases, our proposed method complements theirs, and may be more generally applicable for predicting ncRNA-protein partners, in addition to mRNA-protein partners. The method of Pancaldi and Bähler [36] , which was developed to predict mRNA-protein interactions (rather than ncRNA-protein interactions), also uses RF and SVM classifiers, but requires a much more extensive set of features regarding the mRNAs and proteins. Input for the classifiers, which consists of a vector constructed by concatenating the features of potential RNA and protein partners (e.g., isoelectric point of protein, protein localization, mRNA half-life), cannot be extracted or calculated from sequence information alone. This requirement restricts the applicability of this method in practice: Pancaldi and Bähler were not able to extract the necessary features for a majority of interactions in their RPI dataset. The RPISeq methods do not suffer from this limitation because they require only sequence-derived features to make reliable predictions. In fact, the performance of RPISeq improved substantially (by 8% in accuracy) when evaluated on the entire dataset of Pancaldi and Bähler. Thus, for predicting mRNA-protein interactions, the sequence-based approach implemented in RPISeq provides performance comparable to that of classifiers that require a more extensive set of features, including those that cannot be extracted from RNA and protein sequences alone.
