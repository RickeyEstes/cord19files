Plasmid Construction. Using a TMV full-length cDNA clone as template, primers 24AUPD-F and 24AUPD-R were designed to introduce a 24 nt internal poly(A) tract upstream of its UPD. High fidelity enzyme (KAPA Biosystems) was used for over-lapping PCR. DpnI was added into the PCR products and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to remove the original DNA template. The treated PCR products (5 μ l) were transformed into competent E. coli cells by heat-shock treatment. Colonies were screened by sequencing the transformed plasmids on an Ampicillin-LB medium to confirm the introduced internal poly(A) length. The same approach was used to construct TMV(42A+ UPD) and TMV(62A+ UPD). The sequences of primers were listed in Table 1 . In vitro transcription. Full-length cDNA clone of TMV and the mutants were linearized with KpnI. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the purified DNAs were used as templates for in vitro transcription by the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Life Technologies, Ambion). RNA transcripts were precipitated by LiCl, following the manual instructions and dissolved in RNase-free water. Plant inoculation and qRT-PCR. Fully expanded leaves of 4-week-old N. benthamiana were mechanically inoculated with 2 μ g in vitro transcribed viral RNA in GKP buffer (50 mM glycine; 30 mM K 2 HPO 4 , pH 9.2; 1% bentonite; 1% celite). Total RNAs were extracted from the inoculated and upper leaves by TRIzol reagent. qRT-PCR was performed using the KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR kit on a CFX384 Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The N. benthamiana actin gene was used as an internal control. Error bars (SD) were obtained from nine replicates that included three biological replicates and each biological replicate contains three technical replicates. Primer-R and Primer-R-negative-strand were used for positive-and negative-strands reverse transcription, respectively. Primers qPCR-F and qPCR-R were used for target fragment amplification and primer Actin-F and Actin-R were used to amplify the actin gene. The sequences of primers were listed in Table 1 .
