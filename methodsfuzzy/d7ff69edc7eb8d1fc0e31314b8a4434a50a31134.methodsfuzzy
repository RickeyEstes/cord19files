Because bobby calf mortality is a rare event, a case-control design was selected as the most appropriate way to explore risk factors for mortality associated with the farm, transport and processing stages of the supply chain. Cases were defined as calves that died or were condemned before the point of slaughter and controls were acceptable calves that were slaughtered as per standard procedure. Case and control calves were selected by Ministry for Primary Industries Verification Services (MPI VS) veterinarians at meat processing premises around New Zealand. Their management from the farm to the point of arrival at the processor was traced back using questionnaires completed by interviewing the supplier of the calf (farmer/farm manager) and transporter of the calf as soon after the event as possible and by recording features of management at the processing premises. At the time of the interview, neither the researchers nor the farmers/transporters knew whether the calf was a case or a control. Calf selection and retrospective data collection occurred over an 18week period in six regions of New Zealand between June and October 2016. In each region, data were collected over three non-consecutive weeks at the start, peak and end of the season (Table 1) .
