It is already proved in Theorem 1 that Z-control method drives the system to the desired state for any positive initial condition. However, this control method sometimes fails to capture the biological feasibility though the desired state is achieved analytically [32, 36] . Depending on the initial conditions one or more state variables of the controlled system may traverse through negative values while approaching to the desired state, which is unrealistic from biological point of view. In Fig. 3 it is shown that all the state variables remain positive while approaching to the controlled equilibrium (S c , I c , N c ) = (1000, 0, 1500) for the initial condition (900, 40, 1000). On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows that for a different initial condition (400, 90, 1200), the susceptible population becomes negative in the transient period while approaching to the desired equilibrium (S c , I c , N c ) = (1000, 0, 1500). We further demonstrate the role of the design parameter λ in determining the range of initial conditions for which the Z-controlled system approaches the desired equilibrium maintaining the biological feasibility. In Fig. 5 , the basins of attraction for the controlled equilibrium (S c , I c , N c ) = (1000, 0, 1500) are plotted in S − I plane for increasing values of the design parameter λ. From Fig. 5 , it is observed that the basin of attraction for analytically as well as biologically successful Z-control approach (i.e. the blue region) expands when the design parameter λ is increased (i.e for λ = 0.0003; 0.0004; 0.0006) up to a threshold value λ * . If the value of λ exceeds the threshold value then the basin of attraction for successful Z-control approach gradually squeezes (i.e for λ = 0.00125; 0.0013). Finally the basin of attraction completely disappears when the value of λ is increased further (i.e for λ = 0.0015). Therefore, to make the Z-control successful for a broader range of initial conditions, an intermediate value of the design parameter λ should be chosen. Similar kind of observation has also been reported by Lacitignola et al. [36] in the context of epidemic model.
