Cells, plasmid constructs, and antibodies H1299 and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and Huh7 cells from R. Bartenschlager, University of Heidelberg, Germany. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (PAA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA) and 0.5% amphotericin (PAA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37uC. HEV ORF2 was amplified with the forward primer (fwd) 59-CCATGGGCATGCGCCCTCGGCCTATTTTG-39, reverse primer (rev) 59-CTCGAGTAACTCCCGAGTTTTACCCAC-39 and the HEV clone pSK-HEV-2 (GenBank: AF444002.1), a kind gift of S. Emerson and R. Purcell (NIH, Maryland) [60] as a template. After amplification with PFU turbo polymerase (Stratagene), the amplimer was inserted into pcDNA TM 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The pGL3CHOP-luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human CHOP promoter, the ERSE deletion constructs (2221 to 240) and ATF4 (2318 to 2286) were obtained from P. Fafournoux, INRA, France [61] . The CHOP enhancer elements with luciferase reporter AARE1 (bases 2310 to 2302), AARE2 (bases 2778 to 2770), ERSE (bases 2103 to 276), AP1 (bases 2244 to 2238) were kindly provided by S.C.M. Kwok, Albert Einstein Medical Center, USA [32] . The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-Hsp72 (Stressgen Biotechnologies), rabbit anti-His probe, rabbit anti-Bax N-20 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-eIF2a, rabbit antiphospho-eIF2a/Ser51, rabbit anti-COX IV (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-TBP (Abcam), and mouse anti-b-Actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were: peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG, (GE Healthcare), anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 633 (Molecular Probes). Cloning of the Chikungunya virus capsid protein into the pcDNA3.1 was performed using the construct described previously [62] .
