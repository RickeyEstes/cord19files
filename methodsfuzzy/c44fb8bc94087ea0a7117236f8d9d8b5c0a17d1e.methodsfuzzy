In our comparative study, we have used six methods based on 2dimensional (2D) analysis and one 3-dimensional (3D) system (see Ref. [10] for details). The 2D methods are primarily based on the Cartesian coordinate system. In the Nandy plot [11, 12] , the four nucleic acid bases are assigned to the four axes of a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. A given sequence is plotted based on the distribution of its bases in the corresponding direction; in computations for this note adenine (A) was assigned to the negative x-axis, cytosine (C) to the positive y-axis, guanine (G) to the positive x-axis and thymine (T) to the negative yaxis. The weighted average of the x-and y-coordinates of each point of a sequence of length N represents the centre of mass. The Euclidean distance between the origin and the centre of mass provides a quantitative graph descriptor, termed as the graph radius (g R ). A variant of this method can be seen in the Yau plot [13] in which two quadrants are used with the first quadrant addressing thymine (T) and cytosine (C), and the second quadrant denoting guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, the authors of this method did not prescribe a sequence descriptor. As a result, for the purpose of this commentary, Nandy's graph radius method is used to define the sequence descriptor of the Yau plot for comparative analysis. The 2D Randic plot [14] and Song-Tang plot [15] , employ parallel horizontal lines to denote nucleic acid bases. The key difference The coordinates, the centre of mass of all the points, and the graph radius g R of the sequence as per Nandy rectangular plot. To fix our ideas of what these various approaches to graphical representations of nucleotide sequences represent and how the sequence descriptors characteristic to each method are computed, we consider a 10-base oligonucleotide, ATGAAGGCAA, for a simple application of each method. This short sequence constitutes the first ten bases in the hemagglutinin gene of the influenza virus, A/Novosibirsk/02/ 2009(H1N1), and therefore can be taken as representative of a real-life situation. 2.1.1.1. Nandy 2D rectangular plot. In the Nandy plot [11] , the graph of our 10-base sequence drawn according to the given prescription is as shown in Fig. 2 .1. Table 2 .1 represents the coordinates, the centre of mass of all the points, and the graph radius g R , the sequence descriptor, of the sequence as described in Section 2.1 [12] .
