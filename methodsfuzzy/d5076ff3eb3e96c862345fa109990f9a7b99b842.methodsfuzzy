China (NCET-10-0144). Construction of plasmids containing genes encoding TGEV-S1, PEDV-S1 and PEDV-S The plasmid pcDNA3.1-TGEV-S containing the full-length S gene of TGEV strain Purdue was constructed in our laboratory by common cloning techniques and used as a template for PCR amplification. A sense primer P1 (5' GGGGGCTAGCCCAT-GAAAAAACTATTTG 3') and an antisense primer P2 (5' CCCCGAATTCTTAGTTTGTCTAATAA 3') which contain NheI (P1) and EcoRI (P2) restriction enzyme sites (underlined), were used for PCR. The plasmid Easy-T-S containing the full-length S gene of PEDV strain CV777 was constructed in our laboratory by common cloning techniques and used as a template for PCR amplification. A sense primer P3 (5' GGGGGTCGACATG-GATGTCACTAGGTGCC 3'), two antisense primers P4 (5'CCCCGCGGCCGCTCAAATACTCATACTAAA 3') and P5 (5' CCCCGCGGCCGCTCATCTCTGCACGTGGAC 3') which contain SalI (P3) and NotI (P4 and P5) restriction enzyme sites (underlined), were used for PCR. The amplification profile for the TGEV S1 gene (primers P1/ P2) was as follows: 95uC for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94uC for 1 min, 54.4uC for 1 min, and 72uC for 3 min. A final extension of 72uC for 10 min was performed at the end of the cycling period. The amplification profile for PEDV-S1 gene (primers P3/P4) and PEDV-S gene (primers P3/P5) were the same as for the TGEV-S1 gene except that the annealing temperature was raised to 56.8uC and 56.4uC, respectively. All PCR products were purified prior to cloning into the eukaryotic expression vector pIRES (TaKaRa, Japan). Briefly, TGEV-S1 was digested with NheI and EcoRI and then inserted into the multiple clone site (MCS) A of the pIRES vector, resulting in a recombinant plasmid pIRES-TGEV-S1; PEDV-S1 and PEDV-S were digested with SalI and NotI and then inserted into MCS B of pIRES-TGEV-S1, respectively. The resulting recombinant plasmids were designated as pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S), respectively. The cloning steps are shown in Figure 1 . After transformation, clones were picked and validated by DNA sequencing. TGEV S1 and PEDV S1 proteins were expressed in E.coli, respectively for lymphocyte stimulation assays. In brief, two recombinant plasmids pGEX-S1 comprising the 59-end half of the TGEV S gene [26] and pET30a-S1 comprising 59-end of PEDV S gene (97 bp-1776 bp) were constructed and transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Germany). Expression and purification of TGEV S1 protein were detailed in a recent reference [26] and PEDV S1 protein was also obtained according to a similar protocol. The expressed fused proteins were named TGEV-S1and PEDV-S1, respectively,
