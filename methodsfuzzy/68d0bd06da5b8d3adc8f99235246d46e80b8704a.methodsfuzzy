Differences in frequencies were evaluated using leastsquares test statistics and the relationship between disease status and test results by a logistic regression model evaluated with the chi-square test using the statistical software package S-Plus 6.1 for Windows (Profession Release 1; Insightful). Data from the acute phase protein measurements were analyzed using a two-sided t-test. The similarity of the different populations was tested using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test as some of the sample sets proved to be not normally distributed.
