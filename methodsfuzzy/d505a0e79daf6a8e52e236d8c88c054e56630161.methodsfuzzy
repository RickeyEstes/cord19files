The American Type Collection strain of MHV3 was grown and titrated as previously described on cells of the DBT line originating from a murine brain tumour [18, 19] . In order to obtain purified radioactively labelled virus, MHV3 was grown either in the presence of 1 ~Ci/ml laC-L-amino acids (40 mCi/mAt of carbon; CEA, France), or in the presence of 5 ~Ci/ml glucosamine 3H-l-hydrochloride (15 Ci/mmole; CEA, France) and 5 ~Ci/ml 3H-6-fucose (15 Ci/mmole; CEA, France). Fourteen hours after infection, the tissue culture fluid was removed and clarified by low speed centrifugation. Virus in the supernatant was precipitated by incubation with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) at a concentration of 8 % For sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the purified virus was dissolved in Tris-HC1 0.05 M pH 6.8, SDS 2 ~o, ~-mercaptoethanol 2 %, glycerol 15 % and bromophenol blue 0.001 ~o. The samples were submitted to electrophoresis on slab gels (5 ~o acrylamide stacking, 10 ~o acrylamide resolving gels) according to the techniques described by Laemmli [7] and by Studier [14] . After eleetrophoresis, the labelled protein bands were visualized by the fluorographie method of Bonner and Laskey [2] . Escherichia coli RNApolymerase subunits ~ (165,000 daltons) and ~' (155,000), phosphorylase b (94,000), bovine serum albumin (45,000), chymotrypsinogen (25,700), trypsin inhibitor from soybean (21,500) and cytochrome c (11,700), were used as standards for the molecular weight (MW) estimation of the viral polypeptides. For electron microscopical observations, the viral particles were negatively stained by 2 ~o sodium-phosphotungstate at pH 7 and examined in a ~( Philips ~ EM300 electron microscope.
