Generation of the GFP-tagged, full-length cDNA clone of GLRaV-2 The GLRaV-2 isolate obtained from a local Oregonian vineyard was propagated on N. benthamiana plants as described earlier (Goszczynski et al., 1996) . Virions were isolated (Napuli et al., 2000) and the viral RNA was obtained using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A strategy for nucleotide sequencing of the viral genome and the generation of the intermediate and fulllength viral cDNA clones was as described for BYV . The resulting sequence of GLRaV-2 RNA was deposited to Genbank (accession no. XXXX). The sequences of the numerous primers used in cloning procedures are available upon request. In brief, a full-length cDNA clone of GLRaV-2 was assembled using pCB301 mini-binary vector (Xiang et al., 1999) , while the cDNA cloning was done using reverse transcription and either conventional synthesis of a double-stranded (ds) cDNA or PCR amplification. The NOS terminator was added to the pCB301 by using unique sites Sac I and Kpn I and a polylinker containing restriction sites Sac I, Bam HI, AatI I, Bbvc I, Rsr II, Bst EII, and Sma I was inserted between Sac I site and NOS terminator to produce pCB301-NOS-PL. To add a CaMV 35S RNA polymerase promoter fused to the 5′-fragment of the viral cDNA (nts 1-2034), a PCR-mediated DNA splicing technique was used. Separate PCRs were done to amplify the 35S promoter and the 5′end of GLRaV2 cDNA and to generate products with overlapping ends. These products were combined and used as templates for another round of PCR using primers complementary to the 5′-and 3′-ends of the full-length product. The latter product was cloned into pCB301-NOS-PL using Sac I (added to the 5′-end of 35S promoter) and BamH I (nt 2034) to produce p35S5′LR. To add a ribozyme to the 3′-end of the viral cDNA, a megaprimer with a virus-specific part complementary to the 3′-end of the viral cDNA followed by a ribozyme sequence designed as described (Prokhnevsky et al., 2002) and a Sma I site was used in combination with a regular primer to amplify the 3′-terminal region of the GLRaV-2 cDNA (nts 14,842-16,486) . Resulting PCR product was cloned into p35S5′LR using restriction sites BstE II (nt 14,842) and Sma I (added at the 3′-terminus of the megaprimer) to produce a p35S5′3′LR-Rib. For cloning the internal region of viral cDNA (nts 2029-10,827), three partially overlapping fragments of ds cDNA were obtained using conventional cDNA cloning and Gibco-BRL protocol for SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. These fragments were inserted into p35S5′3′LR-Rib using restriction sites Bam HI (nt 2029), Aat II (nt 3394), Bbv CI (nt 6281), and Rsr II (nt 10,821) to generate p35S-5′BR3′LR-Rib. The remaining part of the viral cDNA (nts 10,821-14,848) was PCRamplified and cloned into an intermediate vector pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega). A nucleotide sequence encoding an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted GFP (Haseloff et al., 1997) followed by a BYV CP promoter was inserted upstream from the 5′-end of GLRaV-2 CP ORF. The resulting cDNA fragment was cloned into p35S5′-BR-3′LR-Rib using Rsr II (nt 10,821) and Bst EII (nt 14,842) sites to generate the fulllength GLRaV-2 cDNA clone p35S-LR-GFP or LR-GFP for the brevity.
