Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination ThnT was expressed, purified, and concentrated to 7.7 μg/μL as previously described for the inactive T282C variant. 13 The enzyme was incubated at 20°C for 6 h prior to being flash frozen for storage at − 80°C. The ThnTinactivator complex was prepared by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the inactivator and incubating it at 20°C for 1 h immediately prior to use in crystallization attempts. Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion against a 1-mL reservoir solution of 14-18 % polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.5-0.7 M sodium acetate. Crystals grew overnight and were cryoprotected by immersion into 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.7 M sodium acetate, and 20% glycerol prior to flash freezing in N 2 . Crystallization and data collection for ThnT were carried out at X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data for the ThnT-inhibitor complex were collected on BL12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the Phaser program, 42 as implemented in the CCP4 package. 43 The structure of the uncleaved T282C variant of ThnT [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3S3U], with dual occupancies removed, was used as the search model. Iterative rounds of model building were performed in Coot, 44 using REFMAC5 for refinement. 45 After the protein and solvent atoms were defined, TLS operators were added and further refined in REFMAC5, which yielded significant improvements in R free for both models. 45, 46 Crystallographic and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1 . Coordinates were deposited to the PDB with accession numbers 3TM1 (wt-ThnT) and 3TM2 (inactivated complex).
