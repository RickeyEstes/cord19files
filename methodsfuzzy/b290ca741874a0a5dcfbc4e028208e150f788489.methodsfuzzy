The advantage of the wavelet method is that it performs a multiresolution analysisthat is, it allows us to analyze the data at different scales (each one associated with a particular frequency passband) at the same time (Sun et al., 2015) . In this way, the method enables us to identify a single event truncated in one frequency range as well as coherent structures across different scales (Sun et al., 2015) . Recent examples for a financial application of wavelet methods can be found in Chen et al. (2015) , Meinl and Sun (2012) , Sun and Meinl (2012) , and Sun, Rezania, Rachev, and Fabozzi (2011) . In general, there are two classes of wavelet transforms: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Studies undertaken during the past decade have found that CWT is widely used in the economics and finance literature (Aguiar-Conraria & Soares 2014). Following Aguiar-Conraria et al. (2008) and Aguiar-Conraria and Soares (2014), we consider a time series R x t L ( ) ∈ ( ) 2 , whereby its CWT with the mother wavelet ψ t ( ) is defined as Here, asterisk (*) denotes complex conjugation, R ψ t s ψ t τ s s τ ( ) = (( − )/ ), , ∈ τ s , −1/2 , and s ≠ 0 is derived from the mother wavelet ψ t ( ). In the definition, parameters s and τ denote the frequency and time indices, respectively. Moreover, because both s and τ are real values that vary continuously, W τ s ( , ) x ψ ; is then named as the continuous wavelet transform. The wavelet function is normalized to have unitary variance (∫ ψ t dt ( ) = 1 2 ), and it verifies ∫ ψ t dt ( ) = 0 (Daubechies 1992) . Therefore, the original function x t ( ) from its CWT as follows: is the "admissibility constant", with f and ψ f ( ) respectively denoting the Fourier frequency and Fourier transform of the mother wavelet. Aguiar-Conraria et al. (2008) argue that both x t ( ) and its wavelet transform are representations of the same mathematical entity. It is important to observe that the energy of x t ( ) is preserved by the wavelet transform, in the sense that and that a Parseval type identity also holds 3 (4) where W τ s W τ s W τ s ( , ) * ( , ) = ( , ) x ψ y ψ xy ψ ; ; , denotes the cross-wavelet transformation of two time series x t ( ) and y t ( ). There are several types of wavelet functions available with different characteristics. One of the most popular wavelets used is the Mortlet wavelet, the simplified version, which is defined as ψ t π e e ( ) = , where π −1/4 ensures unit energy of the mother wavelet. 4 The wavelet power spectrum describes the evolution of the variance of a time series at different frequencies, with periods of large variances associated with periods of large power at different scales (Aguiar-Conraria et al., 2010) . In the wavelet theory, the (local) wavelet power spectrum of a time series x(t), the analogous approach of the Fourier spectrum, is defined as WPS τ s W τ s ( , ) = ( , ) x ψ x ψ ; ; 2 . It can be interpreted as a measure of the local variance for x(t) at each frequency. Aguiar-Conraria and Soares (2014) note that when the wavelet power spectrum is taken over all times, they then can call the global wavelet power spectrum as This present study looks to explore the co-movement of returns among international health care sector indices. We focus on the health care sector returns of Germany, the UK, and the US and therefore first set out to use the Mortlet wavelet transform for the time series (returns of health care sector) in the time-frequency space. The Mortlet wavelet is selected, because it is the most popular of the complex-valued wavelets that can achieve an excellent compromise between time and frequency accuracies. In general, the Mortlet wavelet has some good mathematical properties as follows. First, for numerical purposes it can be treated as an analytic wavelet. Second, the peak frequency, the energy frequency, and the central instantaneous frequency of the Mortlet wavelet are all equal. Third, the Mortlet wavelet has optimal joint time-frequency concentration in the sense that the Heisenberg box area reaches its lower bound with this wavelet. Finally, the time radius and the frequency radius are equal (Aguiar-Conraria & Soares, 2014) . From the plots of the wavelet power spectrum, we are able to tell whether a structural break exists in the returns of the health care sector. The primary aim of this study is to analyze the dynamic relationship among the international health care sector returns. Following Aguiar-Conraria and Soares (2014), we define the absolute value of the complex wavelet coherency, the so-called wavelet coherency, as  where I and R are the imaginary and real parts of the smoothed cross-wavelet transform, respectively. This paper further studies the dynamic relationship among the international health care sector returns after controlling for the industrial production index. The wavelet partial coherency is a technique similar to partial correlation, which helps identify the resulting wavelet coherency between two time series x t ( ) and y t ( ) after eliminating the influence of the controlling variable z t ( ) (Ng & Chan, 2012) . Following Ng and Chan (2012) and Aguiar-Conraria and Soares (2014), we define the complex partial wavelet coherency as . Moreover, Q xz and Q yz are defined in a similar manner to Q xy , while R xz and R yz are calculated in a similar manner to Eq. (7). Following Aguiar-Conraria and Soares (2014), we define the absolute value of the complex partial wavelet coherency, the socalled partial wavelet coherency, as R Q = xy z xy z , , , while we define the partial phase delay (phase-difference) of x t ( ) over y t ( ) after controlling for z t ( ):  The value of the phase-difference between two time series ranges from π − to π . The two series are positively correlated (in-phase) when the phase-difference (ϕ xy ) is in the interval [−π/2, π/2]. When the phase-difference is within [−π, −π/2] or [π/2, π], the two variables exhibit an anti-phase relationship (i.e., they are negatively correlated). On the other hand, when the phase-difference is within π [− /2, 0] or π π [ /2, ], y leads x. When the phase-difference is within π π [− , − /2] or π [0, /2], the variable x is leading y (Caraiani 2012) . The interpretation of the anti-phase (in-phase) relationship of the partial phase-difference (ϕ xy z , ) is the same as that for the phase-difference (ϕ xy ).
