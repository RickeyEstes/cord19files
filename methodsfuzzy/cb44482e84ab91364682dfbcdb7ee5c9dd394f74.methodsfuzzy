Cell culture and virus strains. Vero (ATCC CCL 81), COS-7 (ATCC CLR 1650) (epithelial and fibroblast kidney cells from African green monkeys, respectively), and HeLa (ATCC CCL-2; epithelial cells of the human cervix) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HeLa GFP stable cell lines were obtained, as detailed below, from the HeLa cell line. All three cell types were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (63) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in a controlled 7% CO 2 atmosphere saturated with water vapor. The growth medium was supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM nonessential amino acids, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin for Vero and COS-7 cells and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin plus 10 2 U streptavidin for HeLa cells. Induction of protein expression in stable HeLa cell lines was performed by addition of 1/4,000 Tet (5 mg/ml) for 16 to 20 h. Infections were carried out with the Vero-adapted isolate of ASFV strain Ba71 (Ba71V) and titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells, as described previously (64) . HeLa and Vero cell infections were performed in DMEM with 2% FBS, while COS-7 cells were infected in DMEM with 5% FBS. Depending on the requirements of the experiment, an MOI from 1 to 5 was used. Plasmid construction, mutagenesis, and generation of stable HeLa cell lines. For generation of the ASFV-DP-HA vector, we cloned the D250R gene (strain Ba71V), together with the 250-bp upstream fragment, into a pcDNA vector containing an HA tag (a kind gift from Ricardo Madrid, Bioassays, Parque Científico de Madrid, Madrid, Spain). The D250R gene was amplified using PCR primers KpnI_promD250R_FW and BamHI_noSTOP_D250R_RV (Table 3) to construct a D250R gene with an N-terminal HA fusion, with expression of the protein under the control of the viral promoter. GST-ASFV-DP was produced for use in generation of specific anti-ASFV-DP serum and pulldown assays by cloning the g5R gene (the Malawi Lil 20/1 virus strain) from pCDNAg5R (a kind gift from L. Dixon, The Pirbright Institute, Pirbright, United Kingdom) into pGEX-2T using PCR primers BamHI_g5Rwt_FW and EcoRI_g5Rwt_RV (Table 3 ). The resultant pGEX-ASFV-DP was transformed in Escherichia coli (BL21) to produce GST-ASFV-DP proteins under the conditions described below. For study of the catalytic activity of ASFV-DP, we performed substitutions affecting two conserved amino acids within the Nudix motif. In the REGG mutant, arginine 146 and glutamate 147 were replaced by glycine (R146G/E147G), whereas in the EEQQ mutant, glutamates 150 and 151 were replaced by two glutamines (E150Q/E151Q). To generate these mutants, the D250R gene was first cloned into the pCFP-C2 vector to generate pCFP-ASFV-DP wt. Cloned fragments were amplified by PCR from a lysate of cells infected by ASFV Ba71V using primers EcoRI_D250R_FW and BamHI_D250R_RV ( Table 3) . Construction of pCFP ASFV-DP REGG and pCFP ASFV-DP EEQQ was carried out by PCR, using the pCFP-ASFV-DP wt vector as a template and primers D250R_mutREGG_FW and D250R_mutREGG_RV and D250R_mutEEQQ_FW and D250R_mutEEQQ_ RV, respectively (Table 3) . Inducible HeLa Flp-in TREx cell lines were established for the expression of GFP-tagged ASFV-DP wt and REGG/EEQQ mutants. pEGFP-C2, pCFP-ASFV-DP wt, and the pCFP-ASFV-DP REGG/EEQQ constructions were used as DNA templates to clone into the pCDNA5/FRT/TO vector using primers KpnI_GFP_FW, nexo_GFPpD250R_FW, nexo_GFPpD250R_RV, and BamHI_pD250R_RV (Table 3) . pCDNA5/FRT/TO vectors containing ASFV-DP wt and mutants were transfected into HeLa Flp-in TREx cell lines, generated as described previously (42, 43) . Positive cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which was done in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. Three additional HeLa Flp-in TREx cell lines were produced: HeLa GFP-ASFV-DP N-term (GFP fused to the D250R N terminus), HeLa GFP-ASFV-DP C-term (GFP fused to the D250R C terminus), and HeLa GFP-ASFV-DP ΔNudix (Nudix deletion). We stablished the regions by taking the Nudix motif as a reference: the N-terminal region contains the sequence of ASFV-DP upstream of the Nudix conserved motif, while the C-terminal region of the protein covers the sequence downstream from the Nudix sequence. Finally, GFP-ASFV-DP ΔNudix possesses both N-terminal and C-terminal regions but lacks the ASFV-DP Nudix motif. GFP-ASFV-DP N-term was produced by fusion PCR using primers KpnI_GFP_FW, nexo GFP_pD250R_FW, nexo_GFPpD250R_RV, and BamHI_pD250R_N-term_RV (Table 3 ) and using pEGFP-C2 and pCFP-pD250R wt as DNA templates. HeLa GFP-ASFV-DP C-term was obtained by fusion PCR using KpnI GFP FW, nexo_GFP_pD250R_Cterm_FW, A238L FW  GCAGATCCGACTCAAAAAGACT  A238L RV  ACTCCATATTTCCTGTAAAGACTGC  A224L FW  AAGCACCCTTTACAGGTGCATGGC  A224L RV  TCCTATAATGCCCAAGGTTGCACGG  B646L FW  CCCGAGAACTCTCACAATATCC  B646L RV  CGTTGCGTCCGTAATAGGAG  nexo_GFP_pD250R_Cterm_RV, and BamHI_pD250R_RV primers (Table 3) , using pEGFP-C2 and pCFP-ASFV-DP wt as DNA templates. HeLa GFP-ASFV-DP ΔNudix was obtained by two fusion PCRs, using the primers KpnI_GFP_FW, nexo_GFP_pD250R_FW and RV, pD250RNtermCterm_FW and pD250RNtermCterm_RV and BamHI_pD250R_RV (Table 3) , with pEGFP-C2 and pCFP-pD250R wt used as DNA templates. In all cases, restriction digestions with the specific enzymes were performed following the manu-facturer=s instructions (NEB). HeLa eGFP and HeLa MOV10-YFP stable cell lines were used as negative and positive controls for RNA-protein binding assays (43) .
