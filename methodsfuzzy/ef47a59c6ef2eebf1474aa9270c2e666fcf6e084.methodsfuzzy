Reagents and solvents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, WI) and were used without further purification. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck Silica Gel 60F254 pre-coated plates. Preparative HPLC was performed using a C18 reverse-phase column (19 Ã‚ 150 mm; Sun-Fire Prep C18 All other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL 400 MHz spectrometer, a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer (300 MHz), or a BRUKER AV600 spectrometer (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (ESI or EI) were recorded on a micromass Q-Tof Ultima API or a JEOL JMS-GCmate BU-20 spectrometer. Mass spectra (ESI) were recorded on an LCMS-2010EV (SHIMADZU).
