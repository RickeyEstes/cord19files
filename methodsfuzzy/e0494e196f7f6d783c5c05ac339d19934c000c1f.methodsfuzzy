Representative HCoV strains used in the design of the mCoV-MS method are shown in Supplementary  Table 1 . The CoV genome sequences used for primer and extension probe design were obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Specific primers and extension probes (Supplementary Table 2 ) used in this study were designed using Assay Design v4.0 (Agena Bioscience, Inc.). In this study, we developed a 17-plex analysis to detect six HCoVs in Panel A and another 17-plex analysis to detect Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in Panel B. Panel A: including specific primers and extension probes targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of six HCoVs, and ribonuclease P (as an internal control). In addition, for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we also designed primers and extension probes targeting the ORF1b gene and regions upstream of the E gene (upE). Panel B: including specific primers and extension probes targeting RdRp gene of CoVs in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. The primary PCR and iPLEX reaction of the mCoV-MS method was performed in a 384-plate by using a ProFlex PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to our modified protocol as previously described (Peng et al., 2013a) . The PCR mixes (5 µl) contained 2 µl template and final concentrations of 500 µM nucleotide mix (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dUTP), 100 nM primer mix, 1 U DNA polymerase enzyme, 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.2 U uracil-DNA glycosylase. The reaction conditions of primary PCR were: 45 • C for 2 min; a denaturing step of 2 min at 95 • C followed by 45 cycles of 95 • C for 30 s, 56 • C for 30 s and 72 • C for 1 min; and then a final extension step at 72 • C for 5 min. Sterile water was used as negative control. Then SAP was used to dephosphorylate the primary PCR mixes as follows: 37 • C for 40 min and then 85 • C for 5 min. After SAP treatment, the iPLEX reaction (single-base extension reaction) mix which included 0.2 µl terminator mix, 0.94 µl extension probe mix, 0.2 µl iPLEX Pro buffer, and 0.041 µl ThermoSequenase enzyme was added. The iPLEX reaction, desalting and sample dispensing were performed according to standard procedures (Agena Bioscience, Inc.). All data were acquired and analyzed using Typer software, v4.0.3 (Agena Bioscience, Inc.). We used the plasmids containing nearly the full-length sequence of target genes of HCoVs to determine the analytical sensitivity of the mCoV-MS method. The plasmids were diluted to a series of concentrations of 1, 10, 100 1,000, and 10,000 copies per reaction. The test of each plasmid concentration was performed in triplicate. All samples used in this study were obtained from collections at our institute. We isolated total RNA and DNA from all samples using the Qiagen DNA/RNA isolation kits (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the specificity of the mCoV-MS method, we used 32 samples that had previously been confirmed positive for HCoV (Ren et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014) , and two bat SARS-like coronavirus isolated from bats . A panel of common respiratory viruses (Ren et al., 2009; n = 110) was also used to determine the specificity of the mCoV-MS method ( Table 1) . Potential biohazardous materials were handled in required levels of biosafety laboratories. All experiments (collection of samples, sample handing, operator training and protection, etc.) were carried out according to the approved biosafety standard guidelines set by The Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. Further testing of the mCoV-MS method involved 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats (n = 352) or rodents (n = 32) which were part of our bat and rodent virome project. Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in 384 samples of bats and rodents were also screened using a RT-PCR of the RdRp gene of CoVs . For comparison, the next generation sequencing technology (NGST) results of 352 bat samples in another study were also included (Wu et al., 2016) . We screened 131 nasal and throat swabs obtained from patients for HCoVs using the mCoV-MS method. The results were compared with those of other methods as described follows. Four common HCoVs were also screened by using PCR or nested PCR assays, followed by sequencing analysis according to previously reported methods (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2006) . To screen for SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoV, we used the method described by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/). To screen for MERS-CoV in samples, we used a qPCR assay developed by Corman et al. (2012a,b ). All primers and probes used in the mCoV-MS method were evaluated using BLASTN searches against the non-redundant nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Panel A and B test can be carried out simultaneously or separately according to actual needs. Sensitivity tests showed that the panel A of mCoV-MS method can accurately detected all six targeted HCoVs. The limit of detection of the mCoV-MS method was ∼10-100 copies per assay panel ( Table 2) . For example, for the MERS-CoV panels, we were able to detect 10 copies of N, ORF1b and upE, and 100 copies of RdRp (Figure 1 ). As expected, negative controls yielded no positive results for the mCoV-MS method. We used 32 HCoV-positive samples to evaluate the common HCoV assays and MERS-CoV assays, and two SARS-like CoV isolates to evaluate the SARS-CoV assays (  We used 352 pools of bat pharyngeal and anal swab samples to validate the performance of mCoV-MS. These samples were collected in 22 provinces which is a part of our bat virome project (Wu et al., 2016) . Among the 352 pools, 20 (5.68%) were tested positive by our method. Seventeen pools (4.83%) were identified by panel A assays as SARS-CoV, which showed good concordance with the results of SARS-like CoVs by means of metagenomic analysis (Wu et al., 2016 ; Table 3 ). Six of the 17 (35.3%) pools were also confirmed as lineage-B beta-CoV by panel B assays. We found that these samples obtained two or more positive results by panel A assays. It is obvious that multiple target using in panel A avoid the false negative results. Five of the 17 (29.4%) pools were confirmed as lineage-B beta-CoV by PCR-sequencing method. It seemed that the mCoV-MS method were more sensitive than PCR method (P = 0.01 by χ 2 test). Interestingly, all the 17 pools obtained SARS-upE-positive results, while only 8 (47.1%) of them were detected by the panel B assays or PCR method targeting CoV's RdRp gene. Our results are consistent with the earlier research demonstrating that upE assay is the most sensitive test for coronavirus detection (Corman et al., 2012a; Chan et al., 2015) . The remaining three pools (0.9%) were identified as Alphacoronavirus by panel B assays and were ascertained by PCR-sequencing method. Another 32 rodent pharyngeal and anal swab pools collected in eight provinces across China were also screened by our novel method. A total of 4 (12.5%) pools were classified as lineage-A Betacoronavirus by panel B assays and PCR-sequencing verified two of them (Table 4 ). Using the mCoV-MS method, we analyzed 131 nasal and throat swabs. The mCoV-MS method detected HCoVs in 22.14% (29/131) of samples. This result was identical to that when we used a combination of PCR and sequencing techniques. We detected HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 in 9.9% (13/131), 6.9% (9/131), 3.1% (4/131) and 2.3% (3/131) of specimens, respectively. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not detected in any of these samples.
