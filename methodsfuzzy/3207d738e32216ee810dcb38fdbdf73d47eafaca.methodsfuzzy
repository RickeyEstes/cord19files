Reagents and animals. Glycyrrhizin (IUPAC name, [3β,18α]-30-hydroxy-11,30-dioxoolean-12-en-3-yl 2-O-β-D-glucopyranuronosyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid; CAS number, 1405-86-3; molecular formula, C 42 H 62 O 16 ; molecular weight, 822.93 Da; purity, 98%) was purchased from Xi'an Tianxingjian Natural Bio-products Group (Xi'an, Shaanxi, China), and its structure is shown in Fig. 1 Modeling and treatment. The sciatic nerve injury model was created as previously described (19, 20) , with certain modifications. Briefly, all mice underwent intraperitoneal injection of 3% ketamine using 100 mg/kg weight for anesthesia. The two cm-longitudinal incisions were aseptically made on the unilateral rear thigh. The sciatic nerve cords were completely interrupted at 0.5 cm below the ischial tuberosity and immediately underwent microsurgical anastomosis using 11-0 microsutures (Sharpoint™ MicroSutures, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Finally, the muscle and skin were sutured. Mice were randomized into four groups of 40 mice each and treated with different concentrations of glycyrrhizin for four different time periods. Glycyrrhizin was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and administered intragastrically, daily for 14 continuous days. The final high-, mid-and low-doses were 20, 10 and 5 g/kg weight/day, respectively. An NaCl solution (0.9%) of an equivalent volume served as the control. Mice were sacrificed one, two, four and eight weeks after injury. Electroneurophysiological testing. Affected sciatic nerves underwent electroneurophysiological testing using an electromyograph and evoked potential machine (Keypoint ® , Medtronic A/C Inc., Skovlunde, Denmark) prior to the mice being sacrificed, as previously described (20) , with certain modifications. Briefly, the sciatic nerves were exposed at 24˚C, then pin electrodes were pierced into the musculi soleus for wave recording (M point) and grounding electrodes were placed on the tails. A single current stimulus (10 mA) was employed to stimulate proximal anastomotic ischial tuberosity (P point) and the distal sciatic nerve bifurcation point (D point), respectively, using a parallel stimulating electrode with a fixed space of 3.3 mm between two tips. Motor nerve conductive velocity (MNCV) equaled the distance between the P and D points divided by the difference value of potential latency. Preparation of spinal cord specimens. The affected spinal cord segments, L4-L6, connected to injured sciatic nerves, were dissected, dissociated and removed as previously described (19, 20) . Tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen until use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting analysis. Alternatively, tissues were soaked in 10% neutral buffered formalin for fixation for 72 h, then dehydrated by gradient alcohols and embedded in paraffin for use. Western blotting and qPCR analysis. Western blotting procedures were routinely performed, as previously described (20, 21) , but the goat anti-rat p75NTR polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) were diluted 100 times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Beyotime Inc., Nanjing, China). In the qPCR experiments, the total RNA was extracted from the tissues using the TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) reagent method. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using total RNA templates. p75NTR mRNA was detected by qPCR using cDNA templates. Reduced glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a housekeeping gene in each reaction system. The relative p75NTR/GAPDH mRNA levels were determined. The reaction condi tions were 35 cycles at 95˚C for 30 sec, 57˚C for 60 sec and 72˚C for 60 sec. p75NTR and GAPDH primers were designed based on the NCBI Genbank sequences using Beacon Designer 7 software (Premier Biosoft Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) and synthesized by Sangon Bioengineering, Inc. (Shanghai, China). The p75NTR primer sequences were: Sense, 5'-AGTGGCGGATATGGTGAC-3'; antisense, 5'-GAGCAATAGACAGGAATGAGG-3'; and probe, 5'-TCC TGACTCCGTTGCTGCTCCCGA-3'. The GAPDH primer sequences were: Sense, 5'-AATGTGTCCGTCGTGGAT CTG-3'; antisense, 5'-CAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC-3'; and probe, 5'-CGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAACCTGCC-3' . Histological examination. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into transverse slices of 3 µm in thickness. Slices were stained using combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson's silver stain (Marsland's) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining methods, as previously described (21, 22) . Nerve fibers were stained black and myelin was stained blue (23) . In each slice, five microscopic fields of x400 magnification were randomly selected and their images captured. The diameter and number of myelinated fibers was calculated using image analysis software Image-Pro ® Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). Immunofluorescence staining. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into slices of 3 µm in thickness. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was routinely performed to detect expression in astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was stained blue and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was stained green. Goat anti-rat GFAP and NSE monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were diluted 1,000 times. The fluorescence intensity of five random fields was measured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1200CLSM; Olympus Inc., Beijing, China). The excitation wavelengths were 488 nm and 561 nm for blue and green fluorescence, respectively. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The SPSS 17.0 statistical package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for comparisons between groups. P<0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference.
