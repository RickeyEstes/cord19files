The MF technique is recognized by the USEPA and UNEP/WHO as a method for detecting biological contaminants of potable water. This technique is capable of isolating and eliminating discrete microbiology colonies in relatively large number of sample volume compared to the MTF technique [82] [83] [84] . Similar to the MTF technique, MF method is generally used for major indicator organisms [85] . In the past, both methods have been conducted at laboratory level, but due to the advancement of portable technologies, MF and MTF method are now able to be executed for on-site applications. Incubation of MF on solid and/or liquid selective media at appropriate temperature allows the growth and development of organism cultures providing a direct count of total coliforms colonies. The choices of temperatures depend on the type of bacteria indicator and the selective media. For instance, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and Penicillium were able to be detected using cellulose nitrate membrane filters which after being incubated for 48 h at 44 â€¢ C on the solid and liquid selective media [86] . The MF technique has also been used for retaining virus, known as F-RNA coliphages via incubation using mixed cellulose nitrate and acetate membrane filters [87] . Work conducted by Grabow et al. [88] indicated that theoretical efficiencies of 100% are achievable with procedures governing to direct plague assays on 100 mL samples and the presence-absence test on 500 mL samples. In addition, positively-charged filter media have been widely used for recovering bacterial viruses and phage. However, poor detection of viruses and phage was experienced following poor absorption and inactivation caused by extreme pH level exposures [88, 89] . In general, microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes are preferable to be used for the filtration purpose due to their appropriate range of surface pore sizes that could retain microorganism effectively [90] . Previous work has shown that the removal of bacterial contaminants in water could be carried out using microfiltration-based method by observing the in-vitro nitric oxide production and binding response of Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays [91] . Instead of using single type of membrane filter, simultaneous use of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membrane filters were attempted in recent years. Xiong et al. [92] has established the first quantitative assessments in the water samples using integrated method and reported the total organic carbon (TOC), total suspended solid (TSS) and turbidity of the samples to be 95-630 mg/L, 180-1300 mg/L and 150-1900 NTU, respectively. The integrated method has also been used to reduce peroxidase activity in red beet stalks in order to maintain natural pigment stability [93] . Results showed that it achieved more than 99.5% reduction of peroxidase activity and 99.9% reduction in turbidity. Previous work showed the applications of membrane bioreactor (MBR) process based on aerobic fermentation method [94] . MBR combines the membrane filtration process with reactor that involves biological reactions. The efficiency to monitor microbial population in water sample depends on the attachment of bacteria onto inert material inducing high biomass [95, 96] . Integration of bioprocess and MF method provides a better efficiency in the removal of bacteria as, demonstrated by Adan et al. [97] in which a derivation of photo catalysis-microfiltration hybrid system was used to remove E. coli from water source. MF, selective medium broth and culture plate methods have become the standard (ISO 16654:2001) to monitor the presence of
