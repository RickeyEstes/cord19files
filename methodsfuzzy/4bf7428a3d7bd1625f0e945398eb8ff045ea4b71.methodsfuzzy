Seventy-eight genes associated with AD (reported genes) were obtained from the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published GWAS [99] , available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas, accessed January 2016, version 1.0, using studies labelled as "Alzheimer's disease" or "Alzheimer's disease late-onset". These genes and their relationships with pathogens or the immune system are catalogued in Supplementary  Table 1 . The genes are highlighted in bold throughout the text. The tissue and cellular distribution of the 78 AD genes were analyzed using the functional enrichment analysis tool (FUNRICH) [100] (http://funrich.org/index.html) which derives proteomic and genomic distribution data from >1.5 million annotations. It provides the total number of genes in datasets from each region sampled and returns the significance of any enrichment for the uploaded AD genes, using the hypergeometric probability test, with p values corrected using the Storey and Tibshirani method (Q values) [100] . AD gene enrichment was also analyzed in a BBB proteome dataset of mouse cerebral arteries (6620 proteins) [101] . The presence of the AD genes in exosomes, a means of transit through cells allowing intercellular communication [102, 103] , was assessed using Exo-Carta (http://www.exocarta.org) a manually curated database of exosomal proteins, RNA and lipids [104] . The exosomal pathway is hijacked by several viruses, contributing to intercellular spread and immune evasion [105, 106] . Genes related to general pathogen diversity, protozoan and viral diversity and to the immune response to parasitic worms are from a series of papers concerning evolutionary selection pressure relevant to pathogen resistance [92] [93] [94] [95] . The host/pathogen interactomes of two fungal species (C. albicans, C. neoformans), eight viral species (Borna virus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Ebola virus, HSV-1, human endogenous retroviruses HERV-W, HIV-1 (the latter from the HIV-1, human interaction database [107] http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/retroviruses/hiv-1 /interactions, EBV, hepatitis C and influenza A viruses) four bacterial species (B. burgdorferi, C. pneumoniae, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), H. pylori) and two protozoans [T. gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi)] were obtained by literature survey and from existing databases. These referenced interactomes can be accessed at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/HPI.htm. Genes misregulated in the AD hippocampus are those reported from a postmortem microarray study [83] . Up-and downregulated genes (n = 2,879) were combined for comparison with the pathogen interactomes. The upregulated genes (n = 1,690) from this AD hippocampal study contain the pathways relevant to pathogens and immune activation (inflammation, complement activation and the defense response) [83] and these were chosen for comparison with upregulated genes from infection datasets at the Molecular signatures database (MSigDB; http:// software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). MSigDB contains several thousand microarray datasets which can be compared against the various AD inputs [96] . Infection related datasets, and those related to TLR ligands, were identified using search terms (e.g., infection, virus, bacteria, TLR, LPS, etc.). Microarray viral infection datasets (upregulated gene sets) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) [108] were also downloaded from the Harmonizome database (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/ Harmonizome/) from the Ma'ayan laboratory of computational systems [109] . For the searched gene sets, most of the data outputs were restricted at source (by MSigDb or GEO) to the top upregulated genes (usually âˆ¼ 200-300). In addition to this AD hippocampal microarray study, a literature survey was undertaken to analyze the gene or protein expression profiles of components more specifically related to pathogen defense in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. These included TLRand NOD-like receptors, c-type lectins, antimicrobial peptides, defensins, interferons and viral DNA and RNA detectors, and antiviral oxysterols, inter alia. Many of these are endowed with relative specificity against viruses, bacteria or fungi and where possible their known effects were matched to the pathogens used in this study. These properties are reviewed in Supplementary Table 2 . The proteins found in plaques or neurofibrillary tangles are from two proteomics studies yielding 488 proteins in plaques [85] and 90 in tangles [86] . Assuming a human genome of 26846 coding genes and an interactome or other gene set of N genes one would expect N/26846 to exist in the comparator dataset. For example, when comparing 2879 misregulated AD hippocampal genes against any pathogen interactome one would expect 2879/26846 (10.7%) to figure in the pathogen interactome. This calculation was used to define expected values and the enrichment values (observed/expected) in relation to other datasets. Significance of the enrichment was calculated using the hypergeometric probability test. The resultant p values from each analysis series were corrected for false discovery (FDR) [110] . Nominally significant FDR corrected values are considered at p < 0.05 and a corrected Bonferroni p value threshold is illustrated on each set of graphs. (Bonferroni P = 0.05/N, where N is the maximum number of possible comparisons for each situation (e.g., 78 AD genes or 1690 upregulated genes in the AD hippocampus).
