Cells. Vero grivet HEK 293T and U2OS cells were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . U2OS NPC1 Ϫ/Ϫ cell lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as previously described (27) and transiently transfected with NPC1 constructs for colocalization experiments. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in DMEM-Ham's F-12 medium (50/50 mix) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cell lines were generated by a retroviral transduction system, as previously described (22) , to stably overexpress the NPC1 constructs in CHO-M12 cells, which contain a deletion in the NPC1 locus (24) . FreeStyle 293-F cells were maintained in Gibco FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 8% CO 2 . NPC1 constructs. NPC1 domain C sequences (residues 373 to 620) flanked by sequences that form antiparallel coiled coils as previously described (35) were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(ϩ) vector. Constructs made included glycosylation mutants in HsNPC1 domain C (L414NϩD416T, K498NϩG500S, and N598A), while those in DrNPC1 domain C were N414A, N498A, and R600T. DrNPC1 domain C chimeras were made by substituting these residues for human residues 373 to 475 (chimera 1), 476 to 536 (chimera 2), 537 to 620 (chimera 3), 493 to 502 (chimera 4), 502 to 512 (chimera 5), and 513 to 522 (chimera 6), and the point mutations made were E502D, Y503F, I505V, H506Y, F509Y, and S511T. The constructs were then transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells, and the supernatant with secreted protein was harvested after 72 h and used in ELISAs. Purified proteins were made by transfecting FreeStyle 293-F cells in suspension, harvesting cells 72 h posttransfection, and purifying them by incubation with His-60 nickel resin. The proteins were eluted at 500 mM imidazole and pH 7.6 and dialyzed into 50 mM 2-(Nmorpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.5. Domain C chimeras in the full-length NPC1 were generated by seamlessly replacing the domain C sequences in HsNPC1. The constructs were subcloned into the pBABE-puro retroviral vector and stably transfected into CHO-M12 cells by retroviral transduction, as previously described (22) . All constructs possessed N-terminal Flag tags. VSV pseudotype infections. Replication-incompetent vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana (VSV) pseudotypes encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in the first position and EBOV GP in place of VSV G were made as previously described (9, 36) . EBOV GPΔMuc matches the EBOV/H.sapiens-tc/ COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga isolate amino acid sequence (GenBank accession number AF086833) but lacks the mucin-like domain (Δ309 -489; ΔMuc) (37) . Unless otherwise indicated, virus titers were determined on Vero grivet monkey cells by manual counting of eGFP-positive cells. Cleaved EBOV GP (GP CL ) was generated in vitro using the bacterial protease thermolysin (250 g/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at 37°C as described previously (38, 39) , and the reaction was stopped by adding the metalloprotease inhibitor phosphoramidon (1 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich). Authentic Ebola virus infections. CHO cells, seeded in black Cellcoat 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, North America, Monroe, NC) were incubated with Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621 at the indicated multiplicity of infection in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory located at USAMRIID. Following a 1-h absorption, virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 , and 80% humidity for 72 h, at which time the cells were washed once with PBS and submerged in 10% formalin prior to removal from the BSL-4 laboratory. Formalin was removed, and cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Cells were blocked by adding 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBS to each well and incubating the cells at 37°C for 2 h. Cells were incubated with EBOV GP-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) KZ52, diluted to 1 g/ml in 3% BSA-PBS, at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS prior to addition of goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary antibody. Following a 1-h incubation with secondary antibody, cells were washed 3 times prior to addition of Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in PBS. Cells were imaged and percentages of virus-infected cells were calculated using the Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and Harmony high-content imaging and analysis software (PerkinElmer). GP CL -NPC1 domain C capture ELISA. Normalization of NPC1 domain C supernatants and proteins was carried out as previously described (25): resolution on SDS-PAGE gels followed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-mouse Alexa-680 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantification on the Li-Cor Odyssey imager (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Capture ELISAs were also performed as previously described (22, 25) . Briefly, high-binding 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with KZ52 (40) (2 g/ml in PBS) and then blocked using PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (PBSA). Pseudotyped EBOV was cleaved with thermolysin (250 g/ ml) at 37°C for 1 h and captured on the plate. Unbound virus was washed off, and serial dilutions of either Flag-tagged purified soluble NPC1 domain C (domain C; 0 to 40 g/ml) or supernatants from transient transfections of the NPC1 constructs on HEK 293T cells were added. Bound domain C was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Flag antibody and Ultra-TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher). EC 50 values were calculated from binding curves generated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Binding ELISAs were done in duplicate and in at least two independent experiments. All incubation steps were done at 37°C for 1 h or at 4°C overnight. Immunofluorescence. Imaging was performed in U2OS or CHO cells grown on 12-mm coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For antibody staining, the coverslips were incubated with an anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA. Detection was by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For filipin staining, the coverslips were stained with 50 g/ml of Streptomyces filipinensis filipin III complex (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and images were acquired with an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a 63ϫ high-numerical-aperture oil objective.
