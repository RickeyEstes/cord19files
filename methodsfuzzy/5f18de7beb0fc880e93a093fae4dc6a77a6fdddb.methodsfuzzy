Samples: Tissue samples from eight suspected IBV outbreaks in Sulaimani broiler farms were collected. Trachea, lung and kidneys were obtained from 3 to 4 birds in each farm and transferred to the laboratory on ice. The birds suffered from respiratory symptoms and lesions as well as kidney damage (enlargement, congestion, and uroletheasis). The flocks were vaccinated with 4/91 or MA5 vaccine. Three different strains of IBV vaccines (H120, CEVA), (MA5, Intervet) and (4/91, Intervet) were used as positive control. Serological test: Blood samples were collected from 10 birds of each of the eight broiler farms and repeated one week later. The serum was separated; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted for the detection of IBV antibody in clinically suspected farms using IBV antibody test kit (Synbiotics, USA). This ELISA kit is highly specific in which a titer of (>5 Â 10 3 ) indicates the present of IBV infection. RNA extraction: 50-100 mg tissue from trachea, lung and kidney of the birds were homogenized in liquid nitrogen. TRIZOL 1 reagent was used to extract the RNA from tissue samples according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were dissolved in 40 ml RNase-DNase free distilled water and directly used for subsequent RT-RCR or stored at (À20 8C). Virus isolation: Tissue homogenate (200 ml) from trachea and kidney of each PCR positive sample was inoculated in the allantoic cavities of 3 SPF chicken egg embryos (9-11 days) and incubated for 3 further days at 37 8C and candled daily. After 5 passages, allantoic fluids were collected and RNA was extracted for RT-PCR (Momayez et al., 2002) . Oligonucleotides: Oligonucleotides used in this project are illustrated in Table 1 . cDNA synthesis: SuperScript TM II RT protocol (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instruction, briefly, 1 ml total RNA (1 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 ml reverse primer (10 pmole/ul), r-N1221 for N gene or r-S1982 for S gene (Table 1) , 1 ml dNTPs (10 mM each) and RNase free distilled water in a total volume of 12.5 ml mixture. The mixture heated to 65 8C for 5 min then directly chilled on ice. 4 ml from 5Â First-strand buffer and 2 ml Dithiotheritol (0.1 mM), 0.5 ml (40 units/ ml) RNase inhibitor were added to the mixture. After incubating the mixture at 42 8C for 2 min, 1 ml (200 units/ml) Superscript TM II Reverse Transcriptase was added and further incubated at 42 8C for 50 min, and finally, the enzyme was inactivated at 70 8C for 15 min. The cDNA was stored at 20 8C for the following PCR amplifications. Detection of the virus by N gene amplification: A primer pair (f-N784 and r-N1221) was used to detect IBV in clinical samples amplifying 437 bp of N gene. This pair of primers was designed specific to a conserved region of nucleocapsid (N) gene to ensure a wide detection range. The PCR amplification reaction was carried out in 25 ml mixture containing 2.5 ml of 10Â PCR reaction buffer, 0.7 ml of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 ml of each of 10 pmol forward Table 1 Sequences, genome location and the references of primers used in this study.
