Cells HEK293, HEK293T, and Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin. MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum, Lglutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Bat cell lines BKT1, FBKT1, YubFKT1, IndFSPT1, DemKT1, ZFBK11-97, SuBK12-08, and ZFBS13-76A were established as described previously (Maeda et al., 2008; Maruyama et al., 2014) . All bat cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FCS, L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin.
