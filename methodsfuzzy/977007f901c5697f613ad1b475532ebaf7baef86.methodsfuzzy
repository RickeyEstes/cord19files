A clinical isolate of CHIKV (Chikungunya virus strain DRDE-06; GenBank accession number: EF210157.2) was used for all the in vivo experiments in this study. The bioinformatics related work was carried out using the CHIKV E1 protein sequence from the prototype strain CHIKV S27 available in the SWISS PROT (ID:Q8JUX5). Further, a multiple sequence alignment of the E1 glycoprotein of DRDE-06 sequences and CHIKV S27 revealed a 98% homology between the two strains. Peptides CHIKV peptides were custom synthesised from commercial sources (Hysel Pvt Ltd., India) and obtained as a lyophilised powder. The non-specific peptide was a gift from XCyton diagnostics private Ltd, Bangalore, India.
