Ethical statement. All experiments with the olive flounders in this study were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulation approved by Ethical Committee of Pukyong National University. Preparation of olive flounder gill tissues. Gill tissues from twelve olive flounder (BW = ~50 g, n = 3/ group) including healthy and infected fish with each pathogen were used for this study. Briefly, healthy fish (non-challenged), sampled fish at 7 days post challenge (dpc) with S. parauberis at 5.06 × 10 3 CFU/fish in 1/3 seawater of 21 °C, sampled fish at 7 dpc with VHSV at 106 PFU/fish in 1/3 seawater of 19 Construction of cDNA libraries for transcriptome analysis. Building of transcriptome libraries were conducted by Illumina's TruSeq RNA protocol, and 1-2 μg of total RNA were used in each samples. AMPure XP beads (BECKMAN COULTER) and Ambion Fragmentation Reagents kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) were used for extraction of Poly(A)+ RNA and their fragment, respectively. As the following steps, cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina indexed adapters were carried out according to Illumina's protocol. The size-selected 250-300 bp cDNA fragments were loaded on a 3% Nusieve 3:1 (Lonza) agarose gel for libraries. The cDNA fragments were recovered using QIAEX II gel extraction reagents (Qiagen), and amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for 14 PCR cycles. The amplified libraries were purified by AMPure XP beads, their concentration and product sizes were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing of paired-end libraries were conducted with the Illumina HiSeq2500, (2 × 100 nucleotide read length). Transcriptome analysis and differential gene expression. Transcriptome analysis were carried out with the RNAseq Tuxedo protocol. Mapping of Sequences were conducted against the Olive flounder draft genome (Submitted at present) using TopHat v2.0.9 with default options for paired-end sequences. Transcripts expression were estimated using the Cufflinks program v2.1.1. Total sequencing reads were subjected to preprocessing as follows: adapter trimming was performed using cutadapt with default parameters, and quality trimming (Q30) was performed using FastQC with default parameters. Processed reads were mapped to the Olive flounder draft genome (Submitted at present) using tophat and cufflink with default parameters 76 . The differential analysis was performed using Cuffdiff 76 using default parameters. Further, the FPKM values from Cuffdiff were normalized and quantitated using R Package Tag Count Comparison (TCC) 77 to determine statistical significance (e.g., P values) and differential expression (e.g., fold changes.). Through these statistics analysis, we sorted DEGs having p < 0.05 and showed them as results. Gene ontology analysis. DEG set for GO analysis was acquired from transcriptome analysis. DEGs were annotated from InterProScan database and non-redundant protein database in the NCBI. DAVID and uniprot tool were used for exploring the functional enrichment of these DEGs and sorting specially out the immune-related GO terms with p-value of <0.05, respectively.
