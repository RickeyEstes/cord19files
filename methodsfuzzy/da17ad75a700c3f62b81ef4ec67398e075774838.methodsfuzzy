Patients and clinical specimens Recruitment of patients took place from May 2005 to July 2007 at the Fever Outpatient Clinic Department (FOCD) of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Beijing, China. To include the potential viral ARTIs and to exclude typical bacterial infections, patients enrolled in the study were selected by physicians according to the following criteria: ‡14 years of age, with respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheezing, acute fever (body temperature ‡38°C), and normal or low leukocyte count, with or without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. Nose and throat swabs were collected from each patient, and the two swabs were pooled in one tube containing virus transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). A total of 5808 patient samples (i.e. c. one-third of the patients who visited the FOCD of PUMCH during the study period) were collected and tested.
