Day-old commercial broiler chicks with IBV maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) were obtained from a commercial hatchery. The parent flock of these chicks had been vaccinated with live IBV H120+ D274 vaccines and with an inactivated IBV M41. Chicks were kept in an isolation unit at the University of Liverpool. The chicks were reared on deep litter with water and feed provided ad libitum.
