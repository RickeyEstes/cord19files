Cells and reagents HEK-293 T (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), Huh-7 cells (Japan Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan), Vero-E6 cells (ATCC) and MRC-5 cells (ATCC) were grown at 37°C 5% CO 2 in DMEM (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), 10 mM HEPES (Corning), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Corning). A mammalian codon-optimized gene encoding wild-type EMC/ 2012 MERS-CoV spike (EMC wt , GenBank: AFS88936.1) with a fused C-terminal C9-epitope tag was described previously, 8 and subcloned in the pcDNA-3.1 vector. Mammalian codon-optimized wild-type NRCE-HKU205 spike (205 wt , GenBank: AHL18090.1), and NRCE-HKU205 spike with S886A and I888S substitutions (205 EMC-S2′ ) containing C-terminal C9-epitope tag were synthesized (Biomatik, Wilmington, DE, USA) and subcloned in the pcDNA-3.1 vector. Sitedirected mutagenesis (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed to introduce A886S and S888I substitutions in the EMC/2012 S gene (EMC 205-S2′ ). The mutated gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing (Cornell Genomics Facility). pCMV-MLVgag-pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, pTG-Luc transfer vector encoding luciferase reporter and pCMV-Furin human furin-encoding vector were described previously. 13, 14 The pCAGGS-VSV-G plasmid was used to generate positive control-pseudotyped particles. 8 Fluorogenic peptides derived from MERS-CoV spike EMC/2012 and NRCE-HKU205 S2′ sites containing GSRSARSAIE and GSRSSRIAIE sequences, respectively, and harboring the (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl/2,4-dinitrophenyl (MCA/DNP) FRET pair were synthesized by Biomatik. Recombinant human furin was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA), recombinant cathepsin L was kindly provided by Dr Fang Li (University of Minnesota), and recombinant L-1-Tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). The furin inhibitor used in this study (dec-RVKR-CMK) was purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK).
