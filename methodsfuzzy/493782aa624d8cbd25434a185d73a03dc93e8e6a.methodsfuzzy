Tissue c&we cells and media All media were supplied by Life Technologies and were supplemented with fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (50 l.J/mL/SO pg/mL) and 1% nonessential amino acids. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were grown in Ml99 with Glutamax I and S-10% fetal calf serum and HeLa ( Technologies) was added to a final concentration of 10%. Hard water for dilution of products Solution A contained 19.84 g anhydrous MgClz and 46.24 g anhydrous CaCl, diluted in purified water; then diluted to 1 1, in deionized water and sterilized at 121°C for 20 mins. Solution B contained 35.2 g NaHCO, diluted to 1 L in deionized water and sterilized by 0.45 urn membrane filtration. Purified water 600 mL, 6 mL Solution A and 80 mL of Solution B were mixed then diluted to 1 L with deionized water. The final water hardness in test was 300 ppm as CaCo,. The pH at 25°C was 7.0 A 0.2. Bovine serum albumin/yeast extract Bovine serum albumin (10% w/ v; Sigma Chemicals) was prepared in deionized water and sterilized by 0.45 urn membrane filtration. Yeast extract (10% w/v; Oxoid) was p re ared in deionized water, autoclaved at 121 "C for p 20 min then pH adjusted to 7.OAO.2. Equal quantities of the bovine serum albumin and yeast extract solutions were then mixed to provide a combined organic soil load of 10% w/v.
