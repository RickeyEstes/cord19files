New public health methods need to be harnessed to help reduce the eff ect of health problems during MGs. Use of innovative communication channels, such as the internet and mobile phone networks, have the potential to aid surveillance, rapid risk assessment, and dissemination of accurate information. 23, 40, 41 Mathematical modelling and risk communication have potential applicability in all aspects of research into health risks associated with MGs. Some countries and MG organisers use state-of-the-art approaches for early detection and monitoring of diseases such as syndromic surveillance. 3, 29 In some countries computerised health-care and laboratory-based infor mation systems are used for planning MGs and these systems can be adapted for monitoring large-scale outbreaks. Other innovative technologies such as mobile phones can be used in remote areas or countries that lack the resources to gather and transmit health-related data in real time, provide rapid feedback, and train health-care workers. 7, 23 Applicability and use of these modern methods of monitoring in diff erent settings and contexts require further investigation, with special attention to issues related to integration and interoperability of initiatives for infection control during MGs (panel 6). Communication is a key strategy in risk management in planning for MGs. The SARS outbreak in 2003 reinforced the idea that a timely and transparent public information policy could help reduce excessive and inappropriate public health responses and minimise the social disruption and economic consequences of a fast-moving global epidemic. 49, 50 Increased investment in identifying eff ective approaches and developing and assessing new communication methods will benefi t risk prevention and control eff orts. The specifi c challenge is to provide clear, credible, and appropriate communication to meet the needs of diverse communities and retain public trust in a dynamic yet unknown process. 51, 52 Some of the main research topics in this specialty include the link between communication and behaviour change models; development and assessment of methods that can be quickly accessed and used in MGs; and assessment of best practices, challenges, and barriers in risk Research in early detection and monitoring of disease • Identify, develop, and adapt modern technologies for early detection of outbreaks of communicable diseases and their application in disease surveillance during MGs • Integrate and continuously assess innovative approaches and channels for disease surveillance and monitoring • Develop effi cient mechanisms to address the global challenges to sharing information, data, and details about pathogens identifi ed during outbreaks at MGs in terms of local, ethical, legal, and research perspectives • Defi ne the timeliness and quality of data required for early detection of disease from local to district, regional, national, and global levels
