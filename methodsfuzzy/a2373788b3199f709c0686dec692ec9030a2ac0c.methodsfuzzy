Adult outpatients with ILI attending the emergency room of a University Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Centro de Educació n Médica e Investigacion Clínica, CEMIC) during two consecutive winters (May-September 2004 and June-September 2005), were included. These periods corresponded to the 18-39 and 24-34 epidemiological weeks, respectively. Influenza-like illness was defined as fever (>38°C) at least once during the last 72 hours of symptoms and at least one upper respiratory sign ⁄ symptom (cough, nasal discharge, throat sore) and at least one of the following systemic sign ⁄ symptom: headache, myalgias, malaise, chills, prostration. The patients who gathered the inclusion criteria were invited to read and sign the informed consent and those who accepted were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected at the emergency room and sent in viral transport media to the Virology Laboratory. Clinical data including age, symptoms, Flu vaccination, presence of immunosupression and clinical management at the end of the visit were recorded in a form specially designed for this study. The attending physician at the emergency room decided whether the patient required symptomatic and ⁄ or antiviral or antibiotic treatment. This study was approved by the local IRB.
