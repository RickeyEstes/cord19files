We prospectively followed our NSCLC patients who were enrolled in clinical trials undergoing chemotherapy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, between April 1 and July 15, 2003. Whether or not there existed a delay, omission, or refusal of scheduled chemotherapy was recorded and the causes analyzed. Whether or not patients had been suspected of or treated as having SARS, or quarantined due to possible contact with SARS patients, was also recorded and the causes reviewed. The patients filled in questionnaires regarding the importance of lung cancer treatment and the risk of getting SARS during travel to or while staying in the hospital.
