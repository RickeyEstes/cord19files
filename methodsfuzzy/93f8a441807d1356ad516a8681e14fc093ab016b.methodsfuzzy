Whatever the SELEX method used, after sequencing the pool, the binding of individual aptamer clones has to be evaluated on living organisms or cells. During this evaluation, the affinity of the aptamer can be determined but also its specificity for its target, since it is found in a mix with many other biomarkers at the cell surface. Several strategies have been presented for measuring the binding of aptamers to living cells. Basically, aptamers are incubated with cells at different concentrations and bound aptamer quantified after extensive washing. Using Scatchard analysis, the K D and Cmax (apparent concentration of target at the cell surface) can be measured for a specific cell line. When cells are adherent, a possibility is to incubate cells with 5'-[32P]-radiolabeled aptamer and following a washing step, detect bound aptamer by scintillation counting [16, 95] . When cells are non-adhering, many studies apply fluorescent aptamers to perform similar analyses by flow cytometry. The latter technique has also been applied as a tool for monitoring the progress of cell-SELEX experiments [62, 64, 65] . The technique can also be used with adherent cells, but cells have to be put in suspension before flow cytometry analysis. However, the presence of some proteins on plasma membranes may be affected by the procedures associated with detachment of adhering cells from the solid support of the culture plate. For instance, Li et al. demonstrated that the aptamer for Tenascin-C was not a good probe for flow cytometry analysis using U251 glioma cells whereas it labeled the same cells efficiently after adhesion using microscopy [100] . Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein and the authors hypothesized that the protein may be removed and degraded by the process of detachment using trypsin which was performed prior to flow cytometry analysis.
