Monolayers of HRT-18 cells (Tompkins et al., 1974) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) buffered with 44 mM NaHCO, and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The D2 strain of the BFS cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) buffered with 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-Zethanesulfonic acid and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Working stocks of the Mebus strain L9 of BCV (Mebus et al., 1978) with lo6 to 10' p.f.u. per milliliter were prepared in HRT-18 cells. Monolayers were grown in 20-cm* solvent-resistant culture dishes for immunogold labeling experiments and in multiwell chamber slides for immunofluorescence studies. The cells were washed with serum-free medium, infected with BCV (m.o.i. = 2 to 20 p.f.u. per cell) for 60 min at 37°C covered with fresh medium, and incubated for various periods. Infected BFS cultures were incubated with and without the addition of 0.2 pg of trypsin (Type XIII, Sigma Chemical Co.), per milliliter. We used a polyclonal rabbit antibody against purified BCV. This antiserum had a neutralization index of 4.5 and reacted in Western blots with all BCV proteins. The IgG fraction was obtained by protein-A-Sepharose column chromatography of antiserum and normal serum from rabbits. Cultures for electron microscopy were fixed for 30 min at 4°C in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M NaP04, 0.14 M NaCl at pH 7.3 (PBS), washed overnight in PBS, and then treated for 10 min with 1 m&f glycylglycine to quench reactive aldehyde groups. The fixed monolayers were incubated at 4°C in rabbit anti-BCV IgG or normal rabbit IgG, washed in PBS, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 5-nm colloidal gold (Janssen Life Sciences Products, Beerse, Belgium). These monolayers were tixed again in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 hr at 25°C posttixed for 1 h in a solution of 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide in PBS, washed in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and stained en bloc for 1 h with 0.2% uranyl acetate in acetate buffer. After being washed in distilled water, the cells were dehydrated in an ascending alcohol gradient, embedded in situ in Spurr's epoxy resin 1%9) , and polymerized at 60°C. The embedded monolayers were peeled from the plastic substrate and reembedded. Thin sections were cut in a plane perpendicular to the monolayer, stained with lead citrate, and viewed with a Zeiss EM-10 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. The density of labeling on the cell surface was quantitated by counting the number of gold particles per length of plasmalemma in thin-sectioned cells. An PAYNE, STORZ, AND HENK image analyzing system (Sigma Scan, Jandel Scientific) was employed to measure membrane length directly from electron microscope negatives. Preparations for immunofluorescence microscopy were fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.005% CaCl, and 0.11 M sucrose, permeabilized for 5 min with acetone at -2O"C, incubated with rabbit anti-BCV antibody, and reacted with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The preparations were viewed with a Leitz fluorescent microscope using epifluorescence. dantly at 24 hr with 9.5 ? 2.7 gold particles bound per micrometer length of plasma membrane. BCV antigen was located on both microvilli and planar portions of the apical plasma membrane. The gold particles were spatially separated in general, but observations of clustered BCV antigen in the plasma membrane were made as well. Neighboring cells without evidence of infection were practically devoid of label with fewer than 0.5 gold particles per micrometer of plasmalemma.
