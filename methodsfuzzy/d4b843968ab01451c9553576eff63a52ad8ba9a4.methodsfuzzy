We scanned publicly available information published in research articles and quoted from official reports of outbreak investigations to obtain our dataset. The date of illness onset was defined as the date on which a symptom relevant to COVID-19 infection appeared and was determined by the reporting governmental body. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the ascertained pairs into "certain" and "probable," where the former was used for pairs and dates of illness onset were clearly defined in an academic article and the latter was applied to pairs and dates of illness onset that were clearly defined but quoted from outbreak investigation reports. Pairs of cases that cannot be scientifically linked were classified as "uncertain" and removed from our analysis, and the verification of illness onset date was ensured following an erratum report of presymptomatic transmissions in Germany [4] . Estimates were obtained for certain and probable pairs combined (n=28) as well as for the certain pairs alone (n=18). The interval censored data were handled in units of days. We employed a Bayesian approach with doubly interval censored likelihood to obtain estimates of the serial interval [5] : . . . , (1) where i represents the identity of each pair, ( (http://github.com/aakhmetz/nCoVSerialInteval2020). As the epidemic will continue to grow beyond our data collection cutoff point of 12 February 2020, it is possible that the na√Øve likelihood (1) underestimates the serial interval as sampling during the early stage of the epidemic preferentially excludes infector-infectee pairs with longer serial intervals. We adjusted for this selection bias-called right truncation-in our model. The alternative p.d.f. that accounts for right truncation during the exponential growth phase of the epidemic is written as: where r is the exponential growth rate estimated at 0.14 [7] and T is the latest time of observation (12 February 2020). We account for the exponential growth rate of cases, because recently infected individuals are more likely to be sampled during the exponential growth phase of an epidemic. The widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) was used to compare between distributions and the model with the minimal WAIC value was selected as the best-fit model for each set of estimates with and without right truncation.
