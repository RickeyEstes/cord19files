Mice. C57BL/6 mice were originally acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice deficient for type I IFN receptor (␣/␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice), type III IFN receptor (R Ϫ/Ϫ mice), and type I and type III IFN receptors (␣/␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice) on a C57BL/6 genetic background were kindly provided by Sergei Kotenko (Rutgers University) and generated as described previously (55) . Infectious clone constructs, cloning, and in vitro transcription. A pACNR-YFV-17D low-copynumber backbone (kindly provided by Charles Rice, Rockefeller University, NY) was transformed and amplified using low-recombination-frequency NEB 5-alpha high-efficiency competent E. coli cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Transformed bacteria were incubated in LB-50 g/ml ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) overnight at 30°C under conditions of shaking at 205 rpm. Plasmid cDNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A. endonuclease-free Maxiprep kit (Omega, Norcross, GA), ethanol (EtOH) precipitated, and linearized using Afi-II restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Following concentration of linearized DNA by ethanol precipitation, viral RNA was transcribed from 1 g of linear template using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electroporation and production of viral stocks. Single-cell suspensions of Huh-7.5 cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM Gluta-Max-1 reduced-serum media (Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen, Foster City, CA) and resuspended at a concentration of 1.5 ϫ 10 7 cells/ml in Opti-MEM. Two micrograms of viral RNA was mixed with 0.4 ml of cell suspension and immediately pulsed in a 2-mm-path-length cuvette using an ElectroSquare Porator ECM 830 system (BTX, Holliston, MA) (860 V, 99 s, five pulses). Electroporated cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to being transferred into 25 ml (P150 culture dish) of media. To produce a large-scale stock of YFV-17D, 5.4 ϫ 10 7 Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with 18 g of RNA. At 24 h postelectroporation, the medium was changed and replaced by low-serum-concentration DMEM (1% FBS). Virus was collected at 48 h and 72 h postelectroporation. At 72 h postelectroporation, virus was pooled and concentrated 40-fold to 100-fold using Millipore 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff (MWCO) spin filter columns (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) (3,000 ϫ g, 20 min) on the last day of collection. Viral titers were then assessed using a PFU assay. Titration of viral stocks and YFV-17D in vitro infections. To determine the viral titer of the YFV-17D stock, 2.5 ϫ 10 5 Huh7.5 cells were seeded per well in a 6-well plate at 24 h postinfection. Serial dilutions of the viral stock from 10 Ϫ3 to 10 Ϫ12 were performed, and 2 ml of each dilution was incubated with Huh7.5 cells for 6 h at 37°C. At 6 h postinfection, media were replaced by a fresh Methocel solution (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% methylcellulose). At 4 days postinfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 100% ethanol for 25 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The PFU count for each dilution was then determined. Mouse infection and monitoring. C57BL/6, ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ , R Ϫ/Ϫ , and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ adult male and female adult mice (2 to 6 months of age) were infected through intravenous injection in the tail vein with YFV-17D (10 6 or 10 7 PFU) diluted in 200 l of PBS. Clinical manifestations of disease were monitored daily, and signs of clinical disease progression were recorded through weighing, clinical scoring, and temperature measurements using a rectal probe. Overall appearance was assessed using a clinical scoring matrix assigned as follows: 0, posture normal, appearance with smooth, shiny fur; 1, posture hunched, appearance with ruffled fur, loss of muscle tone, loss of weight; 2, posture hunched, trembling, shaky, appearance with ruffled fur, loss of weight, rash; 3, posture severely hunched, appearance disheveled, significant (greater than or equal to 20%) body weight loss; 4, death. Histologic analysis of liver and spleen tissue. Liver and brain tissues from noninfected or infected (day 5 postinfection) wild-type, ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ , R Ϫ/Ϫ , and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice were harvested and incubated in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4°C for 48 h and subsequently transferred into 70% (vol/vol) ethanol (EtOH). Tissue processing, paraffin embedding, and hematoxylin and eosin or CD3 staining (to stain T-lymphocyte) were performed by the Histopathology Reference Lab (HRL) (Hercules, CA) using the standard procedure. All liver and brain sections were of sufficient area to permit accurate examination of tissue histopathological manifestations and lymphocyte infiltration. For each mouse model and experimental condition (noninfected or infected), tissue (liver and brain [or brain only for lymphocyte infiltration analysis]) was examined using 6 tissue sections from three biological replicates (3 animals). The histopathological manifestations and extensive lymphocyte infiltration observed in ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice were absent from all examined noninfected animals and limited in other infected mouse models. Pictures depicting histopathological manifestations and extensive lymphocyte infiltration are representative of three biological replicates. Organ collection and isolation of immune cells. Whole blood (200 l) was collected through submandibular bleeding and transferred into EDTA capillary collection tubes (Microvette 600 K3E; Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Cells were separated from plasma through centrifugation, and red blood cells were lysed with 1ϫ lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Following lysis and quenching with 10% FBS-DMEM, blood cells were then washed twice with a 1% (wt/wt) FBS-PBS solution before staining. At the indicated endpoints, mice were euthanized via exsanguination under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. To isolate immune cells from spleen and liver tissues, spleens and livers were collected following sacrifice and individually placed in 15 ml of serum-free DMEM. Spleens and livers were then transferred into 6-and 10-cm-diameter dishes, respectively, mechanically dissociated using a razor blade, and digested with 5 and 10 ml of digestive buffer, respectively (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany; 40 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 U/ml DNase I, HBSS [Hanks' balanced salt solution; Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen, Foster City, CA]) (0.1% [wt/vol] collagenase) for 30 min at 37°C. Following quenching with 10% (vol/vol) FBS-DMEM media, splenocytes were strained through a 100-m-pore-size cell strainer and washed with 10% (vol/vol) FBS-DMEM twice. Splenocytes were then centrifuged and lysed with 1ϫ lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Following quenching, liver cell suspensions were spun at low speed (300 rpm) for 5 min and supernatants containing the intrahepatic lymphocytes were transferred into a new 50-ml tube. For each 25 ml of collected supernatant, 15 ml of lymphocyte separation medium (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA) was slowly added to the bottom of each conical tube, and samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min with no brake. The interphase between the two phases was then collected and transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. Splenocytes and liver-derived lymphocytes were then washed twice with a 1% (vol/vol) FBS-PBS solution and viable (trypan blue-negative) cells counted prior to staining. RNA extraction from serum and tissues. At the indicated time points, 200 l of blood was collected through submandibular bleeding in a 1.5-ml collection tube. Serum was then separated from blood cells by centrifugation (10 min, 3,500 rpm). Viral RNA was isolated from mouse serum using a ZR viral RNA kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At the indicated endpoints, mice were euthanized via exsanguination under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Spleen, brain, liver, kidney, and thymus tissues were collected, placed into RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, CA) solution, and maintained overnight at 4°C. The isolated tissues (20 to 30 mg) were then resuspended in buffer RLT-1% ␤-mercaptoethanol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), lysed using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (20 cycles/s for 2 min, 1 min wait, 20 cycles/s for 2 min), and centrifuged at high speed (10,000 rpm) for 10 min. Total RNA was then extracted from the resulting supernatant using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. YFV-17D single-step reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR. Viral RNA was quantified using single-step reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative real-time PCR (SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit; Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen, Foster City, CA) with primers and TaqMan probes targeting a conserved region of the 5= untranscribed region (UTR) of the YFV-17D genome. Single-step RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was accomplished in a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using the following thermal cycling procedure: 52°C for 15 min, denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 55°C for 20 s, and elongation at 68°C for 20 s. A cDNA sequence coding for the 5= UTR was in vitro transcribed and used as a standard for the absolute quantification of viral RNA. The primers used were as follows: YFV-17D sense 1 (GCTAATTGAGGTGCATTGGTCTGC), YFV-17D sense 2 (GCTAATTGAGGTGTATTGGTCTGC), YFV-17D antisense 1 (CTGCTAATCGCTCAACGAACG), and YFV-17D antisense 2 (CTGCTAATCGCTCAAAG
