Bacterial strains. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 . For Escherichia coli strains, LB agar and broth (Fisher, Hampton, NH) were routinely used, and growth was at 37°C. For the selection of pHUG21, 12.5 g/ml of carbenicillin (Fisher) was used, for the selection of pHb0.0, 5 g/ml of tetracycline hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA) was used, and for the selection of pOS1 P lgt , 50 g/ml of carbenicillin was used. Staphylococcus strains were grown at 37°C using tryptic soy agar and broth (Fisher), except where noted throughout. For the selection of pOS1 P lgt , 10 g/ml chloramphenicol (Fisher) was used except where noted. The strains were streaked onto agar from stocks stored at Ϫ80°C 2 days prior to each experiment. Hemoglobin cloning and genetic manipulation. We compiled a subset of ␣and ␤-globin sequences from GenBank, as well as cloned ␣-globin orthologs from cDNA derived from primate cell lines and ␤-globin orthologs from primate genomic DNA. Hemoglobin gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MH382883 to MH382906). Hemoglobin gene sequences obtained from GenBank include those for olive baboon, bonobo, white-headed capuchin, chimpanzee, Angolan colo-bus, northern white-cheeked gibbon, green monkey, human, drill, crab-eating macaque, common marmoset, Sumatran orangutan, rhesus macaque, black snub-nosed monkey, golden snub-nosed monkey, and squirrel monkey. Primate cell lines were purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). The ␣-globin orthologs cloned from cDNA (with Coriell identifier [ID] numbers) are as follows: African green monkey (PR01193), black-and-white colobus (PR00240), white-handed gibbon (PR01131), Western lowland gorilla (AG05251), Francois' leaf monkey (PR01099), black crested mangabey (PR01215), white-faced marmoset (PR00789), Nancy Ma's night monkey (PR00627), patas monkey (AG06116), proboscis monkey, Allen's swamp monkey (PR01231), talapoin (PR00716), and Wolf's guenon (PR00486). The ␤-globin orthologs cloned from genomic DNA (with Coriell ID numbers) are as follows: crested macaque (PR01215), Bolivian red howler monkey (PR00708), pigtailed macaque, blackcrested mangabey (PR01215), Nancy Ma's night monkey(PR00627), patas monkey (AG06116), white-faced saki (PR00239), island siamang (PR00722), Allen's swamp monkey (PR01231), talapoin (PR00716), Spix's saddle-back tamarin (AG05313), dusky titi (PR00742), Wolf's guenon (PR00486), and common woolly monkey (PR00525). Primate hemoglobin cDNA was cloned into pHb0.0 using Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs [NEB], Ipswich, MA). In general, each ␣and ␤-globin gene cDNA was amplified from the template (above) using Phusion 2ϫ master mix (Thermo, Waltham, MA) with primers that also had homology to pHb0.0. All primers are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Because of cDNA sequence homology, some primers were used for multiple species. pHb0.0-human was digested with PacI (NEB) and HindIII-HF (NEB), and the doubly digested vector was isolated by gel purification (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). PCR products were assembled with digested pHb0.0, transformed to DH5␣, reisolated with a Mini-prep (Thermo), and confirmed by sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ) with primers pHb0.0_for/pHb0.0_rev. Globin cDNA was amplified with the following primers for Gibson assembly: white-cheeked gibbon ␣-globin, primers AF327/328; white-cheeked gibbon ␤-globin, primers AF329/ 330; baboon ␣-globin, primers AF331/332; baboon ␤-globin, primers AF329/330; talapoin ␣-globin, primers AF327/328; talapoin ␤-globin, primers AF329/330; marmoset ␣-globin, primers AF333/334; and marmoset ␤-globin, primers AF329/335. Chimeric hemoglobins were prepared by subcloning the ␣-globins. To enable digestion with XbaI (NEB) (which is sensitive to dam methylation) pHb0.0-human and pHb0.0-baboon were transformed and reisolated from E. coli K1077 (Δdam Δdcm). The ␣-globin from each plasmid was excised by digestion This paper pOS1 P lgt isdB schweitzeri This paper pOS1 P lgt isdB argenteus This paper pOS1 P lgt isdB aureus Q162R This paper pOS1 P lgt isdB aureus S170T This paper pOS1 P lgt isdB aureus Q162R;S170T This paper with XbaI (NEB) and PacI (NEB), and the ␣-globin and doubly digested pHb0.0 containing ␤-globin were separately isolated by gel purification (Qiagen). Human ␣-globin was ligated into pHb0.0 containing baboon ␤-globin and baboon ␣-globin was ligated (T4 ligase; NEB) into pHb0.0 containing human ␤-globin. The chimeras were confirmed by sequencing (GeneWiz) with primers pHb0.0_for/ pHb0.0_rev.pHb0.0-human was mutagenized using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to create changes in the ␣-gene: T8K (primers AF289/290), T8K/N9H (primers JC112/113; using pHb0.0-human ␣T8K as the template), A5D/T8K/N9H (primers JC114/115; using pHb0.0-human ␣T8K;N9H as the template), N78Q (primers AF291/292), and N78H (primers AF293/294). Changes in the human ␤-gene were as follows: S9N (primers AF303/304), S9T (primers AF307/308), S9A (primers AF309/310), S9K (primers AF305/306), A76N (primers AF313/314), and A76T (primers AF311/312). Phylogenetic analyses. Hemoglobin DNA sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE. Input phylogenies were based upon supported species relationships (47) as well as maximum likelihood gene phylogenies generated using PhyML with SPR topology search and 1,000 bootstraps for branch support (48) . Tests for positive selection were performed using codeml from the PAML software package with the F3X4 codon frequency model. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were performed by comparing pairs of site-specific models (NS sites): M1 (neutral) with M2 (selection), M7 (neutral, beta distribution of dN/dS Ͻ 1) with M8 (selection, beta distribution, dN/dS Ͼ 1 allowed). Additional tests which also account for synonymous rate variation and recombination, including FUBAR, FEL, and MEME, were performed using the HyPhy software package via the Datamonkey server (49, 50) . Sites under positive selection were mapped onto three-dimensional molecular structures by using Chimera (51) (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/ chimera/). The staphylococcal DNA gyrase gene tree was generated using PhyML with 1,000 bootstraps as described above. Macrococcus caseolyticus DNA gyrase was included as an outgroup. The similarity of IsdB sequences in S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri relative to that in S. aureus is shown in Fig. 5 . Recombinant purification of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin expression strains [BL21(DE3) pHUG21 pHb0.0] were streaked onto LB agar containing 12.5 g/ml carbenicillin and 5 g/ml tetracycline hydrochloride. pHb0.0 harbors both ␣and ␤-globin genes, and proper folding and tetramerization require sufficient intracellular heme. Therefore, pHUG21, which encodes a heme uptake system, is coexpressed, and hemin is supplemented in the medium (52) . Single colonies were inoculated in 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with 12.5 g/ml carbenicillin and 5 g/ml tetracycline hydrochloride and grown for 14 h at 37°C with shaking. This culture was used for inoculating 1:500 into 1.5 liters of LB with 12.5 g/ml carbenicillin, 5 g/ml tetracycline hydrochloride, 100 M hemin (prepared fresh at 10 mM in 0.1 M NaOH; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 50 g/ml of the iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(ohydroxyphenylacetic acid (EDDHA, solid added directly to medium; LGC Standards, Teddington, UK; ) in a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask. Cultures were grown at 37°C until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.6 to 0.8. The expression of hemoglobin was induced with 40 g/ml IPTG (isopropyl-␤-isopropyl-␤-Dthiogalactopyranoside-thiogalactopyranoside; RPI, Mount Prospect, IL). At 16 h postinduction at 37°C, cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mM imidazole (Fisher), 5 mM MgCl 2 (Sigma), 1 Roche protease inhibitor tablet (Fisher), approximately 1 mg/ml of lysozyme (Thermo), and 100 g/ml DNase from bovine pancreas (Sigma). The cell pellet resuspended with rocking for 20 min at room temperature after incubating on ice for 20 min. The cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex (Avestin, Ottawa, CA), and then the cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 17,000 ϫ g). The cell lysate was applied to a 3 ml of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen) in a gravity column, to which hemoglobin binds, and washed with 50 ml PBS containing 10 mM imidazole. Hemoglobin was eluted with 6 ml PBS containing 500 mM imidazole, with the first 1 ml of eluate discarded. The hemoglobin-containing eluate was dialyzed twice sequentially in PBS at 4°C. Purified hemoglobin was filter sterilized with a 0.45-m filter and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. The hemoglobin concentration was measured with Drabkin's reagent (Sigma) using human hemoglobin as a standard, ranging from 2 to 6 mg/ml. The relative purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE before use in experiments, as shown in Fig. S8 . Whole-cell hemoglobin binding assay. S. aureus strains were streaked on tryptic soy agar (containing 10 g/ml chloramphenicol for strains carrying plasmids) and grown at 37°C for 24 h. Single colonies were used to inoculate 3 ml of RPMI containing 1% Casamino Acids and 0.5 mM 2,2=-dipyridyl (Acros/Fisher) to induce the expression of chromosomal isdB or 10 g/ml chloramphenicol (for strains carrying plasmids with constitutive isdB expression). After 14 to 16 h of growth at 37°C with shaking, 2 OD 600 units (except for experiments shown in part in Fig. 3D and S4C , where 1 OD 600 unit was used) were collected by centrifugation in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The cell pellet was resuspended with 1 ml PBS or PBS containing recombinant hemoglobin. Then, 10 g/ml (chromosomal isdB) or 2.5 g/ml (plasmid-borne isdB) of hemoglobin was used. The cells were incubated with hemoglobin or PBS for 30 min at 37°C with shaking, and then the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4°C at 8,000 ϫ g. Cells were washed thrice by pipetting with 1 ml ice-cold PBS and centrifuging at 4°C at 8,000 ϫ g. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in 30 l 0.5 M Tris (pH 8.0; Fisher) containing 4% SDS (Fisher) and heated at 90°C for 5 min to remove surfacebound proteins. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 ϫ g, and the eluate was added to 6ϫ loading buffer and heated at 90°C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 12% or 17.5% SDS-PAGE and silver stained (GE, Boston, MA). The gels were imaged using an Alpha Innotech Alpha Imager or Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system. Quantification was performed by densitometric analysis with Image J (NIH) according to the software instructions and by quantifying the area under the peak that corresponds to the hemoglobin band, excluding background density. Because of the variation in stain intensity and quantity of nonspecific bands across gels, all comparisons were made within the same gel, and the relative density was calculated for each biological replicate within the same gel; the comparison was either to human hemoglobin or wild-type IsdB, depending on the assay. Additionally, PBS-only samples and S. aureus ΔisdB::erm were used to verify that hemoglobin binding in this assay is IsdB dependent (Fig. S4C, S5 , and S8) as previously observed, and that recombinant human hemoglobin is bound equally as well as hemoglobin purified from human blood (Fig. S1) (11, 13) . Growth with hemoglobin as sole iron source. For hemoglobin variants ( Fig. 2D and S3 ), S. aureus Newman WT was streaked onto tryptic soy agar and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C. A few colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml of RPMI (Corning, Corning, NY) supplemented with 1% Casamino Acids (Fisher) and 0.5 mM EDDHA (prepared fresh in ethanol). After growth to stationary phase at 37°C with shaking, approximately 16 h, 4 l of culture was inoculated in 196 l of medium in a 96-well plate, and the OD 600 at 37°C with shaking was monitored over time using a BioTek plate reader. The medium was RPMI containing 1% Casamino Acids that had been depleted of cations with Chelex 100 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, filter sterilized, and supplemented with 25 M ZnCl 2 , 25 M MnCl 2 , 100 M CaCl 2 , and 1 mM MgCl 2 (all from Fisher) to restore noniron cations, 1.5 mM EDDHA to chelate any remaining free iron, and 2.5 g/ml of recombinant purified hemoglobin as the sole iron source. For IsdB variants (Fig. 6D) , S. aureus strains were streaked onto tryptic soy agar containing 10 g/ml chloramphenicol and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C. A single colony was resuspended in 120 l RPMI containing 1 M EDDHA (prepared fresh in 0.1 M NaOH) and 5 g/ml chloramphenicol. Then, 100 l was added to 2 ml of RPMI containing 1 M EDDHA and 5 g/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 37°with shaking in aeration tubes for 8 h. The OD 600 was measured for each culture and normalized to 1, and 5 l was used to inoculate 2 ml of RPMI containing 1 M EDDHA, 5 g/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 nM hemoglobin or no hemoglobin (for ΔisdB pOS1 P lgt isdB). Growth was monitored every 12 h by removing 50 l of culture and adding to 150 l PBS to measure the OD 600 with path length correction in a BioTek plate reader, with the background subtracted from the corrected OD 600 values. Growth using hemoglobin as a sole iron source in both assays is IsdB dependent (11, 13, 22) . Cloning of isdB. The full-length coding sequences of IsdB were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion 2ϫ high-fidelity master Mix (Thermo); cells were treated with 20 g of lysostaphin (AMBI Products, Lawrence, NY), and DNA was isolated with a Wizard genomic DNA extraction kit (Promega, Madison, WI). S. aureus isdB (NWMN_1040) was amplified using primers JC343/344, S. schweitzeri isdB (ERS140239_01018) using primers JC218/219, and S. argenteus isdB (SAMSHR1132_09750) using primers JC216/217. Each primer pair included homology to pOS1 P lgt digested with NdeI and BamHI-HF (NEB), and PCR products were ligated to pOS1 P lgt with Hi-Fi assembly (NEB), transformed into E. coli DH5␣, and reisolated with a Mini-prep (Thermo). All plasmids were sequence confirmed by Sanger sequencing (GeneWiz). Plasmids were transformed into RN4220 by electroporation, reisolated, and transformed into S. aureus Newman ΔisdB::erm by electroporation. S. aureus IsdB site-directed mutagenesis. pOS1 P lgt isdB aureus was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis by PCR with a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). Primer pairs with desired mutation were used to create Q162R (primers JC315/316), S170T (primers 317/318) and Q162R;S170T (primers JC319/ 320). PCR products were transformed to DH5␣. Plasmids were isolated and subjected to Sanger sequencing with primers JC228/229 (GeneWiz) to identify successful incorporation of the desired mutation. Plasmids were transformed into RN4220 by electroporation, reisolated, and transformed into S. aureus Newman ΔisdB::erm by electroporation. Quantification and statistical analysis. Specific statistical details for each experiment can be found in the corresponding figure legends. Data analysis and statistical tests were performed in Prism 6 (GraphPad).
