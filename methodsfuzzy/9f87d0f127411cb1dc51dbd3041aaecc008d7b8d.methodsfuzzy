The composite likelihood method, which finds the composite likelihood surface of recombination rate, inferred non-zero recombination rates for all simulated datasets (see Supplementary Fig. S4 ), revealing some degree of susceptibility to both temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. A windowbased approach of this test shows a sharp increase in the recombination rate estimated within 300 nucleotide windows around nucleotide 21000, close to the breakpoint inferred by GARD (see Supplementary Fig. S5 ). We recovered a qualitatively similar pattern when analyzing empirically simulated sequences. It is important to note, however, that none of the simulated data, even under extreme heterogeneity, reproduced the same scale of the estimated recombination rate. Although in MERS-CoV data, the majority of 300 nucleotide windows after position 23000 have a recombination rate per base consistently higher than 0.005, only data simulated under extreme rate heterogeneity approach values as high as that. In addition to the apparently higher recombination rate in regions with higher rates, we expect rate heterogeneity to produce a higher density of polymorphic sites in regions that are evolving faster. This is quite obvious in empirically simulated data with 3-fold rate heterogeneity-the region with higher rate also contains, on average, more polymorphic loci per window in the last third of the 'genome' than the first 20 kb (see Supplementary Fig. S6 ). We only see hints of this in the actual MERS-CoV genome, with an apparent decline in polymorphism density from positions 5000 to 15000 which resembles that of the simulated data with 1.3-fold rate heterogeneity.
