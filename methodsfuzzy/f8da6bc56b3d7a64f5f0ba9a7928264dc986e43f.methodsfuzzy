Bacterial strains and construction of expression clones. All chimeric toxins in this study were produced by expression from recombinant plasmids in Escherichia coli BW27784 (araFGH pCP18-araE [37] ). This strain does not metabolize arabinose and constitutively expresses the arabinose transporter, and therefore a uniform degree of induction occurs in all cells of a culture at any arabinose concentration. To produce the expression strains, genes encoding native-length CTB or carboxy-terminally extended CTB tagged with a glycosylation-sulfation signal (24) followed by a hexahistidine peptide were cloned on compatible plasmids with different selectable markers and inducible promoters. These encoded resistance to ampicillin (Ap) with the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter or resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) and the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter, along with the regulator araC. Variants of these CTB clones were also made with G33D substitutions that eliminate GM 1 binding. A separate plasmid (pSlacbadCTA) selectable with spectinomycin (Sp) and compatible (with a pSC101 origin) with both ctxB plasmids was used to independently express the ctxA gene under control of both the lac and araBAD promoters. Each expression strain thus contained three plasmids, encoding a native CTB subunit (wt or G33D variant, Ap, and lac promoter), a GSH6-tagged CTB subunit (G33D or wt, Cm, and ara promoter), and the wt CTA subunit (Sp and ara and lac promoters). Details of construction, including full DNA sequences, are available on request. Plasmids created or used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Plasmids pAlacCTB and pAlacCTB G33D encode Ap resistance and the wt and G33D native-length variants of CTB, respectively, under control of the lac promoter and have previously been published as pLMP1 and pLMP148, respectively (38) . Carboxy-terminally linker-hexahistidine-tagged variants of CTB and CTB-G33D were made in a compatible Cm r arabinoseinducible vector, pAR3 (39), using the hexa-His tag from pT7sh6 (40) and a glycine-rich repeat from the M13 phage PIII protein, encoding XX (EX) 4 XDPRVPSS (where X is GGGS) inserted between residues 102 and 103 of CTB. Initial experiments to make wt and CTB-G33D mixed pentamers were done using these plasmids, but we saw significant proteolysis of the polyglycine linker-tagged variants, and subsequent experiments were done with variants that had the linker replaced with the GSH6 tag-pCbadCTBGSH6 and pCbadCTB G33D GSH6. Toxin expression and purification. A 400-ml LB culture at 30°C was inoculated with a 1/8 volume of an overnight culture with appropriate antibiotic selection (Sp and Ap at 100 g/ml and Cm at 25 g/ml) and grown to an A 600 of 1.2, when it was induced with 400 M IPTG and 0.0005% l-arabinose with incubation continued overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by mixing for 20 min at room temperature with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and Elugent detergent (EMD Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA) to 2%. Viscosity was reduced by sonication four times (10 s each) on ice, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min in an SS34 rotor. Toxin was purified from the supernatants by Talon chromatography as detailed by the manufacturer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Imidazole eluates were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (buffer A). All chromatographic separations were conducted on an Akta purifier (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) in 4.6-mm by 100-mm Poros perfusion chromatography columns packed with Poros HS 20 cation exchange medium or Poros HQ 20 anion exchange medium. For cation exchange, the column was equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) buffer A and washed with 5 CV buffer A after sample loading. Bound material was eluted with 10 CV of a linear gradient of 0 to 100% buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1M NaCl). For anion exchange, the column was equilibrated with 5 CV buffer A, washed with 5 CV of buffer A after sample loading, and was eluted with a 40-CV (initial separation) or 10-CV (second purification) linear gradient of 0 to 100% buffer B. Anion exchange fractions were pooled and concentrated using Microcon Ultracel YM-10 filter devices (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Ganglioside GM 1 ELISA. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with 50 l of 2-fold serial dilutions of ganglioside GM 1 (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS, starting at 150 nM, and then blocked with 10% horse serum in PBS. All steps were performed at 37°C for 1 h, after which samples were aspirated off and wells were washed three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. Each holotoxin was assayed in triplicate by incubating 100 l of 50-ng/ml holotoxin per well (approximately 60 fmol), followed by 1/5,000 rabbit anti-cholera toxin B subunit (B10) and then 1/2,000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL), followed by o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich), and the reaction was stopped with 3 M HCl. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. Y1 assay. Mouse Y1 adrenal cells (ATCC CCL-79) were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere in RPMI medium with 5% fetal bovine serum with 1ϫ penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 96-well plates were seeded with 10 4 cells per well. One-hundredmicroliter volumes of 2-fold serial dilutions of toxins were added to semiconfluent monolayers and incubated overnight, followed by scoring for toxin-induced rounding. One unit of toxin was defined as the amount contained in the last dilution giving 75 to 100% rounding of cells. T84 cells and electrophysiology. Measurements of short-circuit current (I sc ) on monolayers (0.33-cm 2 inserts) of the polarized human intestinal cell line T84 were performed as previously described (41) .
