Chronically isolated ileal (Thiry-Vella) loops were prepared as described by Keren et al. ( 1975) . Female New Zealand White specific pathogen free rabbits weighing 2-3 kg were fasted for 12-18 h prior to surgery. Each was anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of ketamine HCl (Ketaset. Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) and 20 mg/kg xylazine (Anased, Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA) i.m., followed by a mixture of 50 mg/kg ketamine HCl and 10 mg/kg xylazine i.m. as needed (about every 20-30 min). Following a midline incision, 15 cm of ileum containing the most distal Peyer's patch was surgically isolated by transecting the intestine proximal and distal to the segment. While the mesentery was cut to permit movement of the excised segment, care was taken to insure that the blood supply to the segment was left intact. Continuity of the intestine was restored by end-to-end anastamosis using con- tinuous 4-O silk sutures. Two tubes (Silastic type, Dow Coming, Midland, MI) were sewn into the ends of the isolated segment using a purse string suture of 4-O silk (Deknatel, Queens Village. NY) and then anchored to the body wall with 3-O silk (Deknatel) upon closing. Both access tubes were brought through a subcutaneous tunnel and exteriorized at the nape of the neck. A plastic, Elizabethan-style collar was used to prevent the rabbit from damaging the tubes.
