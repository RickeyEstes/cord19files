This study conducted a literature review to design the conceptual model regarding the use of social media in supporting SMEs business processes. The stages of research can be seen in Fig. 4 . The study begins with problem formulation. In this stage, the researcher aims to find the existence of an association or influence of the use of IT on the performance of an organization. The IT investigated in this study is social media. The problem is formulated based on previous studies about the impact of social media usage on the business processes of an organization or the performance of the business process. After formulating the research, a literature review is conducted. First, the keywords that are used as a "search term" are determined. The search terms in this study are "Social Media, SMEs, Information Technology, Task-Technology Fit, Business Processes, and PCF". The search for previous literature was carried out on a database of scientific publications and displaying search results according to the "search term" used. However, not all studies that match the "search term" could be used as references. The required keywords were not simultaneously used in one search. The authors combined 2 keywords such as "Business Process AND PCF", then reviewed several papers that appear and chose which paper could be used as a reference. Similar processes are done using other keywords such as "Business Process AND Information Technology" or "Business Processes AND Social Media". Finally, the keywords "Business Process AND Social Media AND Task-Technology Fit", are used as search terms combined with "Business Process Performance". To analyze and select the papers, the authors set inclusion and exclusion criteria for the papers. Papers included are those that discuss Social Media in SMEs, or Information Technology that uses Social Media as its object, or the use of social media on the performance of SMEs. The selection process resulted in 17 papers that are used as references in this research. From the paper that has been obtained, the main references to form the conceptual model were paper related to social media functionality [8] , business processes using PCF [4] and information technology [6] . One of the selected references was in the form of books, which became the basis of Task-Technology Fit theory [21] and Business Process Performance theory [12] & [25] . The 17 papers can be classified into several categories, namely the business process category, information technology-social media & social media functionality, SMEs, business process performance measurement, Task-Technology Fit-Business Process-Information Technology. The design of the conceptual model in this study begins with a literature review of the concepts of social media, business process management, and the suitability of the technology used. Based on the data obtained from the literature results, the data are then integrated and analyzed to develop a conceptual model of the suitability of information technology. In this conceptual model, various social media functionalities and management of business processes suitable for SMEs are identified as an indicator of the suitability of IT with the business processes. Indicators of suitability in using information technology are developed based on business process goals in business, user, and business rules. The purpose of this business process is to enable SMEs to focus on business processes in which the performance can be driven by social media to achieve improved business process performance in SMEs.
