A total of 12 patients, including five females and seven males, fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included receiving a single short-course of corticosteroid medication within the three years prior to presentation, ONFH identified by typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, stage 1 or 2 by the Ficat classification system and no previous treatment of the femoral head (9) . The exclusion criteria for sampling were the history or evidence of metabolic bone diseases, including hyper-or hypoparathyroidism, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy and the presence of cancers with bone metastasis. In total, 12 healthy volunteers, including five females and seven males, were enrolled in the control group. Peripheral venous blood (5 ml) was drawn from each patient in the Outpatient Department or in the procedure room prior to general anesthesia for total hip replacement. The blood samples were processed to collect serum and stored at -80˚C until analysis. Serum sample preparation. Blood samples (3 ml) from each subject were collected in a drying tube early in the morning and allowed to clot for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 15 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was dispensed into 0.5 ml aliquots and stored at -80˚C until use. All the serum samples were processed according to a standard protocol.
