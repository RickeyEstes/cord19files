Two independent generic PCR assays were used for the detection of members of the family Adenoviridae. A panAdVHex nested PCR that amplified one of the seven hypervariable regions of the hexon gene and had previously been using for human AdVs genotyping was used for screening of samples [30, 31] . Five µL of nucleic acids extracted were added to 45 µL of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 mM each of dNTPs (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), 60 pmol of each primer and 2.5 U AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ, USA). Cycling conditions were: 95 °C-4 min and 40 cycles, 95 °C-30 s, 50 °C-2 min, 72 °C-30 s. For nested reactions, same reagents and cycling conditions were used. Amplified products (~768 bp) were visualized following 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. To increase the phylogenetic accuracy, a panAdVPol hemi-nested PCR assay targeting a taxonomical informative fragment of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene (DNApol) was designed and used. Five µL of extract was added to 20 µL of reaction mixture (LightCycler 480, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 10 pmol of the primers pol-F (5'GTIGCRAAIGAICCRTAGAGGGC 3') and pol-R (5'GTTTAYGAYATITGYGGMATGTAYGC 3'). The amplification conditions were: 95 °C-5 min, followed by 45 cycles, 95 °C-15 s, 57 °C-2 min, 68 °C-30 s. For heminested reactions, 2 µL of the previously amplified DNA and 10 pmol of the primers pol-F2 (5'AAIGAICCRTAGAGGGCRTTKGA 3') and pol-R were added to a reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mM each of dNTPs and 1.25 U AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase. The amplification conditions were: 95 °C-5 min, followed by a two-step-cycle of 95 °C-15 sec and 62 °C-2 min 45 times. Amplified products (~450 bp) were visualized following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Two independent generic PCR assays were used for the detection of members of the family Adenoviridae. A panAdVHex nested PCR that amplified one of the seven hypervariable regions of the hexon gene and had previously been using for human AdVs genotyping was used for screening of samples [30, 31] . Five µL of nucleic acids extracted were added to 45 µL of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8. Amplified products (~768 bp) were visualized following 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. To increase the phylogenetic accuracy, a panAdVPol hemi-nested PCR assay targeting a taxonomical informative fragment of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene (DNApol) was designed and used. Five µL of extract was added to 20 µL of reaction mixture (LightCycler 480, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 10 pmol of the primers pol-F (5'GTIGCRAAIGAICCRTAGAGGGC 3') and pol-R (5'GTTTAYGAYATITGYGGMATGTAYGC 3'). The amplification conditions were: 95 • C-5 min, followed by 45 cycles, 95 • C-15 s, 57 • C-2 min, 68 • C-30 s. For heminested reactions, 2 µL of the previously amplified DNA and 10 pmol of the primers pol-F2 (5'AAIGAICCRTAGAGGGCRTTKGA 3') and pol-R were added to a reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.2 mM each of dNTPs and 1.25 U AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase. The amplification conditions were: 95 • C-5 min, followed by a two-step-cycle of 95 • C-15 s and 62 • C-2 min 45 times.
