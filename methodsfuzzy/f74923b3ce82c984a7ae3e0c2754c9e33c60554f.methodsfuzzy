Patients and samples. Samples were collected from 80 patients categorized as suspected or probable SARS cases (according to WHO guidelines adopted at the time) during an outbreak at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, China, between 1 and 3 April 2003. Further samples were collected from 40 patients categorized as suspected or probable SARS cases from the New Territories East cluster of hospitals in Hong Kong between 11 and 23 April 2003. Samples were primarily nasopharyngeal aspirates, but also included nasal swabs, rectal swabs, throat swabs, throat aspirates, and a peritoneal swab. Preparation of cDNA. Total RNA from samples was isolated using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript II RNase H À Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 300 ng random hexamer primers were used in place of oligo ðdTÞ 12-18 and nuclease-free water was used in place of RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor. Primers and probes. A variety of primers and probes for conventional and real-time PCR were used (Table 1) . For comparison purposes primer sets described by the Bernard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany (BNIoutAs/BNIoutS2 and SARS1s/SARS1as), and the Government Virus Unit, Hong Kong SAR, China (COR-1/COR-2), were used. A new set of primers and probe for conventional and TaqMan real-time PCR were derived based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of the Tor2 SARS-CoV isolate (GenBank Accession No. AY274119). Conventional PCR. In a total volume of 25 ll, the following components were mixed: nuclease-free water, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 U Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1Â PCR buffer, primers (10 lM), and cDNA template ($100 ng). The PCR amplification was performed in a MasterCycler (Eppendorf) with the following temperature profile: after denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 10 s (1°C reduction after each cycle), and 72°C for 20 s were carried out, followed by a further 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 56°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis at constant current ($24 mA) on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide. TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. In a total volume of 25 ll, the following components were mixed: nuclease-free water, 12.5 ll of 2Â qPCR mastermix (Eurogentec EGT Group, Seraing, Belgium) (comprising 0.2 mM each dATP, dCTP and dGTP and 0.4 mM dUTP, HotStart Taq DNA polymerase, MgCl 2 , uracil-N-glycosylase, and passive reference), primer C (10 lM), primer D (10 lM), probe E (10 lM), and cDNA template ($50 ng). The real-time amplification was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) with the following temperature profile: after initial incubation at 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 58°C for 1 min were performed. Enhanced real-time PCR. A novel real-time PCR assay was developed. The salient feature of this new assay is the use of the amplification product from an initial round of conventional PCR as the template for a second round of TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR (using the amplification profiles described above) to increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV detection. The same primers were used for the initial pre-amplification by conventional PCR and the real-time PCR stages. Sequencing. The products of the amplification reaction were sequenced to ensure that the amplicons corresponded to the intended target sequence. Sequencing reactions were performed using a commercially available sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequences were obtained by resolving the sequencing reactions with the 373A sequencer system (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences were analyzed using the BLAST sequence comparison tool available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Viral culture and isolation. Specimens were inoculated on Vero cell monolayers and examined daily over 14 days for the presence of cytopathic effects (CPE). Cell cultures showing CPE were passaged to another Vero cell monolayer where they showed the same CPE within 2 days of incubation. In addition, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using primers COR-1 and COR-2 (Table 1 ) was used to examine the supernatants of positive cell cultures.
