The ATS has recommended standardization of the test using criteria including rapid inspiration, inspired volume at least 90% of largest VC, breath-hold time between 9 and 11 seconds, and adequate washout and sample volumes. The mean of the acceptable tests is reported; if more than two tests are performed, the mean of all acceptable tests is reported. Calculations are standardized for breath-hold time and adjusted for dead space, gas collection conditions, and carbon dioxide concentration. Reproducibility of the two acceptable tests should be within 10% or 3 mL/min per mm Hg (at standard temperature, pressure, and dry [conditions] [STPD]), whichever is larger. When the ratio of DL CO to alveolar volume (DL CO /VA) is reported, DL CO is at STPD and VA is at BTPS.
