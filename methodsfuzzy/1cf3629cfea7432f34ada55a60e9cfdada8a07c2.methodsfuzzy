All patients were evaluated by emergency physicians using a structured recording form designed by the principal investigators. Items in the questionnaire included baseline demographic data, travel and contact history, the occurrence and time sequence of various symptoms before presentation to the ED, ancillary laboratory tests, and chest radiography. Details of the occurrence of each of the 8 symptom items were obtained and recorded. Lower respiratory symptoms included cough and shortness of breath. Diarrhea included loose stool. Because symptoms after hospitalization could be modified by various treatments, they were not recorded.
