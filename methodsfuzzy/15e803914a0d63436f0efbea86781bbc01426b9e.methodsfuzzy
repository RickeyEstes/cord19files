Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions. Escherichiu coli $097 (Nakayama et al., 1988) and S. typhimurium strains x3730 and x3987 were used. Plasmid pYA292 (usd+ ZucZa) ) of 3.5 kb was used to express TGEV antigens as fusion proteins with the amino-terminus of pgalactosidase. Both E. coli $XY27 and S. typhimurium x3730, used as intermediate strains, were previously transformed with lucP+ plasmids kzmR+ F' ( Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985) or fep' pYA232 (Nakayama et al., 1988) , respectively, in order to regulate expression of recombinant products from pYA292-derived plasmids. In this strain expression was induced with isopropyl /3-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma) 1mM. S. typhimurium ,y450!9 was generated from x3987 by introducing into the chromosome of this strain a gene conferring resistance to rifampicin (Curtiss, unpublished data) . All bacterial strains were grown aerobically at 37" on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or broth and when appropriate, kanamycin (50 pg/ml), tetracycline ( 15 p/ml), rifampicin (50 pg/ml) or DAP (50 pg/ml) (Sigma) were added.
