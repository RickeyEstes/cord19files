Well before the Mendelian laws of heredity were formulated and molecular biology evolved to become the highly advanced discipline it currently represents, major congenital malformations, for example, Siamese twins, anencephaly, hygromas, and massive edema, were surely not oblivious to observers of the time. By their very monstrosity, these malformations gave birth to interpretations varying in degrees of fantasy. More important, they provided material for disease classification and opened the avenue for the study of embryonic development. First, in embryologic studies in rodents and birds and, later, drosophila, it became evident that interactions of immense complexity were required to allow for the organization of 3 embryonic layers based upon a central common blueprint that included bilateral symmetry and apico-caudal development. Recent investigations dissected part of this complex developmental process and have led to the discovery of the role of some important constitutional genes conserved throughout evolution, such as HOX and TBX1 [1] . This gave birth to the recognition of the critical role of germline mutations as the cause of malformations, such as spina bifida, palatine division, holoprosencephaly, and DiGeorge syndrome. This initial step was essential as it enabled one to distinguish the embryo and malformative embryopathies, for example, DiGeorge syndrome, from the fetus and acquired, not inherited, deforming "dysruption sequence" fetopathies, for example, digital contractures and or amputations stemming from amniotic bands. As well, it served to establish a chronologic distinction between malformation and deformation and a simple manner in which to study their diverse etiologies. Later, the systematic practice of autopsies in infants revealed the unexpected incidence of severe malformations, especially those affecting organs in which development was complex, such as the brain, heart, and kidney. In 1900, a trilocular heart was the first specimen and centerpiece of the Maude Abbott collection of congenital heart disease cases at McGill University (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Dr Abbott was one of the first pediatric pathologists. The museum she founded was based on the pioneering works of Sir William Osler. This specimen was the first of many that, in time, facilitated the formulation of a cohesive classification of congenital heart defects and provided a foundation for the design of corrective surgical procedures. After Dr Abbott, Dr Frederick W. Wiglesworth, a distinguished pathologist at the Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Quebec, Canada), maintained and continuously added to the collection from 1946 until 1972. The descriptions of the malformations corroborated those occasionally made by adult pathologists and later by radiologists using ultrasound. Benefiting from a superior technology, the latter demonstrated not only the frequency but also the latency that attends to some conditions, such as single umbilical artery, ureterocele, and annular pancreas. Rapidly, the extension of the Mendelian laws of genetics to man illustrated that alterations of the genetic message affected not only the initial development of an organ and intimate cell organization but also, and perhaps, more important, the subsequent steps of synthesis and degradation of molecules that are essential for normal ontogeny. In 1908, Sir Archibald Garrod, an English (London) physician and chemist, delivered the Croonian Lecture before the Royal College of Physicians entitled "Inborn Errors of Metabolism." This represented an innovative chapter in medical history, one which made possible an understanding of a number of relatively rare human diseases [2] . Alcaptonuria, albinism, pentosuria, and cystinosis were the first disorders to be recognized, thereby, illustrating the novel and informative role of pediatrics and chemistry in the description of new conditions. A mutation may affect a gene implicated in the metabolism of a metal (iron, copper), an enzymatic activity (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), a protein (hemoglobin, dystrophin), a polysaccharide, a lipid, or an intermediary molecule, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. The clinical expression of these "monogenic diseases" is quite varied, depending chiefly upon the tissue distribution of the gene product, the nature (site or magnitude) of the mutation, and the role played by the affected molecule in cellular metabolism. Thus, mutations of a mitochondrial gene involved in the respiratory chain are often expressed at birth, whereas those affecting the structure or metabolism of some amino acids (phenylalanine) or sugars (galactose) manifest months or even years postnatally. Such monogenic diseases have been regarded as "errors of nature," confirmed by the identification of an abnormal and sometimes measurable protein, the occasional success of substitutive therapy and the phenotype of "knockout" mice for the gene under study. These conditions, in some instances, may be diagnosed at birth or in utero. Appropriately treated, some patients survive to adulthood, for example, cystic fibrosis and α-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Study of the diverse expression of these disorders contributed original information related to the secrets of molecular metabolism and revealed unsuspected alternative pathways. Without cystic fibrosis, the role of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator might never have been discovered [3] . In short, this class of diseases, discussed in the previous paragraphs, was born essentially in the domain of pediatrics and now occupies an important place that has led to the creation of specialized services in childrens' hospitals. In a recent 2245-page, 2-volume excellent and monumental textbook edited by Enid Gilbert-Barness entitled Potter's pathology of the fetus, infant and child, nearly a hundred pages were devoted to "metabolic diseases" [4] . This multiauthored textbook was the product of years of acquired information, building on the original work of Edith L. Potter in 1952. Commensurate with the development of pediatric pathology as a specialty and, indeed, a culture, a number of pediatric pathology societies evolved. As the societies took form, journals, textbooks, and fellowship training programs in pediatric pathology took root. In 1990, the American Board of Pathology offered its first examination in the newly declared subspecialty of pediatric pathology. Pediatrics made a significant contribution to diseases stemming from chromosomal abnormalities. In 1959, Jérôme Lejeune, a pediatrician and geneticist in Paris, and colleagues [5] reported that Down syndrome was associated with trisomy of chromosome 21. This landmark discovery opened a new chapter in pediatrics, medicine, and genetics and shed light on the origin of a certain number of genetic conditions to be described in the coming years. The documentation of a monosomic deletion or translocation based on a peripheral blood leukocyte or skin and/or fascia lata fibroblast culture karyotype subsequently opened antenatal diagnosis (amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling), enabling one to localize and analyze genes in the fetus and infant. In due course, these techniques and others were applied to infantile and adult tumor pathology. Rapidly, it became evident that light microscopic chromosomal anomalies were but one expression of major genetic anomalies in which invisible, more subtle lesions are represented by mutations, deletions, repetitive sequences, and others. These genetic alterations might impact not only on structural genes but also and often on regulatory genes and those encoding transcription factors. Genetic studies conducted essentially in plants and animals permitted one to develop and perfect techniques capable of exploring the genetic polymorphisms of an individual, for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms, to analyze the 3 million base pairs that constitute the human genome and to isolate some of the 25 000 to 30 000 human genes to establish the correlations between variations of genotype and different expressions of phenotype. Because these techniques require only a tiny amount of genetic material, they are widely applicable in pediatrics where they have demonstrated their value in discovering unexpected genetic variations and aberrations. Although these techniques are tedious and labor intensive, they are capable of detecting fetal DNA (3%-6% levels) in the maternal circulation [6] . Today, the infant, generally spared of noxious environmental events, has proved to be an important field of study. As an example, it has been established that mutations of CARD15, a gene that normally encodes for NOD2, a protein expressed by macrophages involved in the recognition of microbial agents, are implicated in the etiology of Crohn's disease [7] . Along the same line, it has been established that certain HLA groups, such as DQ2/DQ8, are frequently associated with celiac disease in infants [8] . Therein could reside a potential approach to the complex polygenetic conditions of adulthood. Again, diseases in the infant and child are a rich field of study for conditions that affect adults. As well, across the extreme polymorphism of the human genome, the notion has arisen that some genetic sequences may act as biomarkers for exquisite drug hypersensitivity and explain isolated and undesirable severe drug reactions stemming from a genetic inability to properly metabolize the drug [9] . It is our conviction that, in some instances, pediatrics and many of its diseases offer excellent models that allow for a better understanding of conditions of unknown pathogenesis. Four are cited. (a) Mutations in FOX P3 (Xp11.23) have been identified in a rare and lethal pediatric syndrome called IPEX (immunodeficiency, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) characterized by diverse autoimmune phenomena. The scurfy mouse, described in 1959, shares many similarities with boys with IPEX. In murine studies, FoxP3 is normally expressed by regulatory CD4 + /CD25 + T cells that contribute to the maintenance of immune tolerance. Interestingly, FoxP3 is overexpressed in nonrejected allografts, confirming its tolerogenic role, thereby providing a new approach to monitor allograft rejection [10] . (b) Robert P. Bolande, a creative pediatric and experimental pathologist, presented in 1974 [11] and redefined in molecular terms in 1997 [12] , a novel, groundbreaking concept: "the neurocristopathies." Among a diverse group of afflictions, he recognized a common thread: the affected tissues were derived from the neural crest. Some of these conditions included neuroectodermal tumors, certain endocrine tumoral syndromes, Hirschprung's disease, and a syndrome of dysautonomia with congenital central hypoventilation, known as Ondine's curse. The recent discovery of mutations in PHOX2B that controls the expression of the RET gene, more directly implicated in familial forms of Hirschprung's disease and the tumoral syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A/B, has given a molecular confirmation to Ondine's curse and Bolande's prophetic conceptualization [13, 14] . (c) Progeria of Hutchinson-Gilford, characterized by infantile premature aging, is associated with anomalies in the nuclear membrane linked to mutations in LMN (laminin and nuclear antigen) that encodes for progerine. This protein can be identified in fibroblast cultures from older individuals, thereby, opening an avenue of novel research on aging [15] . (d) Most of the chondrodysplasias, from achondroplasia to dyschondrosteosis, and certain acromegalic dysplasias have been found to have an original molecular signature, illustrating that different mutations of the same gene can produce variable phenotypes. If the molecular approach brings many new elements to the evaluation of susceptibility factors and the distinction between those innate and acquired, the impact of the environment, nutritional deficiencies, and deplorable socioeconomic conditions have not been consistently included in these studies: these factors are likely to impact on development of the embryo and fetus as well. Retrospective epidemiologic studies revealed that infants with retarded fetal growth and small for gestational age appear to be at increased risk for metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis, and psychiatric disorders later in life [16] . Other epidemiologic studies, as well as animal studies based on the ligature of the uterine arteries, have tended to support this association. Once more, this illustrates that certain diseases of adults take root in utero, as supported by the ultrasound finding of thickening of the aortic arch in the fetus and infants with development delay [17] . A systematic study of blood lipids in 599 adolescents discovered 2 children with unsuspected familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition, in a number of children, the serum lipid levels were abnormal, and this opened the debate about using screening tests in adolescents [18] . These represent additional unexpected contributions of pediatrics and pediatric pathology to adult pathology and preventive medicine.
