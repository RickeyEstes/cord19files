Besides 1 H-STD-NMR spectroscopy, more NMR methods have been developed for the analysis of protein-templated DCLs. Claridge and Schofield reported the use of two NMR methods to analyze DCLs with proteins as template for the first time, namely, 11 B-NMR spectroscopy and 1 H-waterLOGSY. 19 Using these NMR techniques, ternary complexes of enzyme, boronic acids, and sugars in the DCLs were monitored to identify binders of a-chymotrypsin. The 11 B nucleus is quadrupolar (I Â¼ 3/2), which can be exploited to determine the hybridization state of the boron atom: an 11 B nucleus in an sp 2 -hybridized trigonal planar environment exhibits relatively broad peaks compared with an 11 B nucleus in a highly symmetrical sp 3 -hybridized tetrahedral environment, which gives much sharper peaks. 20 Although 11 B-NMR spectroscopy enables the direct observation of the boronate-enzyme complexes and is free from protein background signals, it is far from optimal for the analysis of DCLs. The 11 B-NMR signals are broad, causing boronic acids with similar structures to overlap. Additionally, 11 B-NMR spectroscopy suffers from low intrinsic sensitivity, which necessitates the use of high concentrations of boronic acids and protein to compensate for the loss in signal. 1 H-waterLOGSY 21 features better sensitivity than 11 B-NMR spectroscopy. First, magnetization of the bulk H 2 O in the sample takes place, and after a variety of different transfer mechanisms, small molecules that interact with the target protein are detected. The protein concentration can be very low, but 1 H-waterLOGSY 21 can be limited by the exchange kinetics of the reversibly formed protein-ligand complexes and might still suffer from overlapping signals, especially for large DCLs. In 2013, the same group introduced a competition-based 1 H-NMR method to screen binders for human 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)dependent oxygenases. 22 Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases, specifically prolyl hydroxylase domain containing enzyme isoform 2 (PHD2) and factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), were used as model systems for this study. The natural cosubstrate 2OG was used as a reporter ligand, and in order to block enzyme-catalyzed 2OG turnover and to avoid oxidation of diamagnetic Fe(II), the native Fe(II) was substituted by paramagnetic and catalytically inactive Zn(II). When a competitive binder displaces bound 2OG from the binding site into the bulk solution, the unbound 2OG is observed via 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. By monitoring the intensity of the reporter signal as a function of inhibitor concentration, it is also possible to obtain dissociation constants (K d ). As a proof-of-principle study, the boronic acid scaffold and some diol hits from a previous study 23 using dynamic combinatorial MS (DCMS; see section "Dynamic combinatorial MS") were subjected to the competitive NMR analysis. The results obtained are in agreement with the nondenaturing DCMS results. The competition-based 1 H-NMR technique only uses substoichiometric amounts of unlabeled protein and has additional advantages over other ligand-based NMR techniques: site-specific binding information and K d values for ligands with both high and low affinity can be obtained.
