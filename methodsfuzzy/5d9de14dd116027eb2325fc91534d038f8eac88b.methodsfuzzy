Traditional tools of outbreak detection have been designed to operate in two separate stagesFwith an automatic, computational component in which red flags are raised in the case of a coming outbreak, followed by a distinct humananalyst component in which a person considers the recommendation of the machine and responds by enacting public health responses or dismissing the particular flag as being of low priority or concern. However, we believe that the most effective systems will integrate the input of computational tools with that of human decision makers. Autonomous components of a surveillance system could constantly analyse and organize vast quantities of otherwise overwhelming data, and present the results to a human analyst in ways that may highlight possible anomalies, allowing the analyst to decide which of these directions may be most valuable to pursue. Novel methods for such tools are currently under development within the newly rising field of visual analytics (http://nvac.pnl.gov/, http://www.purdue. edu/discoverypark/vaccine/research/vaat.php), 16, 30 and we eagerly anticipate further developments in these areas. We believe that these methods will provide drastically more effective tools for biosurveillance. Expanding the roles of autonomous methods leading to truly self-organizing systems for outbreak detection Many of the complications inherent in determining an a priori, human understanding-based definition of 'outbreak' may, in fact, be irrelevant. As with many fields of data mining, we believe that there may be vast, untapped potential in the idea of using historical data, not to set thresholds (whether static or dynamic), the violation of which would constitute an outbreak, but instead as training data, that is, data used for sensitivity calibration by a detection algorithm. By introducing concepts of machine learning, it may be that we can allow software to decide where the most useful signals of incipient outbreaks lie in the available data. This can be carried out by providing only the data and points in time during which human analysts concluded 'manually' that outbreak conditions were present. Using these methods may lead to surprising and counterintuitive definitions of an outbreak (perhaps having nothing to do with any signal of understood biological relevance). Yet, for practical purposes, it would be unlikely to matter, so long as the detection algorithm arrived at by the autonomous system provided consistent, sensitive, specific warnings of coming outbreaks. Furthermore, the exploration of autonomous systems need not lie only in the definition of an outbreak itself. As the heterogeneity of data sources increases, it may be that a similarly automated dynamic weighting method for assessing the relative contribution to overall signal strength from each data source could lead to a far more sophisticated and sensitive system for outbreak detection. Again, along the same lines, the underlying topology of data sources could be autonomously explored, allowing clustering algorithms to be applied over different configurations of both time and space. These methods could reveal previously concealed travel patterns, or mechanisms of contaminationFor even perhaps cultural similarities that enable enhanced transmission of an infectious agent. Each of these potentially critical facets, contributing to the spread of infection, would need to be understood and defined manually under the current detection systems; however, by allowing dynamic methods of ongoing machine learning to operate, we may be able to enhance our ability to detect outbreaks while potentially furthering our understanding of the contributing factors driving the disease dynamics. A fully autonomous system, allowed to learn by continual, dynamic exploration of the complete space of incoming surveillance data, could be a prototype for a very powerful self-organizing surveillance system.
