2.1. Animals and tissue processing 302 cats were routinely necropsied at the Department of Veterinary Pathology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany. Tissues for histologic and immunohistologic examination were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Furthermore, femoral bone marrow was collected for DNA extraction, embedded in Tissue Tek ® O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek Europe B. V., Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands), immediately frozen and stored at −72 • C. If required for diagnostic purposes, appropriate tissue specimens were transferred for microbiological, parasitological or viral examination. The animals were sent as corpses from variable sources in Germany (owners, practitioners, private veterinary hospitals, university veterinary hospitals) for diagnostic purposes. They all were included in the study continuously and independently from history, breed, age, origin and diagnoses in the period from May 2002 to December 2003. Supplied information on animals and case histories often was poor and not always reliable. Especially information on previous serological FeLV test results and vaccination status was supplied only infrequently. Immunohistologically FeLV-positive cats, which all were U3-positive (see below) as well, were regarded as productively FeLV-infected. Antigen-negative cats with detectable provirus (U3) in bone marrow samples are referred to as non-productively FeLV-infected, whereas antigen-and provirus-negative cats are classified as FeLVnegative.
