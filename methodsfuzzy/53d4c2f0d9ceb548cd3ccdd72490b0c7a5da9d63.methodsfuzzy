Chi-square test was used to test the statistical significance of groups differences. The associations (odds ratio) between different forms of positive and negative impacts, adjusting for demographic factors, were derived using logistic regression analysis methods. Partial correlation coefficients were also calculated to investigate such relationships. SPSS for Windows Release 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for data analyses and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
