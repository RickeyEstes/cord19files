Next, to verify the above predictions, susceptible Balb/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice were immunized with DC-LLO 91-99 , DC-LLO 296-304 , , DC-LLO 189-201 , DC-GAPDH 1-15 , or DC-GAPDH 1-22 together with Advax (50 μg/ml) or were left nonvaccinated (NV). Mice were immunized i.p with a single dose of vaccine and 7 days later were administered a Listeria challenge (see Methods section for procedures). Five days post-challenge, all mice were bled, sacrificed and spleens recovered to count Listeria CFU and analyse immune cell populations ( Fig. 2A and Table 3 ). DC-GAPDH 1-15 and DC-GAPDH 1-22 provided the greatest protection in both Balb/c and C57BL/ 6 mice (~97 and 99%, respectively) ( Fig. 2A) . DC-LLO 91-99 also conferred significant protection in both Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (90 and 93%, respectively). DC-LLO 296-304 vaccine conferred strong protection in C57BL/6 mice (~90%) ( Fig. 2A) but only intermediate levels of protection in Balb/c mice (~60%) (white bars in Fig. 2A) . , and DC-LLO 189-201 vaccines conferred no significant protection in either strain (2 and 5%, respectively). Vaccination efficiency was associated with normal spleen size (images of DC-GAPDH 1-15 vaccine recipients shown in Fig. 2A ) compared with enlarged spleens (images of NV mice in Fig. 2A ) and granulomatous livers of non-vaccinated mice (data not shown). We also evaluated several immunological parameters induced by the most protective DC vaccines. DC-GAPDH 1-15 and DC-GAPDH 1-22 vaccines were found to induce the highest frequencies of IFN-γ-producing CD8 + T cells in both C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice (4.0-4.2%, respectively) followed by DC-LLO 91-99 vaccine with 3.0% frequency as assessed by FACS using H2-K b :Ig-peptide dimers or 2.16% frequency using H2-L d :Ig-peptide dimers (right plot in Fig. 2B ). DC-LLO 296-304 vaccine induced very low 0.87% CD8 + T cell frequencies in C57BL/6 mice and undetectable frequencies in Balb/c mice (DC-LLO 296-304 bars in Fig. 2B ). Only DC-GAPDH 1-15 and DC-GAPDH 1-22 vaccines induced detectable numbers of IFN-γ producing peptide-specific CD4 + T cells (1.05 and 1.76%, respectively) ( Fig. 2B show C57BL/6 data, values in Balb/c were 1.05 and 1.76%). In summary, our results with DC-GAPDH vaccines confirmed that CD8 + T cell responses were more relevant than CD4 + T cell responses for Listeria protection. GAPDH 1-15 and GAPDH 1-22 peptides presented high numbers of MHC-I binding epitopes in listeriosis resistant and sensible mice, explaining DC-GAPDH vaccines induced similar CD8 + T cell responses and Th1cytokines in both mice strains. Antibody production and B cell responses seemed to play no role in listeriosis (Pamer, 2004) . However, antibodies against LLO seemed to participate in neutralization of Listeria growth (Edelson and Unanue, 2001) . Here, we confirmed no variation in B cell numbers among nonvaccinated (NV), vaccinated mice (DC vaccines) or non-infected control mice (control) with similar percentages of CD19 + positive cells (Spleen markers rows in Table 3 ). Nevertheless, DC-GAPDH 1-22 (DC-GAPDH 1-22 rows in Table 3 ) or DC-GAPDH 1-15 vaccines (data not shown) produced high levels of anti-GAPDH 1-22 IgM antibodies compared to nonvaccinated mice (NV) that correlated with an increase in the percentages of CD4 + T cells. DC-LLO 91-99 vaccinated mice produced no significant levels of anti-LLO 91-99 IgM antibodies compared to NV and presented low percentages of CD4 + T cells (DC-LLO 91-99 rows in Table 3 ). These data strongly suggested that vaccines conferring the highest protection in listeriosis induced prominent antigen-specific T cell responses and promoted also antigen-specific B cell responses, suggesting a collaborative role of B and T cell responses in listeriosis protection (Edelson and Unanue, 2001; Alvarez-Dominguez et al., 2008; Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014 . Finally, vaccination with DC-GAPDH 1-15 , DC-GAPDH 1-22 or DC-LLO 91-99 vaccine induced high levels of MCP-1, TNF-α and IFN-γ in both mice strains whereas DC-LLO 296-304 vaccine induced only intermediate levels of TNF-α in C57BL/6 mice (DC-LLO 296-304 bars in Fig. 2C ). Only DC-GAPDH 1-15 and DC-GAPDH 1-22 vaccines induced high IL-12 levels, post-challenge, in both mice strains (right plot in Fig. 2C ). DC-LLO 91-99 vaccine induced low but significant levels of IL12 in both mice strains (Kono et al., 2012; Calderon-Gonzalez et al., 2014) . Thus the Listeria T-cell epitope prediction algorithm described in the methods was validated in vivo and shown to predict vaccine effectiveness after Listeria vaccination of low and high susceptibility mice. Advax adjuvant was confirmed to be important to induction of a potent Listeria antigen specific T-cell response, consistent with its ability to enhance vaccine protection in other models including influenza, where it similarly enhanced CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses and Th1 cytokine production . The present results confirm that Advax adjuvant has the ability to induce MHC I cross-presentation of Listeria antigens thereby resulting in activation of Listeria-specific CD8 T cells, although the mechanism by which it might induce cross-presentation is currently unknown. One possibility currently under investigation is that Advax induces cross-presentation via activation of CD4 + T helper cells that signal to upregulate cross-presentation pathways in antigen presenting cells. When considering design of Listeria vaccines, a major advantage of Advax over other potential T-cell adjuvants is its lack of toxicity as evidenced by data from preclinical studies (Lobgis et al., 2010; Cristillo et al., 2011; Eckersley et al., 2011; Layton et al., 2011; Larena et al., 2013; Petrovsky et al., 2013; Saade et al., 2013; Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2014; Feinen et al., 2014; Honda-Okubo et al., 2014 as well as human clinical trials (Gordon et al., 2012 (Gordon et al., , 2014 .
