Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 11 (StataCorp LP). Results are presented as mean Ï® SD or median (interquartile range [IQR] ) with Student t test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate and Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data. The x 2 test was used to compare proportions. Two-sided tests with P , 05 were considered signifi cant, with the exception of data on the frequency of common colds and PCR-positive colds ( P , .025, because this outcome was assessed by two similar methods). The rate difference between the groups for colds was compared using a Poisson regression model adjusted for BMI, atopy, and parity, with a robust option when data were overdispersed. Secondary outcomes were cold severity (analyzed as panel data using Stata's xtreg with random effects and adjusted for baseline CCQ score, BMI, atopy, and parity), impact of colds on asthma, and impact of colds on pregnancy outcomes. We assessed the relationship between PCR-positive colds in asthma and preeclampsia/pregnancyinduced hypertension with logistic regression, adjusting for smoking, parity, age, BMI, and multiple pregnancy. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were used to evaluate different diagnostic cutoff levels for the CCQ score in PCR positive infections (e- Fig 3) . Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to investigate the time to fi rst cold (e- Fig 4) .
