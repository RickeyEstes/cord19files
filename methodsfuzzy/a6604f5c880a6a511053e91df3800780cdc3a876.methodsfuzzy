The search strategy used was adapted from two studies ( Table 1) . 15, 16 All papers with the specified search terms in their titles, abstracts, or keywords were searched for. Focused searches of the following databases were conducted: Medline, Scopus, and PubMed. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for further existing epidemiological reviews, as well as Evidence Aid. Further relevant articles were identified manually from cited references from each selected full-text paper. Data from gray literature were not systematically searched, but sources and advice from key experts were discussed in the accompanying text. Inclusion criteria • Papers published from 1 January 2004 to 30 September 2012. Ahern et al. 15 included studies associated with infectious disease incidence following flooding up to 2004. • Epidemiological studies. • Studies conducted in any country, because Europe experiences a wide range of climate and geographical variation. • Papers in all languages with English abstracts. • All papers where an explicit link is studied between flooding as an exposure and an infectious disease as an outcome. Exclusion criteria • Papers concerned primarily with mental health effects, flood-related injuries, population displacement, economic costs, and disruption of food supplies.
