Lewis (RTlt), ACI (RTI"), and BN (RTI") female rats (Corona virus-free), 6-10 wk old, were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis IN. Radiation. Lewis rats were irradiated (950 rad) at 120 rads/min from a dual-source ~:~VCs small animal irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Kanata, Ontario, Canada). Marrow Transplantation. Donor animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. Marrow from femurs, tibias, and humeri was collected in Hank's solution supplemented with 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 ~g/ml streptomycin. The marrow cells were adjusted to a concentration of 6 × 107 nucleated cells/mi and 1 ml was infused into recipient animals by intravenous injection through the tail vein 1 d after irradiation. Antibiotics. Rats received medicated drinking water supplemented with bactrim, neomycin, and polymixin B, and were given 1 mg/d gentamycin subcutaneously for 10 d as previously described (I 5). Cyclosporine. CsA was the generous gift of Sandoz, Ltd., Basel, Switzerland. The powdered CsA was dissolved in 95% ethanol and added to a 4% Tween-20 solution in deionized H~O. Rats were weighed daily and received 1 ml/100 g/d subcutaneously from the day of marrow infusion for 40 consecutive days. The total dose of CsA per day per rat was 15 mg/kg. Control animals received the identical quantities of the drug diluent (ethanol, 4% Tween-20, H20) without CsA. Assessment of GVHD. Rats were examined daily for signs of clinical GVHD, such as red ears, dermatitis, or diarrhea. Skin biopsies were taken at frequent intervals. Previously described criteria were used for the histological documentation of GVHD (16) . Grade 2 acute GVH D was defined by the presence of lymphocytic exocytosis, epidermal destruction with vascular changes of the basal layer, dyskeratotic cells, and/or lymphocytic dermal and/or epidermal infiltration. Animals were sacrificed for assessment of cellular immune reactivity. Autopsies were performed, and the skin, tongue, liver, intestine, and spleen were histologically examined for the presence of GVHD at various times after marrow transplantation. Cell-mediated Lympholysis Assay (CML). The CML assay was performed using standard techniques as previously described (1 i, 17) . Briefly, spleen ceils from the test animal, fractionated over nylon wool to enrich for T cells (18) , were used as effector cells in the CML assay. Target cells were either 3-d-old phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced blast cells or 4-d-old concanavalin A (Con A)-induced blast cells labelled with 400/~Ci of ~Cr. Maximum, and spontaneous ~lCr release were obtained by adding 0.1 ml 1 N HCI or 0.1 ml of complete medium, respectively, to wells containing 104 target cells. Percent specific ~TCr release was calculated according to the following formula: % specific 5~Cr release --(cpm experimental -cpm spontaneous) x 100/(cpm maximum -cpm spontaneous). Effector/target ratios, in most instances, for these assays, were 100:1. Natural Killer (NK) Cell Assays. NK assays in the test rats were performed as previously described (19) . Briefly, ceils from a murine tumor cell line (YAC), were labelled with ~tCr and served as targets for assessment of NK cell activity. The assay was performed in a fashion comparable to the CML assay described above. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAb). Murine mAb directed against rat lymphocyte determinants were purchased from Sera Labs (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury NY). The specific mAb (from ascites fluid) used in our studies consisted of W3/13 HLK (panspecific for rat T lymphocytes), W3/25 (specific for rat T helper cells), OX8 (identifies the rat non-T helper cetl subset), OX4 (specific for a common determinant of class II histocompatibility antigens in the rat), and OX18 (reacting with a common class I rat histocompatibility determinant). Cell Separation by Panning. Nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells from the test animals were separated into lymphocyte subsets by panning, as previously described (20). Briefly, 10 7 lymphocytes, incubated (1 h at 4°C) with 0.2 ml of a 1:10 dilution (in phosphatebuffered saline [PBS]), were placed in petri dishes coated with affinity-purified goat antimouse IgG (Tago Inc., Burlingame CA), the plates were lightly centrifuged (200 g for 2 min) and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The nonadherent fraction was aspirated, plates carefully washed with PBS, and the adherent fraction eluted by vigorous aspiration with a 10% solution of normal mouse serum or control ascites fluid. This fractionation procedure routinely achieved >90% purity of the selected cell population. Statistical Analysis. Results from the in vitro assays were analyzed for statistical significance by the student's t test. Association of syngeneic GVHD with in vitro parameters of cellular immune reactivity were performed by x 2 analysis.
