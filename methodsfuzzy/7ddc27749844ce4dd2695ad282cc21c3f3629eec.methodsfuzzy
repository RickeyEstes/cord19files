Mice SPF C57BL/6J, birth antibiotic C57BL/6J, Rag1 -/-, nestin-Cre, Il1r -/-, Il18 -/-, Tlr4 -/-, TLR4-floxed, Cx3xr CreER , and Tlr2 -/mice were originally purchased from Jackson Labs and reared in the SPF facility at the University of Utah. Germfree C57BL/6J mice were reared in gnotobiotic chambers in the germfree facility at the University of Utah. Microbial sterility is determined every 3 weeks by plating and PCR. Mice used in this study were 6-10 weeks old at time of infection. For microglia depletion, PLX-3397 (formulated in an AIN-76A) was prepared by Research Diets and provided by Plexxikon Inc SPF mice were provided PLX-3397 in their chow beginning 7 days prior to viral infection. Mice were chosen at random to receive either PLX-3397 or control chow. All experiments were performed in accordance to federal regulations as well as the guidelines for animal use set forth by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
