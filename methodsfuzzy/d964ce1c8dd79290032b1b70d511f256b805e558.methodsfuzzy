Viruses and cell culture AGM fibroblasts (PRO1190, Coriell Institute for Medical Research) human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), rhesus fibroblasts (RF), BSC40 and HeLa cells, and derivative cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% NuSerum (BD Biosciences) as previously described [32] . At times, PRO1190 cell lines were also propagated in Minimal Essential Medium with 20% fetal calf serum and anitbiotics to enable more rapid growth. PRO1190 cells were transduced with a nonsilencing control or PKR-targeting shRNA lentiviral vectors (Open Biosystems, catalogue numbers RHS4430-98819555 and RHS4346, respectively) and selected in puromycin (5 mg/ml) to generate PRO1190-ctrl k/d and PRO1190-PKR k/d cells. pEQ1364 was constructed by moving the RhTRS1 gene, with a C-terminal biotinylation signal and 6x-His tag, as a HindIII/PmeI fragment from pEQ1215 [20] into the HindIII/HpaI sites of pLHCX (Clontech Laboratories, Inc). HFF-LHCX and HFF+RhTRS1 were produced by transducing HFF with retroviral vectors made using LHCX and pEQ1364, respectively and selecting with hygromycin B (100 mg/ml). Vaccinia virus (VV) Copenhagen strain (VC2) [33] and VVDE3L [34] , both obtained from Bertram Jacobs (Arizona State University), and VV-bg (VC2-LacZ in [20] were propagated and titered in BSC40 cells. VC-R2 (VVDE3LDK3L) was constructed by replacing the E3L gene in the K3L-deleted VACV vP872 strain (DK3L in VC2 background, provided by Bertram Jacobs) [35] by homologous recombination. The 518 bp 59 arm was created by PCR amplification of VC2 DNA with primers C15 (59-GATTAAGGG-TACTAGCGGCACCG939)6C16 (59-TTTTAGAGAGAACTA-ACACAACCAGC-39). The 512 bp 39 arm was created by PCR amplification of VC2 DNA with primers C19 (59-GTGTAG-TAAGCTAGCGAGCTCGGTACCTTCTAGTTATCAATAA-CAGTTAGTAGTTTAG-39)6C20 (59-CCAACAAACTGTTC-TCTTATGAATCG-39). The reading frame of EGFP including the PEST sequence was amplified with primers C17 (59-GCT-GGTTGTGTTAGTTCTCTCTAAAACCCGGGATCCACCG-GTCGCC-39)6C18 (59-GGTACCGAGCTCGCTAGCTTAC-TACACATTGATCCTAGCAGAAGC-39) using pD2EGFP-N1 (Clonetech) as the template. PCR products were gel-purified and mixed together as template for fusion PCR using C156C20. PfuUltra polymerase (Agilent Technologies) was used for these PCR reactions. PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector to generate plasmid S96. S96 was used as template for PCR amplification of marker +59 and 39 arms using C156C20 followed by gel-purification. BS-C-1 cells grown on 12 well plates were infected with vP872 at MOI = 2 and transfected 2 hours after infection with 1 mg of the purified PCR product. Cell lysates were collected after 18 hours and plated in a dilutions series on RK13+E3L+K3L cells [36] . Green plaques were picked after 48 hours at the highest dilution possible and plaque purified an additional three times on RK13+E3L+K3L cells. EGFP expression in VC-R2 is under the control of the endogenous E3L promoter. VVDEDK was propagated and titered using HFF+TRS1 cells (HF-TRS1 in [37] ). VVDEDK+RhTRS1 was constructed by homologous recombination of plasmid pEQ1233 [20] into the thymidine kinase (TK) locus of VVDEDK. Recombinant virus was plaque purified three times in BSC40 under G418 selection and subsequently propagated and titered on BSC40 cells.
