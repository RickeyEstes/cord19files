The human coronaviruses known prior to March 2003 are difficult to propagate in cell cultures. Their disease associations-generally mild respiratory illness ("common cold"), enteric and rarely possibly neurological disease-led to their widespread neglect in medical virology; only few groups worked on various scientific aspects, and very few laboratories offered routine diagnostic tests, mainly by PCR. SARS-CoV, on the other hand, is readily propagated in vitro and may also be detected by PCR and indirectly through antibody testing. Nevertheless, and despite considerable progress in this field, much remains to be done until laboratory tests become a useful tool for the management of SARS cases (World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003) . The presence of the infectious virus can be detected by inoculating suitable cell cultures (e.g., Vero cells) with patient specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood or stool) and propagating the virus in vitro. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as SARS-CoV using further tests. According to international consensus, such work has to be performed under biosafety level (BSL) three conditions. SARS-CoV-specific RNA can be amplified from various clinical specimens, especially in respiratory secretions and in stool, by PCR. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per millilitre were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected, albeit at extremely low concentrations, in plasma during the acute phase and in faeces during the late convalescent phase, suggesting that virus may be shed in faeces for prolonged periods of time (Drosten et al., 2003a) . A commercial real-time RT-PCR test kit containing primers and positive and negative controls developed by the Bernhard Nocht Institute (http://www.bnihamburg.de/) is available (http://www.artus-biotech.de). An inactivated standard preparation is also available for diagnostic purposes through the European network for imported viral infections (ENIVD; http://www.enivd.de). ENIVD is also preparing for an international external quality assessment scheme for SARS-CoV assays. The existing PCR tests cannot rule out, with certainty, the presence of SARS-CoV in patients . On the other hand, contamination of samples in laboratories performing PCR may lead to false-positive results, unless appropriate precautions are taken. Various methods were developed for the detection of antibodies produced in response to infection with SARS-CoV by probably virtually all patients. The first type of antibody test to be employed was the immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Using cells infected with the patient's own virus isolate and an antihuman IgG:FITC conjugate, we were able to demonstrate specific seroconversion in the two Frankfurt SARS patients (Drosten et al., 2003a;  Fig. 1 ). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients and reliably yields positive results at around day 21 after the onset of illness (World Health Organization Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diagnosis, 2003). The neutralisation test (NT) assesses and quantifies, by means of titration, the ability of patient sera to neutralise the infectivity of SARS-CoV on cell culture; the NT titre may therefore be correlated to clinical immunity although this has yet to be demonstrated. However, NT is limited to institutions with BSL-3 facilities. The only antibody test commercially available so far is an IFA which yields a positive result from about day 10 after the onset of illness (Euroimmun, LÃ¼beck, Germany). As the diagnosis of SARS is based entirely on a set of clinical and epidemiological criteria so far, reported case numbers are likely to include a substantial number of non-SARS patients. Therefore, recovered patients should be tested systematically for specific SARS-CoV antibody reactivity to confirm their diagnoses in retrospect and thus allow a better understanding of epidemiological and other features . Although electron microscopy has an important role in the rapid diagnosis of infectious agents in emergent situations (Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003) , it has provided only circumstantial evidence in the case of SARS. When a virus-like agent was first visualised in clinical material from SARS cases by electron microscopy, its classification was ambiguous; it later turned out to be human metapneumovirus (Poutanen et al., 2003) . Even in cases in whom coronavirus-like particles were detected, these could not be distinguished from the 'classic' human coronaviruses.
