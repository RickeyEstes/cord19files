Propagation, Purification and Labeling of virus. Vero cells were first cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . DBCO modified Vero cells were produced by DSPE-PEG-DBCO (Avanti) with various concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 30 µg/mL at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Then, PEDV strain CV777, a commercially attenuated vaccine virus, was propagated in Vero cell monolayer. The cells were washed three times with serumfree DMEM, and cultured with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB, Sigma) and 3 µg/mL tripsin (Sigma) in the DMEM for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Finally, DBCO modified viruses were propagated in DBCO modified Vero cells in the same condition. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 850 g for 10 min after freezing and thawing twice, and the viruses were purified by a 10-60% gradient of sucrose at 100,000 g for 2 h at 4 °C. QD-N 3 was produced by adding the azidobutyric acid NHS eater (Lumiprobe Corporation, US) (NHS-N 3 ) to the QD-NH 2 (Wuhan Jiayuan Quantum Dots Co., Ltd., China) in the 0.1 M NaHCO 3 -Na 2 CO 3 buffer solution (pH = 7-9) and stirred at 25 °C for 1 h. Then QD modified viruses were obtained by mixing the virus solution and QD-N 3 for 1 h at 25 °C. Unbound QD-N 3 was removed by gel filtration on a NAP-10 column (GE Healthcare).
