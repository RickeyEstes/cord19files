We designed a questionnaire including contact history, degree of fever and duration, age, constitutional symptoms, and respiratory and gastrointestinal tract symptoms. This 5-week period was divided into two phases. In the first 2 weeks, we collected the questionnaires and analyzed the clinical manifestations. After comparing the clinical manifestations and results of IRTs, we designed a simple scoring system to predict the test results. In the next 3 weeks, we validated the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system. The commercial IRT kit we used was the Quickvue influenza A Ã¾ B assay (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA). Oropharyngeal swabs were performed at the emergency department and the influenza antigen tests were done according to the manufacturer's instructions.
