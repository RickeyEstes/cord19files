The key contribution of our method is to quantitatively model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction (Salathé et al., 2010) , based on the state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision. The input to our workflow is video sequences VS i , i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , N c , captured by multiple (N c ) cameras. These cameras are potentially non-overlapping and installed at different locations. The search starts with a diagnosed patient P * , who is confirmed in the clinic with the pandemic disease. The goal of this work is to identify the contact graph (CG) and quantitatively evaluate their potential infection risk (PR) with the principle of close proximity interaction. The workflow of our method is presented in Figure 1 . Our method successfully evaluates the infection risk and requires to solve multiple problems simultaneously. The tasks range from the fundamental problem to extract human from an image, to identify the same subject across different cameras and eventually to evaluate the infection risk for potential subjects. The knowledge learned from one task is harnessed for use in other tasks. The final goal of infection assessment can only be achieved by integrating the knowledge from prior sub-tasks. We describe our method as two main stages: (1) identifying the potentiallyinfected group, (2) modeling close proximity interaction.
