Sigma Stat 2008 software (SPSS Science, San Rafael, CA) was used for analyses. Differences between groups were tested using the one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test according to data distribution. When these tests demonstrated a significant difference between groups (p < 0.05), the Tukey test to correct for multiple comparisons was used. Pearson or Spearman Rank Order test were used for correlations. In all analyses, a two-tailed p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
