From seven herds, seven piglets naturally infected with PRRSV were killed by electrocution 2 to 4 days after the appearance of clinical symptoms. Tissue samples from four different areas of the right lung (anterior lobe, middle lobe, caudal lobe and accessory lobe) of each pig were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for insitu hybridization. The left lung was used for PRRSV isolation as described by Halbur et aL (1996) , and for bacterial isolation. Bacterial cultures were made on 5 % defibrinated bovine blood trypticase soy agar, brilliant green agar, and MacConkey agar, incubated at 37~ A 433 base pair cDNA fragment representing the 5' region of the nucleocapsid gene (ORF7) was used as a probe. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out as previously described (Mardassi et al., 1994) . The sense (101 PLS) and antisense (1011 PLR) primers were 5'-ATGGCCAGCCAGCCAGTCAATCA-3' (nucleotides 51 to 69) and 5'-TCGCCCTAATTGAATAGGTG-3' (nucleotides 464 to 483), respectively. The PCR product was purified in agarose gel with commercial geneclean kit (Bio 101 Inc., LaJolla, CA, USA). Purified PCR product was labelled by random priming with digoxigenin-dUTP by means of a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in-situ hybridization, lung tissue from each piglet was collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and after 1 or 2 days' fixation was dehydrated through graded alcohols and a toluene step and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were then cut at a thickness of 4 lam, mounted on "Superfrost/plus" slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and stored at room temperature. Just before use, sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7"4, 0"01 M) for 5 rain. De-proteinization was carried out in 0"2 M HC1 for 20 min at room temperature. Tissues were then digested at 37~ for 20 min in proteinase K (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) 20 lag/ml in PBS (pH 7"4, 0.01 M) and fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS for 5 min. After rinsing with PBS twice, the slides were acetylated in 300 ml of 0'1 mM triethanolamine-HC1 buffer (pH 8"0) to which 0"75 ml of acetic anhydride (0"25%) had been added. After 5 min, a further 0"75 ml of acetic anhydride was added and 5 min later the slides were rinsed in 2 x saline sodium citrate (SSC) (1 x SSC contains 50 mM NaC1 and 15 mM sodium citrate pH 7"0). The slides were equilibrated for 60 min in a standard hybridization buffer that consisted of 5 x SSC containing deionized formamide 50%, 10 x blocking buffered solution (Boehringer Mannheim) 2%, N-lauroylsarcosine 0" 1%, and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) 0"02%. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45~ The digoxigenin-labelled probe (0' 1 ng/~tl) was diluted in 300 gl of the standard hybridization buffer and then heated for 5 min in a 95~ heating block and quenched on ice before being applied to tissue sections. Approximately 75 ng of digoxigenin-labelled probe were added to standard hybridization buffer (70 gl), which was then layered over the section. The fluid was held in place by a coverslip, the edges of which were sealed with rubber cement. After overnight hybridization, sections were thoroughly washed, twice in 4 x SSC for 5 min at room temperature, once in 2 x SSC for 10min at 37~ once in 0"2 x SSC containing formamide 60% for 10min at 37~ twice in 2 x SSC for 5 min at room temperature, twice in 0"2 x SSC for 5 min at room temperature, and once in maleic acid buffer (100mM maleic acid and 150mM NaCI, pH 7"5) for 5rain at room temperature. For detection of hybridization, sections were incubated with anti-digoxigenin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1 in 200 in 0"1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7"4), 0'15M NaCI with 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). After three washes in buffer, substrate consisting of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromocresyl-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP) was layered over the sections. Colour was allowed to develop for 5-8 h in the dark, and development was stopped by dipping slides briefly in Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer (10 mM Tris-HC1 and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8'0). Sections were counterstained with methyl green 0"5%, and the slides were then washed with distilled water for l min and dried completely. Negative control sections were prepared from a 1-day-old colostrumdeprived pig not exposed to PRRSV. Also included as a control was lung tissue from a 3-week-old conventional pig infected with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), isolate SK2736.
