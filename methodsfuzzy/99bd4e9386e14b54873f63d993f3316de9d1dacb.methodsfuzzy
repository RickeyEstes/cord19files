The methodology followed by the Chinese National Marine Data and Information Service to quantify the size and composition of the ocean economy is very similar to the methodology employed by the US National Oceans Economic Program (NOEP) as well as methodologies followed by other coastal countries that have analyzed their respective ocean economies, such as Canada, Australia and Ireland [19] [20] [21] [22] . The Chinese methodology is reviewed here but for a more in-depth discussion in relation to the developments in the Chinese marine economic statistical system over the past 20 years the interested reader should see Song et al. [13] . In that paper the authors argue that marine economic data gathering has gone from dispersed efforts to a concentrated approach, increasing from partial coverage of industry categories to comprehensive statistics and transitioning to more institutionalized management of marine economic statistics. They suggest that the practical significance of these developments is an improved national data set for the marine economy and policy makers that will continue to develop in the future. Similar to the issues faced by the other countries that prepare ocean economy statistics, estimates of the value of the ocean industries in China are limited due to the definitional and data limitations. Nevertheless, with the growing realization of the importance of marine economic activity to the wider Chinese economy, China's OEAS was established exclusively for ocean economy data collection in 2006 to meet the practical needs of ocean economic management. The system was developed and is operated by the Chinese National Marine Data and Information Service within China's State Oceanic Administration. The OEAS includes four basic parts, which are the Principal Account, the Elementary Account, the Natural Capital Account and the Green Ocean Account. The Principal Account, which is also called the Gross Ocean Product (GOP) Account, is the most highly developed component within the system and is concerned with the identification and quantification of ocean economic activity. The Elementary Account is concerned with the development of an input-output matrix that disaggregates the major ocean industries from the standard industry classifications in the national input-output tables. This account also analyses the quantity and value of exports and imports through Chinese sea ports and estimates the value of marine related capital. The third major account within the system is concerned with the assessment of the non-market values associated with China's marine resources. The Green Ocean Account combines the market and non-market analysis from the Principal and the Natural Capital accounts in order to provide policymakers with a holistic view of the overall value of China's ocean economy. The Elementary Account, the Natural Capital Account and the Green Ocean Account are still at an early stage of development. Fig. 1 presents the framework of China's OEAS. Based on the OEAS, this paper focuses on the Principal Account where the major ocean industries in China are defined and quantified. The basic goal of defining and quantifying major ocean industries within the elementary account of the OEAS is to permit consistent measurement of the contribution of the ocean to the China economy across time and regions. Similar to many other ocean economy reporting exercises [19] [20] [21] [22] , five basic steps are followed to quantify the Chinese ocean economy: 1. Source the data. In this step, the ocean economy activities are identified via government collected data within national accounts. These sources in China's case are outlined in Section 4.
