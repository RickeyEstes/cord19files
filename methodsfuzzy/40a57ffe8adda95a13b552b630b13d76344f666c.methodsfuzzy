For evaluation of the decontamination protocol to reduce or eliminate PEDV from feed processing equipment and processing facilities, the Cargill Feed Safety Research Center (FSRC) in the O.H. Kruse Feed Technology Innovation Center at Kansas State University was used. The FSRC is a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory with pilot scale feed manufacturing equipment. The FSRC includes a containment mode, where a separate air handling system with HEPA filtration and biosafety protocols restrict pathogen exit during operation of equipment. Employees are required to wear personal protective equipment and follow strict biosafety guidelines while operating in containment mode. As a final decontamination step, the entire temperature of the facility can be raised to and maintained at 60˚C. Due to the dual functionality of the FSRC as a pilot-scale feed mill operated not under containment, effective decontamination is essential to prevent the contamination of research feeds. Thawing of the virus, preparation of the inoculum and subsequent inoculation of the larger feed batch was all done within the FSRC in containment mode. The FSRC was not removed from containment mode until completion of decontamination after the final replication. Grand Island, NY) by rubbing the moist swab across the desired surface. Swab samples were collected from designated locations within the FSRC at baseline (prior to the manufacture of contaminated feed), after production of PEDV-contaminated feed and after each step of the decontamination protocol [10] . All collected swabs were analyzed for PEDV RNA by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For RT-qPCR analysis, the swab tubes were vortexed briefly before 50 μL of fluid was transferred to a 96-well plate and used for RNA extraction. Automated extraction was carried out on a KingFisher magnetic particle processor (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using a Mag-MAX™-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). All manufacturer's instructions were followed, with the exception of a final elution volume of 60 μl. Each 96-well extraction plate included an extraction positive control (PEDV inoculum) and an extraction negative control (1x PBS). A duplex real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting the Spike gene of PEDV and host 18S rRNA (internal control) was used for the detection and quantification of PEDV. Primer and probe information is listed in Table 1 . The RT-qPCR was carried out in 20 μl reaction volumes with final concentrations of: 1x Path-ID™ Multiplex RT-PCR buffer, 2 μl Path-ID™ Multiplex Enzyme Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 500 nM of each primer, 62.5 nM of each probe, and 4 μl sample RNA. The reactions were carried out on the CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and consisted of 10 min reverse transcription at 48˚C, 10 min of reverse transcriptase inactivation/initial denaturation at 95˚C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95˚C and 40 s at 60˚C. Each 96-well RT-qPCR plate included the two extraction controls (above) and a PCR positive control (known PEDV-positive RNA sample) and a PCR negative control (water). Results were analyzed using the CFX Manager™ Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 18S Ct values were monitored for each sample as an internal positive extraction control.
