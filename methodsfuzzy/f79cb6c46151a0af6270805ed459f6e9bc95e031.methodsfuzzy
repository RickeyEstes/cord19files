This study received ethical approval from the human research ethics board of the Wannan Medical College. The researchers explained the purpose and significance of the survey to the head nurses of each department. The participants voluntarily completed the scale. The researchers also explained to the participants that the survey results would be used exclusively for research purposes, that the information they would provide would not be leaked, and that they should provide their informed consent. The questionnaire can be completed anonymously between five and 6 min. We distributed 108 questionnaires, among which 102 valid questionnaires were returned, thereby resulting in a 94.44% response rate.
