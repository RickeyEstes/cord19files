With the advent of new chromosome staining methods, the use of somatic cell hybridization for human gene mapping came of age. Caspersson and his colleagues first introduced the use of the fluorescent dye quinacrine (in several forms), which imparts specific and reproducible banding to chromosomes (Caspersson et al., 1968 (Caspersson et al., , 1970 (Caspersson et al., , 1971 ) and allows them to be readily identified in rodent-human hybrids. However, this procedure involves the use of relatively expensive equipment and the fluorescence rapidly fades under the microscope. More or less permanently stained and banded chromosomes were successfully produced by different preparations of Giemsa stain (Arrighi and Hsu, 1971; Sumner et al, 1971; Drets and Shaw, 1971; Schnedl, 1971; Seabright, 1971 ). The most successful and widely used procedure utilizing Giemsa stain is the method of Seabright (1971), which employs a pretreatment of the fixed chromosomes with trypsin, followed by Giemsa stain. This method of staining also produces very reproducible and specific bands (called G-bands) which readily allow identification of all of the human chromosomes. Several modifications of Seabright's procedure have been reported (see reviews by Schnedl, 1974b; Sanchez and Yunis, 1977) . Figure 5 shows a diagrammatic representation of the normal human chromosome complement, showing the light and dark bands achieved by staining with quinacrine (Q-banding) or various treatments with Giemsa (G-banding). These specific bands serve to fingerprint each human chromosome. The banding patterns and numbering are those given in the report of the Paris Conference (1972). Other procedures which delineate human from mouse chromosomes in hybrids take advantage of the differential staining of centromeres and arms. Staining fixed and spread chromosomes with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 (Hilwig and Gropp, 1972; Kucherlapati et al, 1975) usually causes mouse, but not human, centromeres to fluoresce brightly (Fig. 6) . A similar event occurs with Giemsa at an alkaline pH (Giemsa-11 staining; Bobrow et al., 1972; Bobrow and Cross, 1974; Friend et al., 1976a) . Giemsa 11 stains mouse chromosomes magenta with light blue centromeres, and stains human chromosomes light blue with magenta centromeres. Therefore, this procedure can be used readily to identify human chromosomes in mouse-human hybrids Some procedures are often used in tandem, e.g., initial quinacrine fluorescent staining of hybrid metaphase spreads to visualize specific chromosomal bands (preserved with photography) followed by restaining the same spreads with Giemsa 11 to identify quickly human chro-117 mosomes from mouse chromosomes. Such procedures now allow investigators to identify chromosomes quickly and accurately. They also have led to at least 120 genes being assigned to all 22 autosomes plus the X chromosome (Table III) . During the past few years, procedures have been introduced for fusing cells and producing hybrids from cell fragments such as isolated nuclei, chromosomes, or enucleated cells (for a detailed treatment of this subject, see Ringertz and Savage, 1976) . For use in human gene mapping, intact rodent cells can be fused with human nuclei (minicells), parts of nuclei (microcells), or isolated chromosomes. Each of these procedures has advantages over the normal hybridization procedures discussed earlier and, in general, can give results faster than conventional hybridization. (Ringertz and Savage, 1976 ). This minicell can be seeded onto a tissue culture dish where it will attach and metabolize. Minicells cannot replicate and cannot live for more than 2 days, but they will make viable hybrids. . The chromosome-cell mixture is then incubated for a selected time with mild shaking, after which the cells are plated on tissue culture dishes; hybrids are selected in HAT medium (or any other selection medium). Colonies are observed at very low hybridization frequencies (about 10~6 to 10" 7 ) and must be grown in selective medium for the first few months after hybridization to allow stabilization of the transgenome (Fig. 12) . et al., 1976) , and possibly, isolation and purification of the transgenome can be achieved if the foreign DNA is sufficiently different from the recipient's DNA.

Section:most methods for isolating metaphase chromosomes follow that of maio and schildkraut (1967) or modifications of this method. briefly, this procedure involves an initial administration of mitotic block to cultured cells to build up a large number of cells in metaphase, followed by gentle lysis of the cells and centrifugal purification of the metaphase chromosomes. these metaphase chromosomes are then suspended in culture medium and mixed with freshly trypsin-treated recipient cells and poly-l-ornithine (poly-l-ornithine stimulates phagocytosis by the recipient cells)
