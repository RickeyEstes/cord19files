Cell lines and mice. Murine 17Cl-1, L2 fibroblast, and BHK MHV receptor (MHVR) cells were cultured as described previously (12, 23) . Human 293T (ATCC) and human Hey1B (21) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and RPMI 1640, respectively, both with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary BMM were generated from the hind limbs of C57BL/6 (B6) or Rnasel Ϫ/Ϫ mice and cultured as described previously (49) . C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Rnasel Ϫ/Ϫ mice (B6, 10 generations of backcrossing) (50, 51) were bred in the University of Pennsylvania animal facility under an approved IACUC protocol. Antibodies. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-ns2 monoclonal antibody (provided by Stuart Siddell, University of Bristol, United Kingdom), mouse monoclonal anti-Flag epitope (M2; Sigma); sheep anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked whole antibody (GE Healthcare); horse anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling); Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen); mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (U.S. Biologicals); monoclonal anti-␤-actin (A1978; Sigma-Aldrich); and custommade affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP7 CD antibodies against peptide A (CQLLNEDEVNIGTDALLELK) and peptide B (KKQSNGYYHCESSIVIGEK) (Biosynthesis). Peptide A is 100% homologous to murine AKAP7 (except in the N-terminal cysteine residue), whereas peptide B is 100% homologous to both mouse and human AKAP7. Plasmids. For protein purification, the murine AKAP7 full-length coding sequence (clone MmCD00295344 from the PlasmID DF/HCC Resource Core at Harvard University [NCBI reference sequence NP_061217.3]) was transferred from the entry vector pENTR223.1 to a destination vector, pDest-pGEX-6P-1, using Gateway cloning technology (Life Technologies), resulting in pGEX-AKAP7. The histidine residues at positions 93 and 185 were mutated with a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) to generate pGEX-AKAP7 (H93A H185R). Plasmid pMAL-ns2 was described previously (7) . The cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human rotavirus WA strain VP3 (amino acids 691 to 835) (Virus Sequence Database accession number JX406749) was optimized for bacterial expression, synthetically made (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), cloned in a pMal parallel vector, and expressed as a maltose binding protein fusion protein with a TEV cleavable tag, as we previously described for SA11 VP3-CTD (8) . For Hey1b transient transfections, the murine AKAP7 full-length coding sequence was PCR amplified from the entry vector pENTR223.1 and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS, generating pC-AKAP7. The histidine residues at positions 93 and 185 were mutated to generate pC-AKAP7(H93A; H185R), and a Flag tag sequence for the C terminus was added. The CD region of murine AKAP7 (corresponding to amino acids 48 to 253) was PCR amplified from the full-length construct with a Flag epitope sequence added to the C terminus and cloned into pCAGGS, generating pC-AKAP7 CD. For 293T stable cells lines, the lentivirus vector pLentiCMV-Puro-DEST, from Eric Campeau (52) , pCMV-VSV-G, expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein, and the pCMV-dR8.2 packaging plasmid, from Robert Weinberg (53), were obtained from Addgene. The murine AKAP7 full-length cDNA insert was transferred from the entry vector pENTR223.1 into the destination vector pLentiCMV-Puro-DEST with Gateway cloning technology. The CD region of murine AKAP7 (see above) was PCR amplified from the full-length construct with a Flag epitope sequence added to the C terminus and cloned into the entry vector pENTR2B (Gateway; Life Technologies). The insert was transferred to the destination vector pLentiCMV-Puro-DEST with Gateway technology. All of the clones were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Viruses. Wild-type A59 and mutant ns2 H126R virus were described previously (8) . The chimeric AKAP7 viruses were constructed based on the infectious cDNA clone icMHV-A59 (provided by Ralph S. Baric, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) (8, 23) . All chimeric AKAP viruses encode the mutant ns2 H126R gene. To insert the AKAP7 sequences in place of ns4, the BsmBI restriction site in the AKAP7 gene was first removed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with no change in coding sequence. The full-length AKAP7 (encoding 314 amino acids), AKAP7 with an N-terminal 47-amino-acid deletion (AKAP7 ⌬NTD , amino acids 48 to 314), and the CD of AKAP7 (AKAP7 CD , amino acids 48 to 253) were amplified and digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into icMHV-A59 fragment G as previously described for VP3-CTD (8) . In the mutant AKAP CD H185 , the histidine at position 185 was exchanged for arginine (H185R, CAC to CGC), and the mutant sequence was cloned into icMHV-A59 fragment G using the same strategy as for the wild-type genes. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The full-length A59 genome cDNA was assembled, and the recombinant viruses were recovered as previously described (8, 23, 54) . Briefly, wild-type A-E plasmids, F plasmid with a single mutation (H126R) in ns2 (8) , and G plasmids with AKAP7 insertions were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the viral genome fragments were assembled in vitro to produce a full-length-genome infectious DNA. Viral RNA transcripts were generated from the DNA by using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion). The viral genome transcripts combined with the in vitro transcripts of viral nucleocapsid gene were electroporated into the BHK MHVR cells with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator. When virus cytopathology was observed, cell lysates were combined with the supernatant, virus plaque purified, and amplified on 17Cl-1 cells for use. 2=,5=-PDE activity assays. Proteins were expressed from the pGEX or pMAL construct in the BL21(DE3)/pLysS strain of Escherichia coli (Life Technologies). Wild-type or mutant AKAP7 was cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads with 30 units of human rhinovirus HRV3C protease (PreScission protease; GE Healthcare). The cleaved proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with GelCode blue stain reagent (Thermo Scientific). The proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a MonoQ GL100 column on an ÄKTApurifier UPC (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The buffer in the pooled fractions was exchanged with assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) in Centriprep centrifugal filter devices (Millipore; molecular weight cutoff, 3 kDa). MHV ns2 was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (7). The plasmid encoding WA VP3-CTD was expressed in bacteria, and the WA VP3-CTD was purified essentially as described previously for SA11 VP3-CTD (8) . Purified proteins (1.5 M ns2, VP3, AKAP7, AKAP7 H93A;H185R ) were incubated with 10 M (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 as described previously (7) in assay buffer at 22°C or 37°C. Degradation of the (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 was determined by FRET-based RNase L activity assays, in comparison to a standard curve with different concentrations of (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 (20) , or with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as we described previously (55) . Degradation of 2-5A in pIC-transfected cells. Hey1B cells were plated at 4 ϫ 10 5 cells/well in six-well plates for 20 h. Plasmid DNAs (1 g per well) of the empty vector (pCAGGS), AKAP7 CD , AKAP7, and Flagtagged-AKAP7 H93A;H185R were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. After 16 h, cells were mock transfected or transfected with poly(rI) · poly(rC) (pIC) (EMD Biosciences) at 1 g/well for 3 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 200 M sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT) and heated to 95°C for 7 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 ϫ g at room temperature, and supernatants were passed through Microcon centrifugal filters with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa (Millipore Corporation) for 45 min at 11,000 ϫ g. Levels of 2-5A were determined by RNase L-based FRET assays in comparison to a standard curve of authentic (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 as we described previously (20) . Viral growth kinetics. Viral growth curves were determined by infecting B6 or Rnasel Ϫ/Ϫ BMM with each virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. After a 1-h incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Culture supernatants were collected at 6, 9, 12, and 24 h postinfection, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays on L2 cells (56). RNA chip analysis. For analysis of rRNA integrity, total cellular RNA was isolated at 10 h postinfection with the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). RNA was quantified with a NanoDrop analyzer, and equal quantities of RNA were resolved on RNA chips using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (28) . Immunofluorescence assays. 17Cl-1 cells or B6 BMM were infected with each virus at an MOI of 1. At 9 h postinfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and then with secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cell were stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and visually analyzed by using an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope and associated SlideBook 5.0 software. 293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with an empty lentivector or a lentivector containing cDNA to AKAP7 or AKAP7 CD , together with a plasmid expressing VSV G envelope protein (from a pCMV vector) and a pCMV dR8.2 packaging plasmid. Cells were selected with 3 g/ml puromycin to generate stably expressing cell lines. 293T cell lines were plated on sterile coverslips at 2 ϫ 10 5 cells/well in six-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, blocked with 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h, and incubated with primary anti-AKAP7 CD antibody peptide A at a 1:100 dilution at 4°C for 16 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS, probed with secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:500 dilution, and stained with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI. Images were collected using an HCX PL APO 63ϫ/1.4-numericalaperture (NA) oil immersion objective on a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Western blotting. Proteins in cell lysates were separated in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed with the antibodies described above and developed using Amersham ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and X-ray film ( Fig. 1G and 3C) or using Western Lightning Plus-ECL enhanced-chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer), and proteins were detected under an Intelligent dark box II (Fujifilm) (Fig. 2B) . As controls for loading and transfer, the blots were probed with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or anti-␤-actin. Animal experiments. Four-week-old B6 or Rnasel Ϫ/Ϫ mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories) and inoculated intrahepatically with each virus (2,000 PFU/mouse) in 50 l of PBS containing 0.75% BSA. At 5 days postinfection, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with PBS. The livers were removed, homogenized, and titrated by plaque assays on L2 cells as previously described (57). All mouse experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC. Statistical analysis. A two-tailed t test was performed to determine statistical significance, and the P values are shown in Fig. 4 . Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA).
