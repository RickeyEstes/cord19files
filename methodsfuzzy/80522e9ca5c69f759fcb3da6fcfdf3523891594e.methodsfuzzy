We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study at six major tertiary care children's hospitals (Ajou University School of Medicine, Sejong General Hospital, Pucheon, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Ulsan University Asan Medical Center and Yonsei University Cardiovascular Center, Korea) during 6-year seasonal period, from 1 st October 2009 to 31 st March 2015. We examined hospital medical records of all children with CHD who had received palivizumab according to the prophylaxis guideline and clinical decision after approval of the Investigated Research Board (AJIRB-MED-MDB-11-351). A total of 466 children with CHD received 1-5 injections of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection every 30 days, over one RSV season (October to February). CHD were identified by code based on the 10 th revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The Korean guidelines for RSV prophylaxis suggest that children less than 1 year of age with HS-CHD are most likely to benefit from prophylaxis. HS-CHD was defined as uncorrected or palliated cyanotic CHD, or acyanotic CHD associated with documented pulmonary hypertension, and/or a requirement for medication to manage congestive heart failure (CHF). Information collected for each patient included date of birth, age at first dose, follow up period, gender, structural type of CHD, and the number of palivizumab injections received before and after RSV infection. Additional data reviewed included the time between the actual start of treatment and the recommendation in the national guideline (October or the first month of life, if the child was born during the RSV season). Any underlying diagnoses of chromosomal defects, prematurity and low birth weight and status of cardiovascular surgery undergone, that involved cardiopulmonary bypass, were reviewed. We also investigated the patients hospitalized for RSV infection despite receiving palivizumab; factors included their age and calendar month at RSV infection, and factors related to infection severity. For infection severity, we reviewed their visit to the emergency department and ICU admissions, hospital and ICU length of stay, oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation use, and delay of elective operation. According to different types of heart disease, the rate of RSV infection, all-cause and RSV related mortality, and doses of palivizumab were analyzed. RSV infection was confirmed by direct fluorescent antibody staining, culture, or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates according to policy of each center. We noted the number of patients with breakthrough RSV infection and mortality, by comparison to doses of palivizumab prophylaxis according to type of CHD. Data were entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 18.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program and analyzed using descriptive statistics. All continuous variables were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics with meanÂ±standard deviation values. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
