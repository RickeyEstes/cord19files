Unadjusted linear or logistic regression analyses with clustered sandwich standard errors to account for within-patient correlation were used for sample-level comparisons, while patient-level comparisons were calculated using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests for continuous variables. Associations between LRTI and HRV species were estimated using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression. Associations between LRTI and individual genotypes detected in ≥4 samples were estimated by unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, using likelihood ratio tests to assess overall Reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstraps using DIVEIN. Neighbor joining trees were drawn in FigTree. HRV-A is shown in red, HRV-B in green, and HRV-C in blue. The study sequences are numbered in order of collection date. The black hash mark indicates that the branch of a HRV-A genotype was shortened to make the labels readable. Study samples were compared to reference sequences found in GenBank. Reference sequences are identified in black by their GenBank accession number.

Covariates in the multivariable models included age (<12 vs. ≥12 months), gender, race, underlying disease (Yes/No), premature birth (<37 weeks gestation), season (December-February vs. March-June), and coinfection. Testing was two-sided with an alpha of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12 (StataCorp).
