Cell lines and culture conditions U2OS, A549, MDCK, HeLa cells (all from ATCC), and chicken embryonic fibroblasts (ChEFs, from Charles River Labs) were grown in complete media (DMEM, Invitrogen Cat#11965) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). WI-38 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen Cat#10569), containing non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen Cat#11140) and 15% FBS. Wild type and matched IfitmDel2/2 MEFs were from adult IfitmDel+/2 mice [26] that were intercrossed and MEFs derived from embryos at day 13.5 of gestation, as described previously [14] . The MEFs were genotyped by PCR and Western blot, and the generation of the IfitmDel2/2 Ifitm3 cells have been previously described [14] .
