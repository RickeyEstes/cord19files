For the next-generation method, we write X = (E, S, Q, I, J, R) T and regard E as the next-generation "infected" population [23] . Then, (S, Q, I, J, R) T can be regarded as the remaining populations. Note that, in the SEQIJR model in this paper, an infected person always enters the E population first and then later enters the Q, I , J or R populations. Then the model can be written in the usual next-generation form as d X Then, a disease-free reproduction number is defined as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix FV −1 , where F and V are the Jacobian matrices of F(X ) and V (X ) at the disease-free equilibrium point ( . We have used the Maple software package to find an analytic formula for the largest eigenvalue of FV −1 , i.e., for R d f , and obtained the result: From the next-generation method, if the disease-free reproduction number R d f < 1, then the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable and if R d f > 1 then it is unstable. We will now prove that R d f can be rewritten in a much simpler form and that R d f > 1 also corresponds to the condition that the endemic equilibrium exists.  Proof. From (18) and using the definitions of α S , α E , α Q and α J in (12), we have Then, the formula for the endemic infectious population I * 2 in (11) can be written as: Therefore, I * 2 > 0 if and only if R d f > 1, i.e., if and only if the disease-free equilibrium point is unstable. To obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 , we consider the special case that the initial population is the 100% susceptible population. For this case, we have S = N , which corresponds to ν = 0 or D S = µ. Thus the basic reproduction number R 0 of the SEQIJR model is The proof is complete. □
