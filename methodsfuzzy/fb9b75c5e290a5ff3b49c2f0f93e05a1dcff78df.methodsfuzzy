Thirty-six sequences of Tollip protein were downloaded from KEGG ( Table 1 ). The phylogenetic reference used was the Tree of Life Web Project, ToL (http://tolweb.org/tree/), which were used in topological comparisons with Tollip generated data. All evolutionary analyses were carried out on the MEGA 5 software [24] . Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were obtained for Tollip using a Muscle alignment and G Blocks curation with default sets at PhyML 3.0 [25] , using the most appropriate model of amino acid substitution and likelihood scores assessed by TOPALi V2.5 [26, 27] . The best model was determined by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [28, 29] . Supports for the nodes were evaluated by bootstrapping with 1000 pseudoreplicates. The effect of reticulate evolutionary events was analyzed through a neighbor-net analysis [30] and converted into a splits graph using the drawing algorithms implemented in SplitsTree4 software -version 4.10 [31] . The neighbor-net method was based on the pairwise distance matrices of Tollip complete sequences alignment with deletion of gaps and non-informative parsimony sites; the matrices were calculated and corrected with the Poisson distribution model [32] . The isoletric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW) of each protein sequence was inferred with the Compute pI/Mw tool [33] , the variability present in sequences was accessed through the Protein Variability Server [34] , and the main protein characteristics as instability index (ININ), aliphatic index (AI) and GRAVY (grand average of hydropathicity) were evaluated with the ProtParam tool [35] . Tests of correlation between collected data and statistical treatments were made with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 software [36] . To check if selection affected the patterns of genetic diversity, we tested if the protein was under positive selection. Tajima's D statistic [37] was calculated by testing the mutation neutrality hypothesis [38] , as previously described by Coscoll√° and colleagues [39] . In order to investigate the presence of positively selected codons, the estimation of both positive and purifying selection at each amino acid sites was calculated from the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, v, as previously described [40] . Analyses were conducted using the Selecton version 2.1 software [41, 42] . The significance of scores was obtained by using a Likelihood Ratio Test that compares two nested models: a null model that assumes no selection (M8a) [43] and an alternative model that does (M8) [44] . Several approaches were used to determine the extent of recombination in the Tollip data set. First, Tollip protein sequences previously aligned at Clustal W2 [45] were backtranslated at BioEdit [46] package using standard genetic code, to normalize the codon frequencies and bring/make the comparisons more accurate. Once recombination eventually creates mosaic sequences in which evolutionary history at each site may be different. Then, GARD method [47] available in Datamonkey server [48] was also used to search for evidence of phylogenetic incongruences, and to identify the number and location of breakpoints corresponding to recombination events. In order to confirm GARD results, the recombination was assessed using a recombination cost ''delta dirac'' and mutation cost ''Hamming'', implemented in the Recco program [49] . The gap extension cost was fixed to 0.2 and the statistical significance of the analysis was obtained after 1000 permutations. Validation of the previously obtained results was performed with the six methods implemented in the RDP3 program [50] : RDP [51] , GENECONV [52] , BootScan [53] , Maximum Chisquared Test [54] , CHIMAERA [55] and Sister Scan [56] . The analysis was performed with default settings for the detection methods, a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.05, and a requirement that each potential event had to be detected simultaneously by four or more methods. A tridimensional model was generated starting from hsa protein sequence, evaluating I-Tasser server [57] , using default sets. This approach was used in order to assess the potential implications of our findings in the tertiary protein structure. Tests to search for ligands and hot spots in the protein were ran using the Profunc application [58] at PDBSum [59] .
