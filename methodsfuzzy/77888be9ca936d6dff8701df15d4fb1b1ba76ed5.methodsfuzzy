In analyzing the economic growth-air transport demand nexus in the US, the ARDL specifications for air passenger service (Case І) and air freight service (Case II) are specified as follows: Case ІI where Δ is the difference operator; and p is the lag order. In Eqs. (1) and (2), it is assumed that the air passenger (AP t ) and air freight services (AF t ) depend positively on the US real income (Y t ). In addition, to capture unexpected market shocks such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq war, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and the recent financial crisis over the sample period, four dummy variables-the 9/11 terrorist attacks (D 911 ) cover- 1) and (2) are known as the error-correction version of the ARDL, because each equation incorporates the short-run dynamics (first-differenced variables) and the long-run equilibrium relationship (lagged-level variables). This specification is distinguished from the method of Engle and Granger, (1987) in that a linear combination of lagged-level variables is used as a proxy for the lagged error-correction term. Pesaran et al. (2001) show that in this type of specification, the selected variables are said to be cointegrated if all the lagged-level variables are jointly significant in the equations. To test for this significance, an F-test with two sets of asymptotic critical values (upper and lower critical values) tabulated by Pesaran et al. (2001) can be conducted in Eqs. (1) and (2). An upper critical value assumes that all the variables are I(1), or nonstationary, while a lower critical value assumes they all are I(0), or stationary. If the computed F-statistic falls above the upper bound of critical value, the selected variables are said to be cointegrated. The main advantage of the ARDL over the standard cointegration methods (e.g., Engle and Granger, 1987; Johansen, 1995) is that it can be applied irrespective of their order of integration and therefore avoids the pre-testing problems. Further, the ARDL is proven to be more robust and performs better for small sample sizes than other cointegration techniques (Pesaran and Shin, 1999; Panapoulou and Pittis, 2004) . Monthly data that cover the period from January 1996 to March 2011 March (1996 March :m1-2011 ) are used to estimate Eqs. (1) and (2). The data for US air-passenger demand (in thousand passengermiles) and US air-freight demand (in thousand ton-miles) are collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) in the US Department of Transportation (USDOT). US per capita disposable income (in 2005 US dollars) is used as a proxy for US real income and is taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). 2 All variables are converted to natural logarithms.
