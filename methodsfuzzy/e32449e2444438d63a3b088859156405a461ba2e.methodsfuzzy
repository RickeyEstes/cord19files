Xueming Li had worked on EM for materials science in his early career. In 2009, he changed his research field to structural biology with the specific aims of improving the efficiency and resolution of biological cryo-EM. Obtaining a large number of particles to boost the overall signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing signal recording efficiency at high frequency are two key strategies for achieving atomic resolutions in cryo-EM. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Yifan Cheng at UCSF, Li introduced the general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU) into 3D reconstruction 17 and developed the data collection system named UCSFImage. 11 These efforts resulted in the acceleration of single-particle cryo-EM data processing by more than 10-fold. His studies on a new generation of detector (i.e., electron counting camera), and a new motion correction procedure, greatly facilitate cryo-EM reconstruction of small biomolecules at near atomic resolution. 18, 19 Since joining Tsinghua University in the spring of 2014, Li has focused on the development of new methods and technologies, aiming to make atomic-resolution cryo-EM analysis more accessible and convenient for a wide range of biological samples. Relying on the deep learning algorithm, Li and his collaborators, Jianyang Zeng ( ) and Tian Xia ( ), have developed a fully automated particle-picking program (Table II) . 20 Fei Sun ( ) of IBP has been collaborating with Fa Zhang ( ) of the Institute of Computation Technology, CAS, to build an automatic pipeline for high-resolution electron tomography (ET). They developed a feature-based tilt series alignment algorithm ATOM_align 21 for plastic section ET and a fiducial marker-based tilt series algorithm Marker-Auto 22 for cryo-ET. To improve the contrast and quality of ET reconstruction, they developed three different reconstruction algorithms: ASART, 23 FIRT, 24 and ICON. 25 Notably, ICON combines both nonuniform fast Fourier transformation and compressed sensing techniques and significantly recovers the missing information in both the angular intervals and the missing wedge.
