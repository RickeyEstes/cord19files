This study used on 82 blood samples collected from 67 pet cats (Table 1 ) grouped as follows: Group 1-Controls: 24 non-SPF (specific pathogen free) cats without any clinical signs of disease, selected from single-cat environments (n ¼ 7) or from catteries with no clinical cases of FIP recorded in the previous five years (n ¼ 17). Group 2-FCoV-exposed cats: 11 cats without clinical signs of FIP, selected from three catteries in which recent cases (1-6 months before the study) of FIP had been diagnosed. In one of these, five non-symptomatic cats were sampled: one (cat No. 51) developed a wet FIP 28 days later and results from this animal were not considered in group 2 and the cat was placed in group 3 and sampled also on days 28 ðT 28 Þ and 53 ðT 53 Þ after the basal sampling ðT 0 Þ. The four non-symptomatic cats (Nos. 25-28) remained in group 2 and were also sampled at T 28 , T 53 and T 83 . Group 3-FIP affected cats: 32 cats with spontaneously occurring FIP (25 wet and seven dry forms), diagnosed by necropsy, histology and/or by the detection of FCoV in the effusion using a direct immunofluorescence test (Paltrinieri et al., 1999) . Cats No. 51 and 57 were also sampled 25 and 40 days after the onset of the symptoms, respectively. Blood (3 mL) was taken from the jugular vein and serum was obtained by centrifugation. Total proteins were measured by a discrete analyzer (EOS-BRAVO, Hospitex) using the biuret colorimetric method. Serum protein eletrophoresis was performed as previously described (Paltrinieri et al., 2001) . Serology for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) was tested using commercially available ELISA kits (IDEXX). On 18 samples (four from group 2 and 14 from group 3) FCoV-serology was performed in our laboratory, using an Indirect Fluorescence Assay (IFA) (VMRD). As suggested by the producer of the kit, cats with antibody titres higher  * Sampled also 28, 53 and 83 days after the basal sampling. ** Sampled also 28 and 53 days after the basal sampling. *** Sampled also 40 days after the basal sampling.

The other 49 cats were already classified as FCoV-positive or negative by the referring veterinarians, based on results obtained using different semiquantitative in-clinic ELISA kits. Radial immunodiffusion (RID) kits were used to measure immunoglobulins (Ig) G and M (VET-RID, Bethyl Lab) and AGP (Cardiotech Services), according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. The concentration of SAA was determined using an ELISA kit (Tridelta Development) based on the method described by Mc-Donald et al. (1991) . Hp was measured using a kit (Tridelta Development) based on haemoglobin (Hb) binding method (Eckersall et al., 1999) . IgG, IgM, SAA, AGP and Hp were determined on 38, 38, 64, 77 and 82 samples, respectively (see Tables 2-4) . Statistical analysis used specific software (Statsoft). Results from the three groups were compared with each other using an one-way ANOVA followed by the honest significant differences (HSD) Tukey test. If a normality test showed that data did not have a normal distribu-tion, the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was used. ANOVA for repeated measurements or the corresponding non-parametric Friedmann tests were used to compare data obtained in repeated samplings. The percentages of positivity for FCoV in the three groups were compared using the chi-squared test.
