The database was developed from 4 experiments completed at the University of Illinois between the fall of 2013 and the fall of 2017 (Table 1) . Individual calf experimental data were obtained from Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) files from each experiment. All experiments included in the data set were nutritional experiments performed under commercial settings and were not expected to induce diarrhea. Information for inclusion included experiments that recorded daily intakes of milk replacer (MR), free water (FW), electrolyte solution (EC), and starter, as well as weekly BW (PS500 electronic scale; Brecknell, Fairmont, MN) and frame measures. A total of 313 (253 male and 60 female) Holstein calves transported from a commercial farm or cattle dealer to the University of Illinois calf research facility (Urbana) were included in the analyses. Calves were enrolled within the first week of life. Upon their arrival at the research facility or selection at a local dairy farm, their blood was sampled from the jugular vein into 10-mL evacuated serum separation tubes (Becton Dickenson, Rutherford, NJ). Blood was centrifuged at 1,300 Ã— g for 15 min, and a refractometer was used to determine total protein concentration in serum. A criterion for inclusion for each experiment was a total protein concentration greater than 5.5 g/dL, indicating successful passive transfer of immunity, but data for colostrum administration were unavailable for any calves at the time of enrollment in the experiments. All calves were vaccinated based on normal facility protocols.
