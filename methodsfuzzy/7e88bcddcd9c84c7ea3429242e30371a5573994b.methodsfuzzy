In this exercise, we focus on simulating the behavior of non-movers, who we posit experience greater peer effects than movers. Therefore, we simulate peer effects by adding the regression coefficient that captures peer effects among non-movers to regression coefficients that capture the influence of other sources of information on these residents. The simulation includes four counterfactuals, which we summarize in Table 8 . 23 The regression model for all counterfactuals is a variant of Eq. (2) estimated on a combined sample of movers and non-movers. 24 We simulate the visits of non-movers by iteratively generating predictions using coefficient estimates that capture the response of nonmovers to national SARS prevalence, peer group shocks plus coefficients on the regressors N i Δv Iijkt and D t N i Δv Iijkt , which capture peer effects among non-movers. In the first counterfactual, non-movers respond to public SARS information, peer group shocks, and social interactions. The second counterfactual preserves the response to public information and peer group shocks but shuts down peer effects. We accomplish this by simulating non-mover behavior using the coefficients from the first counterfactual but setting the coefficient on D t N i Δv Iijkt to zero. This approach measures peer effects in a conservative way because it counts the effect of N i Δv Iijkt as a peer group shock, even though this coefficient may partially reflect peer effects outside of the SARS period. For the third counterfactual, in which people only respond to public information, the simulation also zeroes out the coefficients on Δv Iijkt and all associated interactions. National SARS incidence is the only remaining variable that contains information about the epidemic. In the fourth counterfactual, the simulation excludes the response to national SARS incidence by also setting the coefficient on s t n to zero. This scenario provides a benchmark for comparison to the other counterfactuals.
