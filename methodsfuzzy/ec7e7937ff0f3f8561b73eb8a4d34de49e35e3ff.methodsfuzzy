Virus HHV-6B strain Z29 (available from the HHV-6 foundation repository, www.hhv-6foundation.org/research/repository/ repository-reagents-available) was kindly donated by Dr Helena Dahl, SMI, Stockholm. The virus was grown in MOLT-3 cells (available at ATCC: CRL 1552) in Iscoves complete medium (Iscoves medium with 10% FBS (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel), 3 ug ml 21 L-glutamine (Gibco, UK), 0.1 mg ml 21 gentamycin sulphate (Essex LÃ¤ kemedel AB, Stockholm, Sweden)) containing 5 ug/ml cortisone (Solucortef, UpJohn). After 2-3 weeks, the suspensions were centrifuged at 1500 rpm. The virus-containing supernatants were then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,0006g. The viruses were resuspended in Iscoves complete medium. Viral content was determined by quantitative PCR. The virus was inactivated at 2500 rad prior to use.
