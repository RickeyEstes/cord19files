Immunocompetent patients (n = 134) who attended the Immunology Service of the Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho (HUCFF)/Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) between August 2010 and November 2012 (median age 50.5 years; ranging from 19 to 80 years) were enrolled in the present study. The age distribution of the subjects was as follows: six were 19-24 years old, 21 were 25-35 years old, 17 were 36-45 years old, 33 were 46-55 years old, 37 were 56-65 years old, and 20 were >65 years old (Table 1) . Respiratory samples (nasal/throat swabs) were obtained from all participants. Following collection swabs were placed into viral transport media and stored at −70 • C until processed. Relevant clinical information including age, sex, and clinical symptoms were collected during the medical visit using a standardized questionnaire. Respiratory illness was defined by the presence of rhinorrhea and/or cough and/or respiratory distress and/or sore throat, with or without fever. Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 L of the collected samples using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification KIT (Promega, Madison, WI) and the Totally RNA ® Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specimens were tested for the presence of FLUAV and FLUBV, 16 HRSV (variant A and B), 17 HPIV species 1-4, 18 HRV species A and B (HRV-A/B), 19 HMPV, 20 HAdV, 21 HBoV species 1-4, 22, 23 WUPyV and KIPyV, 24 and HCoV species OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 25 by real time PCR assays. Genomic RNAs of FLUV, HRSV, HPIV, HRV, HMPV and HCoV were subjected to one cycle of reverse transcription (5 min at 25 • C followed by 45 min at 42 • C) using 50 pmol random primer (hexamer pd[N] 6 , Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a Veriti 96 well (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) thermocycler, prior to PCR amplification. Real-time PCR amplifications were performed for each virus separately, in an ABI StepOne Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification conditions consisted of 10 min at 95 • C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 • C and 60 s at 60 • C. Amplification was carried out in 24 L reaction volumes, including 5 L of DNA, specific primer for each virus and 12 L of Maxima ® SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas/Thermo Fischer Scientific, Canada). Each PCR assay for HMPV, HRV-A/B, HAdV, KIPyV or WUPyV used a single pair of primers. Multiplex assays were used to detect and discriminate the distinct species of FLUV, HRSV, HBoV, HIPV and HCoV. A conventional RT-PCR protocol was used for detection of HRV species C (HRV-C). 26 After the reverse transcription step, the viral cDNA was subjected to one step of 8 min at 94 • C followed by 35
