Live imaging of MHV-infected cells. DBT cells were seeded onto 35-mm MatTek glass bottom culture dishes for 48 h. Cells were then infected with MHV-⌬2-GFP3 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. In a separate experiment, cells were transfected with a GFP-expressing plasmid before being infected with MHV A59 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. In the viral entry experiment, cells were infected with DiI-labeled MHV A59 at an MOI of 25 PFU/cell and the infection was synchronized at 4°C for 30 min before imaging. Plates were transferred to a live-cell incubator surrounding the objective stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000S widefield fluorescence microscope. Cells were imaged with a 40ϫ oil immersion lens through differential interference contrast and fluorescein isothiocyanate short-pass filters, and images were captured at 30-s intervals. The resulting images were assembled with Nikon Elements, ImageJ, Adobe Photoshop CS2, and QuickTime Pro. , and spun at 27,000 rpm at 4°C for 90 min. Virions were then incubated with 5 M DiI (Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature, purified with a cushion of 1.5 ml 20% sucrose layered over 1 ml 60% sucrose, and spun at 28,000 rpm at 4°C for 90 min to remove the free dye. Determination of bulk fluid uptake. DBT cells grown to 80% confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips were infected with MHV A59 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. At designated times postinfection, 100 g/ml 800-nm fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (Corpuscular Inc.) were added to the cells, which were then incubated for 3 h at 37°C. DBT-hACE2 cells were infected with SARS CoV for 24 h at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell, and 100 g/ml nanoparticles were added for the final 3 h prior to fixation. Cells were washed with medium three times for 5 min. Drugs were added where indicated. Cells were fixed in 100% methanol or 10% formalin and then put at Ϫ20°C or 4°C, respectively, overnight. Cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The following steps were performed with immunofluorescence assay (IFA) wash solution (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature. Blocking solution was aspirated, and cells were incubated in primary antibodies where indicated (MHV, anti-nsp8 antibody at 1:250) for 45 min. Cells were then washed in IFA wash solution three times for 5 min per wash. Cells were then incubated in secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit-and antimouse-Alexa Fluor 488 [1:1,000] and 546 [1:2,000] [Molecular Probes]) for 30 min. Cells were washed again three times for 5 min per wash, stained with 0.005 mg/ml 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), washed with PBS three times for 5 min per wash, and then rinsed in water. Coverslips were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.) and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope or a by widefield microscopy with a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000S fluorescence microscope at 488 and 543 nm with a 40ϫ oil immersion lens. Images were processed and assembled with Nikon Elements, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop CS2 (12.0 by 64), and infected and mock-infected cells were processed in parallel. Scores for ruffling events were calculated by encrypting the images and allowing three independent blinded reviewers to evaluate if a cell was positive or negative for ruffling by utilizing fixed criteria and a binary system. Cells were determined to have internalized nanoparticles on the basis of a binary scoring system. Viral replication assays. For viral replication analysis, DBT cells were infected in triplicate with MHV A59 at the MOI indicated for each experiment. Following 30 min of adsorption with rocking at room temperature, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with prewarmed medium at 37°C. Aliquots of medium were collected at the indicated times postinfection, and virus titers were determined in duplicate by plaque assay on DBT cells as described previously (54) . EIPA (Sigma) was applied during infection as indicated. Toxicity assays. The toxicity of CdtA (Lacy lab, Vanderbilt), EIPA (Sigma), dec-RVKR-cmk (Calbiochem), and gefitinib (Selleck Chemicals) for DBT cells was tested for 12 h by using the Cell Titer Glo (Promega) protocol in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA assays. SMARTpools for murine Cdc42, Rac1, Pak1, RhoA, and scrambled siRNA were obtained from Thermo Scientific. DBT cells were reverse transfected in accordance with the protocol for Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). For siRNA knockdown and virus infection, cells were reverse transfected for 68 h and infected with MHV at an MOI of 1 for 8 h and nanoparticle and fixation protocols were completed as described above. To test protein knockdown, cells were reverse transfected, incubated for 72 h, harvested with non-SDS lysis buffer, subjected to immunoblot analysis, and imaged with the Odyssey Imaging System (LiCor). Band intensity was normalized to that of GAPDH. siRNA transfection efficiency was tested by transfection of AllStars Negative siRNA Alexa Fluor 488 (Qiagen). For replication assays with siRNA knockdown, cells were reverse transfected for 68 h before infection with MHV at an MOI of 1 for 12 h. UV inactivation and heat inactivation assays. MHV was UV inactivated by placing 1 ml of stock in an open 30-mm dish in a UV cross-linker for 45 min. MHV was heat inactivated by placing 1 ml of stock at 70°C for 45 min. Inactivated-virus titers were determined by plaque assay, and the virus was considered to be inactivated when plaque formation was absent. DBT cells were mock infected or infected with MHV A59, UV-inactivated virus, or heat-inactivated virus at an MOI of 1 or an equivalent volume of noninfectious virus for 8 h. Cell-associated virus assay. DBT cells were infected with MHV-FFL2 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. At 8 hpi, cells were washed twice with PBS and then DMSO or EIPA was added. At 10 hpi, supernatant was collected and cells were harvested in DMEM and subject to three rounds of freezing and thawing. The titer of each fraction was determined by plaque assay as previously described. Cells from a parallel experiment were collected in Luciferase Assay Buffer (Promega) and assessed for luminescence via the manufacturer's protocol. Furin inhibition assay. DBT cells grown to 80% confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips were mock infected or infected with MHV A59 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. Cells were left untreated, treated with 0.25% DMSO, or treated with various concentrations of dec-RVKR-cmk (Sigma) at the time of infection. Nanoparticle assays were completed, and cells were fixed and stained as described above and then imaged and assessed for nanoparticle uptake and syncytium formation. Fusion assays. DBT cells grown to 80% confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips were treated for 1 min with PEG-1500 (Sigma) and rinsed three times with PBS before incubation with nanoparticles for 3 h. Nanoparticle assays were completed, and cells were fixed and stained, imaged, and assessed for nanoparticle uptake and syncytium formation. Alternatively, cells were grown to~60% confluence and transfected with VSV-G in accordance with the protocol for Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) for 24 h before nanoparticle incubation for 3 h. DBT cells grown to~80% confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips were infected with MHV A59 or 2S at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. At 5 hpi, cells were treated with 2.5 g/ml TPCK trypsin (Sigma) for 5 min and washed once with PBS and then nanoparticles were added and the cells were incubated for 3 h, washed, fixed, stained, and imaged. DBT cells grown to 80% confluence on glass coverslips were mock infected or infected with MHV at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. Anti-CEACAM blocking antibodies were added at 2 hpi, nanoparticles were added at 5 hpi for 3 h of incubation, and the cells were washed, fixed, stained, and imaged. Statistical analysis. Statistical tests were used as noted in the figure legends and performed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The statistical significance of differences from uninfected or vehicle-treated samples is denoted as stated in the figure legends and was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test. P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
