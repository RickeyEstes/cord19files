Expression of recombinant RBD-Fc and S1-C9 proteins. Plasmid encoding a 193-amino-acid fragment of SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318-510), corresponding to the receptor-binding domain, fused with the Fc domain of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc) and plasmid encoding S1 protein (residues 12-672) tagged with C9 at the C-terminus (S1-C9) have been described previously [20, 24] . The RBD-Fc and S1-C9 proteins were expressed by transfecting 293T cells with the plasmids using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturerÕs protocol. Supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection. Recombinant RBD-Fc fusion proteins were purified by Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and S1-C9 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with anti-C9 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1D4 (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN). Immunization of rabbits. Two NZW rabbits were immunized intradermally with 150 lg purified RBD-Fc resuspended in phosphatebuffered solution (PBS, pH 7.2) in the presence of FreundÕs complete adjuvant (FCA), and boosted three times with freshly prepared emulsion of 150 lg immunogen and FreundÕs incomplete adjuvant (FIA) at 3-week intervals. Pre-immune sera were collected before starting the immunization and antisera were collected 10 days after each boost. Sera were kept at 4°C before use. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The reactivity of rabbit sera with various antigens was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, 1 lg/ml recombinant proteins (RBD-Fc or S1-C9) or purified human IgG (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) were used, respectively, to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, serially diluted rabbit sera were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by four washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by washes. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC). Immunoabsorption assay. The anti-human IgG-Fc in the rabbit antisera were depleted by immunoabsorption. Briefly, the immunoaffinity resins were prepared by coupling the human IgG (Zymed) to cyanogens bromide-activated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. Immunoabsorption was performed by diluting rabbit antisera 10-fold with PBS and incubating with the human IgG resin overnight at 4°C with constant rotation. Resins were then packed into columns and flowthroughs (anti-Fc depleted antisera) were collected. Neutralization of SARS-CoV infection. Neutralization of SARS-CoV infection was assessed as previously described [29] . Briefly, Vero E6 cells were plated at 5 · 10 4 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight. One hundred TCID 50 (50% tissue-culture infectious dose) of SARS-CoV BJ01 strain (GenBank Accession No. AY278488) was mixed with an equal volume of diluted rabbit sera and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was added to monolayers of Vero E6 cells. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded on days 3 postinfection as previously described [29] . The neutralizing titers represented the dilutions of rabbit antisera that completely prevented CPE in 50% of the wells [34] as calculated by Reed-Meunch method [40] . Neutralization of pseudovirus infection. A sensitive, quantitative, and safe neutralization assay based on reported SARS-CoV pseudovirus system [34, [41] [42] [43] was developed. HIV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein was prepared as previously described [23, 24, 43] . In brief, 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV S protein and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferaseexpressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) using Fugene 6 reagents (Boehringer-Mannheim). Supernatants containing HIV/SARS-CoV S protein were harvested 48 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection of ACE2-transfected 293T cells. Briefly, ACE2-expressed 293T cells were plated at 10 4 cells/well in 96-well tissue-culture plates and grown overnight. The pseudovirus was preincubated with serially diluted rabbit sera at 37°C for 1 h before addition to cells. The culture was re-fed with fresh medium 24 h later and incubated for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using lysis reagent included in a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottomed luminometer plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units were determined immediately on the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan US). Inhibition of S1-protein binding to soluble ACE2. Recombinant soluble ACE2 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 2 lg/ml was coated to 96-well ELISA plates (Corning Costar) in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 2% non-fat milk, 2 lg/ml S1-C9 was added to the wells in the presence or absence of serially diluted rabbit sera. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the anti-C9 mAb 1D4 was added and incubated at 37°C for an additional 1 h. After washing, the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed) and the substrate TMB were used for detection. Measurement of inhibition of S1 binding to cell-expressed ACE2 by flow cytometry. 10 6 stable 293T/ACE2 cells were detached and washed with HanksÕ balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). S1-C9 was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1 lg/ml in the presence or absence of rabbit sera at indicated dilutions, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After thorough washes, the mAb 1D4 was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10 lg/ ml and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed with HBSS and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-FITC conjugate (Sigma) at 1:50 dilution at room temperature for an additional 30 min. After washing, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed in a Becton FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Mountain View, CA) using CellQuest software.
