The RealAmp method was performed using the commercially available DNA thermostatic amplification kit (Guangzhou Diao Bio-technology Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were performed in 25 mL total volume containing 26reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4) 2 SO4, 0.2% Tween-20, 0.8M Betaine, 2.8 mM of dNTPs each), 0.5 mL of a 1:100 dilution SYBR green I (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM of each outer primers of F3 and B3, 1.6 mM of each inner primers of FIP and BIP, 0.8 mM of loop primer of LB, and 8 units of Bst polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). DNA amplification was carried out at 63uC for 60 minutes using the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner which was set to collect fluorescence signals at 30 seconds intervals. The ESE-Quant Tube Scanner used in this study was developed by a company (QIAGEN Lake Constance GmbH, Stockach, Germany). This device has an eight tube holder heating block with adjustable temperature settings and spectral devices to detect amplified product using fluorescence spectra. This equipment weighs about 1 kg with the dimensions 74 mm6178 mm6188 mm. The unit is completely portable and can be operated with a Li-Ion rechargeable power pack without external power supply. A small liquid crystal display (monitor) is available to display the results (as positive or negative) without the need of a computer. However, the device can also be used together with a computer to generate real time amplification plots as the reaction progresses [14] . The lower limit of detection of RealAmp determined using DNA obtained from A. baumannii ATCC19606 was 1610 3 CFU/ mL, but the conventional PCR only 1610 4 CFU/mL (Figure 2) . The time to amplification of RealAmp varied between 15-60 minutes. More time to amplification was required for clinical sputum samples with lower bacterial content. We selected 6 Acinetobacter species (8 strains) and 18 strains belonging to other genera ( Table 1 ). The results showed that the RealAmp assay could effectively differentiate A. baumannii from 18 strains of other non-Acinetobacter genera (Table 1 ). In addition, in the detection of the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii (Ac-Ab) complex, the results showed that the RealAmp assay could differentiate A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3 (Figure 3 ).
