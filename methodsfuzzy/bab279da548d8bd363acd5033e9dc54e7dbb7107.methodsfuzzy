Beijing is located in northeastern China and has a temperate and continental climate with four distinct seasons. Xicheng District is located in the centre of Beijing. Weekly district-wide ILI time series during 2008-2015 was obtained from Beijing Medical Institutions in Communicable Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System. ILI was defined as fever (temperature of 38Â°C or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. The ILI reporting system recorded weekly ILI cases into five age groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-59 and 60 years or older). Beijing Children's Hospital, affiliated with Capital Medical University is one of the sentinel hospitals for ILI surveillance, and accounts for more than half of the total paediatric outpatient visits in Beijing. To render our data more representative of ILI rates across the entire Beijing population, we age-standardised our ILI visit data in Xicheng District to the age distribution of Beijing's population. Age-specific population sizes in Xicheng District were collected from China's 2010 population census. We assumed that the age-stratified population remained constant over the study period. We ignored the immunised population as the influenza vaccination coverage was below 3% in the general population. School calendars for winter/summer breaks of primary and secondary schools in Beijing were obtained directly from Beijing Municipal Education Commission. School calendars were usually announced ahead of each academic year. Winter breaks were often in January and February, which lasts for 4 weeks and covered the 7-day statutory holidays for national Chinese New Year. Summer breaks are in July and August, which last for 7 weeks. The exact starting dates of winter/summer school breaks varied slightly across years and schools. On average, winter breaks in Beijing started at the 5th week and ended at the 8th week, while summer breaks started at the 29th week and ended at the 35th week. Data analysis ILI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of schoolchildren (5-14 and 15-24 years of age) to adults (aged 25-59 and 60 years or older) were used to measure the age shift of ILI incidence before, during and after the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks. In this study, we used 25 years of age as the cut-off point for schoolchildren and adults, because the ILI surveillance system in Beijing reported weekly ILI numbers by age groups of 0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-59 and 60 years or older, without specific age for each case. Owing to data availability, we grouped individuals under 25 years of age as schoolchildren, which was close to but might be a bit older than the true cut-off for schoolchildren. Similar to previous literature, [10] [11] [12] we compared schoolchildren-to-adults IRRs before, during and after the winter/summer breaks using two-sided Z tests. As the reduction in the ILI incidence during the winter break was maintained on average for 2 weeks after the end of the winter break, we allowed a 2-week window and defined before/after school breaks as 2 weeks apart from the break. We considered a 4-week window before and after the winter/summer break as a sensitivity analysis. In order to control the effects of unmeasured confounders of long-term and seasonal trends, we built a Serfling-specified Poisson regression model to assess the effect of winter breaks. A vector of dummy variables for each year was considered and sinusoidal terms of weeks were added in the Poisson model to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, respectively. As weekly adjacent ILI visits were temporally correlated, we further added an autocorrelated regression term to adjust for autocorrelation in the Poisson model. 13 Details of the model can be found in online supplementary appendix and tables S1-S2. Model fitting was evaluated by pseudo R 2 values. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks were used to evaluate the change of ILI incidence before, during and after winter breaks in each age group. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks smaller than 1 indicated that ILI visits during/after winter breaks were lower than those before winter breaks. We presented the estimates as weekly IRRs, which was calculated by dividing the weekly ILI incidence during/after winter breaks to an average of ILI incidence 2 weeks before winter breaks. Data analyses were conducted in R V.3.2.3 using package nlme. 14
