Statgraphics Centurion XVI (Version 16.1.18, Statistical Graphics Corporation) and R [37] were used for statistical analyses. Due to the small sample sizes, data were assumed not to be normally distributed and nonparametrical tests were chosen for statistical evaluation of all data. BSA levels in BALF supernatant were used for normalization of probable expressed local marker Post inoculation values were compared to the value 1 h before inoculation (−1 h) with the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Holm adjustment. -7 d: 7 days before inoculation; −4 d: 4 days before inoculation; dpi: days past inoculation; grey: animals prior to inoculation with C. psittaci; white: animals after inoculation with C. psittaci (n = 13). The 13 calves served as untreated controls in two previous treatment studies where the general clinical scores and concentrations of LBP in blood sera have been published separately [31, 34] concentrations, and the [local marker]/[BSA]-quotient was calculated. The Wilcoxon signed rank test with zero handling according to Pratt from the package coin [38] with Holm adjustment was used for comparing pre-with postinoculational values from blood samples. The sample obtained 1 h before inoculation was always used for comparison with post-inoculation values. For comparison of infected animals with uninfected controls, the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test with Holm adjustment was used. Values from BALF samples of infected animals were always compared to values from the first sample of the healthy controls, because the age difference was lowest at that time point. For comparing different time points of BALF samples in infected and in uninfected animals, Wilcoxon signed rank test with Holm adjustment was used. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Values of 0.05 ≤ P < 0.1 were regarded as tendencies and are given in the graphs. Unless stated differently, data are given as median and range. In 'Box and Whiskers plots' , outlier values (circles) are more than 1.5 times of the length of a box away from the median. Spearman Rank Correlations and multiple regression analyses were used to identify significant correlations between the severity of clinical signs and APPs assessed in BALF or blood, respectively.
