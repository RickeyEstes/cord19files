The efficient market hypothesis assumes that the stock market rapidly incorporates all available information into a firm's value (Mizik and Jacobson, 2004) . According to this hypothesis, investors buy or sell stocks according to updated expectations formed by the stock market. Thus, information providing a positive (or negative) cue in terms of expected future cash flows will have a positive (or negative) influence on stock returns. Because of the efficiency of the market, abnormal returns (ARs) provide an unbiased estimate of future earnings (i.e., changes in market value) due to an event (Fama, 1970) . A surprising event such as a crisis can strongly influence investors' decisions and thus ARs, because estimations underscore the long-term future cash flows of firms under crises. The event study method (ESM), pioneered by Fama et al. (1969) , is widely used to measure changes in stock prices (i.e., changes in market expectations of a firm's future value) associated with the release of new information. This method is used frequently in both finance and marketing research to investigate the effect of stars on the success of movies (Elberse, 2007) , television stock recommendations targeting naive investors (Karniouchina et al., 2009) , and brand extension announcements (Lane and Jacobson, 1995) , for example. Crisis management research has extensively used ESM to explore the impact of product recall announcements (Chen et al., 2009; Thomsen and McKenzie, 2001) , the announcements of mergers or acquisitions (Dodd and Warner, 1983) , positive and negative economic news (Chan, 2003) , and the financial crisis in Japan (Miyajima and Yafeh, 2007) . Despite the advantages of using the event study analysis, there are constraints when using the method such as the availability of precise event dates and the price-sensitivity of the events. It is not desirable to use the method when the event dates are not precise and when events are not price-sensitive because the impacts may not be incorporated into stock prices (Brown and Warner, 1980) . In addition, although most event studies rely on parametric test statistics, the parametric tests are considered to lack detailed assumptions about the probability distribution of returns. Instead, the use of non-parametric tests such as sign test and rank test is suggested by Cowan (1992) to ensure the results of parametric test statistics. In order to overcome such shortfalls of using event study method, the current study identifies the event dates using Marler Clark's website while cross-referencing the Lexis-Nexis database. To eliminate the confounding effects, treatments are made as explained in the methodology section. Lastly, both parametric and non-parametric tests are performed to confirm the reported test results as suggested by Peterson (1989) . While ESM has often appeared in hospitality research, most previous hospitality research measuring stock price movements has investigated the short-term impact of a specific event on hospitality firms. For example, Chen et al. (2007) examined the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks on the stock returns of seven hotels in Taiwan within one month after the outbreak. Salin and Hooker (2001) investigated the influence of food recalls on stock prices of four food-related firms after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days since the recall announcements. In addition, hospitality research investigated the impact of fed policy announcements (Chen, 2012) , terrorist activities (Chang and Zeng, 2011) , and IT news (Lee and Connolly, 2010) on hospitality stock returns. Although a number of studies examined the short-term impact of crises or events, research on the long-term effects of a food crisis is lacking. Thus, the current study investigates the longterm impact of food crises on a firm with a past crisis history. Although conducting a case study may not fully explain the impact of events on firms, the results obtained from a case study provide important empirical evidence about the severity of food crises and its impact on associated firms in the long run. This method is effective and widely used to examine crises, which tend to occur infrequently. For example, van Heerde et al. (2007) examined the impact of product harm crises on marketing efficiency by using Kraft Food Australia's 1996 salmonella food poisoning case. Rittichainuwat (2006) also used a case study of the tsunami that hit Thailand in 2004 to examine how the tourism industry recovers from natural disasters. In turn, this study examines the negative spillover effects reflected in stock returns due to food crises, using a case study of Jack in the Box, by adopting ESM.
