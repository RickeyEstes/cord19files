A cross-sectional design was used to conduct this study. The target population for the study was all nurses and doctors who were working at emergency rooms, operation rooms, intensive care units (ICU), surgical departments, and burn units during the 2014 war. These departments were chosen because they received most of the victims of the 2014 war. Therefore, nurses and doctors who started working at these units after August 2014 were excluded from this study. We used a census population that included all nurses and doctors who were working during the war time in the same departments and in the same three hospitals that were used in our previous study (Abu-El-Noor et al., 2016) .
