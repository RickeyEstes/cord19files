Although IgY can be purified from serum or plasma, egg yolk is by far the indicated source for purification (Brambell, 1970; Rose et al., 1974) . Eggs can be collected daily from the same hen and processed either individually or, as desired, from hens belonging to a similar immunized group. Over 100 mg of purified IgY can be obtained from a single egg (Tressler and Roth, 1987) . As hens continue producing eggs along at least 10 months, it is possible to obtain enormous amounts of specific IgY directed to the Fig. 3 . The antibody diversification in chicken by gene conversion. During this process pseudo-derived genes sequences (left) replace homologous sequences in rearranged immunoglobulin genes (right), giving rise to rearranged complete IgG (IgY) functional gene (center). This process occurs in bursa of Fabricius resident B cells. Resulting IgY molecules are secreted into the blood circulation and subsequently stored on egg yolk. same or related antigens (Loeken and Roth, 1983; Polson et al., 1980) . Different methods are currently used to isolate IgY from egg yolk. A simple non-expensive method was published by Bhanushali et al. (1994) ; the egg yolk is diluted 10-fold with distilled water, pH 5.5 and the suspension incubated overnight at 4 8C. The supernatant containing the IgY is collected by centrifugation (10,000 Â g at 4 8C for 30 min), and the temperature adjusted to 20 8C and subjected to 29% ammonium sulfate. Precipitate proteins are recovered by centrifuging the solution (10,000 Â g at 4 8C for 30 min), re-dissolving in 0.15 M NaCl and dialyzing against this same solution. The material can be further purified by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography to remove nonimmunoglobulin proteins. The resulting IgY preparations are re-dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl and dialyzed against this same solution. When specific purified IgY antibodies are desired, immune-affinity chromatography can be used. The antibodies are applied, at neutral pH, to a column prepared with a matrix, where the antigen of interest is bound. After washing with isotonic phosphate-saline, pH 7.2, to remove non-specific antibodies, specific bound IgY antibodies are eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.2-2.8 (Akita and Nakai, 1992; Kim et al., 1999; Almeida et al., 1998 Almeida et al., , 2003 Almeida et al., , 2008 . IgY, like mammalian IgG, is a reasonably stable protein. Diluted in saline-containing substances that preserve the protein structure, IgY antibody activity can be stored at 2-4 8C. When lyophilized, the IgY antibody activity is not diminished even after several months of storage at temperatures of À20 8C or less, or even for 1 month at 37 8C. IgY, however, is not very stable at temperatures of higher than 70 8C, and at pH below 4.0 (Shimitzu et al., 1994; Olovsson and Larsson, 1993; Larsson et al., 1999) . IgY can be stored for over 10 years in 0.15 M NaCl containing 0.02% NaN 3 at 4 8C (Shimitzu et al., 1994) . The IgY antibodies, such as mammalian IgG, can be labeled by routinely described methods with biotin or horseradish (Olovsson and Larsson, 1993; Larsson et al., 1999) . Similar to mammalian IgG, IgY is bivalent, but its hinge region is more rigid due to a very different amino acid sequence (Warr et al., 1995) . This region is probably responsible for the particular behavior that occurs when the IgY antibody combines with the antigen. The IgY antibodies are identified and quantified by the usual immunochemical methods. Reliable methods for characterizing or quantifying IgY antibodies include agglutination of particulate antigens, precipitation of soluble antigens, identification of cell-bound antigens by immunofluorescence techniques (Kim et al., 1999) and the blocking of some exposed active domains in wellcharacterized molecules, such as toxins, enzymes, hormones, or even other immunglobulins (Kubbo et al., 1973; Shimitzu et al., 1998; Akita et al., 1998; Hata et al., 1993) . Agglutination and precipitation of the antigens are particularly affected by the rigidity of IgY hinge region. The immune precipitin reaction, for instance, expresses better when performed in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl (Shimitzu et al., 1998) . IgY antibodies are, however, very effective at neutralizing toxins present in animal venoms (Almeida et al., 1998 (Almeida et al., , 2003 (Almeida et al., , 2008 Shimitzu et al., 1998; Akita et al., 1998; Hata et al., 1993) , and block some virulence factors such as BfpA, expressed by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (Almeida et al., 2003) .
