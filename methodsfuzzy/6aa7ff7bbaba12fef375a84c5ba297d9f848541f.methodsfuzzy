Twenty-two BEN patients were selected for NGS exome analysis. Informed consent was received from all participants enrolled in the study. We obtained peripheral blood samples from 2 series of patients-11 Bulgarian and 11 Serbian. Clinical assessment was performed according to unified criteria and was applied to all sample cohorts. Genealogical analysis was performed to exclude relatives among all study subjects.

All subjects were born of Bulgarian ancestry, born and living in the endemic region. DNA was extracted by standard phenol-chloroform extraction procedure and stored at −80 ∘ C. All samples were checked for DNA consistency by 1% gel electrophoresis. Serbian samples were collected from Serbian endemic regions. DNA was extracted by DNA extraction kit and stored at −80 ∘ C.
