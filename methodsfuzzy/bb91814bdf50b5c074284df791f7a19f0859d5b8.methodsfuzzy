Our research took place from May 1 to June 30, 2018. The research model used was a variation of the PRISMA model, including a research protocol, which was created for this purpose and consists of five research stages plus a writing phase. The five stages are as follows: preparation, data retrieval, data analysis, data synthesis, and results. Below, we briefly present each stage. There are many techniques regarding the data analysis approach used by various researchers that made estimations, analysis, or predictions. We have identified 109 published items with an explicit data analysis method (48.44%). The data analysis methods or statistical approach cannot easily be categorized, as scientists use sometimes multiple methods but, as a rule, all tried to find correlations between data from the official authorities for diseases and the data obtained from the web to create prediction rules. Twenty-four correlation techniques are used to correlate health data to data from the internet. The correlation techniques used are mentioned as Pearson correlation R, Spearman correlation coefficient, cross correlation function, simple correlation, or autocorrelation function. Others use the R 2 coefficient. It must be noticed that many researchers use combinations of models, which is very common in statistics, when the probability or the validity of the results must be examined and verified in depth before they are announced. Thirty-two types of regression or autoregression models were found. These models can be summarized as follows: linear regression and the ARGO model (autoregression with Google search data) which uses publicly available online search data and not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza epidemics, but also captures changes in people's online search behavior over time. GARMA model is the generalized autoregression moving average model, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model) or ARMA is the Autoregressive Moving Average model, and SARIMA is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model. It must be said that in all cases, the dependent variable is the data from the official health authorities, while independent variables are the data from the sources on the internet. Six studies have been conducted using linear, simple, and multivariate or multiple models. Seven use nonlinear models, such as logistic (logit), nonlinear regression, etc. Six researches use frequency analysis, for example, frequency of queries submitted in the internet. It must be mentioned that there are some other models used, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in two studies, and two used the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM). Of course, there are some cases that the statistical analysis requires more than one technique, for example, a research (Yanga, Santillana, & Kou, 2015) was conducted, using multiple techniques, such as: Other scientists use the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) models, referring to them as LASSO regression or LASSO algorithm, while others use other models, such as ANOVA, or other machine learning algorithms, or a combination of them. Regarding an early prediction, some researchers conclude that, using web data, prediction is possible. In nine studies, early prediction time (period) varies from one day up to 6Ã€13 weeks.
