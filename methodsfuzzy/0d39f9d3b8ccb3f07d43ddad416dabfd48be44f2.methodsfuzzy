The study was conducted in the College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-COM) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The College was established by Royal Decree No. 3-B-53278, dated January 1, 2004. It is located in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. The College provides programs for obtaining a MBBS degree and a Master's in Medical Education. We selected to study students enrolled in one of the above mentioned programs because of their exposure to the recent outbreak of MERS that occurred in the hospital they were studying in. This was a cross-sectional study that used consecutive samples because all of the male and female medical students in their clinical years (approximately 293) who agreed to participate in the study and completed the survey were included. The data were collected using a fourteen-item online questionnaire that evaluated the medical student's level of awareness regarding MERS. The questionnaire included three main domains that covered their knowledge about basic medical sciences, such as virology, and their knowledge of clinical management and infection prevention and control. Some of the questionnaire items were adapted from another study with permission from its' authors [16] . However, new items were added to measure the medical student's awareness of basic medical sciences regarding the virus. The questionnaire was reviewed and validated by three experts in the medical education, infectious diseases, and biostatistics fields. After the pilot study, the reliability was calculated and found to be 0.71. Data management and analyses were performed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. Descriptive analyses were performed by reporting the number and percentages for the different categorical variables. Regarding the inferential statistics, the associations between knowledge and the different subjects' characteristics were evaluated using chi-square, and a P-value was reported. A p-value <0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.
