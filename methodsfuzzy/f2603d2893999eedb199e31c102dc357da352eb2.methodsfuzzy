Experimental design. There were 30 male and 30 female animals in each of eight groups. Six groups were exposed to smoke (three each to test and reference cigarettes), one group was sham-exposed to air only, and there was one room control group (OECD, 198 1) . The six smoke-exposed groups were divided into low, medium, and high exposures for both test and reference cigarettes. The mainstream smoke from test and reference cigarettes was diluted to provide concentrations of 5, 15, and 30 hg of nicotine per liter of air at the animal breathing ports for low, medium, and high exposure groups, respectively. Animals in the sham control group were placed in nose-only restraint tubes and exposed to filtered, humidified air only; the room control animals were kept in the animal room. Animals were exposed to smoke for one hour per day, 5 days per week (Monday-Friday), for 13 consecutive weeks. To ensure that animals were always exposed to smoke on the 2 days prior to necropsy, they were exposed for an additional 3 days in Week 14, to give a total of 68 exposures. Of the 30 animals per sex in the two high exposure groups and in the sham controls, 20 were killed at the end of the go-day period. The remaining 10 animals per sex in each of these three groups received no further treatment for 7 weeks. Cigarettes. Cigarettes were puffed under the conditions used by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC): a 35-ml puff of 2-set duration, taken once per minute. The FTC condition of smoking to a fixed' butt length is not applicable to the test cigarette, which does not shorten in length during smoking. Consequently, a fixed number of puffs (see below) was taken instead from each cigarette. The test cigarette (Fig. 1 ) is based on new technology that heats rather than bums tobacco. The cigarette is lit in the conventional way. A highly refined carbon heat source in the tip of the cigarette generates warm air that passes through tobacco, tobacco extract, flavorings, and glycerol to form smoke. The reference cigarettes were manufactured in house and consisted of blended Turkish, Burley, flue-cured, and reconstituted sheet tobaccos. They were air-diluted by both paper and filter ventilation to yield, under the FTC conditions described above, quantities of WTPM, carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine that were similar to those yielded by the test cigarette. The reference cigarettes were, therefore, unlike any commercially available cigarette. On an analytical smoking machine, the FTC yields were approximately 10 mg WTPM, 11 mg CO, and 475 rg nicotine. Standard filters and cigarette papers were used. The relative humidities (RH) used in conditioning test and reference cigarettes were approximately 10% for the former and 50% for the latter, at room temperature for at least 48 hr prior to use in the animal studies. While full analytical chemistry was not performed on the smoke generated for inhalation exposures, such analysis has been performed on cigarettes similar to those used in this study (RJRT, 1988) . Experimental animals. A total of 540 (270 male and 270 female) Sprague-Dawley derived rata (CrkCD) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). The Sprague-Dawley was chosen over the F-344 because of the larger blood volume (useful for dosimetty: see below) and because of the authors' experience with this strain. Animals were separated according to sex and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 3 weeks prior to their first exposure. At the time of receipt of the animals, after 6 weeks of exposures, and at go-day and reversibility necropsies, sera were collected from 5 male and 5 female sentinel animals. The sera were tested by Microbiological Associates (Bethesda, MD) for the following antibodies to rodent pathogens: reovirus Type 3, mouse encephalomyelitis, Kilham's rat virus, Toolan's H-l virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Sendai, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and mouse adenovirus. Males and females were randomized separately into groups that were homogeneous for body weight, using a computerized random number generator. Records were kept of quarantine number, weight at randomization, and permanent identification number. The mean (*SD) weight of male animals was 152.8 f 8.0 g at delivery and 355.5 + 8.1 g at randomization; females weighed 141.9 + 7.6 g at delivery and 236.4 + 13.4 g at randomization. Animals were ear-tagged on the day after randomization, and exposures began on the following day. The rats were housed and cared for in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and amendments. The rooms had controlled lighting (12-hr dark and 12-hr light), temperature (20-22"(Z), and RH (40-60% cages, which were cleaned thrice weekly and refilled with clean cellulose bedding (Alpha-Dri, Shepherd Speciality Papers, Kalamazoo, MI). Animals had free access to commercially available certified feed (Purina Rat Chow 5002) and tap water, except during inhalation exposures. No analyses of feed or water were conducted. During the weeks when consumption was being measured, feed was presented as a meal. Feed was withheld overnight prior to necropsy. Exposure regimen. Smoke dilutions with HEPA-filtered, humidified air were established for equi-nicotine concentrations in both test and reference groups for low (5 pg nicotine per liter of air presented), medium ( 15 rg/ liter), and high (30 &liter) exposures. These concentrations were confirmed before any animals were exposed to smoke. The CO concentrations were compared with levels previously determined to be lethal for this smoke component, to ensure that animals did not die from COinduced hypoxia. Inhalation exposure system. Two 30-port smoke generators (Baumgartner and Coggins, 1980) were used, at the FIG conditions (except butt length) described above. In this device a carousel rotates at 1 rpm over a fixed puffing port, connected to a peristaltic pump. Each port on the carousel is attached to a cigarette holder, positioned horizontally. The holders have a latex ring that provides a leakproof seal around the filter of the cigarette. The output from each generation device was delivered to an adjustable air dilution apparatus (volume 100 ml), designed to mix the smoke with HEPA-filtered air to achieve the desired nicotine concentrations. Separate generation and dilution devices were used for test and reference cigarettes, and for the sham controls (total of three devices). The smoke generation devices were computer controlled cigarettes were loaded and lit automatically and were extracted after a fixed number of puffs had been taken from them. The computer (Commodore 64, Commodore Business Machines, Inc., West Chester, PA) ensured an even distribution of "current puff" among the 30 cigarettes on the rotating carousel, to minimize the changes resulting from variations in smoke yields per puff. Loading of the cigarettes at the beginning of a run was "staggered," taking approximately 15 min to reach equilibration (30 cigarettes ignited on the carousel). An additional "preignition" port was added to one smoke generator, to warm the tips of the test cigarettes and thereby improve subsequent ignition at the normal port. At the preignition port (three positions before the normal puffing port), a puff of 2-set duration and a volume of 65 ml was taken and exhausted (i.e., this puff was not distributed to the animal exposure device). The preignition port was not operational for subsequent, nonignition puffs on the test cigarettes. After preignition, a further seven puffs were taken for this cigarette, the same number total as was taken from the reference cigarette. The nose-only exposure apparatus consisted of two vertically concentric cylinders equipped with 64 animal exposure ports. The device was constructed as described earlier (Cannon et al., 1983) . The ports were arranged in a radial configuration with 8 ports on each of eight layers. At each port there was a continuous flow of smoke: continuously presented in the breathing zone of each animal and continuously removed by the outer annulus of the port. This arrangement provided a constant supply of fresh smoke to each animal. The volume of the internal cylinder was less than 1 liter and the age of the smoke at the animal ports was less than 1 sec. Animals were restrained in tubes fitting directly into the ports. Each animal was thus exposed only to fresh smoke, as the extraction lines were arranged so that there was no rebreathing of exhaled smoke. The design of the restraint tube permitted the tail of the animal to be positioned open to the atmosphere, minimizing stress associated with overheating. The supply of fresh smoke to each exposure port was 500 ml/min, greater than the estimated peak inspiratory minute volume of individual animals (Coggins ef al., 1982b) . Such a system minimizes breath-holding by the animals during exposure. Air flow and exhaust through the exposure device was maintained at 32.0 liters per minute. Before the initial animal exposures began, satisfactory achievement of uniformly distributed target concentrations was documented for the test and reference cigarettes at each of the three dilutions studied. The characterization ofeach machine included temporal and spatial variations in WTPM and nicotine, along with assessments of particle size distribution. The CO concentration was only analyzed temporally. During animal exposures, four ports were used for monitoring the smoke composition. One port on levels one and eight was used to measure WTPM concentrations, using gravimetric analyses of 44-mm glass fiber filter pads (Model 102 I2 15P 1, Cambridge Filter Corp., Syracuse, NY). Filters were preconditioned at 40-60% RH before use. Weights of pad plus WTPM were obtained immediately after completion of sampling, using a Cahn C-3 1 balance (Cahn, Cerritos, CA). Weights were recorded after the pads had been on the balance pan for 3-4 min, to standardize for any evaporation of materials from the pad. Three gravimetric determinations were made during the I-hr exposure to verify actual WTPM concentrations. Two filter pads were extracted with methanol to provide gas chromatography data on the nicotine and glycerol content of the smoke. The glycerol assay was not available during the first half of the experiment; samples were taken once per week during the remainder of the study. One exposure port was used for monitoring CO concentrations, using a Horiba PIR-2000 CO analyzer (Horiba, Irvine, CA) calibrated with certified gas mixtures (AIRCO, Research Triangle Park, NC). The WTPM was monitored "on line" by a RAM-l instrument (MIE Corp., Bedford, MA), which sampled smoke presented to the fourth exposure port. Chart recorders attached to the RAM-l and PIR-2000 instruments served as general records of exposures; CO data were recorded at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of exposure. Particle size distributions, as characterized by mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and associated geometric standard deviation (sigma g), were measured once per week by using a cascade impactor (In-Tox Prod-ucts, Albuquerque, NM) (Mercer et al., 1970) . With a flow of 1 liter/min (250 ml/min of smoke from the animal port and 750 ml/min of diluting room air), the calculated effective cut-off diameters for the seven stages were 2.00, 1.53, 1.17,0.89,0.68,0.52, and 0.40 pm. Calculations of MMAD and sigma g were made using probit analysis. Temperature and RH measurements were made once per week. Relative humidity was determined by comparing the dry bulb temperature and the dew point temperature. The RH was controlled by regulated passage of a portion of the air dilution stream through an air humidifier. This humidified portion then joined the nonhumidified air prior to mixing with the smoke. In-life biological measurements and observations. Animals were observed two to three times per day for each of the study days; times of onset and nature of clinical observations or death were recorded. Individual body weights were determined within 48 hr of receipt of the animals, during the randomization process, once per week during the study, and at necropsy (fasted). Feed consumption was determined during a 24-hr period in Weeks 1, 6, and 12 of the study, and the week before necropsy for the reversibility groups. Blood for determination of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) was drawn with heparinized micropipettes from the retroorbital sinus, under anesthesia with 70% carbon dioxide (CO,) in air. Samples were taken from five animals per sex per group within 3 min of removal from the exposure system, after 55 min of exposure in Weeks 1,4, 8, and 12. Samples were also taken at necropsy, to determine if any residual amounts of COHb were present 16-24 hr after the end of the exposure. Blood COHb concentrations and other hematology parameters were determined with a Model 282 CO-Oximeter (Instrumentation Laboratories, Hartford, CT), using the method described by Malenfant et al. (1968) . Blood samples were drawn similarly for assays of plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations, after 55 min of exposure during Weeks 2,5, 9, and 13 of the study and at necropsy. It was necessary to pool blood from several animals within the same group in order to have a sufficiently large sample volume. Individual animal data were obtained at necropsy. The anticoagulant in the plasma nicotine assay was disodium edetate (EDTA), and samples wefe analyzed using the method of Davis (1986) . Tidal volume, respiratory rate, and minute volume were derived from respiratory flow measurements made continuously during smoke exposures and during the 1 Oto 15-min preexposure. Measurements were also made in the sham-exposed group of animals. Measurements were made on four animals per sex in each of the groups dur-ingWeeks 1,5,9,and 13. The determination of respiratory airflow was made by whole-body plethysmography (Coggins et al., 198 I) . The animals were enclosed in sealed exposure tubes with a double latex neck seal to minimize leakage of air. Air flow from the plethysmograph passed through a Fleisch 0000 pneumotachograph (O.E.M., Richmond, VA) attached to a model MP-45 pressure transducer (Validyne. Northridge, CA). Plow was transduced into an electrical signal which was directly proportional to the volume inhaled by the animal enclosed in the plethysmograph. Tidal and minute volumes were not corrected for the difference between body volume change and inhaled volume. The authors' experience is that this difference is a constant and would result in values approximately 10% lower than those given. The electrical signal was processed by an upper airways irritation monitor (Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, CT) and pulmonary physiology software (Branch Technologies, Inc., Detroit, MI) for the final determination of respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume. These parameters were recorded once per minute during the evaluation period. Parameter averages were determined for each 60-min exposure and group comparison made against the sham-exposed controls. Blood samples were also taken from each of the plethysmograph animals for additional assays of plasma nicotine and cotinine (see above). Necropsy and histopathology. The Xybion Path-Tox System (Xybion Medical Systems, Cedar Knolls, NJ) was used to collate and analyze data. This software ran under the MPE-V operating system on an HP-3000 minicomputer. Twenty males and 20 females from the high exposure and sham-exposed groups were selected randomly from survivors at the end of the 90 days and were euthanized on the day following their last exposure, along with the remaining animals in the other groups. The time interval between the last exposure and termination was 16-24 hr. The remaining animals in the high exposure and sham control groups were euthanized 7 weeks later, with no further exposure to smoke. Animals were fasted overnight prior to necropsy. Animals were weighed and then anesthetized with 70% CO, in air and exsanguinated until cessation of heartbeat. Blood samples were collected from the vena cava for the different assays, using appropriate anticoagulants. The time of blood sampling was recorded. The following assays were performed on serum obtained from blood taken at necropsy: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, y-glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumin, creatinine, total bilirubin, and total protein. Serum samples were analyzed by Hazelton Labs America (Vienna, VA). A hematology profile, performed on whole blood samples by Roche Biomedical Laboratories (Burlington, NC), consisted of erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte volume, hemoglobin and hemoglobin concentration, total and differential white cell count, reticulocyte count, and platelet count. The anticoagulant used was disodium edetate. Animals euthanized at scheduled necropsy were subjected to a complete gross examination with special attention being paid to the respiratory system. The lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, adrenals, spleen, and heart (excluding major vessels) were weighed. After removal, organs were kept in saline and were blotted dry prior to weighing. Organ to body weight and organ to brain weight ratios were calculated. Tissues were fixed for 7-10 days in 10% neutral buffered formalin at a volume dilution of 1 part tissue to at least 15 parts formalin. After weights of lungs were obtained, they were infused with fixative via the trachea using gravity filling (25 cm water pressure) and the tmchea was ligated. The following tissues, and any gross lesions, were collected: adrenal glands, bone (femur and rib, with marrow), brain, cecum, colon, duodenum, eyes/optic nerve, heart, ileum, jejunum, kidneys, larynx, liver, lungs, lymph nodes (cervical, mediastinal, bronchial and mesenteric), mammary glands, nasal passages, ovaries, pancreas, parathyroids, pituitary gland, prostate gland, rectum, seminal vesicles, skeletal muscle, skin, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes, thyroid, thymus, trachea, urinary bladder, uterus, and Zymbal's glands. The carcass and remaining tissues were incinerated. Respiratory tract tissues (and related lymph nodes), plus heart and gross lesions, were processed for histopathological examination. Additionally, histopathological examination was performed on the esophagus, liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, and urinary bladder ofanimals in the sham-exposed and high exposure groups. The nasal tissues were cut at four different levels, as suggested by Young (198 1) who used I, II, III, and IV to describe transverse sections immediately posterior to the upper incisor teeth, at the incisive papilla, at the second palatal ridge, and at the level of the first upper molar teeth, respectively. The laryngeal sections were taken in the narrowly delineated base of the epiglottis, overlying glands in the ventral epiglottal area (Coggins et al., 1980) . Laryngeal sections in which the subepithelial glands were absent were considered to be in the wrong anatomical area for evaluations. In the lung, the anatomical definitions of Reznik-Schuller (1983) were used. In this terminology, each primary bronchus branches to form, in order: lobar bronchi, segmental bronchi, subsegmental bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts. alveolar sacs, and alveoli. In the untreated rat, goblet cells are typically found only in the bronchi, as defined above. Consequently, in this experiment only those airways with goblet cells bearing periodic acid-Schiff/Alcian blue (PAS/AB)-positive cytoplasmic mucus droplets were considered as bronchi (primary, lobar, segmental or subsegmental). Those narrower airways in which PAS-AB-positive goblet cells are absent were considered to be bronchioles. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Duplicate sections from nose (level III only), lung, larynx, and trachea were stained with PAS/AB, to facilitate evaluation of goblet cells. During a preliminary reading ofthe slides, the pathologist had access to the animal's exposure group and to previous findings. Once target organ(s) were identified, sections of those organs were randomized and reevaluated without knowledge of group or previous findings. The following abbreviations were used to describe the severity of the lesions: 0 = normal, 1 = minimal change, 2 = mild change, 3 = moderate change, 4 = marked change, 5 = severe change. Statistical analyses. In-life functions and data from blood samples were analyzed separately for each sex by exposure group using analysis of variance techniques. Provided that the results of Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance were not significant, group comparisons were made using the "AOVONEWAY" program in the MINITAB 5.1 series (MINITAB, State College, PA). If the results of the Bartlett's test were significant, comparisons with the sham control group were made by a t-test technique which made allowance for unequal variances ("TWO SAMPLE"). Organ weight data were analyzed using Dunnett's test; a similar technique was used for the physiology data. Histopathology data were evaluated statistically by the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smimov test (Siegel, 1956) . Statistical tests were carried out to 5%, two-sided criteria.
