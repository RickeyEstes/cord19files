Rats of the Lewis strain (Alab, Stockholm) were used. Groups of altogether 35 rats, aged 3, 7 and 14 days, were injected intracerebrally with 20/~1 of the Hamster Neurotropic (HNT) strain of measles virus. The virus suspension was prepared by homogenizing brains of infected BALB/c mice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10% w/v, titre 104, 7 ICLDs0/m0. Fourteen control rats were injected with suspensions of homogenized 10% uninfected mouse brain in PBS. At various time points after inoculation rats were killed by decapitation, brains dissected and approximately 4 mm thick coronar slices of the forebrain and parietal region were cut, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until sectioning. Serial 8/~m thick frozen sections were cut, fixed in cold acetone, briefly washed in PBS and subjected to enzyme immunohistochemistry. The following mouse monoclonal antibodies (MCA) were used: Ox19 (Dallman et al. 1982 (Dallman et al. , 1984 and W3/13 (Williams et al. 1977) , which label all peripheral T cells; W3/25 which labels T 'helper' cells and some macrophages (Williams et al. 1977; Barclay 1981 ); Ox8 which labels T 'cytotoxic/suppressor' cells (Brideau et al. 1980 ); Ox22 which labels some B cells and a subpopulation of T cells in which both T 'helper' and T 'cytotoxic/suppressor' cells may be contained ); Ox6 which labels class II transplantation antigens (McMaster and Williams 1979) and Ox18 which labels class I transplantation antigens (Fukumota et al. 1982) . The Ox19, W3/13, W3/25, Ox8 and Ox6 hybridomas were provided by Dr. Alan Williams, University of Oxford, U.K. Antibodies were purified from culture supernatants (Holmdahl et al. 1985) . Ascites fluid containing the Ox18 and Ox22 MCAs were purchased from Seralab, Crawley-Down, U.K. Two different polyclonal rabbit anti-MHC class I antigen antisera were used. Both these reagents were directed against the heavy chain and the fl2-microglobulin (Tr~ig~dh et al. 1979) . For visualization of measles virus antigen a mouse monoclonal antibody (16 AC5) directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) was used (Norrby et al. 1982) . A modified peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method (Sternberger 1974 ) was used. Briefly, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by preincubation in 0.3% H202. The sections were then incubated with appropriate dilutions of different specific antibodies. After washing, a goat anti-mouse IgG (Dakopatts, Denmark) was applied. This antiserum had been adsorbed with rat serum coupled to Sepharose (Pharmacia, Sweden) prior to use. After washing in PBS, mouse PAP (Dakopatts) was added. To visualize immunoglobulins and B cells, sections were incubated with a rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin. These sections and the specimens incubated with the polyclonal anti-MHC class I antigen were then sequentially incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (Dakopatts) and rabbit PAP (Dakopatts). Possible cross-reactivity of the anti-rabbit antiserum with rat Ig was eliminated by extensive adsorption by Sepharose-coupled rat immunoglobulins. The specificity of the antibodies was tested on frozen sections of normal rat lymph nodes and spleens. Omission of the first layer of antibody was used as a control. The peroxidase reaction was made according to Kaplow (1975) . Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. Slides were coded, read blindly and the mean number of cells per visual field was estimated at a magnification × 200.
