All of the included trials were assessed to be of generally poor methodological quality. All the RCTs mentioned that 'participants were randomized into groups' , but did not report the detailed methods for sequence generation. We contacted the authors of the included RCTs, one trial [11] claimed that they drew lots to assign the participants; the other trials did not respond to our inquiry. Allocation concealment and blinding was not mentioned in any RCT. And because of the different formulation of CPMs and control intervention, it was not likely to conduct blinding either to investigator or to patients. No trial reported drop-out or withdrawals, or mentioned intention-to-treat analysis. Selective reporting was unclear because we could not access to the protocols of included RCT. All the included RCTs did not register in relevant authoritative websites prior to the start of the study. The risk of bias summary about each risk of bias item for each included study is shown in Figure 2 . Effect estimates
