Cells and viruses. The WT, mutant, and mouse-adapted versions of MERS-CoV used in this study were previously described (13, 15) and were cultured on Vero 81 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Opti-MEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, South Logan, UT) along with antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). Growth curves in Vero, Calu-3 2B4, and HAE cells were performed as previously described, with examination of multiple samples (n Ն3) at each time point (9, 31) . Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with virus or mock diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37°C. Following inoculation, cells were washed three times and fresh medium was added to signify time zero. Samples were harvested at the time points described. For IFN pretreatments, 100 U/ml recombinant human IFN-␤ (PBL Laboratories) was added to cells 16 h prior to inoculation, and the cells were infected as described above. Stable shRNA knockdown Vero cell lines for both IFIT1 and IFIT2 were previously described for previous CoV studies and had phenotypic validation (10) . All virus cultivation was performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory with redundant fans in biosafety cabinets as described previously by our group (32, 33) . All personnel wore powdered air purifying respirators (3M Breathe Easy) with Tyvek suits, aprons, and booties and were double gloved. Construction of WT and NSP16 mutant viruses. Both WT and mutant viruses were derived from either MERS-CoV EMC or a corresponding mouse-adapted (MA1) infectious clone as previously described (13) . For NSP16 mutant construction, the D130A mutation changed the sequence from the MERS-CoV E fragment, which was cloned into the pSMART vector (Lucigen) and used for alanine scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues in nsp16. For the D130A change, a product was generated by PCR with primers against MERS-CoV NSP16 [fragment 1, EMC:E#2(ϩ) (TGAACTACCTGTAGCTGTAG) and EMC:EmuC(Ϫ) (NNNNNNGCTCTTCTCGCGGAAATAACAAGATCCACTTG); fragment 2, EMC:EmuC(ϩ) (NNNNNNGCTCTTC CGCGATGTATGATCCTACTACTAAG) and EMC:E#6(Ϫ) (CAACCTCAATACAAGCAGAC)]. The two resulting products were digested with SapI (in boldface) and ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase. This product was then digested with PpuMI and NsiI and used to replace the region of the EMC E plasmid (puc57) that had been similarly digested. Thereafter, plasmids containing WT and mutant MERS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. In vitro transcription reactions were then performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells. The medium from transfected cells was harvested and used as seed stock for subsequent experiments. Viral mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis prior to use. Synthetic construction of NSP16 mutants was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee. RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of DE. RNA isolation and microarray processing, quality control, and normalization from Calu-3 2B4 cells were carried out as previously described (36) . Differential expression (DE) was determined by comparing virus-infected replicates with time-matched mock-treated replicates. Criteria for DE in determining the consensus ISG list were an absolute log 2 change of Ͼ1.5-fold and a false-discovery rate-adjusted P value of Ͻ0.05 for a given time point. Clustering and functional enrichment. Genes identified as differentially expressed were used to generate clustered expression heat maps. Hierarchical clustering (using Euclidean distance and complete linkage clustering) was used to cluster gene expression according to behavior across experimental conditions. The David online resource (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to acquire functional enrichment results for the genes in each cluster. David output was manually summarized for each cluster. Plots were generated with R. Ethics statement. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for the care and use of laboratory animals of the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC; permit A-3410-01) approved the animal study protocols used in this study (IACUC protocols 15-009 and 13-072). Mouse infections and vaccinations. Ten-to 20-week-old BALB/c (Envigo/Harlan) or CRISPR-Cas9targeted 288-330 ϩ/ϩ C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (in accordance with UNC IACUC guidelines) and intranasally inoculated with a 50-l volume containing 10 6 PFU of WT MERS-CoV, dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV, mouse-adapted variants, or PBS (mock inoculation) as indicated in the figure legends. Infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease, and lung virus titers were determined as described previously (37) . In vivo adenovirus transduc-tion with Dpp4 were performed as previously described (14) . For vaccination experiments, 10-to 20-week-old 288-330 ϩ/ϩ mice were infected with 10 6 PFU of dNSP16 mutant MERS-CoV as described above, monitored for clinical symptoms for 7 days, and then challenged 4 weeks postvaccination with 10 6 PFU of mouse-passaged MERS-CoV MA1. Animal housing, care, and experimental protocols were in accordance with UNC IACUC guidelines. Data availability. Raw microarray data for these studies were deposited in publicly available databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (37) and are accessible through GEO series GSE65574.
