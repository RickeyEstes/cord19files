All statistical analyses were performed in R. For the analysis of 10-mer sequence space coverage, Figure 2 shows that the association with genome size is non-linear, so we log transformed genome size. In addition, the chance of evenly covering sequence space in a random genome decreases as the frequency of nucleotides is skewed from a uniform distribution. Thus, we transformed GC content by taking the absolute value of (0.5 -GC content). These transformed variables were used as predictors of coverage in a multivariate linear regression that included an interaction term between the predictors. Both variables and their interaction were significant at p < 0.01. We used Cook's distance to identify the top 1% of genomes that have the strongest influence on the regression analysis. We excluded those five genomes and refit the multivariate regression model. We then used that model to predict the coverage values of the five excluded genomes based on their log genome sizes and GC content deviation from 0.5. Only one of the five genomes had a 10-mer coverage value that fell outside the 99.9% prediction range and was therefore identified as an outlier in the model.
