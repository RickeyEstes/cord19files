Development of basic technology LAMP is a one-step amplifi cation reaction that amplifi es a target DNA sequence with high sensitivity and specifi city under isothermal conditions. The mechanism of the LAMP reaction can be explained in three steps, an initial step, a cycling amplifi cation step, and an elongation step. An animation on the website is useful for better understanding of the principle. 13 LAMP employs a DNA polymerase with strand-displacement activity, along with two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and outer primers (F3, B3) which recognize six separate regions within a target DNA (Fig. 1) . The LAMP assay has high specifi city, because the amplifi cation reaction occurs only when all six regions within a target DNA are correctly recognized by the primers. The addition of reverse transcriptase makes it possible to amplify DNA from RNA sequences (RT-LAMP). While PCR has a wide range of applicability as the fundamental tool for molecular biology methods such as molecular cloning, the LAMP method has many characteristics that make it suitable for the rapid and simple detection of nucleic acid sequences in samples. Optimization of the LAMP method as a rapid diagnostic tool has been done as follows. • So-called Loop-primers (LF, LB), which are additional primers designed to anneal at the loop structure in LAMP amplicons, can accelerate and enhance the sensitivity of the LAMP reaction ( Fig. 1 ). 14 The loop primers are now commonly used in the practical applications of LAMP. • Real-time turbidity measurement by a cost-effective photometer with incubation function has enabled the kinetic analysis of the LAMP reaction without the need for any detection reagents such as a fl uorescence intercalator. This is because the LAMP reaction produces insoluble magnesium pyrophosphate in the course of the amplifi cation reaction. It has been reported that the realtime turbidity analysis of LAMP makes it possible to quantify the initial amount of template DNA in the samples. 15 Furthermore, a LAMP positive reaction can be easily detected by visual endpoint judgment of turbidity ( Fig. 2A) . 16 The development of such a simple detection method as well as an inexpensive real-time turbidimeter has contributed to the acceptance of the LAMP amplifi cation method. • Recently, an effective endpoint detection method has been developed by Tomita et al. 17 using calcein, whose fl uorescence is quenched by the binding of manganese ions (Fig. 2B ). Because the manganese ions are bound by pyrophosphate ions produced in the course of the amplifi cation reaction, calcein produces bright fl uorescence in a positive reaction. The simplicity and clarity of this method should make it applicable even for resource-limited laboratories in rural areas of developing countries. • It has been shown that LAMP exhibits less sensitivity to inhibitory substances present in biological samples than PCR. 18 This robustness of LAMP against inhibitors can contribute to saving the time and cost required for sample processing steps. Sometimes, the diffi culty of designing LAMP primers keeps researchers away from trying to use LAMP in their research work. The free software for designing LAMP primers (Primer Explore; Fujitsu, Tokyo, Japan) can provide candidate LAMP primers for a target sequence. 19 The latest version of the software can take into account mutations in the target sequence for designing either mutation-sensitive or -insensitive primers.
