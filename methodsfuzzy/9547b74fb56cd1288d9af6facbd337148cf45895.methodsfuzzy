Autopsies. This study was conducted at a tertiary health care center. From 1990 to 2008, 26,560 medical autopsies were performed at this center, with an annual mean of 1,889. We examined the autopsies of the 4,710 (17.7%) patients in whom ARF was the cause of death. In 980 of these patients, the histological pulmonary findings could not be reviewed because the pulmonary tissue was not available (it was classified as ''without analysis''); histological pulmonary analyses were performed in the remaining 3,730 (79.2%) cases. In this study, we reviewed all of the available microscopic and macroscopic diagnoses of death at autopsy, along with the patient medical records. The only inclusion criterion for the definition of ARF was based on arterial blood gases (PaO2,60 mmHg or PaCO2.50 mmHg with pH,7.30) while breathing room air. [1] [2] [3] We excluded patients younger than one year of age and individuals not diagnosed with ARF. We also obtained data regarding each patient's age, sex, and major underlying associated diseases (as determined at autopsy). The clinical data from the patients enrolled in the study were collected with the approval of the Internal Review Board for this study, and informed consents were obtained from family members to perform the autopsies. After a complete review, the pulmonary pathological reports were categorized as follows: Ndiffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which was defined as diffuse involvement and a uniform temporal appearance of alveolar collapse, hyaline membranes, obliterative fibrosis, neo-septal formation, and moderately organizing fibrosis; Npulmonary edema (PE), which was defined as the accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in the alveolar spaces that gave the appearance of a granular, pink coagulate within such spaces; Nalveolar hemorrhage (AH), which was defined as the presence of blood in the alveolar spaces; and Nlymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia (LPIP), which was defined as widened and edematous alveolar septa, usually accompanied by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. All the lungs were analyzed by microscopy, even when the medical records indicated the patient's diagnosis. The lungs were fixed in 10% formalin prepared in 0.9% saline for at least four weeks. We studied a minimum of five sections per lung for a total of ten sections per person, regardless of the presence or absence of morphologically demonstrable lesions. The paraffin-embedded tissue sections were assessed following hematoxylin and eosin staining. To document the presence and distribution of the wide spectrum of infectious agents and neoplasms to which this population was susceptible, we prepared a variety of special stains (periodic acid-Schiff staining, immunohistochemical analysis, fluorescence, Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining, Gram acid-fast staining, Mucicarmine acid-fast staining, and Gomori's methenamine silver acid-fast staining) for selected tissue sections. Bacterial bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as the presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in bronchioles and adjacent alveoli. For the diagnoses of cytomegalovirus and fungal pneumonia, histological evidence of lung involvement was required, with or without tissue culture. Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined as sepsis with the addition of organ dysfunction or the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypotension, which may or may not have been responsible for the aggressive fluid resuscitation. The diagnoses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and atypical mycobacterial infection were confirmed using fluorescence, the Ziehl-Neelsen techniques and a Lowenstein-Jensen culture. The proportion method and biochemistry were used to identify all of the positive cultures. Statistical analysis. The descriptive analysis of the data included median, minimum, and maximum values. The probabilities (odds ratios) that patients with underlying diseases and comorbidities would develop specific pulmonary histopathological patterns and die of ARF-related pulmonary alterations were determined by logistic regressions. The independent variables included the following major diseases and/or comorbidities: BBP, cancer, liver cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS, acute myocardial infarction, systemic arterial hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney failure, and tuberculosis. All the statistical procedures were performed using the SPSS v10.0 statistical software. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of 5%.
