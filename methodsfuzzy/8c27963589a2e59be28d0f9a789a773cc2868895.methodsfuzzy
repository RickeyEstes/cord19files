Ziheng Yang and Joseph P. Bielawski The past few years have seen the development of powerful statistical methods for detecting adaptive molecular evolution. These methods compare synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in protein-coding genes, and regard a nonsynonymous rate elevated above the synonymous rate as evidence for darwinian selection. Numerous cases of molecular adaptation are being identified in various systems from viruses to humans. Although previous analyses averaging rates over sites and time have little power, recent methods designed to detect positive selection at individual sites and lineages have been successful. Here, we summarize recent statistical methods for detecting molecular adaptation, and discuss their limitations and possible improvements.  All the methods for detecting positive selection reviewed here appear to be conservative. They detect selection only if d N is higher than d S -selection that does not cause excessive nonsynonymous substitutions, such as balancing selection, might not be detected. The pairwise comparison has little power because it averages the ratio over sites and over time. Methods for detecting selection along lineages work only if the ratio averaged over all sites is Ͼ1. Similarly, the test of positive selection at sites works only if the ratio averaged over all branches is Ͼ1. If adaptive evolution occurs only in a short time interval and affects only a few crucial amino acids, none of the methods is likely to succeed. Constancy of selective pressure at sites appears to be a much more serious assumption than constancy among lineages, especially for genes likely to be under continuous selective pressure, such as the HIV env gene. Indeed, models of variable selective pressures among sites 36,37 have been successful in detecting positive selection, even in a background of overwhelming purifying selection indicated by an average ratio much smaller than one 37, 38, 41, 42 . Models that allow to vary among both lineages and sites should have increased power. The methods discussed here also assume the same ratio for all possible amino acid changes; for example, at a positively selected site, all amino acid changes are assumed to be advantageous, which is unrealistic. Although amino acid substitution rates are known to correlate with their chemical properties, the relationship is poorly understood 43, 44 . It is also not entirely clear how to define positive selection in a model accounting for chemical properties. It will be interesting to perform computer simulations to examine the power of various detection methods and to investigate how this is affected by important factors, such as the size of the gene, sampling of species (sequences) and the level of sequence divergence. Including more sequences in the data should improve the power of site-based analyses. Sequence divergence is also important because neither very similar nor very divergent sequences contain much information. Very divergent sequences might also be associated with problems with alignment and unequal nucleotide compositions in different species. Analyses discussed here, which require information from both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, are expected to have a narrower window of suitable sequence divergences than phylogeny reconstruction. The large-sample 2 approximation to the likelihood-ratio test statistic might also be examined, but limited simulations suggest that typical sequence data (with Ͼ100 codons) are large enough for it to be reliable. For very short genes or gene regions and especially at low sequence divergences, Monte Carlo simulation might be needed to derive the null distribution. The likelihood analysis assumes no recombination within a gene. If recombination occurs, different regions will have different phylogenies. Empirical data analysis suggests that the phylogeny does not have much impact on tests of positive selection and identification of sites, and one might suspect that recombination will not cause false positives by the likelihood-ratio test. However, simulation studies are necessary to understand whether this is the case.
