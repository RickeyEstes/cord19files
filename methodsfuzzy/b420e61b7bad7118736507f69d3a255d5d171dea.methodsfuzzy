This is a Phase I/II, interventional trial designed to assess the safety and trends in clinical course of Ebola virus disease in patients ≥18 and <70 years of age treated with either IFN β-1a and usual supportive care, or usual supportive care only. It is associated with appropriate monitoring of therapy. Planned Sample Size: Pilot: 30-50 Treatment and Specimen Collection Schedules and Duration of Follow-up: Subcutaneous injection of IFN β-1a daily for up to 10 days. Up to 11 blood samples will be drawn on days 1-10 and one month after discharge from the treatment centre. Subjects will be followed for the duration of their stay in the treatment centre. From first patient enrolment to last patient last visit, it is expected that the study will last 4 months. Endpoints will be described and compared between baseline and day 10, for the treatment group using cross-tabulation tables and Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables, t-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and Wilcoxon non-parametric test for non-normally distributed continuous or ordinal variables. Data collected will be compared with a retrospective analysis of agematched Ebola-infected individuals who presented with similar symptoms (and viral loads) and who did not receive IFN β-1a. Safety variables such as fever will be considered in three different formats: 1. As ordinal, representing various levels of severity of the AE. For instance, fever will be described as "none", "mild", "moderate" or "severe". 2. As binary, considering only the presence vs. the absence of the AE. 3. As binary, considering the most serious expression of the AE. For instance by grouping "moderate" and "severe" together. Separate analyses for time periods of 0-3, 4-7 and 8-10 days will be conducted. For each of these time periods the most severe report of the AE for each participant will be counted. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be considered in two ways: presence of any event and presence of any event related to the treatment. Viral clearance and symptom endpoints will be analyzed as binary variables for detection (presence) or non-detection (absence) as well as continuous variables where applicable (e.g.; quantitative RT-PCR measurements. Demographics, and underlying conditions will be described by means and standard deviation for continuous variables, by median and interquartile range for ordinal or count variables, and by frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Endpoints will be described and compared between treatment and usual standard of care groups using cross-tabulation tables and Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables, t-test for normally distributed continuous variables and Wilcoxon non-parametric test for non-normally distributed continuous or ordinal variables.

Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be considered in two ways: presence of any event and presence of any event related to the treatment. Symptoms will be assessed as a repeated measure using GEE modelling. Survival will be analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox-proportional hard modeling with 2 week and 1 month survival rates determined. Viral clearance will be analyzed as binary variables for detection (presence) or non-detection (absence) as well as continuous variables where applicable (e.g. quantitative RT-PCR measurements.
