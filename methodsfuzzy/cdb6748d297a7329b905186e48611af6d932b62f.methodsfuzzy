Barrier compromising methods rely on enhancing the permeability of the very effective SC barrier by chemical or physical means to facilitate access of the antigen to the APCs. Chemical permeation enhancers are a very heterogeneous group of substances with widely varying physico-chemical properties as well as mechanisms of action. Examples are surfactants, terpenes, laurocapram, dimethylsulfoxides, fatty acids, alcohols, water and urea (Kaushik et al., 2008) . An ideal permeation enhancer should be pharmacologically inert, chemically stable, potent in low concentrations, non-toxic, non-sensitizing and non-irritant. It should also act rapidly and the barrier function should recover quickly. The main principles permeation enhancers may use for improving percutaneous penetration of other compounds are: (i) perturbation, fluidization or disruption of SC lipids; (ii) extraction of membrane components; (iii) increase of the compound solubility within the SC membrane; (iv) improvement of skin hydration; and (v) interaction with keratin. Especially the more potent enhancers use several of the above mechanisms. Typical enhancement ratios for a small molecule such as hydrocortisone are in the range of 2.8-28 in human skin in vitro (Ibrahim and Li, 2009) . For nanoparticles there are only few reports. Experiments with nude mice indicated that skin permeation of zinc oxide nanoparticles (10 nm) could be enhanced by the addition of oleic acid or ethanol which fluidize the intercellular SC lipid bilayers and extract lipids (Mortensen et al., 2008; Kuo et al., 2009) . It should be kept in mind that especially rodent skin acts differently towards chemical penetration enhancers when compared with human skin (Bond and Barry, 1988; Simon and Maibach, 1998) . In human and pig skin the absorption of superfine Au-NPs and QDs required the combined application of ultrasound and sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) (Seto et al., 2010; Lopez et al., 2011) . Penetration was seen mostly in the hair follicles as well as seen in localized spots in the dermis which they reach supposedly via imperfections in the intercellular lipid layers (Lopez et al., 2011) . Such imperfections are sufficiently rare to explain the spot-like distribution of the particles (Paliwal et al., 2006; Lopez et al., 2011) . The use of SDS in vivo is problematic due to its strong sensitization potential (Kaushik et al., 2008) . In contrast, a lot of work has been done to support that physical barrier disruption methods may be used for TCI. A historical example where this concept has successfully been employed is the immunization against smallpox that finally led to the eradication of the disease. An effective and strong immune response was induced scratching or printing the vaccine into the skin, called scarification (Henderson, 1999) . According to the clinical trial database of the US National Institute of Health (2011), skin permeabilizing techniques that are currently evaluated in clinical trials include jet injection and gene gun devices, microneedle patches, exfoliation, electroporation and thermal ablation techniques. This concerns vaccines against seasonal influenza, different kinds of cancer (e.g. melanoma, prostate cancer, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma), human papilloma virus, hepatitis A and C, HIV, and malaria. Apart from facilitating the invasion of the vaccine the barrier disruption also leads to a non-specific immunostimulation, which improves the antigen-specific immune responses. This includes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1a, IL-1b, and GM-CSF by KCs. TNF-a and IL-1b trigger the upregulation of the expression of a6 integrins, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM.1), CD86 and MHC class II molecules, which then promote the dissociation of LCs from KCs and their subsequent maturation and migration (Streilein et al., 1982; Proksch et al., 1996; Kupper and Fuhlbrigge, 2004; Karande and Mitragotri, 2010) . The time unto re-population of the epidermis with LCs is 24 h, which implies that the epidermal pool of LCs can quickly be replenished when needed (Streilein et al., 1982) . One of the sources of LCs is the hair follicles (Gilliam et al., 1998) . Several such physical permeability enhancing methods have been combined with innovative nano-(or micro-) formulations of vaccines in order to combine the advantages of the particulate formulation with those of the barrier disruption. To this end different delivery vectors, such as liposomes, virosomes, transferosomes, nano-or micro-beads and viral vectors, have already been tested mainly in animal models (Babiuk et al., 2000) . A system that has made it into clinical testing is the HIV-1/AIDS DermaVir patch. It contains a plasmid DNA vaccine (pDNA) encoding for all major HIV-1 antigen and the formation of virus like particles. This was built on a clinical observation from a German HIV infected individual whose immune system learned to control virus replication by producing antiviral T cells (Lisziewicz et al., 1999) . The pDNA is formulated as pathogen-like mannosylated polyethyleneimine nanoparticles (80-400 nm). The pDNA is adsorbed to the positively charged polymer by ionic interactions and forms a nanoplex, which protects the antigen from degradation during application, absorption and endosomal passage. Mannosylation further supports antigen presentation by targeting the pDNA to LCs and induces a Th-1-type cellular response as shown in mice and macaques (Lisziewicz et al., 2005; Cristillo et al., 2007) . In order to facilitate access of the nanoplex bound antigen to the cutaneous APCs an exfoliation step is performed before the vaccine is applied to break down the skin barrier. The clinical trial database of the US National Institute of Health lists several studies using the DermaVir patch evaluating safety, tolerability and efficacy, which have been completed or are ongoing (US National Institute of Health, 2011). Lately, the results of one study have been published. This study looked at 12 individuals on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), who were immunized with the vaccine with or without the addition of hydroxyurea or received a placebo patch (Gudmundsdotter et al., 2011) . Those patients receiving the vaccine patch developed higher and broader levels of CD8+ T cells compared with placebo although it had no effect on CD4+ T-cell count. The vaccination procedure was generally well tolerated with local irritation described at the site of patch application (redness, itching, swelling, pain). Systemic effects were usually mild with headache, fatigue, and muscle pain being reported. The DermaVir vaccine still requires a very large application area for the application of (4 skin sites, each 80 cm 2 , two sites each on the thighs and the upper back). One total immunization schedule consisted of six individual vaccinations. One important goal in immunotherapy in patients with HIV-1 is to strengthen the patients' immune system and to reduce viral load to enable intermission of combined antiretroviral therapy for longer periods (Gudmundsdotter et al., 2011) . In the view of these therapeutic improvements HIV-1 patients will put up with the bothersome vaccination schedule. Skin pre-treatment, large application sites and repeated dosing are however important obstacles which might prevent the DermaVir patch from being widely acceptable by the public for prophylactic vaccinations. Despite the great potential of barrier disrupting techniques they also raise concerns as the vital skin barrier is weakened more or less temporarily which may open the door for the invasion of pathogens. Also, some of the techniques mentioned require expensive equipment. Both points will have to be considered especially for mass vaccination campaigns in developing countries with poor hygiene standards and low funds.
