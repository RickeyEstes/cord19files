PubMed, bioRxiv and Google Scholar were accessed to search for eligible studies. The term 'coronavirus & basic reproduction number' was used. The time period covered was from 1 January 2020 to 7 February 2020. For this time period, we identified 12 studies which estimated the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 from China and overseas. Table 1 shows that the estimates ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28, a median of 2.79 and interquartile range (IQR) of 1.16. The first studies initially reported estimates of R 0 with lower values. Estimations subsequently increased and then again returned in the most recent estimates to the levels initially reported (Figure 1) . A closer look reveals that the estimation method used played a role. The two studies using stochastic methods to estimate R 0 , reported a range of 2.2-2.68 with an average of 2.44. 1, 9 The six studies using mathematical methods to estimate R 0 produced a range from 1.5 to 6.49, with an average of 4.2. 2, 4-6, 8, 10 The three studies using statistical methods such as exponential growth estimated an R 0 ranging from 2.2 to 3.58, with an average of 2.67. 3, 7, 11
