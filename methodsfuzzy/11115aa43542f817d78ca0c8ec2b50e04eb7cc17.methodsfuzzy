Construction of chimeric GPs. Standard molecular biology technique was used to construct chimeric GPs containing pCAGGS vectors. The sequence of ZGP and RGP were obtained from MP1153-ZGP vector and pBluescript-RGP vetor respectively, and primers as described in Supplementary Table 1 were used. Generation of recombinant VSVΔG*-pseudotyped virus. VSVΔG*-pseudotyped viruses were generated as described previously with some modifications 5 . In the VSVΔG* genome, the coding region of the VSV G protein gene was replaced with the coding region of a modified version of the GFP gene 5 . GPs of ZEBOV (Strain Mayinga), REBOV (Strain Pennsylvania), SEBOV (Strain Boniface), and chimeric GPs were cloned into pCAGGS vector. These plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells by using Trans-IT LT1 (Takara). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with VSVΔG*-VSVG (VSV pseudotyped with VSVG) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hour at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium-High Glucose (DMEM-HG) without fetal calf serum (FCS) and once with DMEM-HG with 10% FCS, and then medium was added. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere, the culture fluid was collected and centrifuged to remove cells. Each virus stock was stored at −80 °C until further use. Regarding to the biosafety level (BSL), the pseudotyped virus was categorized to BSL2.
