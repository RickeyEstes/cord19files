Results were expressed as means Â± SEM. Statistical analyses of data to compare the different groups were performed using SPSS version 16.0 software. Data for specificity of antibody, cytokine production and ELISPOT were analyzed using either one-way ANOVA or Student's ttest. Data for flow cytometry and bacterial load were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U of nonparametric Test. For comparison of survival in murine lethal challenge model, individual experiments were analyzed using log-rank test statistic (Mantel-Cox test) from the Prism software (Prism for Windows, version 5.01, GraphPad Software). Probability (P) values <0.05 were considered significant. 4 to 9 mice were used in each experiment and each experiment was repeated two or three times with consistent results.
