Computational methods take an interdisciplinary approach, involving mathematicians, chemists, biologists, biochemists, and biomedical engineers. The robustness of datasets related to gene interaction and co-operation at a systems level requires multifaceted approaches to create a hypothesis that can be tested. Two approaches are used to understand the network interactions in systems biology, namely Experimental and Theoretical and Modeling techniques (Choi, 2007) . In the following sections is a detailed overview of the different computational or bioinformatics methods in modern systems biology. Experimental methods utilize real situations to test the hypothesis of mined data sets. As such, living organisms are used whereby various aspects of genome-wide measurements and interactions are monitored. Specific examples on this point include:
