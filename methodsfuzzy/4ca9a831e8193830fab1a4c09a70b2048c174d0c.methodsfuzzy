We randomly selected a total of 568 stored nasopharyngeal swabs or nasal washes collected in 2007 from children younger than 6 years old who suffered fever and cough or sore throat in three study sites from the program. The facilities included in the study were three city hospitals in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in Managua and Masaya, Nicaragua; and one primary healthcare center in Managua, Nicaragua and four in Piura, Peru: 1) Hospital Infantil from Buenos Aires, Argentina; 2) Hospital Departamental Humberto Alvarado from Masaya, Hospital Infantil Manuel Jesus Rivera ''La Mascota'' and Centro de Salud Villa Venezuela from Managua, Nicaragua; and 3) Centro de Salud Chiclayito, Bellavista, Pachitea and Centro Medico Militar, Piura, Peru ( Figure 1 ). All samples tested for HBoV were assessed using realtime PCR as described by Lu et al. 14 The DNA was extracted and eluted from 200 ll of transport media using QIAmp DNA blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The samples were tested for NS1 and NP1 genes ( Table 1) by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Ò Universal PCR Master Mix Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR was carried out in a volume of 20 ll of master mix and 5 ll of sample. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. Amplification was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing was conducted on any positive real-time PCR samples. HBoV infection was determined from stored samples from each site, and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with the binomial exact test. An exploratory analysis was performed to determine the differences in distribution of HBoV infection, by country and within country, by age or gender, using a t-test for equal variance and a chi-square test. The presence of co-infections was assessed with crosstabulations. All analyses were performed with Stata ⁄ SE 10.1, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA.
