The MTT assay method is a way to evaluate the hazard assessment of nanoparticles, in which the activation metabolism in a mitochondrium in a cell is measured and the influence of nanoparticles on the prolification of the cell is qualitified. The MTT is a kind of tetrazolium, whose molecular formula is C 18 H 16 BrN 5 S. Taken into a cell, it is decomposed by a dehydrogenase enzyme in a mitochondrium into a pigment called 'hormazan'. The measurement of the fluorescence intensity of the pigment shows the prolification of the cell [8] [9] [10] . Fig. 7 .3.5. shows the hazard assessment of Vero cells and kidney cells of the African Green Monkey against CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles. The horizontal axis shows the concentrations of the nanoparticles and the vertical axis the fluorescence intensity of the hormazan at 460 nm, that is, the metabolism of the cells. The figure indicates that cyto-toxicity is not observed for 10 5 cells when the concentration is less than 0.5 M. This result means that this concentration is the threshold of the cell toxicity. Likewise, cyto-toxicity is not observed for the HeLa cells and for the human primary cells. Further, in order to find out how the sizes of nanoparticles influence the cyto-toxicity, the cyto-toxicities were evaluated with three kinds of quantum dots; one whose fluorescence wavelength is 640 nm, red, one with 570 nm, yellow, and the other with 520 nm, green. The following results were obtained. The largest quantum dots whose fluorescence wavelength is 640 nm show a tendency to give cyto-toxicity. Cyto-toxicity is observed at concentrations more than 1 M [11] .
