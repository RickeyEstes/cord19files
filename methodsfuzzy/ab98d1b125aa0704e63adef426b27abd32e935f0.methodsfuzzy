To determine the sensitivity of ViSeq, the ability of the process to detect a pathogen known to be present in the fecal samples was assessed. Some samples contained norovirus at different genome loads as measured by real time PCR. The total number of norovirus reads in each sample was determined by ViSeq followed by mapping all reads to a close norovirus genome. This value was compared to the norovirus viral load determined by real-time PCR. Norovirus reads ranging from 1 to 42,000 were detected across the sample set and there was a strong correlation with the viral load measured by real time PCR (Figure 3) . The cutoff for a positive clinical norovirus diagnosis with this real-time PCR assay is a threshold cycle (Ct) of 40; the ViSeq method detected norovirus with similar sensitivity, however without prior sequence knowledge required to design specific real-time PCR primers. Although deep sequencing is currently not a faster alternative to a virus specific real time PCR assay, it is clear that the two detection methods show similar levels of sensitivity for a known virus. Furthermore, the four samples with norovirus Ct values below 27 provided sufficient sequence coverage for full genome assembly (see below). Table 1 for total number of reads per samples) were mapped to the indicated viral genomes using MUMmer [31] . The number of reads mapped to each virus (normalized for total reads in each sample) is depicted by color (see color bar scale to right of figure). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093269.g006
