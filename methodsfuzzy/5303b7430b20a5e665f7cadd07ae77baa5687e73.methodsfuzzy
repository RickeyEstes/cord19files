Both the SL approach and LR model required training to estimate the various parameters. These models were trained with the same training dataset consisting of 2m observations. Figure 1 shows the training and evaluation flow schematic. The LR models were fitted with SAS (SAS Institute, NC) software. The SL approach required more involved training with bootstrap re-sampling [28] . Because the sigma-weights impact the performance of the perceptron output, the perceptron training was embedded within the sigma-weight estimation. Perceptron weights were determined by drawing row vectors from the K (training) matrix at random with replacement. The Az was used as a guide for convergence. Because there are only two sigmaweights, a constrained search was used by varying both weights over a range of values. For each sigma-weight combination, the perceptron weights were determined, and the Az value was estimated resulting in an experimental set of values: {σ 1i , σ 2i , Az i } for the i th combination. The sigma-weights were determined by the position of the maximum Az value (Az max ): σ 1 = σ 1i and σ 2 = σ 2i where Az i = Az max . Once the sigma-weights were established, the perceptron weights were regenerated (fine-tuned) by incrementally increasing the Az convergence criterion using a feedback loop. The perceptron weights that gave the highest Az before non-convergence were used in the validation processing along with {σ 1 , σ 2 }. When using x 1 and x 2 individually [s 1 = 0 or s 2 = 0 in Eq. (3)], we retrained the perceptron with the same Az criterion using the respective sigma-weights (determined above). In sum, the sigma-weight pair in combination with the perceptron weights that gave the highest Az for given SL variant were used in the model evaluation comparison. The training dataset was used to evaluate the fitted models initially by generating 10 repetitions of 150 bootstrap datasets [28] . Each bootstrap dataset was processed by each of the models. For a given repetition, the distribution mean (Az 150 ) and standard deviation (σ 150 ) were calculated for each model. Averages of the Az 150 and σ 150 quantities were used to estimate the respective average performances and standard errors (SEs). For independent evaluation, 10 additional datasets were processed by each fitted model to estimate the average performance and SEs.
