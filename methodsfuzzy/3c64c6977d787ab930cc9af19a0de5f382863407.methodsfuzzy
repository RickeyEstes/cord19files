Viruses CHIKV (EU441882.1, FJ445502), DENV-1 (S144 strain), DENV-2 (STP7 and New Guinea C strain), DENV-3 (Eden 130/05 strain), and DENV-4 (S8976 strain) were propagated in C6/36 cells, and viral titers were determined by the plaque-forming assay. 16 Viral RNA of Ross River virus (RRV); Zika virus (ZIKV, MR 766 strain); Kunjin virus (KUNV, MRM 61C strain); West Nile virus (WNV, Sarafend strain); human enterovirus 71 (HEV71, AF316321 strain); enteric cytopathic human orphan virus 2; enteric cytopathic human orphan virus 7; Coxsackie B2 virus (CB2) and A16 virus (CA16, World Health Organization strain); poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 (Sabin strain); human coronavirus (CoV); and influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 were also used to examine the crossreactivity of this assay. The RRV, KUNV, and WNV were provided by Prof. Mary Mah-Lee Ng (National University of Singapore, Singapore). The Human CoV and influenza A viruses were provided by Associate Professor Tan Yee Joo (National University of Singapore, Singapore).
