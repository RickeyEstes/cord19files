Immunization protocol for MOG-induced EAE All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Wayne State University (WSU), and conducted in accordance with the WSU guidelines (protocol # A-09- [11] [12] . Female C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks, cat # 000664) purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, MN) were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55, (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) (100 μl) (final concentration = 200 μg) emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing 5 mg/ml mycobacterium tuberculosis (Lot # 8183887, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) subcutaneously in two injection sites at the hind flanks of each mouse. Control animals were immunized with an equivalent volume of CFA emulsion that did not contain MOG peptide. All mice received an intraperitoneal (ip) injection with 150 μl of pertussis toxin (300 ng) (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) immediately after immunization and again 2 days later. Mice were evaluated on a daily basis for changes in body weight, overt signs of illness, and clinical signs of EAE using a five-point scoring system: 0-no symptoms; 1-limp tail; 2-limp tail and hind limb weakness; 3-partial hind limb paralysis; 4-full hind limb paralysis; 5-moribund state or death by EAE. Daily measurements of weight and hematocrit were also made.
