Ethics statement. This study was approved by the Committee of Experiment Operational Guidelines and Animal Welfare of Sichuan Agricultural University. Experiments were conducted in accordance with approved guidelines. Viruses and animals. The DHAV-1 CH strain and the DHAV-1 CH60 attenuated vaccine were provided by the Institute of Preventive Veterinary Medicine at Sichuan Agricultural University. Ducks were infected with the CH strain at a concentration of 10 7.88 copies/ml and the CH60 strain at a concentration of 10 8.07 copies/ml as determined by qRT-PCR. One-day-old Cherry Valley ducks were purchased from the poultry farm of Sichuan Agricultural University and were raised in isolators. The ducks were confirmed to be free of DHAV-1 or IgG against DHAV-1 by one step reverse-transcription PCR 48 and indirect ELISA 49 detection in serum samples. Experimental procedure. After one week, the ducks were randomly divided into three groups of 15 and raised in separate isolators. The ducks in the first group received 0.40 ml of the DHAV-CH strain (10 7.88 copies/ml) via intramuscular injection, the ducks in the second group received 0.25 ml of the DHAV-CH60 strain (10 8.07 copies/ml) via intramuscular injection, and ducks in the last group were injected with 0.25 ml of 0.75% physiological normal saline (NS) as a negative control. Three ducklings from each group were killed at 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi, and their livers and blood were collected. Fifty-milligram liver specimens were weighed and immediately placed in a solution to protect the RNA and DNA in the samples (code. no 9750, TaKaRa, Japan) until RNA isolation was performed. Additionally, portions of the liver were soaked in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for histopathological examination. To identify the mortality rates of CH-and CH60-inoculated ducklings, 30 one-week-old ducks were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10) and raised in separate isolators. The ducks in the first group received 0.40 ml of the DHAV-CH strain (10 7.88 copies/ml) via intramuscular injection, the ducks in the second group received 0.25 ml of the DHAV-CH60 strain (10 8.07 copies/ml) via intramuscular injection, and the ducks in the last group were injected with 0.25 ml of 0.75% physiological normal saline (NS) as a negative control. Signs of disease and death were observed within one week. Viral RNA load in the liver and cytokine expression in the liver and blood. Viral copies in total RNA were measured using methods previously established in our laboratory 50, 51 . Fourteen immune-related genes (TLR3, TLR7, NLRP3, MDA5, RIG-I, IPS-1, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ) and a housekeeping gene (β-actin) were detected by qPCR using previously published primer sequences as well as newly designed primer sequences for TLR3, NLRP3, MDA5, RIG-I, IPS-1, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-β using Primer Premier 5 ( Table 1 ). The expression levels of immune-related genes were determined by qPCR using a SYBR ® Premix Ex Taq ™ II (Tli RNaseH Plus) Kit (Takara) and an Applied CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Amplification was performed in 10-µl reaction volumes containing 0.5 µl of each primer and 1 µl of RNA. The following thermal cycling conditions were applied: initial activation at 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and annealing and extension at 58.6 °C for 30 s, and a dissociation curve analysis step. Statistical analysis. All statistical and imaging analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. The relative mRNA expression of target genes was analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCt method and compared with that in the control group injected with 0.25 ml of NS. ΔCt values were determined by subtracting the average Ct values of the endogenous control gene β-actin from those of the target genes.
