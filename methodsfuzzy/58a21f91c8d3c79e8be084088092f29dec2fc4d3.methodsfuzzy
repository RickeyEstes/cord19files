CAP and HAP case-control studies. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the V. A. Negovsky Research Institute of General Reanimatology (with IRB approval number 2/6/2012), and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. From January 2008 to February 2016, CAP and HAP studies were conducted at the hospitals of the V.A. Negovsky Research Institute of General Reanimatology, Moscow, Russia. Three hundred ninety CAP patients were recruited in the study; the corresponding control group consisted of 203 unrelated healthy volunteers without a previous history of pneumonia. Subjects with severe physical trauma due to the accidents and patients with acute diseases requiring extensive surgery were included in the prospective study of NP; among 571 patients, 355 individuals developed NP. The majority of patients and controls in both studies were workers of the Rescue Service, predominantly practically healthy young or middle-aged men. The current study is a continuation of previously published CAP and NP investigations hence inclusion/exclusion criteria, microbiological procedures, genotyping methods and statistical procedures are available elsewhere 56, 57 .
