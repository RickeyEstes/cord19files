Animals and antibodies C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained in pathogen free conditions (Department of Comparative Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and studies were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Washington University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee. Antibodies utilized include rabbit anti-CD3 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), rat anti-GFAP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), rabbit anti-GST-Ï€ (Assays Designs-Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. Farmingdale, NY), rat anti-MBP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and mouse monoclonal SMI-32 (Covance, Emeryville, CA). IgG from rabbit, rat (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and mouse (BD Pharmigen, San Diego, CA) were used as isotype controls. Secondary detection was done using goat anti-rat, anti-rabbit and anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa-555 and goat anti-rabbit, and anti-rat conjugated to Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
