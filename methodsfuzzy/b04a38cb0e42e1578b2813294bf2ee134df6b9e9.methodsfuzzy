The developed UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS method was evaluated for linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, stability and accuracy. Stock solutions of fifteen reference compounds were diluted to appropriate concentrations for the construction of calibration curves. At least eight concentrations of the solution were analyzed in duplicate, and then linearity calibration curves were generated by plotting peak areas versus the corresponding concentrations. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) under the present chromatographic conditions were determined at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of around 3 and 10, respectively. The repeatability and stability of the method were also evaluated for each analyte. The analysis was repeated six times in the same day and additionally on three consecutive days to determine intra-day precision and interday precision, respectively. The sample was stored at 25 • C, and analyzed at 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 36 h for stability test. RSD (%) = (standard deviation/mean) × 100%. A recovery test was used to evaluate the accuracy of the developed UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS method. Accuracy was determined by adding the standard solution at three different concentration levels (120%, 100% and 80%) to SHL samples in which the contents of the 15 analytes were known. Then the samples were diluted with methanol and analyzed in parallel in accordance with the proposed method and triplicate experiments were performed at each level. The spike recoveries were calculated by the following equation: Spike recovery (%) = (total amount detected − amount original)/amount spiked × 100%. The method of HPLC-ELSD for quantitative analysis was evaluated for linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, stability and accuracy. The validation measurements were the same as the UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS method. It should be noted that calibration curves were prepared by plotting the logarithmic of peak area against the logarithmic of corresponding concentrations. As shown in Table 2 , for UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS method, all the calibration curves showed good linearity with coefficients (R 2 ) no less than 0.9990. The LOQs and LODs of all analytes were less than 2.24 and 0.66 ng/mL, respectively. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra-day precision, inter-day precision and stability were less than 4.82, 4.98, 4.99, respectively, indicating good precision of method and sample stability. The established method also had acceptable accuracy with spike recovery of 95-105% for all analytes. For HPLC-ELSD method, good linearity is demonstrated over the linear range. The LODs for fructose, glucose and sucrose are 0.05, 0.03, 0.01 mg/ml, respectively. The LOQs for fructose, glucose and sucrose are 0.17, 0.11, 0.03 mg/ml, respectively. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra-day precision, inter-day precision and stability were less than 1.26, 4.30 and 4.49, respectively, whilst the accuracy were all within 95-105% of the actual values at each level. All these results demonstrated that the developed UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS and HPLC-ELSD methods were sufficiently reliable and accurate for quantification of the eighteen investigated compounds in SHL.
