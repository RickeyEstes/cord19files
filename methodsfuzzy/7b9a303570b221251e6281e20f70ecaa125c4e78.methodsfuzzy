RAW-Blue cells, a mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage cell line (obtained from InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), normocin (100 μg/ml) and zeocin (200 μg/ml) (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 humidified atmosphere and passaged every 48 h.
