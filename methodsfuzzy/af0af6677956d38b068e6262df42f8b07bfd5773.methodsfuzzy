Techniques for the detection and recovery of Cryptosporidium from water have been developed. The techniques developed permit an assessment of the potential for waterborne transmission of this as well as of other organisms. The develop ment of these techniques was a direct result of the rise of interest in the waterborne disease caused by Giardia. While there are striking similarities in the epidemiol ogy of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, there are also differences. The oocysts of Cryptosporidium are, for example, smaller than those of Giardia (4-6 μπι vs. 8-12 μπι), thus requiring a more efficient filtration system for their removal. One of the procedures that has been developed to detect Cryptosporidia in water is the "EPA method" (Jakubowski and Ericksen, 1979) . This method uses a gasoline-powered water pump to facilitate the filtration of large volumes of water through a spun polypropylene cartridge filter having standard porosity. The ma terials trapped on the filter are eluted and concentrated and then there is a direct microscopic examination of the material for the detection of oocysts. When first used, this method gave a very poor rate of recovery and ways were sought, therefore, to improve it. The rate of elution was improved by backflushing nitrogen under pressure, by cutting apart the filters, and by agitating the cut fibers in the backflush effluent. The processing of the eluted material was also improved by its fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin or by agitation in a detergent solution of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and a 0.1% Tween 80 (SDS/Tween) to break up large aggregates. The proportion of oocysts in the samples which were detected in the sample trap was further improved by the use of gradient centrifugation procedures employing sucrose (1.23 g/ml), potassium citrate (1.195 g/ml), or Percoll-sucrose (1.09 g/ml) gradients. Finally, detection methodologies were improved by the use of cellulose nitrate membrane filters to capture the parasites and by the use of fluorescent-labeled polyclonal or mono clonal antisera to enhance parasite detection (Musial et al, 1987; LeChevallier et al, 1990) . Despite the fact that there have been significant improvements in the basic EPA method, the method remains labor intensive and costly. A wide range in recovery efficiencies occurs depending on the quality of water being tested. An accurate determination of oocyst numbers present, therefore, is only possible if seeded samples are run to determine recovery efficiency in the water samples. The procedure is, however, gaining a measure of acceptance and is being proposed as a standard reference method. Identification of cryptosporidial organisms may be aided by staining of infected tissues (Figure 2 .22), mucosal scrapings, and gut contents (Tyzzer, 1910 (Tyzzer, , 1912 Slavin, 1955; Panciera et ai, 1971) . Cryptosporidial oocysts may also be demon strated in feces following staining (Pohlenz et αϊ, 1978; Tzipori et ai, 1980a) . Examination of fecal material which has been stained by the Giemsa technique is a better diagnostic technique than is examination of biopsy samples but it un fortunately does not permit differentiation of cryptosporidial oocysts from yeasts and other debris in the feces. In 1981, a procedure based on the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining technique was developed which provided clinical and research laboratories with a simple and effective method for identifying oocysts in stool samples (Henriksen and Pohlenz, 1981) . In feces stained by this method the bright red oocysts are easily differentiated from the blue-green fecal material and yeasts which are always present (Figure 2 .22). The acid-fast staining technique has been modified and improved since its introduction. Garcia et al (1983) introduced a hot acid-fast stain and Ma and Soave (1983) developed a cold acid-fast stain. Bronsdon (1984) , Pohjola et al (1985) , Ma (1986) , and Ma et al (1984) incorporated the detergent tergitol into the system of staining by the cold Kinyoun acid-fast method. Negative stains have been introduced as alternatives to the systems using the acid-fast methods (Current, 1983; Pohjola, 1984) . A hot safranin-methylene blue stain has also been developed as have fluorescent stains.The fluorescent stains which have been used to stain oocysts in feces include Truant's auramine-rhodamine stain (Garcia et al, 1983; Ma and Soave, 1983) , the auramine-carbol-fuchsin stain (Casemore et al, 1984) , and the acridine orange stain (Garcia et al, 1983; Ma and Soave, 1983) (Figure 2.22) . The fluorescent stains may be better than the nonfluorescent stains but, like all chemical staining meth ods, they are not perfect. Preparations of fresh fecal samples may be examined under a microscope after they have been stained with iodine. If this is done, however, it is best to confirm the results by use of a more sensitive assay (Crawford and Vermund, 1988 ). Some investigators screen fresh or concentrated fecal specimens using phase-contrast (Figure 2 .22) or differential interference contrast (Nomarski) microscopy. Immunologic techniques for the detection of cryptosporidial organisms in stool specimens were introduced in 1985 and 1986. An indirect immunofluorescent assay employing convalescent human serum was developed by Casemore et al (1985) for the detection of oocysts and Stibbs and Ongerth (1986) developed a similar test which used antiserum from rabbits immunized with oocysts. Immunofluorescent assays employing oocyst-reactive monoclonal antibodies have also been introduced McLaughlin et al, 1987; Sterling and Arrowood, 1986; Arrowood and Sterling, 1989) (Figure 2 .22). The immuno fluorescent methods are significantly more sensitive and specific than conven tional staining techniques (Arrowood and Sterling, 1989; Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Garcia et al, 1987) . They are widely used in research and clinical lab oratories and they are useful for detecting oocysts in environmental samples Stibbs and Ongerth, 1986; Madore et al, 1987; Musial et al, 1987; Rose et al, 1988 Rose et al, ,1989 Arrowood et al, 1989; Loose et al, 1989; Smith et al, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990) . ELISAs for the detection of oocysts in feces utilizing oocyst-reactive mono clonal antibodies have been developed (Anusz et al, 1990; Chapman et al, 1990) . Monoclonal antibodies are used to detect antigens in feces by an antigen-capture ELISA procedure. This assay is capable of identifying Cryptosporidia in fecal samples from people whose infections have been confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopy, but it has produced some false-positive results (Chapman et al, 1990) . Attempts to use an antigen-capture ELISA to determine if micro scopically negative fecal samples contain cryptosporidial antigens have not been successful. The antigen-capture assay is more sensitive than is microscopic ex amination of fecal samples stained by the acid-fast procedure, but is less sensitive than the immunofluorescent procedure (Anusz et al, 1990) . Ungar (1990b) devel oped an indirect, double-antibody ELISA using polyclonal antisera for the detec tion of cryptosporidial antigens in feces but the assay is not as sensitive as the immunofluorescent procedure. A specific and sensitive ELISA would be an at tractive alternative to microscopic examination for the processing of fecal samples obtained from clinics and obtained in the course of large-scale epidemiological studies. A latex agglutination method has been developed for the detection of oocysts in stool samples. This method employs latex beads coated with antisera from rabbits immunized with oocysts (Pohjola et al, 1986) . This assay has been used to test samples of homogenized stools and gut contents from C. parvuminfected mice. This method is simple to perform and gives results quickly but the test lacks specificity. There is no universally appropriate method for diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Most clinical laboratories attempt diagnosis by fecal examination. These lab oratories use acid-fast staining methods on fecal samples and may or may not attempt concentration of the oocysts in the stool. However, immunofluorescent microscopy, which has great sensitivity and specificity, is the method of choice for examination of fecal and environmental samples. There are two commercial products presently available for diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. MeriFluor Cryp tosporidium is an immunofluorescent assay system based on an oocyst-specific monoclonal antibody that is produced by Arrowood and Sterling Arrowood and Sterling, 1989) . It is marketed by Meridian Diagnostics, Inc. (Cincinnati, Ohio 45244). A second immunofluorescent assay system based on an oocyst-specific monoclonal antibody is produced by McLaughlin and associates (1987) . This assay is marketed by Northumbria Biologies, Ltd. (Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 9HL, U.K.). Differences in specificity between the two products have been reported. The antibody used in the MeriFluor test reacts with C. parvum, C. meleagridis, and possibly some strains of c. muris (Arrowood and Sterling, 1989; Rose et al, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990) . The antibody does not react with any of a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, protozoa, and helminth ova . The reagent produced by McLaughlin and associates (1987) reacts with C. parvum, C. baileyi, and C. muris (Rose et ai, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990 ). Oocyst shedding by most infected individuals is transient, affording investigators a limited window of opportunity to confirm infection by parasite detection. Epi demiologic surveys of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis should therefore use sérodiagnostic methods as well as fecal examination since fecal oocyst detection methods alone will probably underestimate the true number of cases. Serologic methods may identify recently infected individuals if a series of serum samples from each individual is examined. In such samples, seroconversion, a significant increase in anti-cryptosporidial antibody titers, or the identification of antibody responses to certain antigens, may indicate recent infection. Humoral responses to cryptosporidial infections were first assayed by in direct immunofluorescence (IIF) in tests which used infected tissue sections as antigen Campbell and Current, 1983) . Using this technique, Tzipori and colleagues demonstrated anti-cryptosporidial immuno globulins in the sera of mammals of 10 species . This test showed that immunocompetent humans who had recovered from infection developed titers of 1:40 to 1:640. The titers persisted for at least 1 year (Campbell and Current, 1983 ). In the same study, Campbell and Current (1983) demonstrated that hypogammaglobulinemic individuals infected with Cryptosporidium did not develop anti-cryptosporidial immunoglobulins but that all of five AIDS patients infected with Cryptosporidium developed titers of at least 1:40 (Campbell and Current, 1983) . Immunofluorescent assays have also been developed which use oocysts as antigens Casemore et al., 1985; Casemore, 1987) or mixtures of oocysts and sporozoites (Mead et al., 1988b; Hill et αϊ, 1990) . With the exception of the monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescent assay for the detection of oocysts, use of the immunofluorescent assays has largely been re stricted to research laboratories. ELISAs for the detection of antibody responses to cryptosporidial antigens have been developed in several laboratories (Ungar, 1990b) . These tests employ antigens prepared from sonicated oocysts (Ungar et ai, 1986; Janoff et al., 1990) ; whole, frozen oocysts (Laxer et al., 1990) ; or oocysts prepared in an undefined manner (Williams, 1987) . These ELISA procedures are more sensitive than immunoblotting procedures . While several investigators have claimed that there is a strong correlation between infection and ELISA titers, others still have reservations about the specificity of these assays (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . Reactivity with cryptosporidial antigens of sera from individuals infected with other parasites is a problem which may occur with any sérodiagnostic assay. We have observed, for example, that monoclonal antibodies raised against Plas modium chabaudi react with sporozoite antigens of C. parvum and that mono clonal antibodies raised against C. parvum cross-react with P. chabaudi antigens in indirect immunofluorescent assays (unpublished data). Western blot methods have been developed for the detection of antibody responses to Cryptosporidium using antigens prepared from sonicated oocysts Luft et al, 1987) ; purified, sonicated sporozoites (Mead et al, 1988b) ; boiled oocysts (Lumb et al, 1988a) ; and freeze-thawed oocysts (Hill et al, 1990; Tilley et al, 1990b) . Antigens with molecular masses ranging from 3 kDa, to over 200 kDa react with immune sera from experimentally and naturally infected animals and humans. A 23-kDa antigen has been identified by all immune sera. Originally identified as an antigen from sonicated oocysts , it was subsequently shown to be on the surface of sporozoites by a study employing purified sporozoites as antigen (Mead et al, 1988b) . Immunoelectron microscopy (Lumb et al, 1989) and surface labeling studies (Mead et al, 1988b; Tilley and Upton, 1990) confirmed the location of this antigen. Reactivity to the 23-kDa antigen was demonstrated 10 days after infection. Re activity peaked in intensity at 3 to 4 weeks after infection and was essentially absent after 4 to 5 months (Mead et al, 1988b) . These data suggest that detection of this antigen by immunoblotting indicates recent infection.
