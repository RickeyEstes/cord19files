The human 3' @-globin LINE, an apparently complete 6.2-kb sequence, has been described previously (Adams et al., 1980) . The b2 LINE, an autosomal element, was derived from a genomic clone, XHb2, which had been obtained from a X-phage library of human DNA (Schmeckpeper et al., 1981) . The clones X63 and X65 were from a genomic library of AHA-lla DNA, a mouse-human hybrid cell line, containing an X as the only detectable human chromosome (Schmeckpeper et aZ., 1979) . This library was made by partial EcoRI digestion and ligation into Charon 4A X-phage. X-Phage X63 and X65 were isolated on the basis of hybridization of Ll subclones derived from XHb2. A gorilla Ll element was obtained from a similarly constructed library (Scott et al., 1984) screened with a human @-globin cDNA probe. Restriction maps of the recombinant X phages were prepared, and appropriate regions from these were subcloned into plasmids for further analysis. Because a majority of published sequences are homologous to the 3' end of the element, we have accumulated new data from underrepresented portions of the 5' end of the element. Several sequences used to generate the consensus were derived from genomic fragments with particular restriction enzyme sites. Selection of sequences defined by particular restriction enzyme sites might bias the final consensus by selecting elements of a given type. In order to lessen this potential problem, the new elements analyzed for this paper were selected from genomic clones by hybridization criteria and because they were at least 6 kb long. The presence of particular restriction enzyme sites was not a criterion for selection. Further, many of the published elements were derived either by similar criteria or by the fact that they are adjacent to other genes or sequences. We observed no obvious clustering of elements into subgroups on the basis of how they were selected. Fragments to be sequenced were ligated into either Ml3 phage (Messing and Vieira, 1982) or pEMBL plasmids (Dente et al., 1983) . Random length clones were prepared by a variety of methods (Dale et al., 1985; Hong, 1982; Poncz et al., 1983; Barnes and Bevan, 1983) . Portions of sequence were also obtained using specific synthetic oligomers as primers. DNA sequencing was done by the enzymatic chain-termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using [%J] dATP. Most samples were run on 6 or 8% acrylamide-urea gels (40 cm long, 0.2-to O.4-mm wedge gels). Selected samples were also run on long (80 cm long, 0.2 mm thick) water-jacketed gels heated to 55Â°C (Garoff and Ansorge, 1981) . Regions of sequence overlap between clones were located with the aid of homology identification programs (Queen and Korn, 1984) , while data base searches were conducted using the programs of either Queen and Korn (1984) or Lipman and Pearson (1985) . The sequence of the 3' @globin LINE used in this analysis was determined in our laboratory. The identical element has been sequenced independently by Hattori et al. (1985) . Five differences in 6239 nucleotides were noted between the two sequences which could not be resolved by reexamination of the sequence generated in our laboratory. The GenBank data base was searched for Ll homologous sequences that were aligned with respect to the @-globin element. Interspecies comparisons (Fig. 3) were made by aligning each pair of sequences, counting the number of matches per 60-nucleotide window, and then computing a moving average of three windows. Figure 1 shows an overview of the organization of the human Ll element derived from the consensus sequence (Fig. 2) . Figure 1 also indicates the relationship of the component sequences used in construction of the consensus sequence. Each horizontal bar or group of bars per line represents DNA sequence from a separate element (as listed in Table 1 ). Some elements (e.g., sequences 5 and 6, Fig. 1 and Table 1 ) used in the consensus have regions that are scrambled relative to the 3' /3-globin element. We believe that the fi-globin LINE lacks rearranged or atypical regions because its organization best accounts for the placement of blocks of sequence from the other elements. The consensus human Ll DNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequences of the two ORFs are shown in Fig. 2 . Because of space contraints, the consensus is shown without the individual sequences .F is shown with horizontal lines. The asterisk denotes a small, poorly conserved region that coincides with sequence between the 5' and 3' ORFs in the human consensus. Regions with weak AluI sequence homology are indicated at the 5' end of the element. The GC content is plotted as a moving average of three 60nucleotide blocks. Note that the highest GC content corresponds to the regions flanking the ORFs. Component sequences used in the generation of the LlHs consensus are mapped relative to the consensus. The element 3' of the fl-globin gene was used as the archetype sequence. Black bars indicate elements sequenced in our laboratories. Shaded bars are published sequences. Gaps between bars along a line indicate either that the sequence was not obtained from this region or that these regions are missing from the element. The source for each sequence is presented in Table 1 .
