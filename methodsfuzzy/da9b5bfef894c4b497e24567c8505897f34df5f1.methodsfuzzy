Viruses and specific serotyping antisera . When viruses were propagated in 1-day-old turkeys, the birds were inoculated with 100 μl of virus per os. The birds were necropsied 48 h post-inoculation and the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts were harvested and frozen at -80 C. When virus was propagated in embryonating turkey eggs, the chorioallantoic sac was inoculated with 100 μl of virus. The eggs were incubated for 48 h then the GI tracts of the embryos were extracted and frozen at -80 C. The frozen GI tracts from embryos and poults were thawed, homogenized, clarified by low speed centrifugation (200×g for 10 min), and filtered through a 0.8-μm filter then a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Serotyping antiserum was prepared against each of the TCoV isolates in SPF turkeys using previously published methods with a few modifications (Gelb and Jackwood, 2008) . Briefly, 2-week-old SPF turkeys (Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA) held in positive pressure Horsfal isolation units were given at least 1 × 10 3 50% poult infectious doses of virus per os. Two weeks post-exposure, the birds were injected intravenously with 1 × 10 3 50% poult infectious doses and serum was collected 2 weeks post intravenous injection. The serum was heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min and stored at -20 C.
