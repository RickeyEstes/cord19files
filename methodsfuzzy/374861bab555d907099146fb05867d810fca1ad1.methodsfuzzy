An anonymous database will be built and analyzed. Quantitative variables will be described and categorized according to their distribution in the study population. The proportion of missing data will be described for all variables, and the mechanism of missing data will be researched; a multiple imputation process of missing data will be implemented, if necessary. Descriptive analysis will address each covariate for the entire population, and stratified by site. If multiple microorganisms are detected, typology of co-infections will be developed. Co-infections/colonization will be reported by site, patients' characteristics and time. Patients' characteristics and microbiological data on cases and controls will be compared. Mixed effects logistic univariate and multivariate regression modeling will be applied to assess factors associated with pneumonia or infection by particular pathogens. These models will take into account heterogeneity in baseline risk between sites and countries as well as the nested nature of the data. Indeed, microbial agents are nested in patients because they could be infected by several agents; patients are nested in sites and countries. Other analysis will focus on factors associated with co-infection, for each possible pair or trio of microorganisms. Individual and microbial factors linked with the risk of severe disease or death will be analyzed by survival models, if applicable. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values will be calculated to research the value of CRP and PCT in predicting the severity of pneumonia or infection by particular pathogens. Complementary methods and stratified analyses will be deployed, if necessary, to study the distribution of the causative agents of pneumonia according the underlying medical condition such as HIV for example.
