Wittels KA, Mello MJ, Palmisciano L/Harvard Affiliated, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; Brown Medical School, Providence, RI; Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI; Hasbro Children's Hospital, Providence, RI Study objectives: Since the introduction of nonmotorized scooters in 1999, emergency departments (EDs) have seen a dramatic rise in injuries related to their use. Taking advantage of the influence that media has on education, the Rhode Island American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) chapter, with funding from ACEP, produced a video on scooter safety. The objective of this study is to evaluate the scooter safety knowledge of children aged 8 to 14 years and their parents presenting to an urban pediatric ED and to determine whether the children's knowledge of scooter safety improves after viewing the scooter safety video. A second objective is to determine whether improved knowledge of scooter safety results in parental report of a change in behavior. Methods: The study population was a convenience sample of children aged 8 to 14 years (patients and their siblings) at an urban pediatric ED waiting area and treatment area during June 2002. A brief survey consisting of demographic information, baseline information on the participants' use of wheeled sporting equipment, and questions on their knowledge of scooter safety assessed before and after viewing the video was given to patients. Parents were also given a short survey. In addition, parents were asked for their consent to receive a follow-up telephone call 5 months after completing the survey to reassess their children's scooter use and safety equipment use. Participants were given a small compensation (value <$3) for completion of the survey and follow-up telephone call. The Rhode Island Hospital institutional review board approved the research protocol. Results: The study included 50 participants. There were 24 girls and 26 boys. Study objectives: In an attempt to better understand how patients respond to and cope with traumatic experiences, a trial for medication and counseling was developed. Previous attempts to track patients after hospital discharge have met with poor results. This study was designed to attempt immediate consent and study screening after the emergency department (ED) treatment phase to avoid not being able to contact a large number of possible research subjects. Methods: The data collection was conducted in a prospective manner, with a fulltime research assistant interviewing all ED patients who experienced a traumatic injury as a result of abuse, injury, accident, or disaster. The study requires patients to consent to laboratory and radiologic imaging and a trial of medication for those who test positive on a psychiatric stress testing scale. The University institutional review board approved the study. t Test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare patient demographic and risk factors for patients who consented to study participation compared with the same factors for those who did not consent. Result: Throughout a 90-day period, 231 consecutive trauma patients presenting to a Level I University Hospital were included in the initial screening for participation. Twenty-two percent (48) of these patients agreed to an interview for study purposes, and a net total of 8.3% actually consented to full study participation. There were higher percentages of patients with head injury with or without loss of consciousness who consented compared with those with positive test results for ethanol or substance abuse (P<.05). Of all trauma causes, interpersonal violence victims were more likely to consent than motor vehicle crash, fall, or accidental injury victims (Fisher's, P<.04 ). An increased rate of discharged patients (3.7:1) favored study participation compared with admitted patients. Age was not found to be a significant factor for giving consent. Conclusion: The ability to successfully recruit trauma patients for a long-term prospective study remains difficult. Specific injury patterns and types of trauma appear to signify groups of improved compliance. The high percentage of consent from patients with head injury may require further institutional review board review for true comprehension. Results: Eighty-three (49%) of 171 participants returned the survey. Respondents comprised emergency medicine resident physicians (34% of participants), registered nurses (34%), emergency medicine attending physicians (22%), nurse practitioners (6%), and physician assistants (5%). Sixteen percent worked mostly with pediatric patients, 53% with adults, and 31% with both. Ninety-eight percent of respondents thought that awake patients find NGTI uncomfortable. Eighty-four percent used DRM; 26% believed that these measures were adequate. Forty-seven percent were dissatisfied with their current practice. Ninety-one percent would consider changing the way they perform NGTI. The most practical DRM were believed to be lidocaine jelly (30%), topical anesthetic spray (28%), and nebulized lidocaine (16%; multiple responses were allowed). The most effective DRM were felt to be anxiolytics (25%), nebulized lidocaine (22%), and topical anesthetic spray (18%). The DRM most commonly used in actual practice were lubricant jelly (76%), topical anesthetic spray (63%), lidocaine jelly (52%), and child life/distraction (23%). Conclusion: Almost all ED staff agreed that patients who are awake find NGTI to be uncomfortable; 84% reported use of DRM. However, only 26% of participants believed that DRM were adequate; 47% were dissatisfied with current practice. The measures used most commonly were not necessarily those rated as most effective or practical. Ninety-one percent of participants were willing to change their practice. Improvement in DRM for NGTI is needed and desired by ED staff. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of a computerized database of emergency department (ED) visits in 15 New Jersey EDs. Participants were consecutive nontrauma patients treated by emergency physicians from July to November 2002. The New York State Department of Health extended the chief complaint algorithm originally developed by the New York City Department of Health. The ESSENCE (Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q-Wave Coronary Events) project supplied the ICD-9 algorithm. We examined agreement between the 2 methods in 3 stages: (1) the initial chief complaint and ICD-9 algorithms; (2) after modifying the chief complaint algorithm to match the ICD-9 algorithm; and (3) after expanding both algorithms to include fever. We used the κ statistic to measure agreement. We also calculated sensitivity and specificity of chief complaint by using ICD-9 as the criterion standard. Results: There were 174,520 patient visits in the database. For stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the κ statistics were 0.28, 0.42, and 0.56. The sensitivities were 0.31, 0.53, and 0.71, and the specificities were 0.94, 0.91, and 0.90. Conclusion: Starting with 2 existing methods for biosurveillance of respiratory illness, agreement was improved by modifying the methods so that the syndromic definitions matched. Agreement was further improved by expanding the syndromic definitions to include fever. Sherman SC, Taggart A, Khatoon A, Snyder E, Galich P/Cook County Hospital, Chicago, IL Study objectives: Rewarming a frostbitten extremity is best if performed in a water bath of 104°F to 107.6°F (40°C to 42°C) and can be destructive to tissue if the temperature of the water bath is 113°F (45°C) or greater. Our objective was to determine the most reliable and efficient way to produce a waterbath of 104°F to 107.6°F (40°C to 42°C) for the immersion of a frostbitten extremity. Methods: We tested 2 microwaves (Panasonic NN-S732WL, 1,200 W, and Emerson MW8102SS, 1,100 W) to determine the appropriate heating time on the highest setting to warm a 4-L water bath to 104°F to 107.6°F (40°C to 42°C). The reliability of each microwave was tested in 30 subsequent trials and at 2 starting temperatures. Alternatively, the ability of physicians to create a water bath in the desired temperature range by using hot and cold faucets from a standard hospital sink was evaluated with (n=30) and without (n=30) a thermometer. Results: Using the 1,200-W Panasonic microwave and a 5-minute 30-second heating time was found to produce a temperature closest to the desired range of 104 to 107.6°F (40°C to 42°C). Thirty trials with this microwave on high for 5.5 minutes heated a 4-L water bath to 105.8±1.6°F, with 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66% to 94%) of the trials in the desired temperature range. The 1,100-W Emerson microwave (4 L for 5.5 minutes) created a final temperature of 104.3±0.7°F, with 63% (95% CI 46% to 80%) in the desired range. If the starting temperature was less by 2°F (71.5 versus 69.3°F), the water bath heated to only 102.6±1.4°F, with 20% (95% CI 34% to 56%) of the trials in the desired temperature range. No final temperatures were considered harmful to frostbitten tissue (113°F). During the physician trials at a hospital sink, all trials took less than 2 minutes to complete. Without a thermometer, temperatures ranged from 103.6±6.2°F, with only 20% (95% CI 34% to 56%) falling in the range of 104°F to 107.6°F and an additional 10% (95% CI 0% to 21%) that were dangerously high (113°F). With the use of a thermometer, the final temperatures averaged 105.7±1.2°F, with 93% (95% CI 84% to 100%) in the desired temperature range, and no dangerously high temperatures were recorded. Conclusion: Microwave heating of a water bath for a frostbitten extremity is influenced more by the starting temperature than the type of microwave. In addition, microwave heating is more time consuming than using a conventional hospital sink. The best method is to use a conventional sink with a thermometer to check the final temperature because this process can be accomplished in less than 2 minutes in almost all circumstances. A physician will create a water bath that risks increased tissue injury 10% (95% CI 0% to 21%) of the time if a thermometer is not used, and therefore this method should be avoided.
