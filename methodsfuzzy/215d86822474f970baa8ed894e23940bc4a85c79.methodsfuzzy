Virus strains. In this study for developing duplex-PCR, two standard field strains of NDV (Razi institute), a vaccinal strain of IBV named IB88 (Merial, Lyon, France) and one field strain of IBV named 793/B (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tehran, Iran) were used. Field samples. Clinical samples including trachea, liver and kidney were collected from chickens with respiratory symptoms from 12 broiler farms. All farms had a routine history of vaccination against IBV and NDV. Six birds were collected from each broiler farm. Mucosal layer of trachea was scratched by scalpel blade. Tissues of 0.5 cm 3 was removed from each liver and kidney and then crushed in a sterile mortar with one mL sterile PBS buffer. RNA extraction. Viral RNAs were extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Extracted viral RNAs were used in subsequent reverse transcription for synthesizing cDNA or stored at -70 ˚C for later use. cDNA synthesis and duplex PCR. cDNA was produced from extracted RNA using reverse transcriptase enzyme. For duplex PCR two sets of universal primers were used in one reaction. The sequence and location of the primers used for amplification of M gene of NDV and 3' UTR of IBV are provided in Table 1 . The duplex-RT-PCR was performed in a 25 µL total reaction volume with 0.5 µL of each primer, 2.5 µL 10x PCR Buffer, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 µM of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, and 0.5 µM of each primer, 1 U SmarTaq DNA Polymerase, 3 µL cDNA. The thermal profile for duplex-RT-PCR included an initial denaturation in 94 ˚C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 ˚C for 45 sec, 55 ˚C for 45 sec, and 72 ˚C for 45 sec, and a final extension cycle at 72 ˚C for 5 min. The duplex-RT-PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel run in 0.5% TBE buffer under constant 80 V for 1 hr and the gel stained by ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.
