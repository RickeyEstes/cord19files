The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and verbal consent was obtained from all participants. Patients comprised adults aged 18 years and older presenting to the Saint Marys Emergency Department (ED), an academic ED that is part of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, with influenzalike illness (ILI) from January 28, 2011, to April 30, 2011. Influenzalike illness was defined by the presence of fever (measured at Ն37.7°C or reported by the patient) and either cough or sore throat per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (http:// www.acha.org/ILI_Project/ILI_case_definition_ CDC.pdf). Additional symptoms such as runny nose, nasal congestion, irritability, chills, body or muscle ache, lethargy, weakness, and vomiting were also recorded. Participants first collected a midturbinate specimen with a nasal flocked swab (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH) from the right nostril following written instructions in English ( Figure 1 ). All patients were observed during self-collection by the HCW for adherence to instructions. Language interpreters were used when necessary to read the instructions to the participant; however, no collection guidance was provided by the HCW or interpreter. A second midturbinate nasal flocked swab was collected immediately after the patient collection by a trained HCW from the left nostril. Each swab was placed in an individually labeled container with universal transport media (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH) and sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory for rRT-PCR testing. All specimens were transported within 2 hours of collection using the hospital pneumatic tube system and stored in the laboratory at 4 C until processed. After swab collection, the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that subjectively rated the degree of difficulty in obtaining the self-collected swab (very difficult, difficult, easy, or very easy) and their preference for collection technique (self-collected, HCW-collected, or no preference). Demographic information including age, sex, race, occupation, and influenza vaccination status was also obtained. Patients who were dependent on oxygen via nasal cannula or were unable to provide verbal consent were excluded from the study. All positive results (regardless of collection method) were reported to the health care provider (primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant) to ensure appropriate patient management. Twenty-five of the 72 total paired specimens (34.7%) were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods. Overall, 14 patients (19.4%) had prior health care training. To remove the potential bias of this training, these participants were excluded from the subsequent comparison analyses. In the subset without prior health care training, 20 of the 58 paired specimens collected (34.5%) were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (Table 2) . Seventeen of the 20 positive specimens (85.0%) were positive for influenza A virus and 3 (15.0%) were positive for influenza B virus by at least one of the collection methods. The overall qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (95% confidence interval, 85.9%-98.2%), with a similar rate of influenza detection by both methods (ϭ0.88). In the entire data set of 72 paired specimens, there were a total of 4 discordant results. Two paired specimens (1 obtained by a patient with prior health care training) were positive by the patient collection method but negative by the HCW collection method. Confirmatory testing on these discrepant specimens was performed in triplicate using an influenza A and B rRT-PCR laboratory-developed test, which showed that both collections were positive in at least 1 of the 3 replicates (data not shown), indicating that the discordance was due to low viral RNA levels in the specimen. There were also 2 paired specimens that were positive by the HCW collection and negative by the patient collection. The results did not change on repeat testing. As described earlier in this article, these 2 specimens were collected by patients who were nonadherent to the written instructions. When patients with prior health care training were removed from the analysis, there were 3 discordant results. The Cp data were compared between collection methods for the subset of patients without prior health care training. Among the 20 positive results for influenza A and B by at least one of the collection methods, 17 were positive by both methods and thus had Cp data that could be compared. Of concordant positive results, the HCW-collected specimens tended to have lower Cp Ϯ SD as compared with patient-collected specimens (Cp, 24.8Ϯ4.2 vs 26.6Ϯ4.5, respectively; Pϭ.02), indicating slightly higher RNA yield from the HCW-collected specimens (Table 3) .
