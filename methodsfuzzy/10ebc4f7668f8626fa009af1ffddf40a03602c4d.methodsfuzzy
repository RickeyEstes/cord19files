Advances in sequence-based analysis of microbial genomes have laid the foundation for techniques to characterize the types of microbial species present in a sample. For bacteria, the most widely used approaches are based on analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, whose conservation across species, along with polymorphisms in hypervariable regions of the gene, enables both the broad detection of bacteria present in a sample and their phylogenetic identities. For more comprehensive discussions regarding methods and tools to study the microbiome, including in the context of lung disease, readers are referred to recent articles in this area. [22] [23] [24] The unique anatomy of the lung presents challenges to studying its microbiome. Collecting lower airway samples requires passage through the upper respiratory tract or oropharynx, which has previously raised questions about the extent of oral contamination in such samples. However, several studies now have established that microbiota identified from lower respiratory specimens are distinguishable from upper airway microbiota (especially nasopharyngeal) in measures of diversity and also in the types and relative abundance of specific bacterial groups. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Moreover, the architecture of the bronchial airways leads to regional differences in lung biology and the airway microenvironment, even in the healthy state. 30 In CF, it is likely that patterns of dysbiosis are greatly influenced by the altered airway milieu related to CF transmembrane receptor dysfunction and subsequent changes to mucus clearance. 31 THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS RESPIRATORY MICROBIOME Bacteria: Culture-based Investigations Bronchiectasis and chronic infection are wellrecognized clinical features of CF that contribute the most to disease morbidity and mortality. Although it is well established that P aeruginosa is an important pathogen in CF lung disease, other bacteria that also contribute to pulmonary morbidity in CF include Burkholderia cepacia complex, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 33 and certain nontuberculous mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium abscessus complex or Mycobacterium avium complex. 34 Microbiological features of these organisms, including factors responsible for virulence and resistance to antimicrobial therapies, have been extensively studied. 35, 36 Additional potential pathogens associated with CF include Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter spp, including Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Achromobacter ruhlandii, which can be difficult to treat. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] The role of anaerobic bacteria in CF lung disease remains uncertain, but they are frequently identifiable and prevalent by both culture-targeted and culture-independent methods. 2, [42] [43] [44] [45] Current data support an argument for anaerobes playing an important role in the CF airway microenvironment, especially given the steep oxygen gradients present. 45 In addition to contributing to the CF antibiotic resistome (ie, the collection of all antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms), certain prevalent anaerobic species produce quorum-sensing molecules that mediate interspecies signaling pathways 46 and potentially influence virulence characteristics of pathogens like P aeruginosa. 47 More recent evidence also suggests that metabolic products associated with anaerobes, 43,48 including short-chain fatty acids detected in airway specimens, may increase the release of interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-6 and reduce inducible NOS (nitric oxide synthase) gene expression. Thus anaerobic bacteria may be a group of keystone organisms that collectively have a large influence on the CF pulmonary ecosystem.
