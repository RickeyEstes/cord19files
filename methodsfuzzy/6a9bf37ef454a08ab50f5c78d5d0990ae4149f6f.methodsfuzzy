3.1. Western medical practice and research: from Edward Jenner type of research to randomised controlled trials Case study 1 captures research methodology that was used ages ago, and was acceptable then but is no longer acceptable nowadays. Today, a single medical doctor may not simply decide to test something in a patient or in patients without involving other people with relevant expertise that the doctor may not have. There is now a requirement that any testing of anything in human beings should be explained in a protocol in order to enable peer review (CIOMS, 2002 guideline 2; World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, 2008) . The review of the protocol is meant to ensure that firstly there are no flaws in the planned methodology that may compromise the usefulness of the findings and secondly that the safety of the humans who will take part will not be compromised. The most important requirement for research nowadays is the informed consent. Many international and national ethical guidelines or legal frameworks clearly stipulate that obtaining informed consent is a prerequisite for research. For instance, the CIOMS guideline 4 states that "For all biomedical research involving humans the investigator must obtain the voluntary informed consent of the prospective subject or, in the case of an individual who is not capable of giving informed consent, the permission of a legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. Waiver of informed consent is to be regarded as uncommon and exceptional, and must in all cases be approved by an ethical review committee (CIOMS, 2002) ." Thus when a patient presents to a medical doctor seeking treatment and the doctor happens to be involved in a study that is testing an alternative treatment, the doctor must inform the patient so that s/he decides whether to take part in the study or not. The patient may decide not to take part in the study but should still be given the standard treatment. If there is no proven standard treatment for the disease, then the doctor has to explain to the patient that the medicine available is still being tested. That is the distinction between medical practice and research. Indeed, both the treatment and research may be done in the same hospital settings, but the patients must be informed if they are to be used in a study. Edward Jenner conducted his experiment alone, which during his era was most probably acceptable to the communities, the medical fraternity and perhaps to the parents of James Phipps for medical practitioners to use their discretion to conduct 'research' as they saw fit without any peer review. It was fortunate that Edward Jenner's observations and deductions happened to be correct and that his 'experiment' yielded positive results without serious adverse reactions. But nobody knows whether or not he had conducted other 'experiments' detrimental to the health of his research subjects. Nowadays it is no longer acceptable, no matter how knowledgeable the medical doctor is, to conduct such tests using people without voluntary informed consent. We are in a new era in which people should be adequately informed to enable them to make informed decisions. Precautions should always be taken to safeguard the welfare of patients or research participants, and also to be sure that the research methodology is such that the research questions can be answered objectively and accurately. It should be acknowledged that ATM has evolved over centuries of years, and has involved systematic methods of assessing medicinal or detrimental properties of herbs. Although one school of thought may want to refer to that systematic assessment of traditional herbs as 'African traditional research methods', it could be argued that the systematic approach was basically scientific, more or less similar to the approach that Jenner used, and was devised by the African Traditional Healers themselves. For instance, one approach used by the Traditional Healers long time ago was to observe herbs that were never eaten at all by animals, and such herbs were suspected to be poisonous and would be avoided by the Traditional Healers. Long time ago there were no means of testing toxicity; hence such an approach was logical during that era. The point is that centuries of years ago African Traditional Healers developed methods of assessing safety and medicinal properties of herbs that were logical and acceptable during that era, but the methods should change with time. Traditional knowledge was therefore not gathered haphazardly, there were systematic ways of gathering the knowledge which was then passed from one generation to the next. Was this approach of gathering knowledge not scientific research methodology that was acceptable during that era, just like Jenner's approach? If it was not scientific but an African research methodology, should it remain the same as it was ages ago even when circumstances are changing and the diseases affecting Africa are dynamic? Just as there were limitations in the research methodologies used by Jenner, the research methodologies used by Traditional Healers had limitations which should be gradually overcome as time goes by. In other words, the research approaches used by Traditional Healers should be dynamic, the aim being to continuously improve and overcome limitations. In contrast to case study 1 which depicts what used to happen ages ago in the context of WM, case study 2 shows what is still happening today in the context of ATM. In the advent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the African Traditional Healer in case study 2 tried some of his medicines in patients and came to the conclusion that his medicines were effective. The implication is that there was some form of research that involved testing of the traditional medicines for HIV/AIDS, albeit without disclosure of such 'research' activities to the patients. The traditional medicines that were being given to people living with HIV/AIDS were not free of charge; the Traditional Healer benefited financially from the sale of the medicines. It therefore means that there was conflict of interest since the Traditional Healer testing the medicines was the one who interpreted the findings and eventually benefited financially from the sale of the medicines. Although the medicines were affordable to the majority of the people needing them, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in most African countries meant that there were large numbers of people needing such medicines, which translated into huge financial gains for the healer relative to ordinary members of the community. Another point to be highlighted is that when the traditional medicines are being tested, the patients are not informed about the testing aspects. It is important that any necessary procedural differences in the process of obtaining informed consent are allowed in order to respect different cultural and traditional practices. For instance, empirical studies conducted in some developing countries showed that most people prefer to discuss with their spouses or relatives before deciding whether or not to take part in health research (DeCosta et al., 2004; Nyika et al., 2009) . Thus obtaining informed consent should not be an event, but a process that allows ample time for consultations as per the wishes of the prospective participants. Another issue is that patients have to buy the traditional medicines even if they are still being 'tested' and may have side effects. There is need to assess potential side effects, and such assessments may require laboratory tests in addition to clinical assessments that the Traditional Healers may perform. It is therefore critical that medical practice, be it traditional or Western, is clearly distinguished from medical research, especially when medical practitioners play both roles as service providers and researchers. It also means that there should be well thought out plans of how the research would be done, instead of anecdotal ways of testing medicines, be they Western or traditional. Most importantly, the experimental people should be informed that the medicines are being tested in them. Since no person is omniscient, there may be need to include people with expertise in various relevant fields in the research team. Instead of having a one-man research project, like the one Edward Jenner or the Traditional Healer conducted, bringing on board other experts such as Epidemiologists, Microbiologists, Statisticians, Pharmacists, Physicians and people experienced in conducting clinical trials could significantly increase the quality of research.
