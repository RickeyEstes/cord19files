The diagnosis of COPD is based on the presence of typical symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, together with the presence of risk factors, and is confirmed by spirometry. A variety of methods (as outlined in Figure 1 ) are then used to classify the severity of disease, including questionnaires, GOLD and BODE Index. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classifies COPD into four stages; mild, moderate, severe and very severe according to spirometric measurements [16] . Spirometry, however, is believed to correlate poorly with symptoms [17] , quality of life [18] , exacerbation frequency [19] and exercise intolerance [20] . A more recent and comprehensive method for assessing disease severity and prognosis of COPD is the BODE Index. This is a multidimensional grading system, which not only measures airflow obstruction (FEV 1 ), but also incorporates body mass index (BMI), dyspnoea score and exercise capacity [21] . A comparison between the BODE and GOLD classifications shows that the BODE is a better predictor of hospitalisation [22] and death [21] than by GOLD. There are conflicting views on the prevalence of COPD ranging from 3-12% [23] to 50% [24] . A major contributing factor to this may be that only one-third of physicians know the correct spirometric criteria according to GOLD [25] and only one-third of trained GPs and nurses trust their own spirometric interpretive skills [26] .

Although spirometry is generally used to measure airflow obstruction, it has a number of limitations with regard to the detection and assessment of disease. Spirometry measures established airflow obstruction, which is likely to result from a long and continuous inflammatory process. Early use of therapeutic interventions, however, may be most helpful in attenuating the development of airway obstruction, which is not identifiable by spirometric tests. A single FEV 1 measurement will give information on how much airway obstruction has already occurred, but will not give any information as to the current level of disease activity. At present, such information can only be obtained by serial measurements and assessment of the reduction in FEV 1 over time. Finally, spirometry measures the end result of what may be a number of disease processes. It is known that patients vary considerably in their response to treatments, for example to inhaled corticosteroids [29] , and it is possible that there are a number of pathways by which smoking and other exposures lead to the final state of COPD. An alternative diagnostic approach may help identify disease subtypes and allow for a more accurate distinction between COPD and chronic irreversible asthma [30] .
