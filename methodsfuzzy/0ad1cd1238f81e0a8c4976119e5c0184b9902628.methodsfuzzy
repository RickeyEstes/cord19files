As described previously, deuterium labeling is a key to overcome the size problem of protein NMR studies. The merits of the use of 2 H labeling, such as line narrowing and reduced spin diffusion, are quite important when studying large proteins by NMR. The SAIL method utilizes proteins exclusively composed of stereo-and regioselectively labeled amino acids (SAIL amino acids) for NMR studies. 7 In the SAIL amino acids, selected protons are substituted by deuterium, such that each carbon or nitrogen nucleus in the final protein will have at most one 1 H nucleus bonded to it. In addition, 13 C and 15 N are used only where a 1 H is bound to it or where it is needed for uninterrupted through-bond assignment pathways. To achieve this, SAIL amino acids are designed as follows ( Figure 1 The 20 SAIL amino acids ( Figure 2 ) were synthesized based on these design concepts by chemical and enzymatic means. These SAIL amino acids are commercially available from SAIL Technologies (http://www.sail-technologies.com). The NMR signals from SAIL proteins are sharpened by both decreasing the long-range couplings and eliminating the dipolar relaxation pathways, in comparison to those of UL proteins. The labeling pattern of SAIL amino acids preserves the through-bond connectivity required for backbone and side chain assignments. However, the extensive deuteration of the side chain protons enables efficient transfer of the magnetization. In addition, the stereospecific deuteration in the methylene and prochiral methyl groups eliminates the need for their stereospecific assignment. Thus, a higher level of assignment can readily be achieved by using SAIL proteins compared to UL proteins. In addition to the full-SAIL labeling method, residue-selective labeling by SAIL amino acid(s) is also a powerful approach. In this case, not only the cell-free expression system but also wellestablished and thus more robust in vivo expression systems can be used for protein production, provided that the added SAIL amino acid is not affected by metabolic scrambling. Compared to in vitro expression, however, in vivo expression according to the conventional procedure requires a much larger amount of the amino acid to obtain the intended amount in the target protein. One strategy to overcome this problem involves the use of auxotrophic E. coli strains. By growing the E. coli auxotrophic strain in minimal medium containing a small amount of the target isotope labeled amino acid and a large amount of the 19 other unlabeled amino acids, a reasonable yield of the selectively labeled protein can be obtained: The SAIL method has been applied to several proteins ( Figure 7) . The overall convergence of the SAIL NMR structures is good. In addition, the backbone traces of the obtained NMR structures are quite similar to those of the corresponding crystal structures, verifying the accuracy of the NMR structures. Here, some NMR structures determined by the SAIL method are introduced. The SAIL method is also a powerful tool for investigations of protein dynamics, as well as the averaged structure. One of the applications is a hydrogen exchange study of Tyr side chain hydroxyl groups. 71 In principle, this method is an extension of the DEALS method, which is used for investigating the hydrogen exchange of backbone amide groups, to study the hydrogen exchange of hydroxyl groups. 20 In the case of Tyr hydroxyl groups, proton/deuterium substitution slightly alters the chemical shifts of the carbon atom at the z position in the Tyr ring by B0.13 ppm due to the proton/deuterium isotope shift effect. In a 1:1 mixture of H 2 O and D 2 O, the 13 C z (-OH) and 13 C z (-OD) peaks are resolved on a carbon spectrum when the residence time of the corresponding hydroxyl proton is longer than the inverse of the deuterium isotope shift effect in hertz; otherwise, they appear as a single averaged peak. However, the observation of such a slight chemical shift is difficult in the case of a uniformly 13 C-labeled Tyr ring due to the broad linewidth of the carbon peaks arising from dipole interactions and scalar couplings. To overcome this problem, (2S,3R)-[b 2 ,e 1,2 -2 H 3 ;0,a,b,z-13 C 4 ; 15 N]-Tyr, z-SAIL Tyr, was synthesized by SAIL technology. In this Tyr aromatic ring, only the carbon at the z position is selectively enriched by 13 C, and the ring protons at the e positions are deuterated (Figure 9 ). This labeling pattern facilitates efficient magnetization transfer between the 1 H d protons and the 13 C z atoms via three-bond scalar couplings, with a size of 7 or 8 Hz. Therefore, the assignment of the 13 C z atoms can readily be performed by the NOE correlation between 1 H b and 1 H d and subsequently by the HSQC correlations between the 1 H d and 13 C z atoms. The linewidth of the 13 C z peak is sharp enough to observe the slight deuterium isotope shift effect from the hydroxyl group. Phenylalanine and tyrosine residues are colored red. His147 is colored cyan. In the application of the extended DEALS method to EPPIb, all three Tyr 13 C z peaks were observed as sharp lines, with a linewidth as small as 7 or 8 Hz at 40 1C. When the sample was dissolved in an H 2 O/D 2 O mixture, two of the three peaks were doubled, which shows that their hydrogen exchange rate is smaller than the size of the deuterium isotope shift effect ( Figure 9 ). In addition, the exchange rate was quantitatively estimated by performing a 13 C-exchange experiment. This extended DEALS method is quite simple to perform and thus will be readily applicable to other cases.
