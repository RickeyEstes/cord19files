Cell pellets from processed NPAs were spotted onto slides and stained with antibodies to INF A and B, RSV, PIV 1-3, ADV, and hMPV (D3 Ultra Screening and ID reagents and hMPV reagent, Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc [DHI], Athens, OH). Supernatants were cultured by shell vial (R-Mix Too, DHI) and tube culture. R-Mix Too coverslips were stained at 48 h with D3 Ultra Screening reagent then with specific ID reagents when appropriate. Tube cultures were screened for cytopathic effect for 3 weeks; confirmatory staining was performed when appropriate. Data were stored in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and analyzed using Stata, version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Positive and negative agreement (by virus and by total positives and negatives) were calculated using RPII as the test assay and RVS/MS as the comparator assay. Since this agreement analysis highlights deficiencies in virus detection by RPII but minimized detection deficiencies by RVS/MS, an assessment of sensitivity and specificity Likewise, PIVs were analyzed as a single group (PIV) since the combined total number of PIV 1, 3 and 4 detected was four. CoVs were analyzed as a group since there is currently no clinical utility to distinguishing these viruses individually. EV and HRV discordant results were not adjudicated by a third assay, therefore, only agreement was determined. Confidence intervals were calculated using a web-based calculator. 8 Positive signal statistical data provided in Supplemental data tables were calculated using Excel.
