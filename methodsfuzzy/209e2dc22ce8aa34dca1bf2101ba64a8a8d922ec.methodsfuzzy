RNA and protein preparation. Preparation and radioactive labeling of the Candida group I intron ribozyme RNAs were performed as described [17] . MBP and MS2-MBP fusion protein were expressed and purified [19] . Analysis of the ribozyme activity. The purified RNAs randomly labeled by incorporation of [a-32 P]GTP during in vitro transcription was denatured and equilibrated as previously described [17] . The equilibrated RNA was incubated in the folding buffer containing 2 mM or 6 mM MgCl 2 and 1 lM of the indicated proteins at 4°C for 15 min. Hydrolysis reactions were initiated by incubation at 37°C for 90 min in the presence or in the absence of 2 lg/ll protease K, then stopped and analyzed as described previously [17] . To determine the 3 0 hydrolysis kinetics, time-dependent accumulation 0006-291X/$ -see front matter Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc.

RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The internally labeled Ca.L-11 ribozyme RNA [17] was denatured and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of purified proteins in 10 ll folding buffer (6 mM Mg 2+ ) at 4°C for 15 min as described above, except that 0.2 lg/ll tRNA and 5 lg/ll heparin were included. The samples were then fractionated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels [18] . In this study, all denature and native PAGE gels were analyzed using the variable scanner Typhoon 9200 (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). All data were plotted using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 program (www.graphpad.com). Protein-protected RNA cloning method (PRC) to identify the MS2binding site on Ca.L-11 ribozyme RNA. The method is detailed in Supplementary Data. In brief, the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex containing Ca.L-11 RNA and the MS2 fusion protein was formed; the unprotected RNA segments were removed by RNaseA to produce miniRNP. The miniRNP band was recovered from 5% native polyacrylamide gels, and the small RNAs in miniRNP were then cloned. For the structurally complex RNA molecules, binding of a protein at one site may alter the structure of another site; this feature precludes the use of regular footprinting method to accurately map the direct protein-binding sites on RNA. To circumvent this problem, direct hydroxyl-radical cleavage assay has been used to map the protein-binding sites on some group I introns [24] , in which series of protein mutants containing a single cysteine at different positions needed to be constructed, expressed, and purified. In this study, the protein-protected RNA cloning (PRC) method has been developed to successfully identify the MS2-binding site on the Candida group I ribozyme RNA. In principle, the RNA bound by MS2 CP is protected from nuclease digestion and can be successfully cloned after RT-PCR amplification. This method is cost-effective and easy to be performed, which provides an attractive alternative to identify RNA sequences bound by RNA-binding proteins in vitro. An atypical MS2 CP-binding motif on the Candida ribozyme The P5ab structure does not closely resemble the wild-type target of the MS2 protein or the typical MS2 CP aptamers [15, 25] , and no typical MS2 CP-binding hairpin structure is present in the Candida ribozyme (comparison of Fig. 3C and D) . MS2 interacts with the cognate RNA hairpin asymmetrically. The adenine at the À4 position in the terminal loop and the bulged purine at À10 in the paired region establish four and three hydrogen bonds with some threonine and serine residues in the MS2 protein (Fig. 3D) [26] . In the Candida P5ab structure, two symmetrically bulged Gs are present in P5a, and one recovered sequence contains only G141-C152 in P5a, indicating that this side of P5a may directly contact MS2 protein and that G144 might represent the À10 purine, resembling the base-paired structure in the F6 aptamer (Fig. 3B) . We also noted that P5a could form an alternative structure, with one bulged G144 pairing with U185 and the other bulged G184 pairing with U145. This alternative pairing ending up with a single bulged A143 after the first two base pairs in P5a represents a conserved paired structure for the MS2 protein targets (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, previous research has shown that A-4 is essential for MS2 recognition, and base substitution at this position reduces the dissociation constant of the protein binding to 670 nM [13] , consistent with the lack of a conserved A(-4) in the P5ab-P5 structure and a similar low binding affinity. In summary, the finding of MS2 CP binding of the P5ab-P5 structure of the Candida group I ribozyme suggests that this phage protein can interact with a bulged RNA paired region connected to an asymmetric internal loop containing three adenines. The implication of the MS2 CP in supporting the active structure of a fungal group I ribozyme In addition to the early mentioned mitochondrial proteins CBP2 and Cyt-18, several general RNA-binding proteins have been demonstrated to help RNA folding. The hnRNP A1 protein, HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp7), coronavirus nucleocapsid protein, and the GAPDH protein have been shown to stimulate hammerhead ribozyme catalysis. And La, hnRNP K, and hnRNP I are reported to possess RNA chaperone activity [4] . This study shows that MS2 CP, a bacteriophage protein, can bind to a peripheral structure of a group I ribozyme, which in turn stabilizes the core structure and promotes the activity of the ribozyme. The action mechanism of this protein is strikingly similar to that of the CYT-18 protein on its cognate and non-cognate group I ribozymes. These findings support a model that different RNA-binding proteins may use common mechanisms to promote RNA structures. This model is supported by the notion that splicing factors without host specificity are present to facilitate the group I intron splicing in vivo. For example, the Tetrahymena group I intron splices in Escherichia coli and human cells as efficiently as in its natural host [27, 28] .
