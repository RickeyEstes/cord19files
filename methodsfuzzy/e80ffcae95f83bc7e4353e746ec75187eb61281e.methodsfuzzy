= 0, 2 1 = 2 < âˆž, then { } is called autoregressive and moving average sequence. The basic idea of this model is to regard the time series as a random sequence and to use a certain mathematical model to describe the sequence approximately. Once the model is identified, we can use the past value to predict the future. The basic steps are as follows. (1) Identify smooth sequence using scatter chart, autocorrelation function, partial autocorrelation function, and ADF unit root test. (2) Do smooth processing on nonstationary sequence such as difference. (3) Establish the model according to the time-series model identification rules. If the partial correlation function of a smooth sequence is censored and the autocorrelation function is trailing, sequence can be concluded for the AR model. If the partial correlation of a smooth sequence is trailing and the autocorrelation function is censored, it will be determined for MA model. And if both partial correlation function and autocorrelation function are trailing, ARMA model is for the sequence. (4) Estimate parameters and justify whether the statistical test is significant. (5) Do hypothesis test and diagnose whether the sequence is the white noise. (6) Predict with the model established.
