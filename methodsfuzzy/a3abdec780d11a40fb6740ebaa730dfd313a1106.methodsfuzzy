Materials. The major essential oil components, 1,8-cineole and grandisol, were purchased from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Plant material and essential oil isolation. The aerial components of A. vestita were provided by a botanist and the plant was identified by a well-known taxonomist [both Department of Botany, School of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University (BNU), Beijing, China]. The voucher specimen (CAU-2013-08-29-022) was deposited at the BNU Herbarium. Extraction of the essential oil from the aerial components was performed by hydro-distillation for 3 h using a essential oil determination (Clevenger-type) apparatus (model, MSAW 0789; Lianyungang Highborn Technology Co., Ltd., Lianyungang, China), as recommended in the European Pharmacopoeia (27) . Three samples of the dried aerial components (200 mg) were subjected to hydro-distillation at separate times. The essential oil was collected and dehydrated using anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and stored at 4˚C prior to use. Essential oil analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The essential oil was analyzed using GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed on a Varian Gas Chromatograph Series 3800 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), fitted with a VF-5 ms fused silica capillary column (60x0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 µm) using split/splitless injection, coupled with a Series 4000 Mass Detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) under the following conditions: Injection volume, 0.8 µl with split ratio 1:80; helium as a carrier gas at 1.5 ml/min constant flow; injector temperature, 250˚C; oven temperature, 50-260˚C at 2˚C/min. The mass spectra electron impact (EI+) mode was set at 70 ev with an ion source temperature of 260˚C. The mass spectra were recorded between a range of 50-500 atomic mass units. Identification of the essential oil constituents was completed based on the following: The retention index (RI), determined with respect to a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 5 -C 28 ; PolyScience, Niles, IL, USA) under the same experimental conditions; co-injection with standards (Sigma-Aldrich) and standard isolates; identification using an MS library [NIST 05 and Wiley; NIST/ EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library with Search Program (data version, NIST 11; software version 2.0g), available online: http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm] and comparison with previously reported MS data (28) . Antibacterial assessment, bacterial strains and culture media. S. pyogenes (cat. no. ATCC-12344), MRSA, S. pneumoniae (cat. no. ATCC-2730), Klebsiella pneumoniae (cat. no. ATCC-27853) and Haemophilus influenzae (cat. no. ATCC-33391) were used in the present study. All these bacterial strains were obtained from the State Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Bacterial strains were grown on nutrient agar plates at 37˚C and maintained on nutrient agar slants. The cell suspension of microorganisms in 0.5% NaCl was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard to obtain ~10 6 colony forming units (CFUs)/ml. Agar well diffusion assay. An antibacterial susceptibility assay was performed using an agar well diffusion assay. The overnight bacterial cultures were added to 30 ml liquid nutrient agar (Sigma-Aldrich). The contents of the tubes were then transferred onto petriplates. Following 20 min solidification of the agar petriplates at 25˚C, 20 µl essential oil and each of the two chemical constituents were added to separate wells on the plates and incubated for 24 h at 37˚C. Following incubation, the antimicrobial efficacy of the essential oil and the constituents was measured by calculating the width of the inhibition zone, expressed in mm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Ciprofloxacin (10 µg/well; Sigma-Aldrich) served as a positive control.
