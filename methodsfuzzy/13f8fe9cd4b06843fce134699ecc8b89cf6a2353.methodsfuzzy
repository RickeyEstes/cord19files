To formulate the epidemiological model, here we mathematically capture the epidemiological process of secondary transmission using R 0 and the serial interval, i.e., the time from illness onset in the primary case to illness onset in the secondary case. We assume that secondary transmission does not take place before illness onset. According to a classical study by Stocks (1930) in the United Kingdom (UK), the time interval from first to second diphtheria cases in the household revealed a bimodal shape. Following Klinkenberg & Nishiura (2011) , the first peak corresponds to an independent infection in the community and the second peak reflects within-household transmission. As one of peak time-lags in the observed time interval was observed on day 8, we assumed that the mean serial interval was eight days, and we imposed an assumption that the coefficient of variation (CV) of the serial interval distribution was 50%, and later varied it from 25% to 75% as part of the sensitivity analysis. To capture the epidemiological phenomena of reproduction, it has been shown that the renewal process can capture the serial stochastic dependence structure (Nishiura, 2010) . Let i t be the number of new cases on day t. g t represents the distribution of the serial interval. To describe the time-dependent incidence i t on day t, we have (1) where s t represents the fraction of susceptible individuals on day t. The renewal process of this type is not original to the present study and has been applied to other settings including real-time epidemic modeling studies (Asai & Nishiura, 2017; Dinh et al., 2016; Ejima & Nishiura, 2018; Endo & Nishiura, 2015; Nishiura et al., 2010 Nishiura et al., , 2016 Tsuzuki et al., 2017) . It should be noted that the incidence i t includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Let c t be the reported number of cases on calendar day t. Supposing that only the fraction a t among the total number of infections are diagnosed and reported, c t satisfies where a t is modeled as a function of t. Because the case definition was improved from December 12, 2017 onward, the ascertainment rate likely varied around that time. Namely, we set a t = a 1 for time by December 11 and a 2 on December 12 and later. We assumed that only the ascertainment rate changed as a function of time, and also that R 0 and depletion of susceptible individuals were unaffected by time. We model the fraction susceptible s t on day t in the following way. Let n represent the previously immunized fraction so that only fraction (1 -n) of the population is susceptible at the beginning of the epidemic. In addition to the previously immune fraction, s t decreases when natural infection takes place. Suppose that the total population size was N, s t is written as We assume that N is equal to the population size of epidemic area within Rohingya refugee camp as 579,384 persons (Banerji & Ahmed, 2017) . Accordingly, the renewal equation is written as where t in the right-hand side indicates the time since infection (or the so-called "infection-age"). We assume that c t follows a Poisson distribution. The likelihood to estimate u consisting of the parameters R 0 , n, and a t is derived as where T is the latest time of observation (i.e., December 22 in our case study) and c T = (c 1 , c 2 , : : : , c T ).
