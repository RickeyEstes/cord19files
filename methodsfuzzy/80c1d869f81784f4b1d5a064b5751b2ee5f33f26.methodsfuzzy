Cell lines. 293T cells used in pseudotyped virus generation and VERO-E6 cells used in virus infection were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids. DNA fragments corresponding to the designed peptides were amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the full length S constructs (strain BJ01, GenBank Accession No. AY278488, a gift from Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention). Primers were designed to incorporate a BamHI restriction site upstream, a stop codon, and an EcoRI site downstream of each target fragment. These fragments were then subcloned into the BamHI/ EcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. To produce the SARS-CoV pseudovirus, pNL-4-3E-R-Luc (HIV-luc) and the codon optimized SARS-CoV S protein expression plasmid pcTSh were utilized [7, 27, 28] . Expression and purification of peptides. The N-terminal GST fused peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 (DE3) strain and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some minor modifications. Briefly, cells were grown in 500 ml Luria Broth (LB) containing ampicillin agitating at 37째C until the OD 600 (optical density) reached 0.4. Isopropyl-b-D D -thiogalactoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. Three hours later the induced cells were pelleted, resuspended in 30 ml Lysis Buffer (1% Triton X-100, PBS, pH 7.3), and shaken at 4째C for 30 min. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and bonded with glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4째C for 30 min with shaking. The mixture was then loaded into a column, washed by 10 column volumes of PBS (pH 7.3), and cleaved by 80 U thrombin at 22째C for 3 h. The peptides were eluted with 4 ml PBS, which were collected and further purified by RP FPLC. Fractions containing the peptides were vacuum dried overnight and dissolved in PBS. At last, these products were detected by SDS-PAGE in a 15% Tris/Glycine gel and the concentrations were determined through bicinchoninic acid protein analysis (Micro BCA assay kit; Pierce).
