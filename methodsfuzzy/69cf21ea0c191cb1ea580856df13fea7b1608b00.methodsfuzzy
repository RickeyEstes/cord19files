The HATRIC (Herbal Alternative Treatment (Pelargonium) for Lower Respiratory Tract Infections with Cough in adults) trial (ISRCTN17672884; sponsor reference number: 24375) is a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study, with general practitioner (GP) practices cluster-randomised to give liquid or tablet preparation, and within each practice, eligible patients randomised to Pelargonium sidoides root extract EPsÂ®7630 or placebo. A qualitative study, HATRIC-Q (IRAS project ID: 233467; sponsor reference number: 29921), will also be undertaken with patients, including both those who agreed and those who declined to take part in HATRIC, and clinicians. We will explore their experiences of taking part in the trial and obtain their feedback on trial procedures, as well as their views on the implementation of a delayed antibiotic approach and the use of herbal medicine for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection. This qualitative sub-study is described fully in a separate protocol.
