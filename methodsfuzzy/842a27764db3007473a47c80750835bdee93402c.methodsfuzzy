2.1. Animals, vaccination and experimental challenge with L. chagasi plus saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis Twenty male and female mongrel dogs that had been born and reared in the kennels of the Instituto de Ciências Exatas e Biológicas, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, were treated at 7 months with an anthelmintic and vaccinated against rabies (Tecpar, Curitiba-PR, Brazil), canine distemper, type 2 adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, parvovirus, and leptospira (Vanguard ® HTLP 5/CV-L; Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY, USA). The absence of specific anti-Leishmania antibodies was confirmed by indirect fluorescence immunoassay. Experimental dogs were divided into four experimental groups: (i) control (C) group (n = 5) received 1 ml of sterile 0.9% saline; (ii) LB group (n = 5) received 600 g of L. braziliensis promastigote protein in 1 ml of sterile 0.9% saline; (iii) Sap group (n = 5) received 1 mg of saponin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1 ml of sterile 0.9% saline; and (iv) LBSap group (n = 5) received 600 g of L. braziliensis promastigote protein and 1 mg of saponin in 1 ml of sterile 0.9% saline. All animals received subcutaneous injections in the right flank at intervals of 4 weeks for a total of three injections. The challenge of experimental animals was performed after 100 days of vaccination protocol. In this sense, all dogs received intradermally 1.0 × 10 7 promastigotes of L. chagasi stationary phase of cultivation, in the inner side of the left ear, in addition to 5 acini of the salivary gland of L. longipalpis. This preliminary stage of the study was performed from 2005 to 2007.
