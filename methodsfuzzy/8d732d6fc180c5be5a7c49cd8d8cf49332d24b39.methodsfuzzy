We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of births in WA between 1996 and 2012. Of WA's total population of 2.6 million, 79% reside in the capital city Perth and 6.4% are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders (herein referred to as Aboriginal). 14 Over 60% of Aboriginal people reside in rural and remote regions compared with approximately 27% of non-Aboriginal people. 15 The climate varies across WA from a Mediterranean climate in metropolitan WA (Perth and its surrounds) and the south of the State to dry desert climate in the central regions and tropical climate in the northern regions (online supplementary figure 1 ). data linkage and population-based datasets Data were extracted from the Midwives Notification System, Birth and Death Registries and the Emergency Department Data Collection (EDDC) and probabilistically linked through the WADLS. 12 16 The EDDC comprises data on ED activity from WA's public and private hospitals. 17 The Midwives Notification System records information on pregnancy, labour and birth, and infant and maternal factors and is complete for over 99% of WA births. 13 Our assembled linked dataset contained information on births and deaths in WA from 1996 to 2012 and ED presentations from across the State from birth up to age 17 years from 2002 to 2012 for children in the birth cohort.
