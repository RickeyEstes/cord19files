The five basic methods of obtaining a hepatic biopsy are blind percutaneous, keyhole technique, ultrasound-guided, laparoscopy-guided, and laparotomy biopsy. Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages. Knowledge of these, as well as practice and expertise in each respective method, allow the clinician to select the most appropriate and safest method to obtain hepatic tissue. Blind Percutaneous Biopsy The advantages of blind percutaneous biopsy are that it is very rapid, requires minimal sedation, and is low cost. Disadvantages of this method are that there is the potential for inadvertent trauma to other organs, focal lesions may be missed, and detection of bleeding may be delayed. Equipment Various biopsy needles can be used for percutaneous biopsy. In general, newer automated needles are preferred. These are spring-loaded needles that are similar in style to manual Tru-Cut (Baxter) or ABC (Monoject) needles. Automated needles can be completely automatic or semiautomatic. Automated cutting needles include the Monopty (Bard), ASAP (Microvasive), and Biopty (Bard) needles. Completely automatic needles thrust the inner obturator (containing the biopsy tray or specimen notch) followed by the outer cutting sheath into the organ in a fraction of a second. These needles can easily be operated with one hand. Because the action is so quick, there is minimal displacement of the organ, a shorter intraparenchymal phase, and much more reliable yield of tissue. This allows the biopsy of the organ to be performed with minimal manual mobilization, allows a smaller diameter needle to be used, and allows a lighter degree of sedation. Semiautomated cutting needles include the Vet-Core needle (Cook). Semiautomatic needles require manual thrusting of the internal obturator (containing the biopsy tray or specimen notch) into the organ, followed by an automatic thrusting of the outer cutting sheath by the spring-loaded mechanism. These needles have some of the advantages of the completely automatic needles and have the additional advantages of having more control over final needle position and being lighter with a smaller handle. These characteristics also make these needles well suited to computed tomography (CT) guidance because the handle can be let free by the operator for intraprocedural scanning without the weight of the handle causing the needle to move. In addition, the tip of the needle can be precisely localized before the outer cutting sheath is "fired." The older manual cutting needles (Tru-Cut or ABC needles) offer no advantages over these newer needles. Aspiration needles are generally used to obtain smaller samples that would be suitable for cytologic preparations (rather than histopathologic preparations), or for Menghini and Westcott needles, used to obtain small samples for histopathologic examination (see below). These needles are also well suited to obtain samples of fluid, such as intraparenchymal cysts and gallbladder puncture. Usually these are smaller-gauge needles (20 to 22 gauge) and therefore tend to be less traumatic. Aspiration needles employ suction to obtain fluid or cut the core of tissue. The Menghini needle is especially suited for transthoracic hepatic biopsy but can be used for transabdominal techniques as well. The tip of the needle is slightly oblique and convex and cuts a core of tissue when suction is applied as the needle is rapidly thrust into the liver and immediately withdrawn. The intrahepatic phase should last just a fraction of a second. A sliding screw acts as a depth gauge and prevents the needle from entering too deeply into the parenchyma. For the Westcott needle, suction is used to draw tissue into a specimen notch at the distal end. Gentle back-and-forth movement allows a core of tissue to be cut. Transthoracic Technique Because of the short intrahepatic phase, the transthoracic technique is especially suitable for patients in which sedation is too risky or undesirable and in patients with microhepatica, in which the transabdominal technique may be difficult. The patient is given corn oil orally (1 ml/lb body weight) to cause the gallbladder to contract and thus minimize the risk of inadvertent puncture. A Menghini needle is used to obtain the biopsy specimen. The patient is placed in left lateral recumbency, and the right hemithorax clipped and surgically prepared. A local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously at the needle puncture site: just dorsal to the costochondral junction of the fifth through seventh intercostal space (depending on the size of the patient and distance to the diaphragm). Using a No. 11 blade, a skin incision is made to prevent dulling of the biopsy needle.With the stylet of the Menghini needle in place, the needle is "popped" into the pleural space and then directed caudally and parallel to the rib cage until it contacts the diaphragm (respiratory movements will be felt). Care is taken to avoid lacerating the intercostal vessels that lie along the caudal aspect of each rib. Upon making contact with the diaphragm, the needle depth gauge is slid to within approximately 1.5 cm of the skin so that the depth of penetration into the liver is limited to this distance.The stylet is then removed and quickly replaced with a 12-ml syringe filled with 5 to 6 ml of sterile saline. Negative pressure corresponding to approximately 3 ml of fluid volume is produced by drawing on the plunger. At the peak of expiration, the needle is rapidly thrust into the liver (with the distance limited by the depth gauge) and immediately withdrawn from the patient in one swift motion, maintaining negative pressure throughout. This entire step (i.e., the intrahepatic phase) should last only a split second. The core of hepatic tissue should rest within the fluid in the syringe or in the needle. The plunger is removed and the contents poured into culture broth, onto a slide for impression cytologyic study, and/or into a jar containing 10% formalin. The patient is then immediately turned onto its right side for approximately 5 minutes to allow the weight of the liver to control hemorrhage. Possible complications with this technique include gallbladder puncture (and possible bile peritonitis and pleuritis), pneumothorax, and excessive bleeding. In patients with firm fibrotic livers, this technique may not yield a suitable sample. In this situation a cutting type of needle used with a transabdominal approach may be successful. Transabdominal Technique (Blind) The transabdominal technique is especially useful when the size of the liver is normal or large. It has a longer intrahepatic phase than the transthoracic technique if a cutting type of needle is used, and therefore a higher degree of sedation may be necessary in an uncooperative patient. The patient is given corn oil orally (2 ml/kg body weight) to cause the gallbladder to contract and thus reduce the risk of inadvertent puncture. I prefer to use automated cutting type of needles such as the Monopty or ASAP needles. The patient is placed in right dorsal oblique recumbency at a 45-degree angle. In this position the stomach falls down toward the right side. A large area around the xiphoid cartilage is clipped and surgically prepared. A local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously at the needle entry site: just caudal and to the left of the xiphoid cartilage, in the middle of the "V" formed by the xiphoid cartilage and the rib cage. If the needle enters too far cranially, it may inadvertently enter the thoracic cavity. If there is hepatomegaly, the entry site is moved caudally as appropriate for the hepatic size. The skin is incised with a No. 11 blade to prevent dulling of the biopsy needle. The biopsy needle is inserted and advanced just through the body wall and aimed in a craniolateral direction towards the left shoulder. The needle should be advanced during inspiration. The liver should be very close to the body wall, and the needle need not be advanced very far. Penetration of the liver is often not felt. The most common error using this technique is inserting the needle too far and going completely through the liver. Once the liver is entered the biopsy needle is operated to cut the sample. This is done during peak inspiration. The needle is removed after each attempt. The core of hepatic tissue should be resting within the specimen notch of the needle. If the initial attempt fails to obtain hepatic tissue, the needle is redirected based on perceived location of the liver, body conformation (i.e., deep chested), and direction of previous attempts. Tissue is carefully removed with a 25-gauge needle and placed into culture broth, onto a slide for impression cytologic study, and/or into 10% formalin. The patient is immediately placed in sternal recumbency to allow the weight of the liver to control hemorrhage. Possible complications of this technique include puncture of the stomach, gallbladder rupture (and possible bile peritonitis), puncture of the diaphragm and lung (and possible pneumothorax), and excessive bleeding. Keyhole Technique The keyhole technique offers the advantages of providing more guidance of the needle than blind percutaneous biopsy, being relatively rapid, and being low cost. Disadvantages of this method include the requirement for more sedation com-pared with blind percutaneous biopsy, the possibility of causing inadvertent trauma to other organs, the possibility that focal lesions may be missed, and the possibility that detection of bleeding may be delayed. This technique is especially suitable for individuals who lack the experience to perform a blind percutaneous biopsy. The keyhole technique and equipment are similar to that described for the blind transabdominal percutaneous biopsy. Under a general anesthetic a small incision into the abdominal cavity is made just caudal to the site of needle introduction. A gloved finger is inserted into the abdomen to palpate the liver and stabilize it for biopsy. The needle is inserted through the same incision or through a separate incision just cranial to the first incision. The finger then guides the needle into the liver, and the biopsy specimen is cut. I prefer an automated cutting needle for this technique because it can be operated with one hand, whereas the Tru-Cut needle would require an assistant to operate the needle. Complications are similar to those described for blind percutaneous biopsy. Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy Ultrasound-guided biopsy offers the advantage of providing more guidance to the needle than is possible with blind percutaneous biopsy, is relatively rapid, and requires minimal sedation. Because intraparenchymal lesions can be visualized, biopsy of them can be selectively performed. In addition, other intrahepatic structures such as the gallbladder and portal vessels can be avoided. Disadvantages of ultrasound-guided biopsy include the requirement for expensive equipment and that detection of bleeding may be delayed. As with other biopsy methods, success is operatordependant. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is easier when the liver is normal or large in size. When there is microhepatica, overlying gas in the stomach often makes visualization of the liver difficult. In this setting, laparoscopy would offer a more appropriate image-guided biopsy method. Technique Most dogs require minimal sedation for ultrasound-guided biopsy. I use a low dose of ketamine for cats (10 to 20 mg intravenously) or isoflurane or sevoflurane administered by face mask. A careful ultrasound examination is performed before biopsy. This allows planning of the procedure based on the type of echo pattern, size of the lesion, proximity to other organs, proximity to blood vessels, determination of cystic or solid tissue, and determination of the needle path. For focal liver biopsy the location of the lesion will determine the position of the scan head and needle path. For diffuse lesions the transducer is usually placed just caudal and to the left of the xiphoid and aimed at the left medial or lateral lobes. In patients with extremely small livers, it may be difficult to adequately visualize the needle without stomach gas interfering. In this case placing the patient in a 45-degree right ventral oblique position often helps reduce interference from the stomach. Otherwise the patient is usually placed in dorsal recumbency for most procedures. A rubber trough or V tray assists in positioning. In addition, if the patient is under gas general anesthesia, an assistant compresses the rebreathing bag to hold the patient in deep inspiration. This moves the diaphragm and liver caudally to improve visualization. If a lesion cannot be seen due to overlying gas or bone, changing patient or transducer position usually allows adequate visualization. The area to be scanned, including the needle entry site, is surgically prepared. The ultrasound transducer is covered with sterile plastic wrap (or a sterile glove) after a small amount of coupling gel is placed on the transducer surface. A biopsy guide may be used if desired, allowing accurate placement of the needle in the same plane as the scan. However, it is sometimes desirable to have the needle enter in a different plane due to overlying structures in the plane of the scan, in which case a biopsy guide cannot be used. Biopsy guides also limit the angle of insertion of the needle, and the entry site is usually 2 to 3 cm from the scan head. Therefore for superficial lesions or those in the center of the scan, a biopsy guide should not be used. Furthermore, when the needle is in a rigid biopsy guide, inadvertent trauma to the organ may result if the patient moves or takes a deep breath. A small amount of sterile coupling gel or water-soluble lubricant is placed on the skin, and the ultrasound examination is repeated to verify the needle path. A small stab incision is made in the skin at the needle insertion site. Automated needles are generally preferred because they can be easily operated with one hand. Therefore the needle must be loaded before entry into the abdomen. While one hand maneuvers the transducer, the other hand advances the needle into the organ under direct ultrasound visualization. If the needle tip cannot be seen, gentle movement of the transducer should allow visualization. To allow distinction of the needle from other echogenic structures in the image, the needle can be gently moved in and out. Ideally this should be minimal and just enough to move the organ within the abdominal cavity rather than moving the needle within the organ. If a spinal needle is used, moving the stylet in and out of the stationary needle increases the echogenicity and visualization of the needle tip without creating tissue trauma. Occasionally the needle cannot be visualized. Indirect evidence of organ puncture can be used, including movement of the organ or visualization of motion at the organ border. The needle is directed so the trajectory will avoid other structures when it is fired. Care must be taken to prevent going too deep with the needle, or it will be seen to penetrate the diaphragm and enter the thoracic cavity. Once the biopsy specimen is obtained, the needle is removed. The core of liver should be resting within the specimen notch of the needle. A 25-gauge needle is then carefully used to transfer the tissue into culture broth, onto a slide for impression cytologic study, and/or into 10% formalin. The number of biopsy specimens obtained will depend on the coagulation status of the patient, types of diagnostic tests planned, and adequacy of tissue retrieved. After completion of the procedure, an ultrasound examination is performed to check for excessive hemorrhage. External digital pressure or an abdominal compression wrap may be used to control hemorrhage. Possible complications of this technique are similar to those described above for the blind transabdominal percutaneous biopsy. Laparoscopy-Guided Biopsy The main advantage of laparoscopy-guided biopsy is the ability to visualize the liver, biliary tree, and other abdominal organs. With experience the gallbladder can be examined, palpated with a blunt probe, and the bile duct traced to its entry into the duodenum. In this manner it can be determined whether there is a common bile duct or cystic duct obstruction. In addition, because focal lesions on the liver can be directly visualized, an appropriate biopsy site can be selected, and other intrahepatic structures such as the gallbladder and portal vessels can be avoided. Hemorrhage can be observed and, when excessive, controlled with direct compression with a blunt probe over the biopsy site, with electrocautery, or with application of gel foam. Compared with laparotomy, there is much less anesthetic time.With experience the operator can perform a complete laparoscopic examination and obtain multiple biopsy specimens in 10 to 15 minutes in most cases, and because there is only a 1.0-cm incision, there is much less risk for wound dehiscence. Disadvantages of laparoscopy are the requirement for a general anesthetic and the need for expensive equipment. Details of the equipment and techniques for performing laparoscopy are found in Chapter 3. Potential complications of the procedure include those related to a general anesthetic, excessive bleeding, overdistention of the abdomen with gas, air embolism, and a tension pneumothorax if the diaphragm is inadvertently punctured (as abdominal gas enters the thoracic cavity). In my experience these complications are extremely rare. Laparotomy Biopsy Advantages of a laparotomy biopsy include the ability to view the entire abdominal cavity and to treat disease when surgically correctable. Therefore one can visualize and select the biopsy site. If there is excessive hemorrhage, it can be controlled. However, if there is a known coagulopathy, laparotomy is not advised because of the size of the incision and therefore high potential for additional bleeding. In this setting laparoscopy is the preferred method for obtaining the biopsy specimen. Laparotomy offers the additional advantage of being able to obtain large biopsy specimens. Disadvantages of laparotomy biopsy include the requirement for a long general anesthetic and therefore more risk to the patient. In addition, there may be poor wound healing if severe hypoalbuminemia is present and therefore increased risk for dehiscence. The techniques to obtain hepatic tissue at laparotomy are beyond the scope of this chapter. The reader is referred to surgical textbooks for further information on this subject.
