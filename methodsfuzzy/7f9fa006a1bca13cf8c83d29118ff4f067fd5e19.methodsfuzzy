The questionnaire was evaluated through the four steps listed below: 1. Face validation: In this step, we ensured that the respondents' understanding of the questions was aligned with our goals. 2. Pilot data preparation: In this step, we ensured that response bias was minimized, and we investigated the possibility of predicting missing data. 3. Content validation: In this step, we verified that the question items targeted the aim of the study. 4. Content reliability: In this step, we investigated the relevance of the question items. In the face validation step, the questionnaire was evaluated from the design point of view. None of the respondents reported problems understanding the content of the questionnaire. The options for scaling questions consisted of 6 items that were compatible with the recommendation by Fowler [6] . The items were labeled from negative (strongly disagree) to positive (strongly agree). Labeling the items on a scale using minimal descriptive words helped to eliminate confusion about the value of the scale levels [7] . The next step was data preparation. First, we analyzed the pilot data for outlier responses. The risk of extravagant respondents is a possibility in any survey, especially when the survey is anonymous. To identify the outliers, we used three methods: standardized residuals, Mahalanobis distance and Cook's distance. After removing the outlier responses, we scanned the data for missing values. Missing values are a major factor in reaching valid conclusions. There are methods for calculating these values that remove the effect of hidden bias in the data. We used Expectation Maximization Algorithm (EMA) to calculate the missing values [8] . The next step in the evaluation focused on content validity. There are two methods for measuring the validity of a questionnaire. The first method involves comparing the result with a highly valid measure, such as the work attendance of the participants, to exclude the effect of confounding factors. The second method uses the level of correlation between the dependent and independent variables [9] . The first method was not possible because of the anonymous nature of the study; thus, we applied the second method. To ensure content validity in the second method, the questionnaire should be checked for two issues. The first issue ensures that the independent variables have a minimum level of correlation with the measured dependent variables. This procedure was used to identify irrelevant questions. The second issue involves the identification of highly correlated independent variables. If there is a high degree of correlation between these variables, the questionnaire should be checked again. If possible, it is recommended that these questions be merged, resulting in a shorter questionnaire with the same level of validity. The last step involved checking the reliability of the questionnaire. There are two methods to measure reliability: test-retest and internal consistency [9] . Because of the anonymous nature of the study, it was impossible to utilize the test-retest method; therefore, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was calculated. This test can identify variables that may reduce the inter-correlation between the question variables. If possible, omitting these variables improves the consistency of the questionnaire.
