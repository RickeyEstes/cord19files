With the rapid transmission of 2019-nCov recently, the data that NHS publishes data every day at regular intervals, including the number of accumulated confirmed cases, existing confirmed cases, new confirmed cases, existing suspected cases and new suspected cases. Considering the historical additivity of the number of accumulated confirmed cases, the number of existing confirmed cases is that the number of accumulated confirmed cases minus the number of cure and death cases. However, these two data are relatively small and the number of existing suspected cases has historical additivity and some overlap with the number of confirmed cases, so this paper chooses the number of new confirmed cases and new suspected cases to predict 2019-nCov 1 . NHS began to publish the daily data of new confirmed epidemic on January 17, 2020. This paper chooses the number of new confirmed cases from January 17, 2020 to February 9, 2020, totaled 24 days. The daily new suspected cases began to publish later so we choose the number of new suspected cases from January 20, 2020 to February 9, 2020, totaled 21 days. The data of the last seven days to be kept as the prediction set and the rest as the training prediction model of training set. The main affected area of this 2019-nCov is China, and foreign confirmed cases are also related to the flow of Chinese residents, so this paper chooses the data of Baidu, the most widely used search engine in China. Baidu Index 2 regularly published the search volume of the previous day in the form of search terms. According to the latest research, the incubation period of 2019-nCov is 7-14 days. Baidu search data of 40 days from January 1, 2020 to February 9, 2020 were chose to ensure that Baidu data has enough lead time compared with the epidemic data.
