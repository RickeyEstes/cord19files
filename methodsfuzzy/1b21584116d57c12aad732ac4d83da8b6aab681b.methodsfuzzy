The research subjects are government contingency plans. A standard plan is composed of the organizational structure and operational mechanism at all phases of the emergency management. It also describes the responsibilities of the concerned departments and actions to take to respond to various levels of emergencies. This study uses a mixed method (Williams & Shepherd, 2017) to analyze a research sample of 110 contingency plans of F District in Shanghai. Data were obtained from the evaluation of the contingency plans in two ways. (1) The traditional Likert scale method measures several attributes of the contingency plan using mature scales from previous studies. (2) Social network method generates attributes from the network structure of the department network in each contingency plan. The network is established by assessing the context of the plan and whether or not two departments have certain interactions, as shown in Table 1 . All stated departments in an emergency management office (committee) usually have bilateral interactions with one another. On the basis of this standard, an undirected relation matrix is constructed for each network in 110 plans, where 1 indicates the existence of interactions and 0 means none. Next, the matrix is calculated using two formulas to generate the two structural attributes of the network, namely, accessibility (Stephenson & Zelen, 1989) and connectedness (Borgatti, 1997; Borgatti & Halgin, 2011) . Data gathered using the Likert scale and social network matrix were combined, and a multiple linear regression model was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Fig. 4 illustrates the data processing procedure. The mixed method retains the advantage of the traditional approach of subjective data gathering, which comprises a survey and a questionnaire. This method mines data from the context of contingency plans to ensure the objectiveness of network relations. For measurements that are hard to quantify with objective data, we used the Delphi method to evaluate the corresponding content in the contingency plan and eliminate the bias caused by subjective data gathering. Given that the evaluation procedures are conducted by the researcher and other experts, the possible reliability problem of traditional questionnaire surveys decreases. This study is based on two groups of respondents who score dependent and independent variables, but the scoring system shares the same contingency plan. CMB is a systematic bias that comes from the shared variance among measured variables. It arises when they are assessed using a common method, such as the same data source or respondent, measuring environment, and project content (Siemsen, Roth, & Oliveira, 2010; Zhou & Long, 2004) . The most commonly used method to inspect bias is Hermon's singlefactor test. The first extracted factor is the single method factor, which explains 45.91% (< 50%) of the variance in the sample data. Afterward, a confirmative factor analysis was conducted on Hermon's single-factor model. The results indicate that the suitability measurement (X^2/df = 3.563, RMSEA = 0.153, NNFI = 0.617, CFI = 0.687) of the model with only the single method factor and dependent variable is significantly different from that of the original model (X^2/ df = 1.583, RMSEA = 0.073, NNFI = 0.837, CFI = 0.932). To verify the results, we added the single method factor into the original model and examined the goodness of fit (Flynn et al., 2010; Paulraj, Lado, & Chen, 2008) , which is high (ΔX^2/df = −0.309, ΔRMSEA = −0.023, ΔNNFI = 0.048, ΔCFI = 0.004). The conclusion is that common method variance did not significantly influence our results.
