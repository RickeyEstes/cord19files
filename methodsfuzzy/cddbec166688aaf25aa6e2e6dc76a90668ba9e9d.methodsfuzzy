Cell lines and constructs A549 (adenocarcinoma of human lung epithelia) cell lines stably expressing C-terminally HA-tagged human (hu) IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3, as well as untransfected A549 cells [23] , were cultured in Ham's F-12-GlutaMAX media (tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, unless indicated otherwise) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA) and 1% (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, 10,000 unit/ml/10,000 mg/ ml). HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM-GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) Pen/Strep. All cell lines were maintained at 37uC and 5% CO 2 . Untagged IFITM1 and IFITM1-Vstop (a construct with a stop codon after Val109) were purchased from GeneArt and cloned into BamH1/ Not1 sites of pcDNA3.1. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Source BioScience).
