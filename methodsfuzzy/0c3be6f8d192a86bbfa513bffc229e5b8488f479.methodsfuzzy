In order to analyze the interview texts and responses, a triangulation technique was adopted with the primary data from face-to-face and online surveys. The aim was to gather a richer explanation related to the firsthand experiences of first responders during the Ebola Crisis, while providing a balanced picture on controversial issues related to information dissemination, communication and response procedures adopted, and perceptions of intergovernmental coordination. Others have advocated this technique to examine various viewpoints [2, 13] . This technique was also employed with the secondary data collected, to cross-check inferences made from primary data analyses as suggested by scholars O'Donoghue and Punch [32] . One of the concerns in applying the technique is related to the type of questions asked of respondents and how best to interpret their responses. While there is a potential for misinterpretation of information provided, special care was taken to clarify meanings of words that may be contradictory to the context under discussion. The coding process of texts generated from interviews was done in two stages. In the first stage of coding, an independent coder was assigned to record the responses provided by 24 face-to-face respondents. A second coder was employed to highlight key points made by the respondents and classified these by major themes or categories. In the second stage, the researchers verified the major themes with secondary data collected from the printed materials as well as primary data collected from surveys. The coding process focused on answering the research questions and all materials were read carefully multiple times.
