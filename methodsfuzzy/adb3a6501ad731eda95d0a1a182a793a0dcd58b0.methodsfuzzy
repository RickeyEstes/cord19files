Data From a total of 195 worldwide locations (reflecting mainly countries without taking any position on territorial claims), we included n =194, which excludes the epicenter China. Data on imported cases aggregated by location were obtained from the WHO technical report dated 4th February 2020 1 (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed). We used case counts up to the 4th February, because after this date the number of exported cases from Hubei province drops rapidly 1 , likely due to the Hubei-wide lockdowns. We defined imported cases as those with known travel history from China (of those, 83% had travel history from Hubei province, and 17% from unknown locations in China 1 ). Estimates on daily air travel volume were obtained from Lai et al. 8 Singapore as a special case for surveillance of COVID-19, and we assign it it's own category of highest-achieved surveillance. This study did not include human subjects, used publicly available data, and therefore no ethical approval was required.
