Preliminary design of the yeast-based assay. a Pichia pastoris strain clone of SMd1168H carrying ToPoi in a pPicZαa plasmid was generated in our previous study (13) , and was referred to as SMd1168H-ToPoi. This clone was used for the development of the yeast-based screening assay in the present study. The assay was designed to have the following characteristics: i) Easy to operate with no special skill required; ii) no specific equipment is required, and can be performed with a simple laboratory set-up, for instance using only a shaker flask system; iii) the yeast cell density is the main component of the assay, therefore, no additional detection kit, enzyme or reagent is needed other than the chemical, medium and reagent to maintain the yeast cells; iv) a short amount of time is required to complete the full assay (<1 week), and the assay can be performed at room temperature or at least in a laboratory equipped with an air-conditioner; and v) produces results that are comparable to cell-based screening assays. Yeast cultivation for the cell density measurement. Yeast culture stocks (SMD1168H, SMD1168H-pPICZαa and SMd1168H-ToPoi), which were constructed and stored in glycerol at -80˚C as previously described (13) , were retrieved and enriched using 5 ml buffered glycerol-complex medium (BMGY) in a universal bottle. The transformed yeast strain was incubated overnight at 15-20˚C in an incubator shaker at 250 rpm. Subsequently, 250 µl of the overnight culture was transferred into a 250 ml conical flask that contained 25 ml fresh BMGY. The culture was then incubated in the shaker for another 16 h at 15-20˚C with agitation at 250 rpm, until the exponential growth phase was reached. The growth of the yeast cells was induced using 1.0% (v/v) methanol. after 12 h of incubation, culture medium with 100 µM glutamate or L-glutamic acid (97% purity; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaa, darmstadt, Germany; serving as a growth agonist) was added, and cells were incubated for 96 h. a small volume of the sample was withdrawn from the treated culture every 12 h for cell density measurement, and the yeast cell density was expected to be enhanced under these conditions. an optional step involved replenishing the same volume of the medium containing the drug solution in order to maintain the original culture volume. Throughout the assay, methanol was added every 24 h. alternatively, camptothecin (97% purity; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA; serving as a growth antagonist) was added to the culture instead of glutamate. Similar to glutamate-treated cells, samples were withdrawn from the yeast cell culture treated with 100 µM camptothecin every 12 h for cell density measurement, and the cell density was expected to be inhibited under these culture conditions. Measurement of the glutamate-and camptothecin-treated yeast cell density by spectrophotometry. The cell density (culture turbidity) of the collected samples was assessed at an optical density of 600 nm every 12 h for 72 h using a spectrophotometer, and the turbidity level in each sample was recorded. The value of the samples was then compared with the value of the background control. Next, the growth profile of the yeast at each time-point was plotted. The density (unit) of the yeast culture was expected to grow continuously or to be reduced by ~40% following treatment with glutamate or camptothecin, respectively, for 96 h compared with the density of the background control and relative to the measurement at 12 h of cultivation. The normal yeast (SMd1168H) and the yeast transformed with only the pPicZαa plasmid (SMd1168H-pPicZαa; without the inserted gene) were used as the controls. Subsequently, the overall response of the yeast culture treated with camptothecin was compared with the performance of the drug in a cell-based MTT assay. Analysis of the inhibitory effect on camptothecin-treated cell lines by MTT assay. as SMd1168H-ToPoi was expected to mimic cancer cells, an MTT assay was conducted to examine the effect of camptothecin on various human cell lines and compare it with the effect in yeast cells. The cell lines used in this assay included highly metastatic Mda-MB-231 breast cancer cells, weakly metastatic CAL-27 oral cancer and McF-7 breast cancer cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and McF-10a normal breast cells. all cell lines used in the present study were previously purchased from the american Type culture collection (Manassas, Va, uSa) and cultured in respective growth medium in the laboratory. The cancerous cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (dMeM) supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 µg/ml streptomycin/penicillin, whereas the non-cancerous cells were maintained in dMeM/F12 medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 mg/ml insulin, 10% FBS and 100 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The aforementioned culture reagents were all purchased from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, 2x10 4 cells/ml of each cell line were seeded in 96-well plates and routinely cultured in a humidified incubator at 37˚C with 5% co 2 for 24 h or until the cells reached ~70% confluence. Subsequently, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0-100 µg/ml) of camptothecin solution for 24, 48 and 72 h. at the end of each incubation period, 24 µl MTT reagent (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to each well, and the reaction was incubated for 4 h. The solution was carefully removed without disturbing the formazan crystals that had formed in each well. Subsequently, 100 µl acidified isopropanol was added to each well and agitated for homogeneous colour development. Following colour development, the intensity of the colour in the plate was measured at 570 nm using an eliSa plate reader. dose response curves were generated from cell viability (%) plotted against the logarithmic scale (log) concentration of drug used. The responses of camptothecin in cell-based and yeast-based assays were then compared. Statistical analysis. all graphs were generated and statistical analysis of data was performed using one-way analysis of variance via Friedman test by GraphPad Prism software (version 7.04 for Windows; GraphPad Software, inc., la Jolla, ca, uSa). Subsequent to the initial measurement/analysis, the experiments were repeated twice for cell density measurement (n=3 in total) and three times for cell inhibitory effect analysis (n=4 in total) to confirm the consistency, repeatability and reproducibility of the results. all values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
