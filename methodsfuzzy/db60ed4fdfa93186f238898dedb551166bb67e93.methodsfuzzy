Infants and children hospitalized with acute gastroentefitis at Children's Hospital National Medical Center were screened on admission and selected for study if they had diarrhea for a period of four days or less prior to admission. From January through December, 1974, infants and children predominantly through 24 months of age (87 patients total) were admitted to the study. Later, all patients hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis, regardless of age, were included. Informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian in each case. Shortly after admission, certain specimens were obtained from each patient with acute gastroenteritis and processed as follows: (1) A nose and throat swab and an anal swab were inoculated into human embryonic kidney, HEp-2, and rhesus monkey kidney cells for virus isolation; the throat swab was additionally inoculated into WI-38 cells and a diphasic mycoplasma medium, (2) Anal swabs were plated at the bedside into eosin methylene btue agar, Shigella-Salmonella agar, phenyt ethyl alcohol agar, and gram-negative broth for isolation of enteric bacterial pathogens. (3) Up to four diarrheal stools or occasionally anal swab specimens were examined by electron microscopy and/or immune electron microscopy. (4) Blood samples were drawn for serologic tests. The study group of 152 included nine patients from whom a stool or rectal swab specimen was not obtained but from whom paired sera were available. The clinical records of 150 of these patients were examined retrospectively by three of us. Two records were unavailable for analysis. The patients were grouped into four categories of dehydration: none, mild, moderate, or severe. Initial clinical laboratory studies included complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, serum electrolytes, urinalysis, and urine specific gravity. Whenever possible, these studies were repeated until test results returned to normal. Bacterial cultures of blood, urine, and spinal fluid were made when indicated by the patient's clinical condition. Mucoid portions of diarrhea stools from 72 patients were smeared and air dried on glass slides. These slides were Wright stained and examined for the presence of Ieukocytes or leukocyte fragments. At least one stool and/or swab specimen from each child hospitalized with gastroenteritis was examined by EM or IEM as described, u, ,0 For EM examination, stools were prepared into 2% filtrates and examined routinely by using an homologous convalescent serum or immune human serum globulin as the source of antibody." ...... Paired acute and convalescent sera from 117 of the 152 patients studied were tested for complement-fixing antibody response to HRVLA stool filtrates antigen and/or Nebraska calf diarrhea virus, a closely related agent.,.s.,~-l~ Typing of enteric pathogenic bacteria was according to routine methods. Polyvalent sera for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were available only for groups A and B. Typing of EPEC was carried out routinely only on specimens obtained from patients under 24 months of age. Heat labile enterotoxin production of a selected number of E. coli strains was searched for as described earlier. ~
