Since 1956 once-a-day feeding of liquid has become acceptable management. A review (3) of several experiments indicated good performance of calves fed milk, colostrum, or milk replacer once daily. Quality, amount, and concentration of milk replacer require careful attention, but labor requirements for feeding can be reduced as much as 40% (45) . Reduction of liquid feeding to six times per week also has been reported. Although this procedure resulted in satisfactory gains and health, it has not been adopted by calf growers. Feeding milk or milk replacer by open pail is common, although nipple feeding by pail or bottle is chosen by many calf raisers. No advantage in calf health or performance has been shown for either method. Feeding large numbers of calves by either of these methods is slow and tedious, and producers have been interested in automated feeding. Mobile units with refrigerated storage of feed that automatically dispense feed at given intervals have been used where large numbers of calves are fed. Stationary automatic dispensers also have been used. Pelissier (52) reported that many large operators dispense milk by hose from mobile thermos tanks into individual pails rather than to use automated systems. Others have organized feeding with equipment for mixing and transporting liquid feed in nipple bottles or pails. Time for clean-up of equipment also has been reduced through organization and provision of good facilities. The offering of liquid diets at cold rather than warm temperatures was investigated. Cold milk or milk replacer fed in moderate environmental temperatures generally has supported gains equal to or superior to warm liquid. For veal calves fed ad libitum, warm liquid is preferred. There was some indication of increased diarrhea with cold milk feeding, but growth was not suppressed (3, 67) . Abrupt weaning of calves at an early age is an acceptable practice (3, 45) . If weaned at 21 days, calves may suffer from slightly depressed growth rates. However, by 12 wk of age, earlyweaned calves and later-weaned calves (6 wk) are of similar weights. Weaning according to starter intake has found some acceptance, but abrupt weaning usually stimulates dry feed consumption. Starter intake can be stimulated by placing the dry feed in the pail immediately after liquid has been consumed. In general, weaning age has been reduced sharply and good results can be obtained with weaning at 21 to 35 days of age. peared in publications of the National Research Council (46) . Ingredient composition of starters has been studied (42) and, in general, simple well-balanced preparations have supported good growth as well as more complicated formulations. Various sources of protein such as soybean, linseed, cottonseed, rapeseed, peanut, sunflower, meat, and fish meals were satisfactory in starters, and dried skim milk was not superior to vegetable protein. Dried poultry manure also has been used with success, but nonprotein nitrogen in calf starters has produced variable results and usually is not recommended (45) . In addition, supplementation of starters with amino acids has not proven beneficial. Extremely low crude fiber does not support gains as well as moderate fiber. The exact percentage has not been ascertained and probably depends on other factors such as physical form of fiber (77) . Fiber below 5 to 6% probably will not produce best growth, and some bloating may occur (42) . Simple mixtures with 13.9% crude fiber supported growth as well as a complex mixture containing 6% crude fiber. Pellets are not accepted as well as coarsely ground mash (78) . Mashes generally have a higher proportion of larger particles, suggesting that 50% of the particles should be larger than 1190/.tm (16 mesh) (78) . Complete or all-in-one rations have been developed for calves. These rations have reduced the labor requirement in rearing and assure a uniform intake of nutrients. Various sources of forages have been used with amounts depending on source (25) , but most results have been satisfactory with 25 to 35% roughage. Often the diet has been pelleted, and Bartley (4) found .48 cm pellets preferable to .95 cm pellets. Warner et al. (78) developed formulations of all-in-one diets for calves from birth to 32 wk. Starters vary in protein and fiber concentration according to age of calf.
