As summarized in Table 1 , bacterial isolation, characterization of virulence and pathogenicity factors, RNA detection of viruses by RT-PCR, and coproparasitologic exams for the detection of nematode eggs as well as of protozoan cysts and oocysts were performed on the samples. Discrimination between Cystoisospora spp. and Eimeria spp. was achieved by the modified sugar flotation technique (Sheather's sugar solution) performed after the feces with 2.5 % potassium dichromate were incubated for 5-12 days at 37 Â°C in a biological oxygen demand (BOD) incubator [3] .
