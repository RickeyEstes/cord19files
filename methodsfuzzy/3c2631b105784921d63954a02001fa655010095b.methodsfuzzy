Antisera. Monoclonal antibodies (mouse) (mAB) against CO 13 (clone Sl.101) and CD 26 (clone BA5) were purchased from Oianova (Hamburg). Polyclonal mono specific rabbit-anti-rat-(pRAR)APN antiserum (used by Kettmann et aI., 1992b) and polyclonal mono specific rabbit-anti-rat-(pRAR)OPP IV antiserum (gift of Dr. A. Heider, Institute of Pathological Biochemistry, Martin Luther University of Halle, Germany) were used for labelling the rat small intestine. For the double labelling investigations polyclonal rabbit-anti-pig-(pRAP)OPP IV antiserum could be used because of its cross-reactivity with human OPP IV. This specificity was proved by 2-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis according to Laurell (1965) and by Western blot described by Kettmann et al. (1992b) . Electron microscopy embedding technique. Tissues. Small pieces of fresh human kidney cortex (operation specimens) and sections of small intestine from rats after sacrifice in ether anesthesia were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed in 2070 formaldehyde and 0.02% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 3 washes with PBS. Cells. After centrifugation and washing twice in PBS cultured human synovial fibroblasts and Ilr2-stimulated T lymphocytes (gift of Dr. O. Riemann, Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University of Halle, Germany) were fixed with 2070 formaldehyde and 0.02% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min, followed by 2 washes with PBS and subsequently embedded in 7% gelatine (Si&ma, St. Louis, USA) in PBS. Afterwards all fixed samples were incubated with 1.15 M sucrose and 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K15, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in PBS for approximately 2 days at 5 0c. Further processing and cryosectioning were done following the methods of Tokuyasu (1973 Tokuyasu ( , 1989 . Ultrathin cryosectioning was performed with a Reichert-lung FC 4E cryouitramicrotome. Immunolabelling. The cryosections were transferred to formvar-coated nickel grids (Bio Cell Plano, Marburg), washed with PBS, afterwards with PBS containing 50 mM glyCine and finally with 0.5% albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) and 0.2% gelatine (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) in PBS. The sections were incubated in a moist chamber with the specific antiserum (dilution 1 : 100) at 5 Â°C overnight. The reaction with gold-labelled secondary antibody or protein A was done for 1 h at room temperature. Goat-anti-mouse IgG (GAM, Aurion Immuno Gold, Wageningen, The Netherlands) was labelled with 6 nm and 12 nm gold particles, protein A (Bio Cell Plano, Marburg) with 10 nm gold particles. After washing in PBS and tri-distilled water the sections were embedded in 1.1 % tylose (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) containing 0.5% uranyl acetate. Controls were done by replacing the specific serum with the respective preimmunserum. Double labelling. In the first technique APN and OPP IV were successively labelled with antibodies raised in the same species (Geuze et aI., 1981) . The first antigen was marked according to the standard labelling procedure with GAM 6 nm gold. The free binding places of the primary antibody were saturated by incubation with unlabelled goat-anti-mouse IgG (lmmunpnip., Berlin) 0.01070 in PBG for 15 min. The other antigen was labelled with a specific antibody and GAM-conjugated gold particles of different diameter (15 nm, Aurion Immuno Gold, Wageningen, The Netherlands) as used for the first incubation. In the second technique the two antigens were simultaneously labelled with antibodies from different origin (Tapia et aI., 1983). The procedure was carried out as common labelling with the mixed primary (pRAP-OPP IV antiserum and mAB against GO 13) and secondary antibodies [GAM-6 nm gold and goat-anti-rabbit IgG (GAR) 10 nm gold (Bio Cell Plano, Marburg)]. To control successfully double labelling one of the two specific antisera was replaced by the respective preimmunserum. Additionally, the labelling sequence of APN and OPP IV was changed. Furthermore, the double labelling results were compared with the corresponding single labelling.
