Clinically, diagnosis of human NoV infection is usually based on the symptoms, such as acute onset of vomiting; watery, nonbloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps; nausea; low-grade fever; and headaches. However, to confirm the cause, we must rely on laboratory diagnostic tools, particularly because many human NoV infections are asymptomatic. Because human NoVs cannot be grown in cell culture, viral RNA, viral proteins, or viral particles are targets for detection. Limitations for NoV detection are low concentration of viruses in a sample and extreme genetic and antigenic diversity seen within the genus Norovirus. There are no cross-reactive antibodies that can detect all circulating strains using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Likewise, nucleic acid detection assays are also hampered by low sequence homology because of genetic diversity. Thus, a single primer pair is insufficient for detecting all NoV strains and yet be free of false-positive reactions. For viral particle detection, EM, IEM, and solidphase IEM (SPIEM) are expensive, require a highly trained observer to distinguish NoVs from other enteric viruses, and a large number of outbreak specimens cannot be rapidly examined. Detection of human NoV in implicated foods is complicated by the complexity of the food matrix and low levels of viruses. 52 In general, determination of foodborne outbreaks associated with human NoV relies on epidemiologic investigations or laboratory testing. The virus must be isolated from people who have become ill after consumption of the same food items. Sometimes, an outbreak may be traced to a food handler who also harbors human NoV. The recent trend in food microbiology to focus on viruses will certainly lead to improved molecular detection methods for human NoV in foods. A summary of detection methods can be found in Table 2 . Initially, RNA detection methods for NoVs were reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. 53, 54 RT quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays are considered to be the gold standard for NoV detection and are used in many public health, clinical, food, environmental, and research laboratories. [55] [56] [57] In addition to RT-PCR and RT-qPCR, other amplification variations, such as RT multiplex PCR, 55, 58, 59 RT-nested PCR, 60,61 direct RT-PCR, 62 RT-nested, real-time PCR, 63 RT-booster PCR, 64 and nucleic acid sequence-based amplifications 50, 51 have been used for the detection of NoVs in various specimens. Recently, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach has also been used for the rapid detection of NoVs. [65] [66] [67] To have a 90% probability for detecting an NoV as a cause for an outbreak, at least 3 samples from the same patient need to be tested using a standard RT-PCR assay. 68 Because NoV molecular detection methods, like RT-qPCR, are not always costeffective or adaptable to some health care settings (eg, physician offices, local health departments, small laboratories, off-site clinics, nursing homes, field sites) commercial EIAs have been developed for testing human specimens. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] Immunologic detection of NoVs has shown limited application of early-generation EIAs/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A review of 10 EIA/ELISA studies indicated that the sensitivity for NoV detection ranged from 31% to 90% and specificity ranged from 65% to 100%. 74 The evaluation of third-generation EIAs has shown vast improvement in both sensitivity and specificity. 59, 60 Consequently, some commercial EIA kits offer an improvement for rapid diagnosis of sporadic infections and also are more applicable for outbreak screenings. To have a 90% probability for detecting an NoV as a cause for an outbreak, a minimum of 6 specimens from the same patient have to be tested when using earlier-generation ELISAs. 68 Immunochromatographic (ICGs) assays have been developed and could be helpful, especially for screening specimens from sporadic and outbreak cases. [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] In addition, simple, sensitive, specific, rapid, and inexpensive point-of-care tests (POCTs) would be a helpful medical and public health asset. The best POCTs for NoVs are ICG assays. POCT kits for human NoVs have the potential to be improved in sensitivity and specificity as a result of recent developments in fluorescence immunochromatography. 80 Human NoVs have been detected by EM procedures. 11, 69, 74 Although direct EM has limited sensitivity, in any outbreak in which human NoV is the suspected cause and molecular detection results are repeatedly negative for human NoV, patient specimens should be examined by direct EM for a potential viral pathogens. Because of the low specificity of many of the human NoV molecular assays, a correct diagnosis may be missed by these techniques and direct EM would elucidate human NoV as the cause. Also, other nonspecified viral agents may be identified using direct EM and may not be detected by clinical laboratory assays. Because many diagnostic laboratories may not have the capacity for direct EM analysis of viruses causing gastroenteritis, a partnering with the public health system would be required for this type of identification. In addition, pooling outbreak specimens and concentrating specimen pools would speed the detection of any cause. Once a potential cause has been detected in a pool, then more time can be taken to examine individual specimens for an agent that matches any agent found in a concentrated pool. It is difficult to predict future trends for the detection of human NoVs. However, there is a high probability that the current RT-qPCR approach for detecting NoVs in clinical specimens will be modified by using nanoparticle probes. A nucleic acid, multiplexed test, based on nanosphere and microarray technology, is already available for the detection of respiratory viruses. 81 The complete process, from sample to final results, takes approximately 2.5 hours. 81 With this technology, it should be feasible to detect in clinical specimens a wide variety of NoV genogroups, genotypes, and new genetic variants all in the same specimen on a real-time basis. The future is bright for the rapid and accurate point-of-care detection of NoVs. Human NoV has high environmental stability and a low infectious dose, which makes controlling the transmission of the virus challenging. The CDC has published guidelines for disinfection procedures after a human NoV outbreak, and the recommended disinfectant for surface disinfection is 1000 to 5000 ppm of household bleach (sodium hypochlorite). 13 However, because human NoV cannot be cultivated, the efficacy of this treatment and other disinfectants approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency for human NoV has been established using surrogate viruses. [82] [83] [84] These surrogate viruses may not accurately represent the disinfection kinetics of human NoV, but they remain the most suitable representation. The CDC recommends increasing cleaning wards to twice daily and contact surfaces to 3 times daily with 1000 to 5000 ppm chlorine or an EPA-approved disinfectant during a human NoV outbreak, to increase the efficacy of decontamination. A summary of current data on the efficacy of sanitizers against human NoV clinical isolates can be found in Table 3 . 85 Most of these data have relied solely on RT-qPCR assessment of genomic RNA copies; however, a method coupling genomic RNA detection with human NoV binding ability to HBGAs has recently been used to more accurately determine viral inactivation. 86 Although sanitizers can be used on human NoV-contaminated surfaces, most are not approved for food use. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sodium hypochlorite at the concentration of less than 200 ppm may be used for food sanitization purposes (FDA CFR 178.1010, 2011). This concentration of chlorine is not effective (1-2 log virus reduction) in removing viral contaminants. [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] The food matrix and organic material also affect the ability of the sanitizers to inactive viruses. Thermal treatment is an effective means for inactivation of most pathogens; however, appropriate D values (the temperature and time required to eliminate 1 log of a pathogen) have not been established for human NoV. Recent data on the thermal inactivation of human NoV are presented in Table 3 . However, the highest-risk foods for human NoV contamination (fresh produce and shellfish) are normally minimally processed, eaten raw, or mildly heated. Several nonthermal processing options exist for the treatment of fresh produce and shellfish, including: high-pressure processing (HPP), g irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, ozone, and pulsed electric field. Many of these technologies have been evaluated for efficacy against human NoV using surrogates (such as murine NoV and feline calicivirus). 29, 92, 93 Research in nonthermal processing on human NoV clinical isolates is summarized in Table 3 . The most promising human NoV inactivation technology seems to be HPP. Human NoV-inoculated oysters treated with 600 MPa for 5 minutes were subsequently fed to human volunteers and these oysters did not cause infection in humans, indicating virus inactivation. 94 Similarly, pressures of 700 MPa for 45 minutes could inhibit the binding of human NoV VLPs to their HBGA receptors. 28 Another study using high-pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 5 minutes to treat GI.1 and GII.4 NoV isolates significantly decreased the ability of the virus to bind to HBGA receptors. 95 These studies of HPP are promising; however, further research using human NoV isolates is required to substantiate these findings, as well as to more appropriately evaluate other nonthermal processes for viral inactivation.
