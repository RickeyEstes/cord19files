The PCR protocol was optimised to ensure that, for each cytokine assessed, the prodct generated a single band on an agarose gel and ran at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 5) . Thirty to thirty-five PCR cycles were shown to be within the linear phase of amplification, as determined by assessing replicate tubes run for multiples of five cycles. Titration of the cDNA template prior to amplification revealed a linear relationship between the amount of template added and the intensity of the resulting autoradiograph image. The intensity of the product was shown to be proportional to the logarithm of the template concentration (Fig. 6) . The cytokine assays were found not to be compromised by DNA contamination. This was confirmed by running`no RT'-PCR controls and by removing the DNAse step. Thè no RT'-PCR controls failed to generate product bands and removing the DNAse step had no effect on the product. For the cytokines the RT-PCR reactions produced single bands of the expected molecular weight, (albeit rather weak in the case of IL-12), while the`no RT'-PCR reactions failed to generate visible product. The G3PDH`no-RT'-PCR reaction produced a very faint band of the same molecular weight as that seen for the corresponding RT-PCR. Southern blotting and ECL labelling confirmed the specificity of the bands in the RT-PCR reactions and revealed no bands in the cytokine`no RT'-PCR controls. It also confirmed the specificity of the G3PDH band in the`no RT'-PCR control. The expression of this band did not appear to be due to contaminating genomic DNA as it Fig. 5 .

Since it was shown that DNAse treatment failed to alter the product generated, the step was not incorporated in later studies.
