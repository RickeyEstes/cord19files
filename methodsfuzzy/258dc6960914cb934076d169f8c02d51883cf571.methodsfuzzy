Consecutive patients aged >18 years were prospectively recruited between November 2004 and January 2006 after referral to a tertiary cardiovascular centre for a coronary angiogram to investigate suspected CAD. Only those with significant obstructive CAD were eligible for this study. Patients in cardiogenic shock, with a past history of congestive heart failure or with a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < 30% on angiography were excluded. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at Austin Health, Melbourne and the study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave informed written consent. A standardised medical questionnaire was completed and verified with the hospital medical record. Blood pressure was measured and anthropometric measurements were taken. Obstructive CAD was defined as !50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or !70% stenosis in ! 1 other major epicardial coronary artery by visual assessment on invasive coronary angiography. [18] Diabetes was diagnosed based on a documented history, treatment with glucose lowering therapy or if fasting blood glucose was >7 mmol/L. Hypertension was defined if previously diagnosed by a physician and/or current use of anti-hypertensive medication. Dyslipidaemia was defined if previously diagnosed by a physician and/or current use of lipid lowering agents. Cigarette smoking was defined as smoking within the preceding 12 months. Fasting blood samples were collected at the time of admission for measurement of kidney function, lipids, and troponin. The Access AccuTnI assay (Beckman-Coulter, Chaska, MN, USA) was used to measure plasma troponin with the 99 th percentile of a healthy reference population of 0.04 μg/L. Levels of ! 0.04 μg/L (99 th percentile) were considered abnormal in this study. For plasma ACE2 measurement, blood was collected within 48 hours of presentation into lithium heparin tubes, and plasma was obtained by centrifuging blood at 3000 rpm at 4˚C for 10 minutes and stored at-80˚C until tested. Plasma ACE2 activity was measured within 2 years after all samples were collected. Samples were batched and ACE2 assays were run over a period of 2 days. The catalytic activity of ACE2 was measured using a validated, sensitive quenched fluorescent substrate-based assay as previously described. [9] Briefly, plasma (0.25 ml) was diluted into low-ionic-strength buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) and added to 200 μl ANXSepharose 4 Fast-Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) that removed a previously characterized endogenous inhibitor of ACE2 activity. [9] After binding and washing, the resulting eluate was assayed for ACE2 catalytic activity. Duplicate samples were incubated with the ACE2-specific quenched fluorescent substrate, with or without 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The rate of substrate cleavage was determined by comparison to a standard curve of the free fluorophore, 4-amino-methoxycoumarin (MCA; Sigma, MO, USA) and expressed as ρmole of substrate cleaved/mL of plasma/min. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5.6 and 11.8% respectively. The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as CV death, hospitalisation for HF or myocardial infarction (MI). The secondary endpoint was HF hospitalisation. Endpoints were described according to the 2014 American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association definitions for CV endpoints in clinical trials. [19] CV death was defined as death due to sudden cardiac death, HF, acute MI, cerebrovascular accident, CV haemorrhage, CV procedures or other CV causes, that is death not included in the previous categories but with a specific, known CV cause such as pulmonary embolism. [19] Hospitalisation for HF was defined as an event where the patient is admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of HF where the length of stay is at least 24 hours, where the patient exhibits new or worsening symptoms of heart failure on presentation, has objective evidence of new or worsening heart failure and receives intensification of treatment specifically for heart failure. [19] Myocardial infarction was defined as the clinical diagnosis of ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction according to established criteria. [20, 21] Clinical outcomes were collected by an experienced blinded investigator via medical records review and by contacting each patient and/or the nominated general practitioner for additional information. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA, version 14.2 (Statacorp., College Station, TX, USA). Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and non-normally distributed data (Plasma ACE2 activity, triglycerides, troponin and glomerular filtration rate) are expressed as the median and inter-quartile range (IQR). Student t test or the Mann Whitney U test (for non-normally distributed data) was used to assess differences in continuous variables between patients with above and below median ACE2 activity. Categorical variables are expressed as counts and percentages and compared using Fisher's exact or chi-square tests. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables that may independently influence plasma ACE2 activity. Plasma ACE2 activity, troponin levels and glomerular filtration rate were natural-logarithm transformed for analysis because of their skewed distribution. This rendered a more normal distribution by visual inspection of the distribution of the variables and Q-Q plots. Cumulative incidence of MACE was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method and the logrank test used to evaluate differences between patients with below and above median plasma ACE2 activity. When multiple end-points occurred during follow-up, the time to the first event was considered for analysis of MACE. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for MACE. Significant variables (p < 0.1) from univariate analysis were entered into the final multivariate model to identify independent predictors of MACE. Conventional prognostic variables were used including age, history of diabetes, log troponin and treatment with statin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in addition to log ACE2. Two-tailed p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
