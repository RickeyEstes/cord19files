2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids, growth condition and animals L. lactis NZ3900 (LL) and L. lactis food-grade expression vector pNZ8149 were from NIZO food research (Kernhemseweg, Netherlands). The lactobacilli were grown in M17 medium (Merck, Germany), supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17) or 0.5% lactose (LM17) at 30°C without shaking. E. coli BL21 (DE3; Novagen, USA) was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm. Agar (15 g/l) was added to the media when agar plates were required. LB medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin as required. Female BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old) were purchased from the animal facility of Production Complex of Pasteur Institute of Iran (Karaj, Iran). All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by Ethical Committee of Pasteur Institute of Iran.
