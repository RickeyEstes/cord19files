Larisa Gubareva, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA. As a World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) Collaborating Centre, the Influenza Division of the U.S. CDC monitors susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antivirals, both approved for marketing and in late stage clinical development. Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has three heterologous subunits, PA, PB1, and PB2 that represent attractive targets for antiviral development. Baloxavir marboxil is a recently approved (Japan and U.S.) antiviral that inhibits the PA endonuclease activity of influenza A and B viruses. Pimodivir, which is in late-stage development, specifically targets the PB2 m 7 G cap-binding activity of influenza A viruses. Selection studies in cell culture and analysis of viruses from drugtreated patients in clinical trials have revealed the principal pathways to reduced susceptibility to baloxavir Jones et al., 2018; Omoto et al., 2018) and pimodivir (Byrn et al., 2015; Trevejo et al., 2018) . In baloxavir studies, treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions most frequently occurred at conserved position I38 (I38 F/ M/T) in the PA endonuclease active site and conferred reduced susceptibility by 10-57-fold in influenza A and 2-6-fold in influenza B. Substitutions at position S324 (S324C/I/N/R) in the cap-binding site of PB2 were recognized as the leading pathway for a 60-160-fold reduced susceptibility to pimodivir. Next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of 9,233 influenza type A and B viruses collected in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018, showed that only three viruses had the abovementioned substitutions. However, drug-resistant influenza viruses can become transmissible and spread widely; it is essential to monitor drug susceptibility among seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses. Routine virologic surveillance is carried out through NGS analysis to monitor known determinants of reduced drug susceptibility and by empirical assessments in phenotypic drug susceptibility assays. Most cell culture-based assays are slow and cumbersome, requiring multiple rounds of virus replication. To facilitate surveillance efforts, the CDC laboratory has developed a single-cycle assay: high-content imaging-based neutralization test (HINT). In this assay, MDCK-SIAT1 cells are infected with influenza virus in the absence of trypsin to limit virus spread. After 16-24 h of incubation, cells are fixed, immuno-fluorescently stained with anti-NP antibody, and imaged using an automated fluorescent cell counter. Baloxavir EC 50 values measured using the HINT assay were within approximately 2-fold of values obtained by focus reduction and plaque reduction assays . The HINT assay revealed that the PA-I38L substitution, detected in two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, but as yet un-characterized, conferred a 7-fold reduction in baloxavir susceptibility, which is comparable to the 10fold reduction observed for the previously characterized treatmentemergent I38M substitution . For pimodivir, the HINT EC 50 values were 8-fold higher than EC 50 values determined by focus reduction assay; nevertheless, the fold changes conferred by PB2-S324C and S324R substitutions remained consistent between two assays. The HINT assay provides a higher throughput option for phenotypic surveillance of seasonal and other low pathogenic influenza viruses; HINT does not work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. As the HINT assay is not yet available for influenza C and D viruses, their susceptibility to baloxavir was assessed using the virus yield reduction assay. Baloxavir potently inhibited replication of all viruses tested and showed the highest activity against type A and the lowest (âˆ¼8-fold) against influenza D viruses. 13.6. Panel discussion: future challenges of resistance monitoring Moderator: Maria Zambon. The discussion focused on the remaining questions regarding resistance to baloxavir, the scope and techniques used in surveillance efforts, and the potential for using combination therapy to mitigate treatment-emergent resistance. One question raised was whether certain genetic backgrounds may be associated with substitutions that reduce susceptibility to baloxavir. Substitutions that reduce susceptibility to baloxavir have been shown to reduce replicative capacity in cell culture , but certain genetic backgrounds or compensatory substitutions may increase replicative fitness in vivo and transmissibility of resistant viruses. Such determinants have not been yet been identified, although the rate of treatment-emergent substitutions is far higher in type A influenza virus compared to type B influenza virus. It is not clear if this difference in rates between influenza virus types is driven primarily by reduced activity of baloxavir against type B virus or a greater fitness cost of resistance in type B virus. The scope and methods that will be used in baloxavir resistance surveillance are currently being worked out among agencies across the globe. So far, there are 4 amino acid positions in PA (E23, A37, I38, and E199) that are listed in the USPI as determinants of baloxavir resistance. Additional work is ongoing to describe the impact all the substitutions observed in reported sequences at these and other sites (Gubareva et al., 2019) . One important open question is whether we can identify a correlation between the level of resistance measured in a certain phenotypic assays and the clinical outcome in treated patients. A substantial proportion of subjects in clinical trials of baloxavir exhibited treatment-emergent resistance, with the highest rate of 20-23% observed in pediatric trials Takashita et al., 2018) , and treatment-emergent resistance is associated with a reduced clinical response to treatment and prolonged virus shedding . These observations raise the possibility that baloxavir marboxil may be more effective if used in combination with another antiviral (i.e. NAIs), which may not only enhance overall effectiveness, but also mitigate the risk selecting for transmissible resistant viruses that could end up in wide circulation, as was the fate of adamantanes. 14. Hot topics and late-breakers 14.1. Antiviral design against emerging and pre-epidemic coronaviruses Ralph Baric, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. Viruses that emerge from zoonotic reservoirs present unique challenges for the development of treatment and/or vaccination strategies, as preparation requires being ready to combat viruses that have yet to be identified. The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bat zoonotic reservoirs and then passed through different intermediate hosts prior to infecting humans. Bat coronavirus strains that share varying homology to MERS-and SARS-CoV are still circulating and represent the pre-epidemic strains most likely to make the jump into humans (Anthony et al., 2017; Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015 Menachery et al., , 2016 Sheahan et al., 2008a Sheahan et al., , 2008b . As many novel bat coronavirus strains were identified solely as genomic sequence isolated from bat guano, characterization of these strains beyond sequence analysis was not initially possible. To determine if SARS-CoV-like bat coronaviruses could replicate using non-human primate or human cellular attachment proteins, the Baric laboratory cloned individual bat coronavirus spike genes into the SARS-CoV infectious clone backbone and isolated replication competent viruses. The SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses were evaluated in cell lines expressing either the human, bat, or civet angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, cellular receptor) to determine host species specificity, and to identify candidate bat-CoV strains to generate infectious clones based on the entire bat coronavirus genome. Four of the six SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses tested could use all three ACE2 molecules for entry and replicated to high titers (> 10 6 plaque forming units/mL) (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007) . These four bat coronavirus strains were then isolated from infectious clones derived from their respective genomes and the resulting virus progeny used to characterize replication kinetics in immortalized cell lines and primary human lung cell cultures and to perform in vivo vaccination or treatment experiments in comparison to wild type SARS-CoV. SHC014 and WIV1 replicated to high titers, the same titers as wild type SARS-CoV, in primary lung cell cultures suggesting that these strains were fully competent to infect humans. In murine disease models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infection the bat coronavirus strains were attenuated in comparison to wild type mouse adapted SARS-CoV. Vaccination studies demonstrated that vaccines specific for SARS-CoV were not effective against the bat coronavirus strains and antibody treatments that were protective for SARS-CoV failed against the bat strains (Becker et al., 2008; Menachery et al., 2015; Rockx et al., 2007 Rockx et al., , 2008 . These data highlight how crucial it is to evaluate all treatment options on more than just the current and past human strain(s) and SARS-and MERS-CoV so that appropriate treatment and vaccination strategies are stock piled to be prepared for future epidemics. Previous studies have shown that remdesivir (formerly GS-5734) has broad spectrum antiviral activity and in vivo efficacy against filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses including MERS-CoV Siegel et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2016) . Remdesivir pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and this compound is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola virus efficacy (NCT03719586). Nucleotide/side analogues including remdesivir were tested to determine if they were effective against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses despite previous studies demonstrating that nucleotide analogues generally have poor activity against coronaviruses due to the proofreading enzyme that is part of the viral replication machinery. Studies in human lung cell lines and primary human lung epithelial cell cultures demonstrated that remdesivir is effective against both SARS-and MERS-CoV as well as the pre-epidemic bat-CoV strains described earlier (Sheahan et al., 2017) . In parallel, in vitro passage studies were also performed to determine if coronavirus genomes could evolve to replicate in the presence of remdesivir. After 23 passages in the presence of drug, two mutations were identified in the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene (F276L and V553L) that allowed for increased replication in the presence of remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018) . These two amino acid changes decrease viral fitness overall and attenuate SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model of SARS-CoV induced disease (Agostini et al., 2018) . In both prophylactic and therapeutic (24 h post infection) dosing regimens of SARS-CoV infected animals, remdesivir treated animals had a > 2 log reduction in viral titers by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Remdesivir treated animals also maintained their starting weight throughout the infection time course while vehicle treated animals lost 20% of their starting weight by Day 4 or 5 post infection (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Finally, improved lung function (less airway constriction and reduced times between breaths) was seen when treated animals were compared to SARS-CoV infected untreated control animals (Sheahan et al., 2017) . Similar results were seen with MERS-CoV in prophylactic dosing studies performed in the Baric laboratory's MERS-CoV mouse model (Cockrell et al., 2016) . In contrast, therapeutic treatment with human monoclonal antibodies did not protect against MERS-CoV induced severe disease or protect from loss of lung function in animal models of highly pathogenic human coronavirus disease (Cockrell et al., 2016) . Remdesivir is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral that may prove useful in the treatment of highly pathogenic human coronavirus. 14.2. Remdesivir provides superior therapeutic efficacy to lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta against MERS-CoV Amy Sims, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. Currently there are no US FDA approved therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. A wide range of compounds have been evaluated for activity against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including biologics and small molecules. Among them, nucleotide analog remdesivir showed potent activity against coronaviruses (reviewed above in the Baric and Arabi summaries). Remdesivir is currently being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease (NCT03719586). The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is an FDA approved antiviral for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Croxtall and Perry, 2010; Perry et al., 2016) . Previous studies on the antiviral activity of lopinavir against MERS-CoV are conflicting with one study reporting micromolar EC 50 values in a human hepatoma cell line (Huh 7) yet another reported that lopinavir had no activity in a non-human primate kidney cell line (Vero) de Wilde et al., 2014) . Type I interferons are approved for treating multiple indications including hepatitis B and C, and multiple sclerosis (Dumitrescu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018) . Two studies showed interferon-beta was effective against MERS-CoV infection in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) with EC 50 values < 10 IU/mL Hart et al., 2014) . Clinical observations and in vivo animal models indicate outcomes of MERS-CoV infection are mediated by both virus replication and the resultant host inflammatory response, so combination therapies directly targeting both the virus and host may represent the best course of treatment for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. As such, the cocktail of lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta is currently being evaluated in patients infected with MERS-CoV in the MIRACLE trial (Arabi et al., 2018a) . The purpose of the study described below was to compare the antiviral activities of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon-beta against MERS-CoV. Infected and mock-infected human lung epithelial cells (Calu 3) were treated with dilution series of lopinavir (50 Î¼M-0.05 Î¼M), ritonavir (50 Î¼M-0.05 Î¼M), interferon-beta (2800 IU/mL to 5.5 IU/mL), or remdesivir (10 Î¼M-0.02 Î¼M) and results were assayed 48 h post infection. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in non-infected cells and EC 50 values were determined for each drug. Both lopinavir and ritonavir demonstrated moderate to minimal inhibition of virus replication with respective EC 50 values of 10 and 34 Î¼M. Interferon-beta treatment of MERS-CoV infected human lung epithelial cells inhibited viral replication similar to previous studies in non-human primate kidney cells (Vero) Hart et al., 2014) ; however, the EC 50 value in our studies was higher (175 IU/mL in human lung cells and < 10 IU/mL in non-human primate kidney cells). In contrast, remdesivir potently inhibited MERS-CoV replication with sub-micromolar EC 50 (0.11 Î¼M) (Sheahan et al., 2017) . To facilitate in vivo efficacy studies with MERS-CoV in rodents, a mouse model was generated through the humanization of the murine ortholog of the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Cockrell et al., 2016) in conjunction with the genetic deletion of carboxyl esterase 1 (Ces1c âˆ’/âˆ’ ) to minimize rodent serum esterase-specific remdesivir degradation (Sheahan et al., 2017) . The dosage for the combination of lopinavir (160 mg/kg, QD) and ritonavir (40 mg/kg, QD) were based on human equivalent dose using body surface area. Mouse recombinant interferon-beta was dosed at two concentrations (1.6 Ã— 10 6 and 4 Ã— 10 7 IU/ kg, QD) to cover 1x and 25x human equivalent doses, respectively. Dosage of remdesivir (25 mg/kg BID) was chosen based on pharmacokinetic studies performed in Ces1c âˆ’/âˆ’ mice (Sheahan et al., 2017) . When treatment was initiated one day post infection (dpi) with mouse adapted MERS-CoV, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-beta treatment did not reduce levels of virus replication as compared to their vehicle controls 6 dpi, while remdesivir treatment reduced viral titers by 3 logs relative its vehicle controls. These findings support the potential clinical development of remdesivir as a MERS-CoV antiviral. 14.3. EDP-938, a novel non-fusion replication inhibitor of RSV with high barrier to resistance Kai Lin, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA. No approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy currently exists for RSV. EDP-938 is a replication inhibitor being developed for RSV. It has potent in vitro activity against both RSV A and B laboratory strains and clinical isolates with an EC 50 < 100 nM. EDP-938 is > 20-fold more potent than RSV604, a previously known viral nucleoprotein inhibitor. In African Green monkeys infected with RSV, the vehicle control arm had a robust viral replication, which peaked on Day 5, while EDP-938 treated animals had minimal viral replication (effective 4-log viral load reduction). RSV fusion and polymerase inhibitors rapidly select viral populations with > 1,000 to 40,000-fold reduction in susceptibility. This study evaluated the barriers to developing resistance to EDP-938. RSV-A Long and RSV-B Washington strains were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDP-938. RSV resistance could be forced with a stepwise increase in concentration of EDP-938 but the development of resistance was associated with decreased fitness. The most potent mutation, N protein M109K, caused a 67-fold decrease in sensitivity to EDP-938 but also resulted in a 100-fold lower viral titer. A phase 1 study was recently completed (reported at the 11th International Respiratory Syncytial Virus Symposium) and overall demonstrated no safety concerns. Phase 2 studies in an RSV human controlled infection model were ongoing at the time of the meeting. 14.4. Replicative fitness of seasonal influenza A viruses displaying decreased susceptibility to polymerase inhibitor baloxavir Larisa Gubareva, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA. In clinical trials of baloxavir, treatment-emergent resistance was detected in 9.7% of adults and âˆ¼23% of children, and typically occurred at day 5 or later. The amino acid substitutions at conserved residue I38 in the Polymerase Acidic (PA) protein (PA-I38 T/ M/F) were the most commonly reported changes. In influenza A viruses, substitution PA-I38T was associated with a 27-57 fold decrease in baloxavir susceptibility, while I38M and I38F caused 10-20 fold decrease in susceptibility. The same changes conferred 3-8 fold decrease in baloxavir susceptibility of influenza B viruses. These substitutions were reported to impair in vitro replicative capacity of influenza A viruses . Analysis of PA sequences of 6,891 influenza A and B viruses collected in the U.S. during 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons revealed amino acid substitutions: I38L (two A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses), E23G (two A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses) and I38M (one A(H3N2) virus) conferring 4-10-fold reduced susceptibility to baloxavir (Gubareva et al., 2019) . This study reports the replicative fitness of the viruses containing I38L and I38M substitutions in the PA protein. Replication kinetics of the A(H3N2) PA-I38M and A(H1N1)pdm09 PA-I38L and their counterparts (wild type) lacking the PA substitutions were determined. In MDCK and MDCK-SIAT1 cells, titers of the PA-I38L virus and the wild type were similar. Conversely, titers of the PA-I38M virus were âˆ¼1 log 10 lower compared to its wild type at 12 and 24 hpi. Further, in vivo replicative fitness of the PA-I38M virus was evaluated using a ferret model. The ferrets shed both A(H3N2) viruses, wild type and PA-I38M, for 7 consecutive days. Nasal wash titers were âˆ¼0.5 log 10 lower on 4 dpi in the PA-I38M-infected animals. No reversion from methionine to isoleucine at residue 38 in the PA protein was detected at any time point by pyrosequencing analysis. To get additional insights into replicative capacity of the wild type vs PA-I38M virus, a competitive growth experiment was carried out, where ferrets were co-inoculated with both viruses at ratios of 70:30, 30:70 or 10:90 at a total of 10Ë†3 PFU. Pyrosequencing analysis of virus populations in nasal washes collected over a 7-day period revealed an incremental reduction in the proportion of the PA-I38M virus population. In conclusion, PA substitutions that decrease susceptibility to baloxavir do occur rarely in the natural setting without baloxavir treatment. PA substitution I38M, but not I38L, resulted in modestly diminished viral replicative capacity. 14.5. Insight Flu-IVIG: A randomized, placebo controlled trial of influenza immunoglobulin in the treatment of adults hospitalized with influenza Richard Davey, NIAID/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. For over 100 years there have been anecdotal reports or small studies of giving convalescent sera, plasma, or blood from individuals who recovered from influenza to patients with severe influenza. A metaanalysis of reports from the 1918 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic concluded that early administration of convalescent blood products reduced the absolute risk of death from pneumonia from 37% to 16% (Luke et al., 2006) . A randomized controlled trial conducted shortly after the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 randomized thirtyfive participants to receive high titer anti-influenza immune immunoglobulin (IVIG) or non-immune pre-pandemic IGIV (Hung et al., 2013) . 29% of those receiving immune IGIV died compared to 24% of those receiving standard IGIV (p = not significant), though benefit was reported in a post hoc analysis of the 22 participants who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset. FLU-IVIG was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled in adults hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza who had a NEWS â‰¥2. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single infusion of anti-influenza high titer IVIG or saline placebo, and all participants were to receive standard NAI treatment. Outcome was measured by a 6-point ordinal scale of clinical status on Day 7. The OR for favorable clinical outcome on Day 7 was 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.97, p = 0.33). ORs for influenza A and B were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.55-1.59) and 3.19 (95% CI: 1.21-8.42), respectively. When given against a background of NAI treatment, high titer immune IVIG did not provide clinical or virologic evidence of a favorable treatment effect overall in this study cohort. There appeared to be clinical and virologic benefit to IVIG treatment in hospitalized patients with influenza B infection (27% of study cohort); this finding warrants further investigation. 14.6. High-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma for the treatment of severe influenza A John Beigel, NIAID, Bethesda, MD, USA. Prior studies using polyclonal plasma in the treatment of severe influenza have been encouraging. All these studies, however, had limitations that significantly limited the interpretation. As previously noted, a meta-analysis of reports from the 1918 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic concluded that early administration of convalescent blood products reduced the absolute risk of death from pneumonia by 21% (Luke et al., 2006) . In 2009, a cohort study was conducted evaluating the use of convalescent plasma for severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and demonstrated a decrease in mortality from 54.8% to 20.0% (p = 0.01) (Hung et al., 2011) , but control mortality was significantly higher than expected for severity-of-illness. A prior randomized, phase 2 study in those with severe influenza A or B demonstrated the resolution of hypoxia and tachypnea by Day 28 in 67% of those receiving plasma vs 53% in the standard care arm (p = 0.069 (Beigel et al., 2017) ). This study, however, had differences in baseline characteristics of the study groups, and an asymmetrical loss to follow up between the two study groups possibly due to the unblinded study design. This study was a randomized, double-blinded, controlled, phase 3 trial comparing high-titer anti-influenza plasma (HAI antibody titers of â‰¥1:80) to low titer plasma (HAI â‰¤ 1:10) in hospitalized children and adults with severe influenza A. 43% of participants enrolled were in the ICU and 70% of the non-ICU patients required oxygen. The study was terminated in July 2018 when independent efficacy analysis revealed low conditional power to show an effect of high-titer plasma even if full accrual was achieved. The proportional odds ratio for improved clinical status by 6-point ordinal scale on Day 7 was 1.22 (95% CI [0.65, 2.29], p = 0.54). Despite encouraging results from prior studies, this study and the INSIGHT IVIG study (above) suggest that polyclonal antibody therapies may not significantly improve outcomes in severe influenza A. 14.7. Examining clinical data on potential adjunctive therapies in influenza Nelson Lee, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The meeting was closed with a review of prior works on adjunctive therapies in influenza. As previously noted, the high mortality rates in emerging diseases such as novel coronavirus infectious (MERS and SARS) and novel avian influenza strains (influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)) have raised questions about the possible role of pro-inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis. Prior studies demonstrated cytokine hyperactivation associated with uncontrolled viral replication; and a sustained inflammatory state correlates with disease progression leading to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therapeutics targeting the pathogen alone have thus far largely unsuccessful in reversing such processes. Currently there are no immunomodulatory agents that have been conclusively proven to be of benefit in severe influenza. Corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of superinfection, prolonged viral replication, and increased risk of death, and should not be used (Rodrigo et al., 2016) . For most other adjunctive therapies, the data is less clear. The areas where adjunctive therapies have some supporting data and may be worth further studies were then reviewed. The combination of oseltamivir and azithromycin had been shown to downregulate the proinflammatory cytokines, without impairing viral clearance in one small RCT . The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen was demonstrated to reduce adverse outcomes in another study (Hung et al., 2017) , but these findings, though intriguing, should be confirmed. Sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of an RCT (Wang et al., 2014) , confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy can be explored. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), statins, nitazoxanide (NTZ), IFNs, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonists, cyclooxygenase (COX 2) inhibitors, recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), diltiazem, and herbal medicine, all have some supporting preclinical or clinical data, but these need to be studied more intensely, preferably by RCTs .
