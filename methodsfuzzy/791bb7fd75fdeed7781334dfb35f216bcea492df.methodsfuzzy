Organic carbamates play an important role in organic synthesis, especially as subunits of biologically active compounds. Accordingly, simple and efficient methods for the synthesis of carbamates are of great interest. A number of methods have been developed for the synthesis of carbamates. 3.1. Carbamate Synthesis via Traditional Methods. Over the years, a variety of carabamates have been prepared by utilizing the Hofmann rearrangement of amides, 34−36 the Curtius rearrangement of acyl azides, 37,38 the reductive carbonylation of nitroaromatics, 39 the carbonylation of amines, 40 the reaction of alcohols with isocyanates, 41 and carbon dioxide alkylation. 42−45 The Hofmann rearrangement (Method I, Scheme 1) is wellrecognized as a useful method to convert primary carboxamides to amines or carbamates, characterized by the reduction of one carbon in the structure. 46 Much effort has been devoted to the development of modified reagents to optimize the Hofmann rearrangement since the classical method for this transformation, involving the use of an alkaline solution of bromine, is unsatisfactory and unreliable. 35 A variety of oxidants and bases have been proposed as modified agents, e.g., iodine(III) reagents such as PhI(OAc) 2 , 47 MeOBr, 48 NBS-CH 3 ONa, 49 NBS-KOH, 46 lead tetraacetate, 50 and benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide. 51 These modified methods, however, require more than 1 equiv or an excess amount of the oxidizing reagent, which is not very convenient. The Curtius rearrangement (Method II, Scheme 1) is the thermal decomposition of acyl azides into the isocyanate intermediate. This method is widely employed in the transformation of carboxylic acids into carbamates and ureas. Acyl azides are usually prepared from carboxylic acid derivatives such as acyl chlorides, 52,53 mixed anhydrides, 54,55 and hydrazides. 56, 57 Subsequent isocyanate intermediates can be trapped by a variety of nucleophiles to provide the carbamate derivatives. The acid chloride method is not suitable for acidsensitive functionalities. One-pot transformations of carboxylic acids into carbamates avoids the isolation of unstable acyl azides. However, protocols involving the use of diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) for the one-pot Curtius reaction are also characterized by issues related to toxicity and the high boiling point of DPPA, which creates difficulties during workup and purification. 58−60 Other general methods for carbamate preparation involve the use of the highly toxic phosgene, 61 phosgene derivatives, 62, 63 or isocyanates. 64 Significant efforts have been made to find an alternative to the phosgene process. A very attractive substitute for phosgene is carbon dioxide because it is a classic renewable resource (Method III, Scheme 1). In addition, its use is also very attractive due to its environmentally benign nature (nontoxic, noncorrosive, and nonflammable). 65 Carbon dioxide is wellknown to react rapidly with amines to form carbamic acid ammonium salts. The majority of the approaches in this context rely on the creation of the carbamate anion via the reaction of carbon dioxide and amines, followed by the reaction with electrophiles. Nevertheless, since the nucleophilicity of the carbamate anion is lower than that of the amine formed in the equilibrium of the salt formation, the subsequent reaction of the carbamate salts with alkyl halides does not selectively provide urethanes. 44, 66 The formation of carbamates from isocyanates (Method IV, Scheme 1) is fundamentally important to polyurethane industries. Synthetic limitations and toxicity issues, however, are associated with the use of phosgene, the most common route to obtain isocyanates. 64 The readily available alkyl chloroformates are the most frequently used reagents for the preparation of carbamates (Method V, Scheme 1). However, these reagents display major drawbacks, as a large excess of base and a long reaction time are required in order to gain acceptable reaction efficiency. Moreover, excess reagents are not suitable for the synthesis of molecules bearing multiple functionalities in which the chemoselectivity is critical. 67 3.2. Carbamate Synthesis via Activated Mixed Carbonates. A number of organic carbonates have been developed as low-cost and benign alternatives to the phosgenebased routes for the synthesis of organic carbamates. In this context, several new alkoxycarbonylating agents (7−11) based on mixed carbonates have been developed ( Figure 6 ). These methods are often used for the synthesis of carbamates in drug design. 68−72 Mixed carbonates with a p-nitrophenyl moiety are frequently used for the preparation of a large range of carbamates. 73−76 For this, p-nitrophenyl chloroformate (7, PNPCOCl), when treated with the suitable alcohol in the presence of base, furnishes the corresponding activated carbonates, which have been shown to be useful and effective alkoxycarbonylating reagents for suitable amines (Scheme 2). Examples of carbamate derivatives are shown in Table 1 . Several alkoxycarbonylating reagents for amino groups having heterocyclic groups, such as N-hydroxyimide, have Scheme 1. Traditional Synthetic Methodologies Adopted for the Synthesis of Carbamates been reported. Moreover, the utility and versatility of carbonates and oxalates containing an electron-withdrawing group, such as N-hydroxyimide and benzotriazole derivatives as reagents for various tranformations, have been described. 72, 81, 82 Takeda et al. reported that 1-alkoxy[6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazolyl]carbonates easily derived from 1,1-bis[6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazolyl]carbonate (8, BTBC) showed high acylating reactivity toward alcohols as well as amino groups. 83 BTBC was prepared from 6-trifluoromethyl-1hydroxybenzotriazole and trichloromethyl chloroformate and purified by washing with dry ether. Moreover, it can be stored for several months in a freezer. BTBC was allowed to react with primary alcohols in acetonitrile at room temperature to give stable activated carbonates. The carbonates were treated with amines in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), providing the corresponding carbamates (Scheme 2 and Table  2 ). 83 In connection with our research work aimed at synthesizing biologically active polyfunctional molecules for probing enzyme active sites, we required a more general and synthetically reliable method for the synthesis of various carbamate derivatives. In 1991, we described the utility of di(2-pyridyl) carbonate (9, DPC) 84 as an efficient, high-yielding, and convenient alkoxycarbonylation reagent for amines overcoming many of the limitations of existing methodologies. 85 DPC was readily prepared from commercially available 2-hydroxypyridine and triphosgene in the presence of triethylamine and subsequently reacted with the suitable primary or secondary alcohol (e.g., (+)-menthol) to provide a mixed carbonate. Alkoxycarbonylation of primary and secondary amines with the mixed carbonates was carried out in the presence of triethylamine and furnished the corresponding carbamates in good yields (Scheme 2, Method A, and Table 3 ). Potassium hydride was used in the place of triethylamine in the preparation of the mixed carbonates containing tertiary alcohols (Scheme 2 and Table 3 ). 85 Subsequently, we investigated the scope of N,N′-disuccinimidyl carbonate (10, DSC) 81 promoted alkoxycarbonylation of amines with a host of alcohols under mild conditions. 86 Rich and co-workers highlighted the convenience of succinimidylbased mixed carbonates for the high-yielding introduction of a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl (Teoc) protecting group to amino acids, without oligopeptide byproduct formation. 87 DSC was found to be a highly effective alkoxycarbonylating reagent for a variety of primary and sterically hindered secondary alcohols. DSC is commercially available, or it can be
