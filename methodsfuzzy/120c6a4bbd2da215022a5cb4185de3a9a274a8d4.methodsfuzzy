Given the simple virus structure, virus antigen determination is generally focused on the genetic material and proteins, particularly the nucleocapsid proteins, which have strong species-specific patterns. Therefore, nucleocapsid proteins can be good markers for early diagnosis. Based on the literature, the present study identified the early diagnostic markers of these 6 viruses: influenza virus (A and B) and
