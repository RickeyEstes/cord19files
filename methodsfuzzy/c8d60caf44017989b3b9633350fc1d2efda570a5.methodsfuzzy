The study was conducted in Chanteraines park (82 ha, Hauts-de-Seine department, France, 2.261594, 48.84066 D.D.) which includes a farm, a circus, a horse center, and receives an estimated two millions visitors annually. The park has implemented rat-control measures which prohibit the use of rodenticides. Because whole rat carcasses were needed for endoparasite research and tissue sampling, trapping-removal methods were used. Trapping was conducted during 12 consecutive days from 10 to 21 January 2011 (the park was closed to the public during this time). Manufrance live-traps (280x100x100 mm) were used, baited with a mixture of peanut butter, oat flakes, and sardine oil [25] . Traps were set in two sites: North (site 1) and South (site 2) (Fig 1) . Distance between the centroid of the two sites was approximately 700 m. Traps were spaced 20 m apart whenever possible given physical constraints of the landscape (Fig 1) . Geographic coordinates for each trap location were reported from a GPS device (Garmin eTrex1, precision 3-7 m). Since rat sightings were often reported during daytime hours, two trapping periods were organized, i.e. a night-time and a daytime session, covering all 24 hours of the day. Traps were checked twice daily, 07.00-11.00 (rats caught at night) and 18.00-21.00 (rats caught in the daytime), and baited as necessary. For each day and night of trapping, we recorded for each site the number of traps set, rats trapped, and traps sprung (e.g., traps sprung or damaged by people, trapping of non-target species).
