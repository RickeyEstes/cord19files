Antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SHFV nsp1␤ and the nsp2 N-terminal PLP2 domain were generated using the method that we described previously (52) . The mouse experiment was performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Kansas State University. Briefly, BALB/c laboratory mice (Jackson laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized 3 times with 50 g of purified protein mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 2-week intervals. Mouse splenocytes were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells. Specific anti-nsp1␤ and anti-nsp2 mAbs were obtained by screening with an immunofluorescence assay. mAbs 133-243 and 134-260 against the SHFV nsp2 N-terminal PLP2 domain and mAb 76-69 against SHFV nsp1␤ were used in this study. mAbs 36-19 and 140-68 were used for specifically recognizing nsp2 of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, respectively (34) . A polyclonal antibody (pAb) against the SHFV nsp2TF C-terminal peptide (RLDSTVVFEETTPLLDQVPVC; nsp2TFC) was produced in rabbits by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The following antibodies from commercial resources were also used in this study: anti-HA tag mAb 16B12 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-FLAG tag mAb M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-human PCBP2 mAb 23-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), anti-human PCBP1 rabbit pAb (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and anti-Renilla luciferase mAb clone 1D5.2 (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). mAb 12A4 against EAV nsp1 (53) was generously provided by Udeni Balasuriya at Louisiana State University. In vitro characterization of recombinant viruses. Recombinant viruses were characterized by determining the viral growth kinetics. For multistep growth curves, MARC-145 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. When the cells reached 100% confluence, they were infected with parental virus or mutants thereof at an MOI of 0.01. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hpi. Virus titer was measured by titration on MARC-145 cells and calculated as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/ml according to the Reed and Muench method (55) . To determine the plaque morphology of the parental virus and corresponding mutants, a plaque assay was performed in MARC-145 cells using the method described previously (33) .
