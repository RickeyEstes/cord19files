We performed a retrospective study of patients attending our clinic between 2004 and 2014 who had a history of abroad travels within 6 months of their initial presentation. Our clinic is located in Yokohama, Japan's second most populated city (over 3 million residents), approximately 40 km south of Tokyo. Our hospital is a 650-bed community-based acute care teaching facility, and our clinic is run by 2e4 doctors for infectious disease, with inputs from other specialties, such as dermatology and pediatrics. We obtained data regarding patient demographics, travel histories, reasons for most recent overseas travel, and pre-travel vaccinations using a questionnaire for all patients (pre-travel information was added to the questionnaire in 2006). Regions were classified as East Asia (except Japan), Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East, Europe, Africa, North America, and Latin America. Reasons for traveling abroad included tourism, business, study, missionary or volunteer work, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), and immigration or residence. VFR is defined as a condition when people visit a foreign country to see friends, family, or relatives; it does not depend on where they were born, how developed the foreign country is or which they migrated or not. In cases where there were multiple reasons, the most important reason was considered. Physicians determined exposure regions according to clinical course, travel history, and infection window periods. Therefore, potential exposure regions included Japan, airplanes, or none (disease not associated with any specific exposure). Diagnoses were made according to clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, with every effort taken to determine the underlying etiologies. For example, in cases where acute bacterial colitis was suspected but no pathogen was detected, the final diagnosis was recorded as acute colitis of unknown etiology. Diseases were classified according to organ system as systemic febrile (no specific organ), respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and soft tissue, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, and neurological diseases. When patients attended our clinic in the recovery phase, we used information from clinical correspondence to determine their underlying etiology. Real-time PCR was used to detect the pathogenic gene of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains. This study is performed independently of GeoSentinel, which collects information only on travel-associated diseases. This study was approved by our institutional review board.
