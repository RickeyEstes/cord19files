One-year retrospective analysis in three clinics on the Thailand-Myanmar border of non-pregnant adults presenting with urinary symptoms. POCT (urine dipstick and microscopy) were compared to culture with significant growth classified as pure growth of a single organism >10(5) CFU/mL. Results: In 247 patients, 82.6% female, the most common symptoms were dysuria (81.2%), suprapubic pain (67.8%) and urinary frequency (53.7%). After excluding contaminated samples, UTI was diagnosed in 52.4% (97/185); 71.1% (69/97) had a significant growth on culture, and >80% of these were Escherichia coli (20.9% produced extendedspectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)). Positive urine dipstick (leucocyte esterase ≥1 and/or nitrate positive) compared against positive microscopy (white blood cell >10/HPF, bacteria ≥1/HPF, epithelial cells <5/HPF) had a higher sensitivity (99% vs. 57%) but a lower specificity (47% vs. 89%), respectively. Combined POCT resulted in the best sensitivity (98%) and specificity (81%). Nearly one in ten patients received an antimicrobial to which the organism was not fully sensitive. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): One rapid, cost-effective POCT was too inaccurate to be used alone by healthcare workers, impeding antibiotic stewardship in a high ESBL setting. Appropriate prescribing is improved with concurrent use and concordant results of urine dipstick and microscopy. Patients who underwent an orthopaedic surgical procedure, with prophylaxis recommended, from 01/06/2008 to 31/05/2012 were selected. Cases were linked to local creatinine data and to national patient level hospital activity, community prescribing and Scottish Renal Registry data. Segmented regression analyses of interrupted time series were used to evaluate changes in level and trend of AKI rates associated with the intervention and estimate effect sizes. Results: There was a significant increase in AKI rate trend following policy change (β = 0.28; 95%CI, 0.03 to 0.53; p = 0.028) in trauma patients, equating to an increase of 0.28 cases of AKI/100 procedures/ month and a relative intervention effect at 24 months of 150% (95% CI 25% to 250%). There was no significant change in AKI rate among elective patients. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): We found that a change in orthopaedic antibiotic prophylaxis policy in NHS Grampian was associated with an increase in post-operative AKI. This is consistent with observations in other boards and supports the new recommendation away from this policy made by SAPG in 2012. A key feature of Epic is the intervention reporting module ('iVent') which allows pharmacists to communicate any interventions and recommendations they have made. We investigated the use of iVents specifically to document AMS interventions. Aim(s)/Objective(s): 1. To investigate the types of AMS interventions and classify types and clinical impact of intervention 2. To assess whether there are differences in AMS interventions made between clinical areas and pharmacist grades. Method(s): A report was generated collating all AMS iVents recorded by pharmacists over a one year period. A peer-review group comprising antimicrobial pharmacists and consultant microbiologists was consulted to decide on suitable categories for data analysis. iVents were then sorted according to these categories and assigned values for their potential clinical impact. This group also reviewed a random sample of 50 interventions to assess agreement for categories and severity and whether the intervention made was clinically appropriate. Categories of intervention included administration advice, dose optimisation, course length optimisation, patient counselling, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), choice of agent advice, vaccination referrals, IV to Oral Switch, Supply Issues and stopping unnecessary prescriptions. Results: Preliminary data from a one-month period (April 2016) demonstrated that: 1. 503 interventions were made 2. the most common AMS intervention is for antimicrobials requiring TDM and the least common patient counselling and IV to oral switching 3. most interventions are made on intensive care wards and the fewest on neurology wards 4. number of interventions made increases with grade of pharmacist 5. most interventions have 'medium' clinical impact ID: 4840 Personalised feedback of antibiotic prescribing data to primary care teams Jacqueline Sneddon 1 , William Malcolm 2 , Marion Bennie 2 , Helen Storkey 3 , Terry McLaughlin 2 , James Smith 2 , Charis Marwick 4 , Bruce Guthrie 5 , Sean Macbride-Stewart 6 , Dilip Nathwani 4 . 1 Healthcare Improvement Scotland, 2 NHS National Services Scotland, 3 NHS national Services Scotland, 4 NHS Tayside, 5 University of Dundee, 6 NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Background: In Scotland feedback of prescribing data has proved successful with GPs for high risk medicines and dental practitioners for antimicrobial. A similar approach was designed to complement other interventions to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by GPs. Aim(s)/Objective(s): This study aimed to establish a programme to provide GP practices with quarterly reports on their own antibiotic prescribing data along with benchmarking information. Method(s): A study steering group was established and funding secured for creation of data reports. The pilot phase involved 50% of practices in four health board areas, randomly selected using a stratified sampling frame, receiving the report. Details of these practices were obtained and automated email messaging set up. Results: Practices will receive quarterly reports containing their rates of antibiotic prescribing compared to local and national benchmarks along with suggested actions and details of support resources. The first report focussed on total antibiotic use and included key messages about improving use of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Reports were emailed directly to GP Practices along with a letter from the Chief Medical Officer. The next three reports will focus on urinary tract infection, risk of Clostridium difficile infection and skin and soft tissue infections. Following a time series analysis of changes in prescribing rate in the intervention practices compared to control practices we plan to implement the intervention across all GP practices in Scotland. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This automated feedback intervention is an attractive addition to our stewardship programme as it is supported by good evidence and can be implemented nationally at relatively low cost. To recruit all cirrhotic patients with primary or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) according to ICD10 using administrative data in a tertiary hospital from January 2006 to December 2014. ASP integrated into nosocomial infection control (NIC) was implemented in the institute at the same time. Those with ascitic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) count <250 cells/mm 3 , or with clinical and laboratory data suggesting secondary peritonitis or other infections, or with antimicrobial use before 2 weeks before treatment of SBP, or with hepatocellular carcinoma, or with discharged <5 days after the treatment, without ascetic fluid test before antimicrobials use to SBP were excluded The clinical outcomes of them were evaluated. Results: 1. There were 1,110 episodes of cirrhotic with SBP collected from administrative data during the investigation. The percentage of those patients whose PMNs count >250 cells/mm 3 in the ascitic fluid in the recruited SBP were increased from 27.4% in the first triennium (2006) (2007) (2008) to 38.4% in the second (2009-2011) and 59.3% in the third (2012-2014). 2. There were 386 episodes of SBP identified. • The majority initial prescribed antibiotic was fluoroquinolone and the 3rd generation of cephalosporin in the first 2 triennium (90.3%, 77.8% respectively) and beta-lactam antibacterials/enzyme inhibitors in the last one (67.9%), P = 0.00. • Antimicrobial treatment longer than 10 days was decrease from 81.2%, to 52.7% and 33.6% respectively, P = 0.00. • 30-day mortality was slightly lower (1%, 9.9% and 9.2%, P = 0.86). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Adoption to ASP and NIC combination model in China was slow, but promising. We report the first case of infective endocarditis caused by Paenibacillus provencensis, a very rare Gram-negative spore-forming rod. Results: A mitral valve vegetation was incidentally discovered by intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography in a 70-year old lady undergoing aortic valve replacement. Empirical antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis with gentamicin and teicoplanin was started. The precise identification of the causative agent relied on genotypic characterisation with 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Microbiologic culture was subsequently performed to obtain the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly. The patient was treated with a 4-week course of vancomycin and meropenem, followed by a further 2 weeks of daptomycin due to the identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a rectal swab. After a long in-hospital stay, the patient eventually recovered clinically and biochemically and transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a well functioning mitral valve without residual lesions from the endocarditis. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report showing that Paenibacillus provencensis can be a pathogen in humans and that a member of the genus Paenibacillus may be involved in native valve endocarditis. This case also emphasis the importance of 16S rDNA gene sequencing by real-time polymerase chain reaction, as a rapid and accurate method to identify microorganisms, like Paenibacillus, which can be missed by conventional microbiology investigations. Background: A 48 year old woman was admitted to hospital in October 2015 with symptoms of fever, intermittent diarrhoea and hepatic encephalopathy. She had a history of cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis and it was initially thought that her illness was secondary to decompensation that would necessitate liver transplantation. She was born in Pakistan and had lived in the UK since 2007 last visiting Pakistan from May to July 2015. Results: Routine laboratory results demonstrated worsening liver function, pancytopenia and hyponatremia. Blood cultures were positive for what was finally proved to be Brucella abortus. Serology was positive for Brucella IgM/IgG. A sample from August 2015 was retrospectively tested and was negative. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Following confirmation of brucellosis she was treated with 6 weeks of ciprofloxacin and 2 weeks of gentamicin. She has had a good response and 6 months later remains well with only mild encephalopathy at times. Human brucellosis remains rare in the UK. This case highlights the need to consider it in those patients who present with pyrexia of unknown origin and have travelled to an endemic area. Due to her liver condition her treatment regimen was chosen to avoid rifampicin. The initial concern she might require a liver transplant has abated. Background: Visceral leishmaniasis is a rare illness to present in the UK although it should be considered in the differential when there is an appropriate travel history. A 76 year old male retired civil engineer had been under the haematologists for investigation of pancytopenia since November 2015. He presented with symptoms of weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite and lethargy. He had a background of Psoriatic Arthritis for which he took Methotrexate. His travel history included holidays to North America, Morocco and more recently Spain. Lymphoma was considered a likely diagnosis with evidence of splenomegaly on imaging. He was listed for a splenectomy after repeated splenic biopsies came back showing only reactive changes. Results: His Leishmania serology came back strongly positive (Leishmania DAT Positive at a titre of 409,600 and Leishmania K39 test: Antibody to Leishmania K39 antigen: positive) a few days prior to his planned splenectomy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Visceral Leismaniasis was considered the most likely diagnosis. He was treated with standard liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/Kg (5 days). At latest follow up he has made a good recovery. His platelet count is now normal and haemoglobin and white cell count are improving. Leishmania was not considered in the initial differentials and it was a few months before his serology was performed. Although the majority of cases occur in countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, India and Sudan it is also endemic in the Mediterranean area. Consideration should be given for this diagnosis if there is an appropriate travel history especially in an immunosuppressed individual. Background: A 72 year old Australasian holidaymaker was brought by ambulance to A + E complaining of severe, abrupt onset abdominal pain, present for 6 hours, and a sore throat for 4 days. On examination she was febrile 39.1°C, and was holding her neck. Her throat appeared normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy, but her anterior neck was tender. She was tachyopneic 40/min, saturation 95% on air, with HR 87 and BP 140/76. There was central and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. CXR showed a small right pleural effusion, also seen on CT abdomen which also demonstrated consolidation, but no other cause for her pain. Over three hours she became hoarse; complaining of "a frog in my throat". Nebulised adrenaline, intravenous ceftriaxone and dexamethasone were administered. A CT neck revealed significant soft tissue swelling and thickening of the epiglottis. Her airway was immediately secured and she was transferred to intensive care. Blood cultures were positive the following day with Gram-negative diplococci, later identified as Neisseria meningitidis. She was extubated within 24 hours, and completed 7 days of IV ceftriaxone before discharge. The Scottish Reference Laboratory confirmed the N. meningitidis serogroup Y with a rare MLST type for Scotland. Since 2014 Scottish figures show serogroup Y accounts for 15% of N. meningitidis isolates, is invasive in 79% of cases (CSF, eye or blood culture), and affects older adults mean 66 years of age (range 1-89) and female > male (16F:8M). Serogroup Y is only rarely implicated in epiglottitis, with only a handful of cases previously reported. A 66 year old lady presented with 3 weeks of vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan (MRI) of the abdomen demonstrated multiple liver lesions. Blood cultures grew A. aphrophilus. Following deterioration on day thirteen brain CT demonstrated multiple brain abscesses. Results: This lady was treated with three months of ceftriaxone and six weeks of metronidazole. She then switched to oral amoxicillin 1g tds and completed a year of antibiotics in total. Repeat imaging six months after the end of treatment only showed "tiny flecks of persistent enhancement but no new lesions". She has remained well since completion of therapy. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): This case illustrates the importance of taking blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration and communicating clinical information to the microbiology laboratory. Good communication improves the likelihood of isolating fastidious organisms such as A. aphrophilus and thus optimising patient management. The number of samples sent for culture 3 months pre and post introduction of the guidance was recorded for the laboratory system. Symptoms and antimicrobial therapy were recorded for all patients who had a sample sent for two weeks pre and post introduction from electronic medical records. Results: The number of samples sent decreased from 714 to 378 following introduction of guidance. The proportion of patients who had a urine sent with one or no symptoms of UTI fell from 64% to 45%. The proportion of samples with no growth or no significant growth fell from 39% to 24%. Pre-intervention, 34 patients with no symptoms had growth in their urine (asymptomatic bacteriuria). Of these, 10% were commenced on antibiotics. This decreased to 22 patients asymptomatic bacteriuria and 1 received antibiotics. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Introduction of guidance has led to fewer samples sent for culture and decreased the proportion with no growth. It has also decreased the number of patients receiving inappropriate antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Results: A. schaalii isolates were identified from 14 patients, mean age 70 years (range 46-92). The commonest source of infection was urinary; 5 patients had bacteraemia secondary to urosepsis and 5 had positive kidney urine or bladder biopsy cultures. Four presented with scrotal abscess, breast abscess, necrotising otitis externa and pacemaker pocket infection. Some isolates were assessed as clinically insignificant. Patients who were given antibiotics received empirical piperacillin/ tazobactam or co-amoxiclav, to which all isolates were susceptible. 12 patients were discharged; 2 patients with bacteraemia received piperacillin/tazobactam but died shortly afterwards. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our findings support the role of A. schaalii in urinary infection and bacteraemia, particularly in elderly patients with urological abnormalities. Its clinical significance is less clear in other infections. Formal identification is advised to prevent its misclassification as a contaminant in blood and urine cultures and to improve the understanding of its pathogenic potential. In total 13 rooms were tested. Testing included total viable count (TVC) sampling before and after UV decontamination. Air sampling with Merck air sampler was performed for all tested rooms before decontamination, immediately after (8-20 hours) and week after. Total fungal and bacterial counts in the air were determined. Results: TVC showed reduction from 73.3 to 1.7 which was obtained after the decontamination. The highest TVC levels were recorded for toilet roll holders, bin lids and sinks. Air samples showed highly variable numbers of different moulds with dominating Penicillium and other less virulent moulds with evidence of reduction following decontamination. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): UV-C decontamination achieved a significant level of reduction of microorganisms detected on the surfaces. Lower environmental contamination minimises the risks for infection during construction and improves patient's safety. The objective of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of copper and selected copper alloys, against CNS highly resistant to antibiotics, isolated from touch surfaces of Polish hospital units. Method(s): Modification of Japanese standarda method for testing antimicrobial properties of surfaces made of non-porous materials was used in the study. Assessment of antimicrobial properties was performed on copper alloys: CuZn37, CuSn6, CuNi12Zn24 and Cu-ETP as positive control and stainless steel as negative control. Bacterial strains used in the study were: Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidisstrains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole vs. strains of these species forming a biofilm and, for comparison -Stapylococcus aureus. Results: The strongest antimicrobial properties against the tested strains were found for pure coppertotal elimination of bacteria from the level of 10 7 CFU/mL was observed after approximately 180 min. A faster total reduction of the density of bacterial suspension was also observed in case of SA comparing to CNS strains. Effectiveness comparable to that of pure copper was demonstrated for tin bronze (CuSn6). High-touch surfaces in a 12-bed Intensive Care Unit were cleaned and disinfected either by the daily standard two-step protocol, application of an alcohol-based detergent Keradet (Kiehl), followed by a chlorine-based disinfectant Antisapril 2% (Angelini), or by using disposable wipes impregnated with quaternary ammonium compounds/Biguanide (Clinell Universal Wipes, GAMA). Effectiveness in reducing microbial burden of high touch near-patient surfaces was assessed by a contact plate method on five sites immediately pre-procedure and post-at 0.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 hours. The study was repeated five times over three months, sampling 11 beds for each protocol (560 sampling sites). Results: Pre-impregnated wipes demonstrated a decrease in mean Total Bacterial Count (TBC) from 43 to 16 CFU/24 cm 2 (63.9%) after 0.5 hours vs. a reduction from 27 to 16 CFU/24 cm 2 (40.3%) for the SP. In subsequent 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5-hour tests, mean TBCs decreased respectively by 64.1%, 65.6% and 74.1% with disposable wipes, while for SP methods, TBCs showed increases of 8.3%, 20.7% and 24.3%. According to the Italian hygiene standard (ISPESL, 2009), when using pre-impregnated wipes 14 of 180 sites of sites showed TBC >50 CFU/ 24 cm 2 (Hygiene Failures) whereas for SP 32 of 176 sites were classed as failed (Chi squared, p < 0.05). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Disposable wipes used on nearpatient inanimate surfaces provide a more effective alternative to the usual two-step procedures, considering the potential residual activity. The study was carried out a clinical simulation rooms in the education centre of University Hospital, Coventry, fitted out as a three-bedded bay found elsewhere in the acute hospital. Each bed space is fitted with standard issue flame-retardant 100% polyester curtains (Sunlight, UK). A UVo™ system (Hygiene Solutions, Kings Lynn, UK) was operated within a bedspace behind closed privacy curtains, and UV levels outside the curtains measured using a Bentham dmc150 double monochromator system (Bentham Instruments Ltd, Reading, UK) spectrum range 250-410 nm. Measurements at head, abdomen and ankle heights were made with the use of a polystyrene, body shaped maniken placed outside the closed curtains. Results: The lowest value of effective treatment dose was equivalent to around 11 times that of the maximum permissible UV exposure and the maximum treatment dose was around 260 times this exposure limit. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): It would not therefore be advisable to operate a UVC system with only hospital curtains screening off the bedspace from other patients or staff. Background: Although steam sterilization failures have been reported due to failure to remove air from the load, a classic example being the Devonport incident from the 1970's. There is still widespread denial in some healthcare groups that the presence of air can contribute to sterilization failures. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate steam penetration into dental handpieces using benchtop non-vacuum sterilizers commonly used in dental practice. Method(s): Three different types of handpieces were investigated for steam penetration into handpiece lumens using chemical indicators (CI), biological indicators (BI) and thermocouples/data loggers (TC). Non-vacuum (type N) Benchtop steam sterilizers were investigated in both the laboratory and general dental practice setting. In the laboratory we tested 4 different makes with 3 machine models for each make. In the General Dental Practice setting we tested seven nonvacuum benchtop sterilizers. Results: Results in the laboratory demonstrated BI failure for 15/1152 tests, CI failure for 9/1152 tests, typical delays in reaching sterilization temperature ranged from 0 to 165 seconds detected using TC. In general dental practice we detected BI failure rate of 34/378 tests, CI failure rate of 25/378 tests. And TC failure rates of 28/42 (defined by a temperature delay of 2°C, SHTM 2010). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): In conclusion, we have demonstrated that type N sterilization of dental handpieces is unreliable due to trapped air in handpiece lumens. As a minimum we recommend that dental handpieces used in invasive procedures should be steam sterilized in a vacuum benchtop steam sterilizer. In-vitro susceptibility of C. auris and ATCC controls were tested against chlorhexidine, iodinated-povidone and sodiumdichloroisocyanurate using a microdilution-method. However, in comparison to OFA, significantly fewer organisms were recovered from OFB and C after 8-and 12 h respectively. P. aeruginosa was recovered from water delivered from OFA at levels above the augmented care alert level (i.e. ≥10 CFU/100 mL). Contamination persisted despite continued flushing. In contrast, water delivered from OFB did not contain P. aeruginosa beyond the first flush. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Contamination of OFs via cleaning cloths can occur. OF design, whilst not removing the potential for retrograde contamination may, in combination with a flushing regimen, prevent these waterborne pathogens from contaminating the water delivered from the outlet. A new make/model of HCU was filled with filtered tap water and high numbers of MS-2 (10 10 pfu/L) added to the tanks. Allglass impingers were used to sample the air when the HCU was circulating and not circulating water. Samplers were operated for 5 min before the impinging fluid was transferred to a sterile container and cultured for MS-2. Results: Similar numbers ( p = 0.1) of MS-2 were recovered from the air when the HCU was circulating (1.9 × 10 4 pfu/m 3 ) and not circulating (3.8 × 10 3 pfu/m 3 ) water. The filler inlet was identified as the principal area of aerosol release. Aerosol release was not affected by the position of the inlet cover but could be minimised through crude modification to the filler unit. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Specialist aerobiology using a biological tracer can determine the level of aerosol release from an HCU and its location. Results are obtained rapidly and could be used by manufacturers and NHS Trusts to inform design and purchasing decisions alike. The performance of the test will be evaluated and compared alongside the selective culture screening method currently used at our institution. Both tests will be performed on routine rectal screening samples collected prospectively from adult patients as part of the local CPE screening protocol. We intend to collect 100 rectal swabs and report on the sensitivity, specificity and turnaround times. Results: The C. difficile GDH antigen was detected in 58% (n = 121) of the stool samples with 90% of these (n = 110) also positive for CDT A or B. When cultured on CHROMagar C. difficile, fluorescent colonies were grown from 97/110 (88%) GDH positive samples. Absence of flourescent colonies in 13 samples was either because they failed to grow or they had non flourescent colonies. However 5 samples which were negative for GDH and Toxin had flourescent colonies. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Our findings support the use of CHROMagar C. difficle. The test was found to be 89% sensitive and 94% specific. It is an easy to perform, sensitive and specific method to detect the presence of C. difficile in stool samples. In this study, almost a third of positive stool samples were non-diarrhoeal. Unfortunately, due to limitations of the available clinical data, we could not ascertain the full clinical/public health significance of these positives. However, the organisms isolated are generally regarded as significant human pathogens. First of all, one survey was created to evaluate staffs' knowledge about patient safety and considered methods to prevent any errors and then a one-page form was prepared to collect faults and near miss cases errors in the duration of research. The preferred research method was correlational method because of different aspects of research. The duration was only one month as a start point and main participants were staff of the operation room in Iranian hospital Dubai. In next step analyzing was done based on LOTICs score and as a result we recommended some solutions to remove problems like wise. Results: Based on collected data, we found out there are many important negotiable problems about patient safety in operation room. First of all, miscommunication is important issue, also we found out some gaps on training and education in OT. Background: Hand hygiene compliance amongst medical staff is poor. We performed a project to determine knowledge of the 'how' and 'why' of hand hygiene practice. Initial results showed a good understanding of the 'how' of hand hygiene practice but poor understanding of the core science behind current guidelines (the 'why'). An educational event was administered by our local infection control team to address short-comings. Aim(s)/Objective(s): Following the educational event a further questionnaire was administered to re-assess staff knowledge of hand hygiene practice and their attitudes towards hand hygiene education. Results: Our results show the basic principles of hand hygiene (the 'how') were well understood but understanding of the core science (the 'why') was lacking. Participants indicated a strong tendency towards evidence based practice wishing to have the opportunity to evaluate evidence before enacting a change in clinical practice. Participants indicated that they were unhappy with the current format of hand hygiene education which was thought to be overly dogmatic. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out anonymously among 254 nurses and 242 physicians in Latvia to identify and quantify factors that affect the hand washing behaviour. Groups were asked to answer in free form with regard to failing or neglecting to wash their hands when they should have done so. The questionnaire included details of the situations in which physicians and nurses neglected to wash their hands were classified into the five categories described in Japan study in 2002. Results: 128 nurses (50,3%) and 180 physicians (74,3%) neglected to wash their hands when they should have done so. Among them "was too busy" were 102 (79,6%) nurses and 115 (63,8%) physicians, "forgot" 9 (7%) nurses and 24 (13%) physicians, "do not recognize the necessity" 2 (1,5%) nurses and 1 (0,05%) physicians, "did not find facility for washing hands" 3 (1,6%) nurses and 8 (4,4%) physicians, "use gloves instead of washing hands" 11 (8,5%) nurses and 32 (17,7%) physicians. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Significant differences were found among staff groups. To improve hand hygiene psychological factors must be considered: including motivation, recognition and behaviour in urgent conditions. Hospitals need to develop and implement innovative educational and motivational programmes tailored to physicians. Background: Patient safety and HAI prevention and control should be a pillar of the professional level of competency starting from the first approach to health care organizations (undergraduate level). It should be based also on active involvement of the students. The 10th anniversary of the adoption of Clean Care is Safer Care project in Italy provided the opportunity to the Universities members of the GISIO-SItI Study Group on HAI to try new ways to encourage students' creativity. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To actively involve students in Nursing, Medical Degree, Other HealthCare Professionals in a creative contest on hand hygiene in order to increase their awareness both of this topic and more in general of HAI. The Universities members of the GISIO network promoted at local level a contest after previously defining aim, methods and framework for evaluating the results. Students were invited to prepare by May 5th, 2016 products such as videos, posters, presentations, leaflets, screensavers. The best works will represent their University in a national contest to be held on November 18th. Results: More than 600 students from 9 Italian Universities and 38 from Albania were involved. 105 projects were presented for evaluation. A local committee judged according to a common framework on the following items: scientific accuracy, creativity, products' technical quality, usefulness for campaigning. A national committee will be in charge to apply the same criteria to the national contest. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Given the encouraging achievements, the steering group is considering whether to extend the participation in the next future. Results: The day met the expectations of the diverse audience, with participants reporting that the following knowledge learnt from the conference will inform future practice (number or responses in brackets); the website resources sign posted e.g. PHE Fingertips (14), to become and promote Antibiotic Guardian (5), the risk of foreign hospitalisation on CPE carriage (4), infection control key to tackling AMR (4), the threat of CPE on health security (4), implementation of the CPE toolkit (2), importance of screening patients (2), review antibiotics by 72 hours (2). Participants enjoyed; diversity of speakers (18), the broad and global overview of current AMR (13), environmental dimensions of AMR (9), farming and vets approach to tackling AMR/antibiotic stewardship (9), human travel and the spread of resistance (8), the complexity of AMR (5). The stakeholder theory provides a suitable theoretical framework to analyse the relation between policy issues, responsibilities and activities of people participating in processes serving water systems to contribute to prevention and hygiene. The theoretical drive of this research is inductive, based on a qualitative approach of data collection, divided into two consecutive phases. Results: Preliminary results exemplarily present the organisational structure, legislative frames regarding water safety and Legionella prevention, types water systems and related services and processes, seen from the FM/FS perspective with a technical focus. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Each hospital representing a case study will work out further endeavour on managing risks properly according to organisation's specific necessities. The FSET is a computer-based tool, hosted on the secure UK NHS N3 network. The FSET can collect data on non-identifiable patient characteristics, underlying disease, details of diagnostic tests, antifungal management and hospital visits in the defined patient group. An amalgamation of the pooled data can generate simple visual reports that summarises the key outputs. Results: The FSET allows hospital Trusts to extensively analyse patients cohorts undertaking prophylaxis with antifungals, capturing holistic resource usage incurred during the overall patient management pathway. Air sampling was performed twice-monthly at 13 hospital locations. Indoor locations included an intensive care unit (ICU), a Stem cell transplant unit, a Cardio-thoracic ICU, and a respiratory ward, each with different air handling arrangements. A dual head SAS air sampler was used to sample 1000L of air. Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to select A. fumigatus colonies, and Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 agar containing itraconazole/voriconazole screened for triazole resistant A. fumigatus. Results: Areas with controlled ventilation, and sealed windows, generally had satisfactory counts. Two wards without controlled ventilation repeatedly showed high Aspergillus counts which was addressed by installing portable HEPA filters. The Stem cell transplant unit consistently had satisfactory results. A. fumigatus CFU counts outdoors were generally higher than those indoors. Our findings confirm that adequate environmental control is dependent on having units/wards with air handling systems that address patients' risk of developing nosocomial aspergillosis. 140 health-workers involved after which awareness talk is done to ensure they are updated on management of possible hepatitis B affliction. Academical level: Awareness has been done to medical students and healthcare workers on 3 major hepatitis in Egypt A, B, and C: 903 surveyors. Method(s): Clinical level: survey on needle stick injuries is given to health-worker where we ensure confidentiality and then we aware of hepatitis B. Academic Level: A pre-survey is given to a medical student/ healthworker assessing his/her knowledge of hepatitis A, B, and C. A general talk targeting certain basic info needed to be known by students and clinicians is then given. A post survey is then given to assess the talk. Results: 53% of 140 health-workers got injured by a needle stick in the past 12 months. 81% didn't file incident report. 90 were not vaccinated for Hep B and 96 didn't receive training in management of needle stick injury. Out of 903 surveyors for general info on Hep, 40% answered all questions right in the pre-survey and 90% answered them right on the post-survey. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): More focus is needed to be put on informing health-workers and medical students on how to prevent needle stick injury, and they in general need to be aware of the common types of hepatitis here. We performed a systematic review of studies that included adult patients in LMIC and compared the use of bundled care to usual care. Bundles included those for sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-associated UTIs. Outcomes included improved care with the use of a bundle, reduced incidence of infection and mortality and process outcomes. Results: We identified one randomised controlled trial (n = 109) and nine non-randomised before-and-after studies (n = 87, 055). Metaanalysis of five studies showed an overall significant reduction in the incidence of infection with bundled care (rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.70, p < 0.001). Three studies were included in further meta-analyses, showing no decrease in mortality rate and no significant reduction in severity score (APACHE II). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): The use of a care bundle in LMIC can significantly reduce the incidence of infections. There is no significant effect on mortality. These results may be used to consider developing care bundles for specific use in LMIC.  The pharmacist reviewed CDI patients, aiming to improve outcomes. Outcomes were compared with similar cases in the previous year. We conducted a singlecenter observational study on the effect of daily bathing with no-rinse 2% chlorhexidine-impregnated washcloths in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. The incidence rates of the acquisition of MDRO and the rates of CLABSI were compared. Results: The overall rate of MDRO acquisition was 4.38 cases per 1000 patient-days before chlorhexidine bathing versus 2.03 cases per 1000 patient-days after the introduction of the wash cloths, a 53.6% reduction. The overall rate of CLABSI was 1.95 per 1000 catheter days at the start of the washing period versus 1.40 per 1000 catheter days at the end, a reduction of 28.2%. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Introduction of daily chlorhexidine washing appeared to be an effective intervention to reduce the rates of MDRO acquisition and decrease the infection rates in the ICU. Aim(s)/Objective(s): We performed a detailed evaluation of S. aureus carriage in critical care HCWs. Method(s): Consenting critical care HCWs in a teaching hospital in Southern England were serially screened for S. aureus carriage over 14 months. Data on demographics, co-morbidities, and medical care were collected. Longitudinal nasal carriage was defined using carriage profile indices (CPI) (total culture-positive swabs over total swabs). Measures of association were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 198 HCWs 147 (74.2%) were female, 146 (73.4%) were <40 years and prevalence of co-morbidities was low. Nasal carriage at study entry was identified in 54/149 (36.2%) nurses, 16/40 (40.0%) doctors and 3/9 (33.3%) physiotherapists (8 MRSA (all nurses)) and was associated with concurrent nursing home employment (OR 11, 95%CI 1.2-106.1, p = 0.038) and living with a partner (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.3, p = 0.02). Serial screening revealed 73 HCWs (38.2%) intermittently carried S. aureus (CPI = 0.07-0.93), 36 (18.9%) were always culture-positive (CPI = 1) and 82 (42.9%) always culture-negative (CPI = 0). Of these serially screened HCWs, 54 (28.3%) (52 nurses, p < 0.001) received ≥1 course of antibiotics during the study. HCWs receiving antibiotics were twice as likely to carry S. aureus intermittently (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.3-4.7, p = 0.006). Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Longitudinal nasal carriage of S. aureus in critical care HCWs reveal diverse intermittent carriage profiles associated with receipt of antibiotics. Further work is required to determine the implications of carriage profiles and transmission. The study is a qualitative, multiple case study, where semi structured interviews form the base of the empirical knowledge used. The theory behind the study is the perspective on intersectoral collaboration, examples of models of collaboration and the strength and weaknesses of collaboration. Results: The study showed that the motivational factors for intersectoral collaboration were: focus on organisation and structure in the organisations, collaboration through networks, awareness of the importance of clear communications paths and focus on the professional competencies in relation to infection hygiene. A structured collaboration with the establishment of an actual infection control organisation resulted in access to expert knowledge, security among the personnel as well as motivation to work with infection control as an area of focus. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Nosocomial infections in patients transferring from one health sector to another can likely be prevented by the introduction of knowledge of infection control to all levels of personnel in the sectors, and by entering into a formalised collaboration across the health sectors with the aim of establishing an intersectoral infection control organization. Background: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection occurring worldwide but is endemic in tropical countries. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from an undifferentiated febrile illness to 'Weil's disease'. Serological testing is the main diagnostic modality. Aim(s)/Objective(s): To review serological testing for Leptospirosis at our institution over a 10-year period and describe the clinical features of cases. Method(s): We identified patients from two tertiary care hospitals in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, who had samples sent to a Public Health England reference laboratory for Leptospirosis testing between 2006-2016. Clinical, laboratory and microbiological information on cases was collected retrospectively. Complete details were unavailable for four cases. Results: 480 samples were sent for Leptospirosis IgM ELISA testing: 450 were negative, 26 were positive and four were equivocal. There was no temporal trend to testing. The positive results came from 14 patients with a median age of 26 years. Nine cases were imported, mostly from Asia and with a history of fresh water exposure. Patients presented with non-specific symptoms: fever (10/11); myalgia (8/11); gastrointestinal symptoms (8/11); and headache (7/11). Laboratory evidence of hepatitis (8/10), acute kidney injury (5/10) and lymphopenia (8/10) was common. One patient developed 'Weil's disease' with multi-organ failure. Antimicrobials were administered in seven cases, usually doxycycline (5/7). There were no deaths. Discussion and/or Conclusion(s): Leptospirosis is an uncommon infection in Scotland. Most cases are imported, in contrast to recent UK-wide data, and this may be attributable to the Scottish climate. The clinical presentation is protean and mild hepato-renal involvement is common even in the absence of organ failure.
