A 45 year-old Cambodian woman was admitted in the emergency room because of subacute respiratory failure. Family history was uninformative and there was no consanguinity. Over the preceding 5 years, the patient had been treated for breast cancer. On admission, the patient required an emergency tracheal intubation because of hypercapnic coma. The first line of investigations did not reveal any sign of infection or inflammation, neither pulmonary embolism. Proximal four-limb weakness was noticed with hyperreflexia, suggesting a motor neuron disease. Nevertheless, the electromyography performed at bedside was normal, as well as standard biochemical analyses in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Full-body CT scan displayed metastases in the liver and in the spinal column. On further inquiry, family members reported bladder dysfunction, which started about 2 years earlier, and mild difficulty walking over the past months. In addition, the family indicated that the patient had suffered from dyspnea for a couple of weeks. The clinical status of the patient worsened as she developed a pulmonary infection. Within a few days, she suffered from a severe acute respiratory syndrome and died 3 weeks following admission. The study was approved by local ethics committees and written informed consent for autopsy was obtained from the patient's relatives. In the brain, the following regions were analyzed: midfrontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, caudate nucleus, thalamus and mamillary bodies, hippocampus, calcarin sulcus, cerebellum, substantia nigra, motor cortex, lenticular nucleus, pons, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, orbital-frontal cortex and temporal amygdala. Details on the antibodies that were used for immunohistochemistry are listed in the Supplementary table. In order to confirm the cellular localization of PB, the immunolabelling of neurofilaments (NF) was followed by PAS stain. On muscular and neural sections PAS technique, Masson's Trichromic stain, Congo Red and Luxol-fast blue (LFB) staining were performed. Specimens of sural nerve and musculocutaneous nerve were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The enzymatic activity of GBE was assayed in the patient's leukocytes obtained prior to death using an indirect method (Brown and Brown, 1966) . Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard procedures. The 16 exons and exon/intron boundaries of the GBE1 gene were amplified and PCR products were sequenced using the Big-Dye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and an ABI Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
