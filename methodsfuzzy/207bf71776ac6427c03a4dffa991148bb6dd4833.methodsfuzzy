In this paper, we use data from the 2010 CTS database for Great Britain, provided by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) via the Animal and Plant Health Agency. If multiple animals were moved on the same day from one farm to another, this was treated as one movement; markets were initially not explicitly included. Slaughterhouses were considered as sinks, and therefore movements to slaughterhouses were ignored even when going through a livestock market. In total, there were 70 243 farms and 327 markets in our dataset, with 856 454 movements in total. A total of 635 016 movements passed through markets, with 47 692 farms using cattle markets at least once during 2010. Four methods of sampling from this database are implemented and compared here. A directed weighted-static adjacency matrix A [38] was constructed for each set of sampled data, in which nodes represent farms and edges represent (directed) cattle movements. An edge a ij is defined to be non-zero if cattle are moved from farm i to farm j during the year. The weight of the edge represents the frequency of movements from farm i to farm j in 2010 (i.e. the total number of days on which movements occurred divided by 365).
