Virus purification and RNA extraction SBMV-B, originally obtained from Dr. J. P. Fulton (Arkansas) and maintained as dried leaves since 1974, was propagated in P. vu/gar/s (cv. The Prince) plants and the virus was purified essentially as described by Hull (1985) . Viral RNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform by the method of Zimmern (1975) from virus particles dissociated in the presence of 1% SDS.
