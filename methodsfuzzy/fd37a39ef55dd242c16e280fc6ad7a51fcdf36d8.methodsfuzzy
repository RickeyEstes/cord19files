The statistical methods described herein are similar to those published for our previous genetic association studies [14] [15] [16] 26] . Data were descriptively summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and medians and inter-quartile ranges for continuous variables. Assessments of cytokine secretion and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) measures resulted in multiple recorded values per outcome both prior to and after stimulation with measles virus. For descriptive purposes, a single response measurement per individual was obtained for each of these outcomes by subtracting the median of the unstimulated values from the median of the stimulated values. Assessments of antibody levels resulted in only one recorded value per individual. Observed genotypes were used to estimate allele frequencies for each SNP and departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were assessed using either a Pearson goodness-of-fit test or, for SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 5%, a Fisher exact test [33] . Estimates of pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on the r-squared statistic were obtained using Haploview software, version 3.32 [34] . SNP associations with immune response outcomes were evaluated using regression models. Simple linear regression was used for measles antibody levels, for which we had only one measured value per individual. Repeated measures approaches were implemented for the cytokine secretion and IFN-␥ Elispot variables, simultaneously modeling the multiple observed measurements and using an unstructured within-person variance-covariance matrix to account for within-subject correlations. This was achieved by including the genotype variable in the regression model, together with a variable representing stimulation status. The resulting genotype-by-stimulation status interaction was then tested for statistical significance. Tests of association assumed an ordinal (logadditive) SNP effect using simple tests for trend. Because of the lack of seronegative subjects (PRMN titer < 1:8) in our cohort and the low number of subjects (68) with antibody concentrations less than the protective threshold of 210 mIU/mL (corresponding to PRMN titer of 120) [25] , our statistical approach rationale was to assess associations between SNPs and quantitative humoral/cellular immune outcomes across the entire cohort using linear regression methodologies rather than assess the distribution of SNPs across extremes of humoral/cellular immune responses (such as seronegative subjects and/or subjects with antibody concentrations less than the protective titer). To further explore genomic regions containing statistically significant single-SNP effects, we performed post hoc haplotype analyses. Posterior probabilities of all possible haplotypes for an individual, conditional on the observed genotypes, were estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [35] . This information was used to define haplotype design variables that estimated the number of each of the haplotypes carried by an individual. Analyses were performed on all resulting common haplotypes (those with an estimated frequency of >1%) using simple least squares linear regression approach for antibody levels and repeated measures approaches for the CMI variables. Differences in immune response among common haplotypes were first assessed globally and simultaneously tested for statistical significance using a multiple degree-of-freedom test. Following these global tests, we examined individual haplotype effects. Each haplotype was included in a separate regression analysis, effectively comparing immune response levels for the haplotype of interest against all others combined. Due to phase ambiguity, haplotypespecific medians and inter-quartile ranges could not be calculated. Thus, descriptive summaries were represented using the corresponding t-statistics. All of the association analyses described above were separately performed within the two most prevalent racial groups (Caucasians and African-Americans). Each analysis also adjusted for gender, age at first measles vaccination, age at second measles vaccination, age at enrollment (thus accounting for the time since last vaccination to enrollment/blood draw and immunity measurements), and cohort status (cohort 1 vs. cohort 2). We used an inverse normal transformation for all cytokine secretion and IFN-␥ Elispot outcome variables, and a log transformation for the antibody response measure, in all formal tests to account for the skewed nature of the data. Because of the large number of statistical tests, we computed q-values for each SNP to estimate the corresponding false discovery rates (FDR) as per Storey and Tibshirani [36, 37] . We considered SNPs as being significant if their q-value was less than 0.2 [38] . However, we also reported single-SNP associations as being of interest for further follow-up if the q-value was less than 0.5. This corresponded to single-SNP p-values that were roughly ≤0.01. All statistical tests were two-sided and, unless otherwise indicated, all analyses were carried out using the SAS software system (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.).
