Expression of MERS-CoV-RBD-specific Nbs in yeast cells. NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc Nbs containing a C-terminal His 6 and Fc of human IgG1, respectively, were constructed based on the aforementioned CAb10 VHH. The DNA sequences encoding NbAb10 and NbAb10-Fc were synthesized (GenScript) and inserted into the Pichia pastoris secretory expression vector, pPICZ␣A (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1) . The recombinant NbMS10 and NbMS-Fc were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 cells and purified using a Ni-NTA column (for NbMS10; GE Healthcare) and a protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (for NbMS10-Fc; GE Healthcare), respectively. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The purified anti-MERS-CoV-RBD Nbs were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (23, 48) . Briefly, Nbs (3 g) were loaded onto 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels and stained using Coomassie brilliant blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After being blocked overnight at 4°C with 5% nonfat milk/phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 (5% PBST), the membranes were incubated sequentially with goat anti-llama IgG (1:3,000; Abcam) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:1,000; R&D Systems) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then with ECL Western blot substrate reagents. Finally, the membranes were visualized using Amersham Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). A SARS-CoV-RBD-specific MAb, 33G4 (50) , was used as a control. ELISA. ELISA was performed to detect the binding between Nbs and MERS-CoV S1 or RBD proteins (23, 51) . Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4°C, respectively, with recombinant MERS-CoV S1-His (48), RBD-Fc (48), RBD-Fd (51), or one of the mutant RBDs containing a C-terminal human Fc tag (28) . After being blocked with 2% PBST for 2 h at 37°C, the plates were further incubated sequentially with serially diluted Nbs (containing a C-terminal His 6 or Fc tag), either goat anti-llama (1:5,000) or mouse anti-His (1:3,000) antibody (Sigma) and either HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:3,000) or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000) antibody (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 37°C. ELISA substrate (3,3=,5,5=tetramethylbenzidine [TMB]; Invitrogen) was added to the plates, and the reactions were stopped with 1 N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm (A 450 ) was measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro microplate reader (Tecan). To detect the binding between Nbs and denatured MERS-CoV RBD protein, ELISA plates were coated with RBD-Fd protein (2 g/ml) overnight at 4°C and then sequentially incubated with DTT (10 mM) and iodoacetamide (50 mM) (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C (28) . After three washes using PBST, ELISA was performed as described above. Inhibition of the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4 proteins by Nbs was performed using ELISA as described above, except that recombinant hDPP4 protein (2 g/ml; R&D Systems), and serially diluted Nbs were added simultaneously to the RBD-Fc-coated plates. The binding between RBD and DPP4 was detected using goat anti-hDPP4 antibody (1:1,000; R&D Systems) and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:3,000). The percent inhibition was calculated based on the A 450 values of RBD-hDPP4 binding in the presence or absence of Nbs. SARS-CoV 33G4 MAb was used as a negative control to Nbs. Surface plasmon resonance. The binding between Nbs and MERS-CoV S1 or RBD protein was detected using a BiacoreS200 instrument (GE Healthcare) as previously described (29) . Briefly, recombinant Fc-fused MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein or NbMS10-Fc Nb (5 g/ml) was captured using a Sensor Chip protein A (GE Healthcare), and recombinant His 6 -tagged MERS-CoV S1-His protein or NbMS10 Nb at various concentrations was flown over the chip surface in a running buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20. The sensorgram was analyzed using Biacore S200 software, and the data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model. Flow cytometry. This assay was performed to detect the inhibition of the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell surface hDPP4 by Nbs (28) . Briefly, Huh-7 cells expressing hDPP4 were incubated with MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein (20 g/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of Nbs at various concentrations. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antihuman IgG antibody (1:50, Sigma) for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percent inhibition was calculated based on the fluorescence intensity of RBD-Huh-7 cell binding in the presence or absence of Nbs. MERS pseudovirus neutralization assay. Neutralization of MERS pseudovirus entry by Nbs was performed as previously described (23, 52) . Briefly, 293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV S protein. The MERS pseudoviruses were harvested from supernatants at 72 h posttransfection and then incubated with Nbs at 37°C for 1 h before being added to Huh-7 cells. After 72 h, the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega), incubated with luciferase substrate (Promega), and assayed for relative luciferase activity using Tecan Infinite 200 Pro Luminator (Tecan). The ND 50 of the Nbs was calculated as previously described (53) . MERS-CoV microneutralization assay. Neutralization of MERS-CoV infection by Nbs was performed as previously described (28, 54) . Briefly, MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) at an amount equal to 100 median tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) was incubated with Nbs at different concentrations for 1 h at 37°C. The Nb-virus mixture was then incubated with Vero E6 cells for 72 h at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO 2 . The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily. The neutralizing activity of Nbs was reported as the ND 50 . The Reed-Muench method was used to calculate the ND 50 value for each Nb (55) . Measurement of half-life of Nbs. Male and female C57BL/6 mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were intravenously injected with Nbs (50 g in 200 l per mouse) into the tail vein. Sera were collected at different time points (30 min, 2 h, 6 h, 1 day, 5 days, and 10 days postinjection). The concentrations of Nbs in the sera were detected by ELISA, as described above. Briefly, MERS-CoV S1-His protein (2 g/ml) was used to coat ELISA plates, and then sera, goat anti-llama antibodies (1:5,000), and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies (1:3,000) were sequentially added for ELISA reactions. Evaluation of protective efficacy of NbMS10-Fc Nb. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of NbMS10-Fc was evaluated in hDPP4-Tg mice as previously described (29) . Briefly, male and female mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were intraperitoneally anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/kg of body weight) before being intranasally inoculated with lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain, 10 5.3 TCID 50 ) in 20 l of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium. Either 3 days preinfection or 1 or 3 days postinfection, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with NbMS10-Fc (10 mg/kg). Trastuzumab MAb was used as a control to the Nb. The infected mice were observed daily for 14 days, and their body weights and survivals were recorded. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.01. To compare the binding of Nbs to MERS-CoV S1 or RBD protein, as well as the RBDs with or without D539A mutation to hDPP4 receptor, a two-tailed Student t test was used. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the inhibition of Nbs to RBD-hDPP4 binding. Statistical significance between survival curves was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the figures, "*," "**," and "***" indicate P Ͻ 0.05, P Ͻ 0.01, and P Ͻ 0.001, respectively. Data availability. All data needed to evaluate the conclusions presented here are included.
