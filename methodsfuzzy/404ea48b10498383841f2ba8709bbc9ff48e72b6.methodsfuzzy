Cell and virus. TrichoplMa ni (TN-368) and Spodoptera fmgiperdu (IPLB-21) cells were maintained with TNMFH medium (Hink, 1970) modified according to Wood (1980a) . The plaque-purified 1A clone of AcNPV (Wood, 1980b) was used throughout these experiments. Intracellular viral glyqwrote-ins. TN-368 or IPLB-21 cells (3 X lo5 cells) were seeded into each well of a Falcon Multiwell Plate and inoculated with 3 X 10' plaque-forming units of 1A virus (m.o.i. = 10) by centrifugation at 1000 g for 1 hr (Wood, 1977) . The virus inoculum was removed and replaced either with medium or medium containing 10 pg/ml tunicamycin (TM) and incubated at 26" (Stiles et al, 1983a) . At appropriate times postinoculation (pi) cells in two wells were washed and then starved for 2 hr in low sugar medium (modified TNMFH medium without sucrose or fucase, l/10 the normal amount of glucose, with dialyzed fetal calf serum added to a final 10% (v/v) concentration and sorbitol added to adjust the osmotic concentration) plus 10 pg/ml TM when appropriate. After starving, 40 &i (final concentration 130 &i/ml) of [2-3H]mannose (New England Nuclear Corp.), N-El-"HJacetylglucosamine (Amersham/Searle) or [6-3Hlfucase (Amersham/Searle) was added to each well. After a 2-hr labeling period the cells were removed, washed once with Graces medium minus amino acids and pelleted at 300 g for 2 min. The cells were then suspended in 50 ~1 of distilled water, sonicated at 50 W for 4-5 set (Heat Systems, model W185 cell disruptor) and 5-gl ali-quots removed for a modified Lowry protein assay (Markwell et a& 1981) . The remaining cell sample was combined with an equal volume of 2X Laemmli buffer (1970) and boiled 2-3 min. Preparation and purification of yH-labeled AcNPV TN-368 or IPLB-21 cells were seeded into tissue culture flasks (1 X lo6 cells/cm' surface area) and allowed 1 hr for attachment. The medium was removed and a small volume of fresh medium containing 1A AcNPV (m.o.i. = 10) was added to each flask. The flasks were rocked gently for 1 hr (25") and then additional medium was added (half the flasks received medium plus 10 pg/ml TM). At 12 hr pi the medium and virus inoculum was removed and 5 ml (for a 75-cm2 flask) of low sugar medium (or low sugar medium plus TM) were added. The cells were starved for 2 hr after which 250 PCi of PH]mannose (rH]man), or N-[Hyacetylglucosamine (rH]GlcNAc) was added to each flask. At 24 hr pi 10 ml of complete medium (or medium pius TM) was added to each flask. At 48 hr pi the medium was carefully removed and fresh medium (or medium plus TM) added to the flasks. The medium containing the budded, nonoccluded virus (NOV) was given a low speed centrifugation (300 g, 3 min) to remove cells and then layered over 20% (w/w) sucrose (1 mMTris buffer, pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 1 hr at 66,000 g and 5". The virus pellet was suspended in 1 n& Tris buffer (pH 7.5) and then layered onto a 25-55% w/w sucrose (1 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5) gradient and centrifuged for 3 hr at 80,000 g and 5". The virus band was collected, diluted with 3 vol 1 mMTris buffer (pH 7.5), and centrifuged 1 hr at 66,000 g, 5". The virus pellet was suspended in 50 ~1 of 1 mlMTris buffer (pH 7.5) and a 5-ccl aliquot removed for an optical density determination at 260 nm. The remaining virus samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2X Laemmli buffer and boiled 2-3 min. At 4-5 days pi the infected cells were harvested from the flasks and the occlusion bodies purified using the SDS-NaCI procedure of Wood (1980b) . Purified occlusion bodies (OBs) were dissolved for 15 min in 50 mM Na&O:< at room temperature and then mixed with an equal volume of 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and centrifuged for 15 min at low speed (1000 g) to pellet undissolved OBs. The supernatant was then layered over 25% (w/w) sucrose (1 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5) and centrifuged at 66,000 g and 5" for 1 hr. The virus pellet was suspended in 50 ~1 of 1 mMTris buffer (pH 7.5) and a 5-~1 aliquot removed to determine the optical density at 260 nm. The remaining virus samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2X Laemmli buffer and boiled 2-3 min. Radioicdinatim qf virus envelope surface proteins. Unlabeled NOV was purified as described above. Unlabeled occluded virus released from occlusion bodies (approximately 1 X 10') was further purified by banding on a 25-65% (w/w) sucrose gradient (1 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5) at 80,000 g and 5" (3 hr). Both the NOV and occluded virus bands were collected from the sucrose gradients immediately before iodination. The purified virus (in l-2 ml of sucrose) was mixed with 0.2 ml of 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The following were then added in order: 75 ~1 of 10% glucose, 11 mU of glucose oxidase (Sigma), 11 mU of lactoperoxidase (Calbiochem), and 150 &i of carrier free Na'? (Amersham/Searle) (modification of Hubbard and Cohn, 1972) . The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then diluted with 2 vol of 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) to stop the reaction. The labeled virus was immediately layered over a cushion of sucrose (20% w/w for NOV, 35% w/w for occluded virus) in 1 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5 and centrifuged 1 hr at 60,000 g, 5". The virus pellet was suspended in 100 ~1 of Laemmli (1970) buffer and boiled 2-3 min. Acid hydrolysis of sH-labekd virus structural glycoproteins. To check for interconversion of the labeled sugars to other sugars before being incorporated into virus glycoproteins, NOV produced in TN-368 cells and labeled with rH]man or ["HJ-GlcNAc was purified as described above. The virus (in water) was combined with an equal volume of 20% cold TCA and kept on ice overnight. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 9 for 15 min, the supernatant poured off and the pellet suspended in 5 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:l) to extract the glycolipids. The extraction was carried out overnight at 5". The proteins were then pelleted at 1000 g for 15 min and the supernatant discarded. Acid hydrolysis of the samples and thin layer chromatography were carried out according to Klenk et al (1970) . The pellets were dried under a stream of Nz gas and 1 N HCl added. The mixture was then sealed under N2 and heated at 100" for 12 hr. The residue was dissolved twice in methanol and dried under Nz to remove all the acid. The residue was then dissolved in 50% methanol and spotted side by side with unlabeled sugar standards (in 50% methanol) onto a precoated cellulose TLC plastic sheet (Merck), which was divided into lanes 2-cm wide. The solvent system was ethyl acetate-pyridine-acetic acidwater (5:5:1:3) and the chromatogram was developed twice. The marker sugars (glucose, fucose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, and galactosamine) were stained with an alkaline silver nitrate solution (Krebs et ah, 1969) and photographed immediately after development of the spots. The virus sample lanes were cut horizontally into 3-mm wide strips and counted in Biofluor cocktail (New England Nuclear Corp.). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, autwudiography, and jkn-ography. Virus samples were dissociated and applied to diseontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (1970) . Aliquots of the virus samples were TCA-precipitated to determine the amount of label incorporated. Gels 15 X 15 X 0.15 cm with a 4% stacking and 11% running gels were electrophoresed at a constant 6 W per gel. Gels with 'z51-labeled proteins were dried immediately onto No. 1 Whatman filter paper and exposed to a sheet of Kodak X-Omat X-ray film at -70". '?H-labeled gels were first treated with Enhance (New England Nuclear Corp.) before drying and exposure to X-ray film at -70". Molecular weights of labeled proteins were determined by comparison with the '"C-labeled protein standards (Amersham/ Searle) phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and lysozyme.
