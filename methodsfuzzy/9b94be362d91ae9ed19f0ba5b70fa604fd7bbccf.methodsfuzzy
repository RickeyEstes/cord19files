2.1. Establishment of 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens 3D8 scFv G 1 tg rooster generated with the pLenti-CBA (chicken βactin promoter)-3D8 scFv-HA (human influenza hemagglutinin tag)-IRES-puro vector was mated with wild type hens to produce G 2 tg chickens as previously described (Byun et al., 2017) . Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from whole blood (1 ml) of chickens. After the addition of 3 ml of cell lysis solution, the mixture was centrifuged to recover white blood cell (WBC). The supernatant was removed and gDNA was purified from the WBC pellet using Wizard Genomic Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, USA). The amount of gDNA used in PCR reactions was 50 ng. The presence of 3D8 scFv in the G 2 chickens was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis using a forward primer targeting the CBA promoter region and a reverse primer targeting the 3D8 scFv region. The primer set (forward: 5′-CCTCTGCTAACCATGTTCAT GCCTTC -3′ and reverse: 5′-GCTAGTGAATGTGTATCCAGAAGCCTT-3′) was designed for the amplification. The PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles at 95°C for 20 s (denaturation), 60°C for 40 s (annealing), and 72°C for 30 s (extension).
