In order to investigate leisure and business tourists' perceived importance of safety measures, this study uses face-to-face interviews and a self-completed survey. Literature points out the weaknesses of relying only on a written, closed-end self-completed questionnaire surveys. The closed-end questionnaire survey has limitations (Woodside, 2004; Woodside, MacDonald, & Burford, 2004) . Such surveys may not capture unconscious thoughts (Woodside, 2004) , and 95% of thought is sub-conscious (Woodside & Wilson, 2003) . However, using long interviews to collect data involves high consumption of time and thus usually of research dollars. Also, a drawback of long interviews is drawing inferences such as proportions of a population being in a certain category (Wilson & Woodside, 1999; Woodside et al., 2004) . A combination of data collection methods provides a way to gain in depth insights and adequately reliable statistics. Schatz (2009) highlights the benefit of nesting semi-structured interviews in surveys in solving the quantitative concerns on generalization of the finding to population.
