2.1. Cell culture and drug administration RAW 264.7 cells (murine macrophage cell line, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in endotoxin-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Excell Bio, China), 100IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and then maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For LPS stimulation, cells were stimulated by LPS with a concentration of 1 μg/ml 6 h and 12 h after LPS stimulation, cells were harvested for PCR and western blot respectively. To inhibit SIRT1, EX527 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) was used to stimulate macrophages at the concentration of 1 μM, cells were used for further experiments 24 h after disposal.
