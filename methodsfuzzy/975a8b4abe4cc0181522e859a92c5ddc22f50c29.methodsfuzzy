A questionnaire was developed and distributed to UK farmers between September and November 2011 (available on request form authors). A paper version of the questionnaire was produced, and an identical online version was created using a proprietary survey tool (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, USA). The questionnaire was split in two parts: part A, involving questions about vaccination protocols on the farm, and part B, involving questions relating to the respondent and their farm. The questionnaire contained 14 closed and 9 open-ended questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Eleven questions asked respondents about the protocol used for a specific vaccine the respondent nominated as being most familiar with. As protocols vary between vaccines, the interpretation of 'correct' or 'incorrect' use was made using information provided on the vaccine datasheet (National Office of Animal Health (NOAH) 2010). Pretesting of the questionnaire was carried out with two veterinary students, four veterinarians and three farmers. Minor corrections were made, and paper copies for piloting were sent to five farmers. The online version was piloted with two veterinary students and two farmers. After minor typographical and lay-out adjustments following feedback from pilot participants, the questionnaire was finalised for distribution, and a cover letter included explaining the purpose of the study and offering the option of entering into a Â£100 prize draw for agricultural stockist vouchers. Farmers were asked to nominate which vaccines they had used in the past year, aided by images of the vaccines which were broadly categorised according to the diseases they target (Table 1) . Multivalent vaccines, providing protection against more than one disease, were placed in multiple categories. All vaccines registered for use in cattle in the UK were included in the survey. Bluetongue vaccines and one BVDv vaccine were excluded from the survey, because at the time the questionnaire was distributed, bluetongue vaccination was not permitted, and a BVDv vaccine (Pregsure BVD, Pfizer) had recently been taken off the market.
