The last 30 years have seen the remarkable rapid development of the application of CFD in environmental design. CFD has already been used not only as an environmental research tool to enlarge our predictive power but also as a design tool for urban planners and designers [27] . Highly unsteady and three-dimensional turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary can be simulated. Three methods are broadly discussed: Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), LES, and Reynolds-averaged NaviereStokes (RANS). Compared with laminar flows, the fluctuations of turbulent flows are on a broad range of spatial and temporal scales [27, 28] . In DNS, all spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence motions are directly computed by NaviereStokes equations without any approximations by turbulence models [28] . Therefore, DNS is the most accurate among all of the simulation methods. However, all the length scales of turbulence should be resolved in the meshes [28] . Thus, DNS computation to simulate the flows at high Reynolds numbers becomes extremely expensive. LES method separates the turbulence flow into large and small scales and only focuses on the "large eddy". Small eddies, such as eddies in Kolmogorov scales, are eliminated from the solution to decrease computational cost. The unresolved scales of turbulence flows are approximated by the sub filter-scale turbulence models [29, 30] . Therefore, LES is less computationally costly than DNS. Currently, sufficient computer resources from parallel supercomputers enable the use of LES as a research tool, which is practical in a wide range of engineering applications to simulate high Reynolds flows, such as simulations of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer [26] . Compared with DNS and LES methods, which are timedependent approaches, the RANS method does not directly compute any turbulence by NaviereStokes equations but approximates the turbulence flows by decomposing solution variables in DNS and LES into the time-averaged and fluctuating components: where f is the instantaneous value of variables, such as velocity, in the NaviereStokes equations, <f> is the mean value, and f 0 is the fluctuating value. The turbulence models are to approximate the effects of f 0 . Therefore, compared with DNS and LES, RANS is a simplified engineering approximation broadly applied as a design tool. According to the literature review in Section 2.2, the increasing number of turbulence flows (eddies) approximated by turbulence models considerably decrease computational cost, from DNS, LES to RANS. The current study tries out the RANS method to simulate the wind velocity in the neutral condition in the computational parametric study. Compared with applied studies focusing on wind performance in real urban morphologies [23, 36, 37] , the current study uses the parametric approach to obtain the natural ventilation performance with generic building configurations. In the parametric study, cross-comparing the effects of different design issues is easier by observing changes in natural ventilation performance in different testing scenarios, thus identifying the critical design issues. Three groups, comprising 27 testing scenarios, are set up in three input wind directions and are simulated by the keu SST model. Each testing scenario uses a building model matrix. The building model design, computational modeling of the testing scenario, and boundary conditions for CFD simulation are introduced in this section.
