This was a cross-sectional study aimed at assessing the emergency response among health care workers involved in the case management of patients in this epidemic. The study was conducted in September and October 2010 during the 2010 cholera outbreak. The healthcare workers interviewed included doctors, nurses, laboratory scientists, community extension workers and hospital attendants, most of whom were observed at cholera treatment centers in rural areas. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire designed to collect demographic information, information on previous experience and training in cholera case management and the availability and use of universal safety tools. The questionnaires were pretested using a similar population in a pilot study, and a revised version was used to collect the study data. This study was nested in the intervention by the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research Emergency Response Team (NIMRERT), which visited three north-eastern states of Nigeria in 2010 during the peak of the cholera epidemic to assess the epidemics, evaluate public health interventions for the outbreak and provide research support for the laboratory evaluation, isolation and typing of the circulating strains of V. cholerae in this region. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research Institutional Review Board prior to the commencement of the survey. Healthcare workers observed on site at cholera treatment centers who were willing and able to give informed consent were enrolled in the study. Healthcare workers who did not want to participate were excluded from the study. The few HCWs who refused to participate in the study were either observed during the 'in-between' shift period or had a pressing clinic demand at the time our team visited their facility. Data entry and organization were performed with Microsoft Excel, and data analysis was performed using Epi info software.
