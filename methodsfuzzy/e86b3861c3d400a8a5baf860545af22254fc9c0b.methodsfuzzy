Production of SARS-CoV 3CL pro DNA fragment encoding the protease was amplified by polymerase chain reaction based on strain CUHK-Su10 sequence (GenBank AY282752) [26] . The coding sequence of 3CL pro was cloned into a fusion-protein expression vector so that the 3CL pro is tagged with poly-Histidine-maltose binding protein (His 6 -MBP) at the N-terminus. A factor Xa cleavage sequence was present between 3CL pro and the tag for subsequent removal of the tag by factor Xa digestion. Expression of recombinant 3CL pro was induced by 0.4 mM of isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS during mid-log phase. The cells were grown at 37uC for 4 hours, followed by sonication in buffer A (20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) with 10mM imidazole. Soluble fraction was subjected to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and the recombinant protein was eluted by buffer A with a gradient of 10 to 300 mM imidazole. The His 6 -MBP tag was removed by factor Xa digestion in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4 overnight, and by IMAC. The protease was finally purified by G75 size exclusion column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Elution profile showed that the protease was a dimer in solution.
