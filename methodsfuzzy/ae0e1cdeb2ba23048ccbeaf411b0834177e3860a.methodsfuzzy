The study was performed at Department of Medical Microbiology in cooperation with Children's Department at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Norway. St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital is the regional hospital for Mid-Norway covering a population of 711 000. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from children under the age of 16 years who were admitted to the Children's Department with respiratory tract infections (RTI), from November 13, 2006 to December 31, 2012 (n = 4319). A control group (n = 361) was included prospectively during the same period. The controls were children admitted to elective surgery whose parents claimed that the child had no RTI symptoms during the last two weeks before specimen collection. Most controls had surgery for cryptorchidism, hernia repair or benign skin tumours, and none for ear, nose and throat surgery. 2819 of 4680 children were boys (60.2%), 58.7% in the patient group (n = 4319) and 78.7% in the control group (n = 361). A blood sample was collected from included children, when possible, and HAdV-positive children were tested for HAdV DNAviremia (n = 61). The NPAs were analyzed for HAdV, human bocavirus (HBoV), coronavirus (OC43, 229E and NL63), enterovirus, human metopneumovirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenzavirus type 1-4, parechovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. All were identified by using real-time PCR-assays (RT-PCR) based on TaqMan probes. An in-house RT-PCR was used for the detection of HAdV [15] . Viral nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μl sample using NucliSENS easyMAG extractor (BioMérieux) and eluted into 55 μL of buffer. Five μL of the eluate from each sample was transferred to 15 μL PCR mix and subjected to RT-PCR using CFX96 ™ Real-Time System (C1000 ™ Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad) [21] . The test results were recorded semi-quantitatively based on the cycle threshold value (C t -value) and grouped in two categories (high and low viral load). Based on a ROC analysis comparing C t -value with growth of HAdV in viral culture, the breakpoint was set to C t 30, corresponding to 10 6 copies/mL. PCR-products with C t -values below 40 were sequenced. The PCR-product (212 bp) was sequenced directly. Sequencing analysis was performed on an ABI 3130xl DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and the results were compared to known adenovirus sequences in GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Our typing method covers all the 51 available genotypes [22] . A quantification kit from Argene, ADENOVIRUS R-gene®, was used to quantify HAdV in the NPAs. Ten μL eluate from each sample was transferred to 15 μL amplification premix and subjected to RT-PCR using CFX96 ™ Real-Time System (C1000 ™ Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad). Amplification conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 40 s. The NPAs were collected in ordinary virus transport media with no antibiotics added. The samples were cultured for viruses in standard cell lines (HE, TMG-1, LLC-MK2). All samples were also cultured for bacteria using standard methods. Growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were recorded. Statistical analysis was done by Pearson Chi-square test for categorical data, and Student's t-test or Wilcoxon test for continuous data. To evaluate the association between HAdV and RTI, we used multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio (OR) is reported with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and the corresponding p-value as a measure of the strength of the association. All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 21 (Statistical Package of Social Science Inc.). Informed consent was obtained from the children's parents. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Mid-Norway.
