PSCNV genome was assembled based on contigs identified in two de novo transcriptomes of S. mediterranea (24) by comparison with genome of human coronavirus OC43 (KY014282.1) using tblastx (BLAST+ v2.2.29 (56)); termini of the assembly were completed by contigs from the two transcriptomes and planarian EST clones (26) , identified by similarity to the incomplete assembly using blastn, and 5'-RACE amplicons. Reads from planarian RNA-seq datasets: inhouse ones used to assemble the two transcriptomes, and the ones available from EBI ENA (57) , were mapped to the PSCNV genome sequence by either CLC Genomics Workbench 7, or Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 (58); read counts and coverage were estimated using SAMtools 0.1.19 (59) , genome sequence variants were called by BCFtools 1.4 (60) .
