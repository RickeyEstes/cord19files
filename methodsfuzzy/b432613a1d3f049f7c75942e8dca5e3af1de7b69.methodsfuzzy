Sequence generation. Nucleic acid extracts from PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV-infected patient samples were processed for reverse transcription and PCR amplification as previously described (15) . Briefly, nucleic acids were extracted from respiratory tract samples (Table 1 ) using automated extraction. The MERS-CoV RNA genome was converted to DNA and amplified by PCR in 15 overlapping amplicons. All amplicons for a sample were pooled and processed into Illumina libraries, and sequencing was performed with an Illumina MiSeq instrument to generate 2 million to 5 million 150-nucleotide paired-end reads per sample. The readsets were processed to remove primer and adapter sequences by using QUASR (30) and assembled into whole genomes using de novo assembly with SPAdes (31). The assembly fidelity was verified by monitoring intact open reading frames and through comparison with the genome prepared with reference-based assembly using SMALT (version 0.5.0) (32), with differences resolved by examining the raw read data. Phylogenetic methods. The 32 new genomes were aligned with the 33 published MERS-CoV genomes using MUSCLE (33) implemented in MEGA5 (34) . Bayesian inference of the phylogeny was performed with MrBayes version 3.2.1 (35) using a general-time reversible (GTR) substitution model with a 4-category discrete approximation of a gamma distribution (GTRϩ⌫ 4 ) to represent among-site heterogeneity. For inference of the time-resolved phylogeny, a second, subalignment of 42 genomes was generated by removing epidemiologically linked sequences. Sequences were considered linked if there was epidemiological evidence for contact between the patients that was also supported by the viral genetic data. If the observed number of mutations between the viral genomes fell below the 95% upper confidence interval of the Poisson cumulative distribution function, whose expected value is calculated from the evolutionary rate of the virus, the length of the genome, and the length of time between the samples, then only the index genome was retained. The main coding regions of the genome (encoding ORF1ab, S, E, M, and N) were concatenated, and a codon-partitioning model of evolution applied to the data set. Time-resolved phylogeny was inferred under a codonpartitioned HKYϩ⌫ 4 substitution model (Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano substitution model with a 4-category discrete approximation of a gamma distribution), with an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock and a GMRF Bayesian Skyride coalescent model, using a Bayesian Markovchain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) approach implemented in BEAST version 1.8.0 (36) . Ancestral geographical states were coestimated using the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (37) . Models employing reversible or nonreversible transition rate matrices were assessed by comparing the marginal likelihood estimator of the BMCMC chains, produced through the path-sampling approach implemented in BEAST (38) . The Bayesian skyline plot, estimating the change in effective population size through time, was generated from the BEAST BMCMC output files using Tracer version 1.5. Hypothetical ancestral sequences were determined using a likelihood-based ancestral reconstruction method imple-mented in HYPHY version 2.1.2 (39) . Nonsynonymous substitutions were determined using custom Python scripts. Codon positions under episodic selection (40) were determined using the mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) (40) or fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) (41) implemented in HYPHY.
