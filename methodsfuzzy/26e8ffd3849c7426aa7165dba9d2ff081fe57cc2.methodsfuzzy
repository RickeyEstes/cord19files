2.1. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Crawley) following the manufacturer's protocol for cultured cells. The RNA was eluted into 30 ml of RNasefree water. Genomic DNA was removed by digestion with RQDNase (Promega, Southampton) for 30 min at 37 8C. Reverse transcription was performed using 7 ml of RNA, 0.5 mg random hexamers (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont), 1 ml of ImPromII reverse transcriptase (Promega) and a MgCl 2 concentration of 3 mM in a total reaction volume of 20 ml. Total cDNA was quantified using the Quant-iT TM PicoGreen Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Paisley) which selectively detects dsDNA and DNA-RNA hybrids (cDNA) (Seville et al., 1996) . The assay was performed using a modification of a previously published protocol (Whelan et al., 2003) . Briefly the l DNA standard was diluted in a 5-fold dilution series from 1 mg/ml to 1.6 ng/ml. cDNA samples were tested in duplicate at a final dilution of 1:100. The fluorescence was measured using the SPECTRAmax M2 Plate reader (Molecular devices, Wokingham) with an excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm. The linear standard curve was constructed for the l DNA standard concentration vs. fluorescence units. The concentration of the cDNA was calculated from the linear equation after adjusting for the dilution.
