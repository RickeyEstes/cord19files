Virus stock tubes containing either 1 × 10 6 or 1.6 × 10 10 pfu/ml in 0.5 ml volumes and irradiated at specified doses using a JL Shepherd 484-R2 60 Cobalt ( 60 Co) source using a rotating stage to ensure even irradiation. Virus stocks were maintained on dry ice during the entire course of the irradiation process. Determination of viability was completed by plaque assay in duplicate samples.
