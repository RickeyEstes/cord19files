This was a longitudinal, observational, cohort study. All patients scheduled for heart surgery for CHD at our institution, a tertiary-care university hospital, between May 2013 and May 2014, were eligible. Patients were routinely assessed for respiratory symptoms the day before surgery. Since only patients without respiratory symptoms are operated, only these were included. The study was approved by the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ppedcard.2018.09.003 Received 18 July 2018; Received in revised form 19 September 2018; Accepted 20 September 2018 local institutional review board (#270.409) and signed informed consent was required for enrollment. The study consisted of collection of respiratory secretion samples, extraction of nucleic acids, PCR amplification, and microarray detection and reading. Collection of respiratory secretion samples was performed as follows: the day before surgery, three days after surgery, and seven days after surgery. All patients were tested at the three moments. Virus detection tests were done only after the study was finished; therefore, results were not timely available to affect medical decisions. We used an automated method (CLART PneumovirÂ®, Genomica, Madrid, Spain). This method can qualitatively detect up to 18 different respiratory viruses: RSV A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B, coronavirus 229E, metapneumovirus A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus B, rhinovirus, influenza A (including H1N1), B, and C, and bocavirus, with specificity of > 99% for all viruses. Demographic and surgical data, and outcomes were collected from medical charts. Surgical complexity was categorized using STAT (STS-EACTS Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Category) [7] . Patients with a first-sample (preoperative) positive result were considered home-infected if they were admitted for < 48 h, and hospital-infected if they were admitted for 48 h or more prior to sample collection. A hospital-acquired VRI was defined by a positive result any time after an initial (within 48 h from admission) negative result for viruses. Pulmonary complications such as congestion and atelectasis were diagnosed by agreement between respiratory therapists and at least three medical staff looking at chest radiographs in light of clinical data.
