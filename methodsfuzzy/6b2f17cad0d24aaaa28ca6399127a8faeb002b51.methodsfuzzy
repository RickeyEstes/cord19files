Experimental design. (1) Different diagnostic tools were established to demonstrate infection with Neospora and/or Toxoplasma in tissues obtained from clinical cases of bovine abortion. These tools were (a) in-vitro isolation of parasites from tissues, (b) histological demonstration of parasites or parasiteinduced lesions in tissues, (c) molecular identification of parasite DNA in tissues by PCR, and (d) detection of host immune responses to infection by IFAT, ELISA and direct agglutination (DA). (2) Serological tools suitable for mass screening were used to determine the seroprevalence of Neospora and of Toxoplasma by ELISA in Swiss dairy cattle and in animals of cow-calf farms. Parasites. An original isolate of N. caninum (NC-1 strain [3] ) was obtained from Dr J.P. Dubey, USDA, Beltsville, MD, U.S.A. Parasites were grown in Vero cells as described previously [22, 191. All reagents for cultivation were obtained from Gibco-BRL. Tachyzoites were separated from host cells by passing the trypsinised cells through a 23gauge needle, followed by purification on Sephadex G-25M (PD-IO@ columns, Pharmacia). Purified parasites were stored as pellets at -80°C until required. Diagnostic in-vitro isolation of parasites. For invitro isolation of parasites from host tissue (foetal brain, heart, maternal placenta), 20ml of homogenised tissue of each organ was incubated with 50ml trypsin at 37°C for 1 h. The samples were subsequently washed several times with sterile PBS (pH 7.2) by centrifugation at 1200g for 10min at 4°C until the supematant was translucent. After discarding the supematant, 10 ml of each pellet was incubated on a 24h-old Vero cell monolayer in a 25cm3 tissue culture flask in 10 ml RPM1 1640 containing 10% FCS and I % amphotericin B. The cultures were incubated at 37°C and the medium replaced 12-16 h after inoculation. The cell cultures were monitored microscopically, and the cultivation medium was exchanged daily. Fourteen days after inoculation, the cultures were considered to be "negative" for Neospora growth unless parasites were detected microscopically [23]. PCR. Further processing of diagnostic tissue samples from brain, musculature and maternal placenta for PCR were carried out as described previously 1211, with the exception that a High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Boehringer, Mannheim) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the preparation of DNA. Molecular diagnosis by Neospora-or Toxoplasma-specific PCR and identification of amplification products were also according to our previous description [2 1 J. Putative false-negative results, which may have been caused by inhibitory compounds in the PCR tests, were excluded by performing a parallel inhibition control reaction (data not shown) on the samples in the presence of N, caninum or T. gondii DNA equivalents from about five parasites per reaction (exact performance data in [2 11 ). Histological und immuno-histological examinations, One portion of each tissue sample obtained at nec-ropsy was fixed in 4% formalin ti pm for routine paraffin embedding. P~~~~ sections of 3-4 pm thickness were rnouu$ed on poly-L-lysin precoated glass shdes, depar&Wed in xylene and stained with H gi E or for immunohistology, slides were rehydrated in descending concentrations of methanol, rinsed in H@, and non-specific binding sites were biooked with PBS containing 0.03% Tween and 3% BSA (Fluka AG) (designated PBS-Tween-BSA) for 1 h. Slides were then incubated with the respective rabbit hyperimmune sera [22] for 1 h at 37°C The anti-N. cuninum and the anti-T. go~i~~~~ rabbit sera, and the respective pre-sera (as controls) were diluted 1:200 in PBS-Tween-BSA, The slides were washed in P3S to reaulve unbound antibodies and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37°C with FITC-conjugated goat+anti-rabbit IgG (The Binding Site, Birmingham, U.K.) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS-Tween-BSA. The preparations were washed three times for Smin in PBS, mounted in Fluoprep (BioMerieux Suisse S.A.) and finally examined using a Leitz Laborlux S fluoreseonce microscope. The specificity of the two hyperimmune sera was initially confirmed by the absence of immunoreactivity on heterologous T. gondii or N. caninum tachyzoites, respectively 1221. Serological assays. For the NeosprPra-IFAT, Neospora tachyzoites were obtained from cell cultures as described above and subsequently coated onto 12-spot IFAT glass shdes and air dried. Zmmediately after drying, the slides were fix& in acetone and stored at -20X For the purposes of the investigation, diagnostic bovine sera were dih&d 1:&l in sterile PBS with subsequent two-fold titration. Positive and negative control sera were eaeb diluted at 1:40 and 1:80. The positive control serum was obtained from a pregnant cow e~~~ntally infected with live N. caninum taehyzo&es (Her&rich et al., unpublished) according to the procedure described by others [9}. InfeGtion in this cow was proven by PCR-based detection of N~w+w-DNA in the foetal brain using the same technique as described previously for mice 1211. The mgative control serum was obtained from the same cow (first gestation) prior to experimental iztfation. The absence of antibodies against Neospora and Toxo-pZusma in the negative control sera was confirmed using the same specific tests as employed subsequent to infection. The diluted test and control sera were incubated on the slides for 30 min at 37°C in a moist chamber. The slides were subsequently washed three times with PBS, and the last washing step was followed by a rinse in distilled water. The slides were then incubated for 30min at 37°C in a moist chamber with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal mouse-anti-bovine IgG antibody (Sigma Immunochemicals, Clone BG-18) at a dilution of 1:300 in PBS. After washing the slides twice in PBS for 5min, they were mounted in FluoPrep (Bio-Merieux) and examined on a Leitz Laborlux S fluorescence microscope. In the current study, infection with N. caninum was identified when foetal antibody titres at a dilution of >, l/80 were detected. For cows, the antibody-binding activity against Neospora was determined to be "positive" at a serum dilution of 2 1: 160. For ELISA, the following procedures were used. Neospora tachyzoites obtained and purified from in-vitro cultures as described above were washed in sterile PBS. The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 0.01% NaN, and homogenised. Subsequent treatment by three freezing-thawing cycles (-50"/+ 37°C) and final processing by ultrasonication (3 x 20 s at 65 W) at 1°C yielded the extract solution. The solution was sedimented at 10 OOOg at 4°C for 30 min. The soluble supernatant was used as somatic ELISA-antigen (hereinafter referred to as Neospora-SA-ELISA) or stored at -80°C until use. Coating Dynatech polystyrene plates was done at a concentration of 5 pg protein per ml carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4°C for 12 h. For the detection of antibodies against T. gondii, ELISA plates were coated in a similar manner with 1 ,ug protein per ml of an affinity purified P30 surface antigen (SR2B, Arville, France, cat. No. TXP30B), hereinafter referred to as Toxoplusma-P30-ELISA. All protein concentrations were assessed by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine albumin as the standard. Neospora-and Toxoplasma-ELISA plates were subsequently processed as described for other ELISAs performed in our laboratories [24] . In brief, the washing, blocking and serum dilution solution was PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). The test and control sera were diluted 1: 100 in PBS-Tween. Serum incubations were for 2 h at 37°C. The second antibody was an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbitanti-bovine antibody (Sigma Immmunochemicals, cat. No. A 0705) diluted at 1:500 in PBS-Tween. The conjugate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Antibody reactivity was detected by adding 4-nitrophenylphosphate at a concentration of 1 mgml-' 0.1 M-diethanolamine, pH 9.8. The reaction was stopped after 15 min with 3 N-NaOH, and absorbance values were read at A405nm using a Dynatech MR7000 reader coupled to a Macintosh Performa 6300 computer with Biocalc@ software (Dynatech). Positive and negative control sera for the Neospora-SA-ELISA were the same as used for the IFAT. For the Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA, the same negative control serum was used as for the Neospora serology. The Toxoplasma-positive control serum was a gift from Dr David Buxton (Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, U.K.). The basic test parameters for the Neospora and Toxoplasma antigens were established by investigating 50 sera of animals (no history of abortion; anamnestic lack of clinical or epidemiological signs indicative for neosporosis or toxoplasmosis) negative in Neospora-IFAT and Toxoplasma-DA (see below) using the respective ELISA mean value+4 SD. as the cut-off value. Any value higher than this cut-off value was considered to be "positive"; lower values were considered as "negative". Threshold values discriminating between diagnostically positive and negative reactions were thus determined for both antigens listed above. Reproducibility of ELISA results was monitored by including a low reactive bovine control serum in triplicate, this in addition to the negative and positive standard sera, both also tested in triplicate. In addition to the tests listed above, antibody concentration against T. gondii was determined in parallel by the commercially available agglutination test Toxo-Screen DA (BioMCrieux). Test performance was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions, which corresponds to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) procedure described elsewhere [14] . Tissue collection. Organs and blood samples from 83 naturally aborted foetuses (all originating from different farms in Switzerland) were collected during 1993-1994 and were examined pathologically at the Institute of Veterinary Pathology of the University of Zurich, using conventional macroscopic and histopathologic examination techniques. At the same institute, investigation for the presence of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) by immunohistochemistry (LSAB: labelled Streptavidin-Biotin) was performed. Other conventional microbiological investigations representing the spectrum of micro-organisms recommended in the survey programmes of Swiss veterinary health offices (Rotavirus, IBR/IPV, Listeria, Coxiella, Brucella, Actinomyces) were done in routine diagnostic laboratories. At necropsy, the following samples were ob++ned from the foetuses and processed separately for parasitological analyses: (i) a foetalheart blood or body-cavity fluid sample; (ii) the skull was opened under aseptic conditions and a sample of the cerebrum was transferred into a sterile 50-ml Falcon tube prefilled with 20ml sterile PBS containing 200 U ml-' of penicillin, 200 pg mll ' streptomycin and 0.5 (ug ml-' fungizone; (iii) heart tissue was processed as described above for brain tissue; (iv) placental tissue was obtained in 32 cases; (v) blood samples were collected from 12 cows after abortion. Classical histopathological examinations of the organs, in particular the foetal brain and the maternal placenta, were performed at the Institute of Veterinary Pathology, University of Zurich. Precolostral-IgG determination was carried out by using a radioimmunodiffusion IgG-Determinationkit (RID-Kit; The Binding Site), results being expressed in mg IgG per litre. Tissue samples not processed for histological, immunological or molecular diagnosis were stored at -80°C. Bovine sera. A total of 1689 bovine sera (adult cows) from 113 dairy farms collected for a different project [25] were subsequently investigated in the present study. The animals and farms had been selected as representative of the Swiss dairy cattle population in 1994. Baseline information on health and fertility problems was available for all farms. The samples were investigated for the presence of antibodies against Neospora sp. and T, gondii using the respective ELISA (see above). Sera from 85 dams and from 102 correspomiing o&p&g c&es were obtained from 36 different cow-&f farms. The age of the calves at the time of Wood-sample colle&ion was between 8 and 10 months [26] .
