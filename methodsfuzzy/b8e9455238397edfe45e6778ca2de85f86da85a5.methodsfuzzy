Morbidity due to M. bovis was the major outcome of interest and was therefore used to calculate sample size. At the time the study was initiated, health records indicated that the incidence of respiratory disease, otitis media and/or arthritis in the study herds was at least 15%. We hypothesized that a reduction in incidence to 5% would be biologically and economically significant. Using these values together with 95% confidence and 80% power, and taking into consideration an attrition rate of approximately 10%, the calculated sample size was 180 calves per group. For the secondary outcomes of interest from a subset of calves in Herds A and B, we hypothesized that a reduction in the nasal colonization rate from 50% to 20% would be biologically significant. Using these values together with the parameters outlined above, the calculated sample size was 50 calves per group. Calves were excluded from analyses if clinical signs referable to other organ systems occurred concurrently with respiratory disease, otitis media or arthritis, with the exception of diarrhea without fever of less than 7 days duration. Incidence risk rates were calculated as the number of calves treated for the disease of interest divided by the initial number of calves less half the calves that died during the study for reasons other than the disease of interest. Categorical outcome variables (incidence of clinical disease [%], incidence of mortality [%], incidence of missed dose of vaccine/placebo [%], cumulative risk of nasal colonization [%]), were compared among groups using chi-square tests; data were analyzed for effects of herd and passive transfer status by Stratified Mantel-Haenszel analysis. When the expected count in any cell was less than 5, Fisher's exact test was used. Quantitative outcome variables (post-colostral total serum protein concentrations [g/dl], age at first treatment for clinical disease [days], average daily weight gain from birth to 90 days of age [kg/day]) were compared among groups using independent sample t-tests, and ELISA data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The relationships between average daily weight gain and serological data (post-colostral ELISA data, week 12 ELISA data) were examined using Pearson correlation analyses. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using commercial statistical software (SPSS 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
