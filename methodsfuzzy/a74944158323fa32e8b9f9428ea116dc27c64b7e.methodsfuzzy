Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at King Abdullah Medical International Research Centre, National Guard Health affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2014. The study target population was current residents of Saudi Arabia, regardless of their nationality. An English questionnaire was designed and translated to Arabic. The Arabic version was pretested on students of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. The questionnaire was uploaded as a Google document and distributed to the Twitter accounts of Saudi celebrities who have more than 1 million followers. The celebrities included writers, politicians, TV presenters, sports personnel, and religious leaders. The celebrities were contacted via email, and nearly all of them agreed to post the survey link. Additionally, they encouraged their followers to participate. The questionnaire included a section on demographic and socioeconomic factors. However, personal information of the participants, such as names and full addresses, was not gathered, making the data anonymous. Another section of the survey covered general awareness of the infection and protective measures, while the final section addressed knowledge of the disease epidemiology. Because there were no previous studies in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS awareness among the general population, a conservative choice of 50% awareness was used to determine the sample size. Consequently, a sample of 1066 subjects was needed to calculate a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 3%. Every day, 200 questionnaires were selected randomly and added to the dataset. This systematic approach was followed until the intended number was reached. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 20). Descriptive statistics were used to assess the baseline demographics and socioeconomic factors. A total score of awareness/knowledge was calculated as the percentage of most acceptable answers. One-way ANOVA and two-independent sample ttest were used to examine the differences in the total score between different categories of baseline characteristics.
