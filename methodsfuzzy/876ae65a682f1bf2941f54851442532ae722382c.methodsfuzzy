In order to estimate the robustness of tree topology, Qi et al [34] proposed a bootstrap method by resampling on the genes or translated proteins on the genome (this method was also used by Wang et al [36] ). Wu et al [2] proposed a modified bootstrap method by resampling the frequencies of all K-mers. The method of Qi et al. [34] is not applicable to the virus genomes as almost all virus genomes have only a few genes and it is statistically meaningless to resample such a small number of genes. So we use the modified bootstrap method proposed by Wu et al [2] which works as follows. A table is first constructed with each row being the composition vector representing a genome and each column representing the frequencies of a fixed K-mer in different genomes. The bootstrap is applied to the columns of the table except those are redrawn [2] . Thus, the resampled table has fewer columns but each K-mer maintains the same frequency as in the original table. Because it is allowed that some positions could be redrawn more than once in the traditional bootstrap analyses with sequence alignment [53] , we believe it is more reasonable to allow that some columns to be redrawn more than once, giving the resampled table with the same number of columns as the original table in the modified bootstrap method. Then a distance matrix can be obtained based on the resampled table.
