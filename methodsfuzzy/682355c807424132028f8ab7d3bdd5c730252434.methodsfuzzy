Cells and virus. The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md). The viral inocula were propagated on L-2 murine fibroblast cells (Rothfels et u& 1959) . Five-or ten-dayold rats received approximately 5 X 10' PFU of JHM in a 20-4 intracerebral (ic) inoculation. Preparation of tissue. Rat pups were killed by decapitation. The calvarium was removed and the brain was exposed. The vertebral column was sectioned longitudinally and the spinal cord was removed. The following samples were processed for microscopic examination: sagittal and coronal sections of cerebrum, sagittal sections of mesencephalon, and representative sagittal sections of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. All histopathology samples were fixed overnight by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 pm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remainder of the tissue, used to isolate infectedcell RNA, was quick frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70". Isolation of RNA. Frozen samples were placed in a cold solution of 7.6 M guanidine-HCl: 2.0 M KAc (19:1, v/v), and 1% antifoam C. The tissue was quickly dispersed with a Virtis homogenizer and glass dounced on ice. The procedure of Strohman et al. (1977) as modified by Dr. G. Mackie (Department of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario) was used to isolate the cellular and viral RNA (see Cheley et al, 1981a for details of procedure). In addition, cellular and viral RNA was isolated by the same procedure from uninfected and JHM-infected L-2 cell monolayers. Preparation of cvmplementarg DNA. Murine hepatitis virus-specific 32P-labeled complementary DNA(r2P]cDNA), sp act of 2-4 X lo* cpm/pg, was prepared from infected-cell RNA as described by Cheley et aL (1981a) . Before use [32P]cDNA was annealed with uninfected L-2 cell RNA and virus-specific sequences were selected on an hydroxylapatite column (Cheley et aZ., 1981a) . The selected probe did not anneal with uninfected cell RNA (Fig. 1) . RNA transfer and hybridization kinetic analysis. The RNA samples were denatured with glyoxal, subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, and transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl (DBM) paper. The RNA was then hybridized with virus-specific [%P] cDNA (McMaster and Carmichael, 1977; Alwine et aL, 1977) FIG. 1. RNA transfer analysis of RNA extracted from JHM virus-infected Wistar Furth CNS tissue or from JHM-infected L-2 cells. RNA was extracted either from brain or spinal cord samples from Wistar Furth rats that were inoculated intracerebrally 10 days after birth with JHM virus or from JHMinfected tissue culture (L-2) cells. The RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel (4OV, 18 hr). The RNA was then transferred to DBM paper and annealed to a murine hepatitis virus-specific =P-labeled cDNA. Virus specific RNA was visualized by autoradiography. On the vertical axis the numbers and lines designated JHM-specific RNA species that were present in JHM-infected tissue culture (L-2) cells (Lai et aL, 1981; Spaan et aL, 1981; Leibowitz et aL, 1981; Cheley et a& 1981a, b) . The letters and arrows designate JHM-specific RNA species that were not present as major viral species in JHM-infected L-2 cells (Lai et aL, 1981; Spaan et a& 1981; Leibowitz et al, 1981; Cheley et aL, 1981a, b) . RNA species "a" is the 2.1-2.4 X 106-Da species referred to in the text. strom and Shank, 1978) . The hybridization kinetic analysis was performed as previously described (Cheley et aL, 1981a) .
