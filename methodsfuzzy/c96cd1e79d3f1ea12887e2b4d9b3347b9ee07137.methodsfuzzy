Experimental animals and materials. A total of 80 healthy male SPF grade mice aged 6 weeks and weighing 25.1±5.53 g were selected. All the mice were purchased from the animal experiment center of Zhejiang province, with the production license of SCXK (Zhejiang) 2011-0166. The mice were fed in a plastic box with bedding material on a solid bottom with the temperature of 22˚C and the relative humidity between 50 and 65%, 12 h daynight rhythm was normal, and they were free to eat and drink. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Central Hospital of Zibo (Zibo, China). The CVB3 virus was purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. at a titer of 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) /0.1 ml. Mg-132 was purchased from Calbiochem Inc. at a concentration of 0.75 mg/kg. Grouping and modeling. Twenty mice were randomly selected as the blank group, and they were kept in routine feeding without any intervention. The remaining 60 mice were then randomly divided into the VMC, MG-132 and control group, each containing 20 mice. Mice in the control group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml PBS (phosphate buffersaline) at 0.1 mmol/l, mice in the VMC and MG-132 group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml diluent of CVB3 at 100 TCID50/0.1 ml, and mice in the MG-132 group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.75 mg/kg MG-132 the day after the injection of the CVB3 virus. They were continuously injected for 7 days. Mortality rates of each group were recorded and compared on day 8 of modeling, and then peripheral blood and heart samples of the remaining mice were taken for subsequent detection. Pathological examination. Hearts of mice were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and dehydrated routinely, then embedded with paraffin and sectioned. After sectioning, the pathological changes of mouse myocardial tissues were observed under light microscope (Olympus Corp.) and the pathological score of the myocardial tissues was evaluated. The judgement scores were as follows: 1 point, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was <25%, 2 points, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was between 25 and 50%, 3 points, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was between 51 and 75%, 4 points, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was >75%. Expression levels of mRNA in TNF-α and TGF-β1 detected by RT-qPCR. First, the TRIzol reagent (purchased from Applide Invitrogen, Inc.) was added into the myocardial tissue of mice to extract the total RNA in the blood, and the concentration and quality of total RNA were detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometer (purchased from Shanghai Yuanxi Instrument Co., Ltd.). Total RNA (2 µl) was used to compound cDNA in strict accordance with the instructions of minScript reverse transcription kit (Takara Bio, Inc.). Synthetic cDNA (2 µl) was used for qPCR (RT-qPCR kit was purchased from Takara). Total RNA (2 μl) was added to a microcentrifuge tube, then 11 μl of DEPC H 2 O was added. A total of 12-18 μl of 10 μM Oligo (dT) was added, mixed and heated at 70˚C for 10 min. After ice bath for 1 min, 2 μl 10X PCR buffer, 2 μl 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 μl 10 mM dNTP mix and 2 μl 0.1 M DTT were added, mixed and incubated for 3 min at 42˚C. A total of 1 μl of Superscript II was added, incubated at 42˚C for 30 min, and heated at 70˚C for 10 min. Ice bath was followed for 5 min. The qPCR reaction system was: 2 µl reverse transcription product, 0.5 µl upstream primer, 0.5 µl downstream primer, 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix 10 µl, and sterilized and deionized water complemented to 20 µl. Reaction conditions were: 95˚C for 2 min, 95˚C for 50 sec, 60˚C for 45 sec, extension at 72˚C for 30 sec, and for a total of 40 cycles. The expression levels of TNF-α mRNA and TGF-β1 mRNA were detected with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the internal reference. The primer sequences are shown in Table I (the primers were synthesized and designed by Shanghai Gemma Company), and the experiment was repeated 3 times. The result was analyzed with 2 ΔΔ-Cq method (12) .
