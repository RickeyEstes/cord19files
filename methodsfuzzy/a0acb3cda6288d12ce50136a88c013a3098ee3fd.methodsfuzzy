The animal food manufacturing portion of the experiments was conducted at the Kansas State University Cargill Food Safety Research Center (FSRC; Manhattan, KS), a 3-story biosafety level 2 biocontainment laboratory and animal food manufacturing facility containing pilot scale animal food manufacturing equipment. Procedures were approved by the Kansas State University Institutional Biosafety Committee (Approval No. 929.3). All manufacturing procedures were replicated three times. Decontamination occurred before and after each replicate to establish baseline and confirmed negative by the absence of PEDV RNA on animal foodcontact and non-food contact surfaces as measured by qPCR as previously described [8] . The portion of the experiment evaluating infectivity in animals was conducted at Iowa State University. Procedures were approved by the Iowa State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval No. 1-16-8168-S). 2013 cell passage 8 was used to inoculate food in this study. The stock virus titer contained 4.5 x 10 6 TCID 50 /ml, with a corresponding qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of 11. The virus was divided into three 500 ml aliquots that were stored at -80˚C, with one aliquot used per replication. For each replication, an aliquot was thawed overnight at 4˚C, added to 4.5 kg of animal food using mixing procedures previously established [10] to form the animal food inoculum.
