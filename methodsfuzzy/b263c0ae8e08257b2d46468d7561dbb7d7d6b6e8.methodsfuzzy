Stool samples were diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a 10% suspension. Aliquots of 180 μL of MagNA Pure bacteria lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and 20 μL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were added to 190 μL of stool suspension. NP swabs were collected using flocked-tip swabs and transported to the laboratory in the Copan universal transport medium (UTM-RT) system (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). Before the extraction procedure, 5 μL of Equine herpesvirus 1 and 5 μL of Equine arthritis virus isolates were added to all samples. Specific target sequences of these viruses were subsequently amplified in separate real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) as an internal control to ensure that negative results were not caused by poor nucleic acid extraction or inhibition of the RT-PCR assay [15, 16] . The initial volume used for extracting total nucleic acids was 400 μL of stool suspension, 190 μL of vigorously vortexed NP swab medium and 190 μL of whole blood samples. Nucleic acids were extracted using total nucleic acid isolation kits on a MagNa Pure Compact instrument (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coronaviruses including HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 were detected in stool samples, NP swabs and whole blood samples by molecular methods using primers and probes as described by Kuypers et al. [17] . For amplification of 85-100 bp fragments of the polymerase 1b gene of coronaviruses, a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was used in a StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 5 μL of total nucleic acid was added to 15 μL of reaction mixture including 2 × Reaction Mix, SuperScript W III RT/Platinum W Taq Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an additional 6 mM MgSO 4 . The cycling conditions were as follows: 20 min at 50°C, 2 min at 95°C and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 45 s at 60°C. All NP swabs and stool samples in which HCoVs were established were also tested for the presence of other viruses. In NP swabs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (Flu A-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV 1-3), metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoVs), adenovirus (AdV) and rhinovirus (hRV) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] were searched for by real-time RT-PCR. Stool samples were tested for the presence of HBoVs and AdV using molecular methods as described previously [22, 23] , and for other gastroenteric viruses by electron microscopy (EM). The presence of norovirus genogroups I and II and astrovirus was ascertained by real-time RT-PCR [25, 26] , while group A rotavirus and adenovirus type 40/41 were detected by antigen-ELISA Premier Rotaclone and Premier Adenoclone (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH).
