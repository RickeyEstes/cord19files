Box 1 summarizes the key features of the methods and the minimum quality control requirements. With slight modifications in some instances, the ISO methods have been widely used to screen naturally contaminated sample matrices [46, 47] , and several companies also offer commercial kits based on RTqPCR assays closely related to the one used in the ISO validation. However, despite the wide acceptance of the standardized method and its variations among research labs, most studies do not report the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the assay and this complicates comparisons and drawing of general conclusions. Regarding the process control virus, the use of Mengo virus strain MCo or murine norovirus (MNV) is widespread in most studies [48] . Due to the complexity of food matrices, an extraction efficiency above 1% is considered satisfactory. An assay multiplexing HAV, NoV GI, NoV GII and Mengo virus as a process control was optimized and validated on naturally contaminated bivalve mollusks and water samples [49 ] . The quadruplex assay fulfills the ISO requirements, showing in the worst-case scenario an average sensitivity loss of 0.4 logs. Most virus concentration protocols are time-consuming and laborious, and the great variety of food matrices makes selection of a single method not straightforward. For berries, baby spinaches, lettuce and sliced tomatoes for example, alternative methods of extraction in which RNAs are directly extracted from food have shown good performance and shorter times [50, 51] . However, all alternative methods must be validated versus the ISO standard. Special case: in-house protocols to detect HEV in pork products HEV contamination of meat products is not only restricted to the product surface and hence virus extraction requires other experimental approaches. Although not standardized yet, there are several methods available for detection of HEV in meat and meat products that have been applied to screen retail products in several countries, finding a broad distribution in most cases [41, 52, 53] . There is the need for an ISO standard for HEV detection in food products.
