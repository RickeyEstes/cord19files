Ever since the implementation of PGYD in 2010, this research had taken the method of secondary data analyses as the research method. From the website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, we obtained the name lists of dental training institutions qualified for the PGYD. The project span proposed in 2010 was 2 years. However, the qualified and passed projects were announced in 2011. Therefore, only one year was left to carry out for the passed year-2010 projects and they needed a supplementary application for one more year. Besides, from the Joint Committee of Taiwan's website, we found the qualified name lists in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 with the project span of 2 years in a row. These data revealed the types of project (single system or collaborating institution), the title of the medical institutions (the name of the certain hospital or dental clinic), the code name of the medical institution, the types of the institutions (main or collaborating), and the administrative region in Taiwan. Because in some years the administrative regions were not shown in the name list, this study utilized the Medical Institution Inquiry System and the name code to search and obtain the basic information of the registered medical institution so that the administrative region can be identified. The modes for the hospitals to join the PGYD could be categorized in 3 modes: (1) single training institution (also known as the main training institution); (2) the main training institution in the collaborating training group; and (3) the collaborating institution in the joint training group. There were also 3 modes of participation for the clinics to join the training program: (1) single training institution (also known as the main training institution); (2) the main training institution in the collaborating training group; and (3) the collaborating institution in the joint training group. The responsibility of the main training institution was to be in charge of the coordination and communication with all the institutions that implemented and collaborated in the program and took a leading role. Thus, 6 different types of dental training institution were found: (1) hospital as the single training institution, (2) clinic as the single training institution, (3) hospital as the main training institution in the joint training group, (4) clinic as the main training institution in the joint training group, (5) hospital as the collaborating institution in the joint training group; and (6) clinic as the collaborating institution in the joint training group. The numbers of the 6 different types of dental training institution were collected and calculated as the basic information for analyses. By the analyses of 5-year data (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 , and 2018), we tried to find out the shift of mode of participation of PYGD in Taiwan from 2010 to 2018. If we divided the whole Taiwan's administrative regions based on the geography axis: northern, central, southern, and eastern into 4 regions, we calculated respectively the numbers of main training institutions and collaborating institutions in each of different administrative regions across Taiwan. We could use the above numbers to compare the change of the geographical distribution of the PGYD training institutions year by year and the differences of the geographical distribution of the main training institution versus the collaborating training institutions. In this study, Pearson's chi-square analyses were used to determine whether the number of projects or institutions significantly increased or decreased in a specific year and the adjusted residual (AR) values were calculated. If the AR value was greater than or equal to 2, it meant that the number of projects or institutions significantly increased in that specific year and if the AR value was less than or equal to Ã€2, it meant that the number of projects or institutions significantly decreased in that specific year.
