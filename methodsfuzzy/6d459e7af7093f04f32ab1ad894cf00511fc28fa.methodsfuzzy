The US airlines industry made significant adjustments between 1985 and 2006. Some are easily visible while others are not. For example, Fig. 1 The expansion in aircraft fleet structure, on the other hand, has been largely steady. Other than USAir, all legacy carriers have expanded, on average, their aircraft fleet holding (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, aircraft fleet expansion by the legacy carriers was accompanied by a decline in the number of FTEs while aircraft fleet expansion at the LCCs was accompanied with the increase in employment. This provides the first sign that one side of the sector, namely legacy carriers, was undergoing structurally different changes enhancing productivity than the LCCs. These changes are even more pronounced when changes in the wage and benefits are taken into account. For example, average pay per FTEs for LCCs has increased over 48% from 2000 level to 2006 while it registered only 16% increase for legacy carriers during the same time periods. Many other changes are less visible and often less noticed. For example, re-optimized schedule changes (Jiang and Barnhart, 2006) , use of over-water and Q routes (Bhadra and Hogan, 2008) , restructuring contracts including outsourcing routes to regional service carriers (RJs) (Hogan et al., 2007) , and de-peaking or dehubbing (Franke, 2003) have been noted as means for restructuring services and cost. In addition, rationalized gasoline use by reducing extra weight (e.g. removing minimal accessories including reading materials and pillows, cleaning toilet in between segment stops, etc.) has also been noted in the press and elsewhere. Faced with industry, market and regulatory rigidities creating obstacles for industry consolidation, US airlines have had very little choice but to enhance productivities at every level of resource use. Many of these restructuring steps have been tremendously effective in enhancing efficiency. In production economics literature (see Varian (1999) for a basic discussion), efficiencies have been examined in two ways: technical and allocative. A firm is said to be allocatively efficient when the price it receives in the market place is equal to marginal costs associated with producing the extra unit of service. Technical efficiencies, on the other hand, evaluate a firm's ability to produce maximum level/s of output (either single or multiple output) given the levels of input(s). The outputoriented approach to technical efficiency, first developed by Charnes et al. (1978) (CCR) and later modified by Banker et al. (1984) (BCC), captures the underlying production technology and productivity implications under constant returns to scale (CCR) and variable returns to scale (BCC). Alternatively, a firm can minimize the use of resources in order to produce a given level of output (i.e. input-oriented approach). Compared to the output-oriented method, input-oriented technical efficiency too captures both constant and variable returns to scale. While technical efficiencies relate primarily to the physical relationship underlying the production of goods and services, allocative efficiency refers to firm's allocation decisions faced with market prices for inputs and outputs. Thus, physical inputs and outputs are considered key to understanding technical efficiencies, while input prices and output prices are key to understanding allocative efficiency. Here the focus is on technical efficiency. In panel A of Fig. 3 , a basic output-oriented CCR model is presented for one-output and one-input case as an example. The input-output relationship of a firm or so called decision-making unit (DMU) in DEA is given. Thus, DMU 1 is observed to produce at point A by using a given amount of input (horizontal axis) to produce a certain amount of output (corresponding point in vertical axis). Other DMU's input-output relationships are given by points B, C, D, and E. Given these observations on the input used and output produced, one can derive the underlying production technology for the industry without any knowledge of the true production function, a substantial benefit leading to DEA evolution. In order to uncover the production function, let us draw a series of straight lines tangent to the observed relationships of DMUs. Straight lines touching the observed relationships at B and E represent the inputoutput relationships of DMU 2 and DMU 5 , respectively. Notice that they are also observed upper bounds of the production technology representing the DMUs' input-output relationships. This is because a line tangent to B when shifted downward parallel to point A reduces output, but does not reduce correspondingly, the level of input. Thus, DMU 1 must be technically inefficient in comparison to DMU 2 . The same is true for point E. By drawing such lines and finding where the maximum output level is produced (frontier) and producible (observed), the technical efficiency frontier of the DMUs is drawn. A ratio of producible level of output over produced level of output provides a measure or index of technical inefficiency. For measuring relative efficiencies of a homogeneous set of DMUs for multi-input/multi-output frontier, the efficiency index can be constructed by taking the ratio of weighted sum of outputs over weighted sum of inputs. By construction, the lower bound of the index is restricted to be 1, representing technical efficiency while index value greater than unity indicates technical inefficiency. This measure of technical inefficiency is used for the empirical analysis. Contrary to output-orientation of Panel A of the Fig. 3 , Panel B provides the input-oriented technical efficiency frontier for the DMUs. The basic analytical framework with the assumption of constant return to scale can be formalized for activities by establishing the observed input-output relationships. Under output maximization (whose objective is to maximize output while keeping the same level of inputs or using less), the model can be described as: (1) where X j is the input for DMU j , Y j is the corresponding output, l j are the weights of DMU j and q is the shrinking or slack factor by which output can be increased. In other words, Eq. (1) states that DMU j is said to be efficient if no other input combinations (from the observed data) can produce more output than Y j . If there are other input combinations that can produce more output than y j , then, DMU j is termed as efficient in relation to other observed DMUs. Thus, the solution to the above linear programming (LP) problem finds the increment in levels of output given the observed level of inputs. A more generalized case of multiple output and input can be formalized by formulating an LP problem as: .; m; P n j ¼ 1 y rj l j À s þ r ¼ fy ro r ¼ 1; 2; .; s; l j ! 0 j ¼ 1; 2; .; n: (2) where x ij is required to produce y rj and is the input, r is the output and j is the DMU unit. Furthermore, it is necessary that both input and output quantities meet strong positive and quasi-positive conditions as x ij > 0 and y rj ! 0. The s i À and s i þ are variables to account for any slackness in input use while 3 > 0 is a non-Archimedean element defined to be smaller than any positive real number. The solution to the LP problem stated in Eq.
