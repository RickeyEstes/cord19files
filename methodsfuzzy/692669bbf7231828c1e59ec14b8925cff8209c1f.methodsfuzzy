By 3' terminal labelling of 5 ng of viral RNA, all 11 rotavirus segments were detected after autoradiographic exposure for 16 h (Fig. la) . The amount of RNA could be reduced to 1 ng if the exposure time was extended to 3--4 days (data not shown). A comparable gel stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. lb) showed that the smallest amount of RNA which gave a complete pattern was 1 ~g, i.e. there was a 1000-fold difference in sensitivity between the two methods.
