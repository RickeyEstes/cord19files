The field study had a single treatment arm, without a placebo control group, and was limited to cats with non-effusive or dry FIP. Only cats in the United States and Canada were accepted. Cats were diagnosed and treated by their primary care veterinarians in conjunction with, in many cases, veterinary specialists. The veterinarians' usual laboratories performed diagnostic tests. The study measured survival times from the start of PI treatment to death or euthanasia in terminal condition. The survival data from this study were compared to the historic data from a number of published articles. The study included cats of all signalments with clinical signs that represented the clinical spectrum of dry form FIP and were accepted and treated regardless of the severity of the disease or current treatments. Addition of appetite stimulants, antiemetics, antibiotics, vitamins, or special diets was not prohibited in our study, but the protocol advised against the use of corticosteroids because they cause immunosuppression. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the University of Tennessee Office of Laboratory Animal Care. The protocol was approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol #1946.
