Unadjusted matched odds ratios calculated from conditional logistic regression methods (6) are summarized in Tables 1 to 4 . A multivariate conditional logistic regression was fitted using a forward-stepwise procedure with all variables that were marginally significant (p < 0.10) in the unadjusted analyses as candidates for selection. Matched odds ratios and their exact 95% confidence intervals were derived. LogXact for Windows version 4.1 was used for all calculations (7) .
