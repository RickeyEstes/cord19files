Twelve healthy, nonsmoking men were recruited for the study. Subject mean demographics were as follows: age was 23.5 AE 1.6 years, height was 181 AE 6 cm, weight was 81.8 AE 8.1 kg, and body mass index was 24.9 AE 2.3 kg/m 2 . The study was approved by the NIOSH Institutional Review Board, and all subjects provided written and verbal consent. Prior to exercising, subjects were first instrumented with a 4,600 Precision rectal thermistor (YSI Temperature, Dayton, OH) for core temperature monitoring, wired skin sensors (Grant Industries, Surrey, UK) for skin temperature measurements at 4 sites (shoulder, chest wall, thigh, and calf) to determine mean global skin temperature, 5 2 wireless iButton sensors (Maxim, San Jose, CA) for facial skin temperature and respirator microenvironment (ie, respirator dead space, identified as the airspace between the respirator's internal surface and the wearer's face that is not occupied by any part of the facial anatomy) temperature and humidity measurements, a Tosca (Radiometer America, Westlake, OH) combination pulse oximetertranscutaneous carbon dioxide sensor attached to an earlobe for pulse-derived oxygen saturation (SpO 2 )etranscutaneous carbon dioxide (tcpCO 2 )eheart rate (HR) monitoring, and a BioHarness physiologic monitoring chest strap (Zephyr, Annapolis, MD) for respiratory rate (RR) determination. Subjects were given instructions in donning FFRs, performed negative and positive user seal checks to assess the seal of the FFR to the face, 2 and then underwent respirator quantitative fit testing of a 3M model 1870 N95 FFR (3M, St Paul, MN) with the PortaCount Plus Model 8020. Fit testing of the N95 FFR was carried out with the N95-Companion Model 8095 fit tester (TSI, Shoreview, MN), a condensation nucleus particle counter that measures the concentrations of ambient particles outside and inside the FFR during successive 1-minute OSHA standard exercises (normal breathing, deep breathing, head movement side-to-side, head movement up and down, talking out loud, bending over, and normal breathing) and one 15-second exercise (grimace) that is not included in the calculation of the fit factor. 2 The fit factor is the ratio of the outside and inside particles and is calculated as follows: where FF is the fit factor, Cb is the particle concentration in the ambient sample before the respirator sample, Ca is the particle concentration in the ambient sample after the respirator sample, and Cr is the particle concentration in the respirator sample. The subjects then donned a 3M model 8293 P100 FFR (3M, St Paul, MN), adjusted the straps, and underwent quantitative fit testing using the PortAcount Plus Model 8020 (the N95 Companion is not used for P99 and P100 respirators). Fit factors with the PortaCount with N95 Companion are normally reported up to 200, and if they surpass this level, they are reported as 200þ because they exceed the manufacturer's recommended operating range, 6 whereas the PortaCount Plus can record fit factors as high as 10,000 (for ease of data comparisons between the N95 FFR and P100 FFR in the current study, scores >200 for the P100 FFR were recorded as 200þ). A passing score on an OSHA quantitative fit test is !100, indicating 1% penetration of particles into the dead space of the respirator. The 3M 1870 N95 FFR and 8293 P100 FFR models (see Fig 1 and Table 1 for FFR features) were fit tested immediately before (preexercise) and after (postexercise) 1 hour of treadmill walking (5.6 km/h, 0 incline) in an environmental chamber with ambient conditions of 35 C and relative humidity 50% (equivalent to a heat index of 40.7 C). Three randomly allocated exercise sessions were carried out on separate days: 2 sessions involved wearing either model of FFR, and 1 involved a control session (no FFR). Subjects were not allowed to make any adjustments to the respirators after the initial adjustment just prior to the pre-exercise fit test, so the postexercise fit test reflected only the impact of the exercise and environment. All fit testing was performed outside of the environmental chamber. During the treadmill exercise, subjective measurements were taken at baseline and then every 20 minutes using visual analog numerical scales for exertion (Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale, a 15-grade scale ranging from no exertion at all to maximal exertion), 7 thermal comfort (Frank Comfort Scale, a 10-point scale ranging from the coldest you have ever been to the hottest you have ever been), 8 and a 7-point respiratory scale of overall breathing discomfort (ranging from no discomfort to intolerable discomfort). 9 Respirators were weighed immediately pre-and post-testing on an accu-6201 calibrated analytical balance (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to determine moisture retention.
