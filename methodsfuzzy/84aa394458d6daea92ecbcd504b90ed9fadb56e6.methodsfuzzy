IBV RNA was prepared from purified virions by the method of Lomniczi and Kennedy [5] , and TMV virion RNA by the procedure of Marcus et al. [6] . Total cellular RNA was extracted from both IBVinfected and uninfected chick embryo kidney cells by an SDS/phenol method [7] . The micrococcal nucleasetreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prepared by the method that Pelham and Jackson described [8] . The technique of Roberts and Patterson [9] was used to make an in vitro protein synthesizing system from wheat germ. Conditions in the in vitro reaction mixtures have been reported elsewhere [8, 10] . [aSS]-Methionine (650 Ci/mmol, obtained from the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham) was included in the reaction mixtures. Samples were assayed for radioactive incorporation into TCA-precipitable material by spotting 2/~1 from the reaction mixture on 3 MM paper, boiling in a solution of 0.1% methionine in 5% TCA and treating as described previously [10] . Samples for analysis on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were processed by the published method [8] . IBV particles, labelled with [aSS] methionine, were grown and purified, as described by Lomniczi and Kennedy [5] . Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under the conditions described [11].
