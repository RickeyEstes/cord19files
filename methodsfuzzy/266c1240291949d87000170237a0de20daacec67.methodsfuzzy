Study location, design and samples. The study was undertaken within Kilifi County, which is located in coastal Kenya. A detailed description of the study location and study design was provided elsewhere 28 . Briefly, 47 households scattered across an area of approximately 21 km 2 were followed up over a 6-month period beginning December 2009 and ending June 2010 coinciding with the RSV peak activity months in the area 29 . Households were defined as a group of people sharing a compound and eating from the same kitchen 20 . The selected households (abbreviated HHs) were given designated identifiers from 1 to 57 (HH01 to HH57). Twice weekly throughout the study period, a nasopharyngeal-flocked swab (NPS) was obtained from each member regardless of symptom status. The NPS samples were screened for RSV using a multiplex real-time RT-PCR method which subtyped RSV positives into RSVA and RSVB 30 . For whole genome sequencing (WGS), we targeted 20 select households that documented RSV infection of ≥2 members. A geographical map showing the distribution of the study households is provided in the Additional File: Fig. S1. RNA extraction, amplification and whole nucleotide sequencing. Viral RNAs from the positive samples of selected households were obtained using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and RSV whole genome amplification was achieved using a six-overlapping PCR fragments strategy (each ~2.5 kb) as previously described 21 . Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera DNA Library Prep kits and nucleotide sequencing performed using Illumina MiSeq platform multiplexing 15-20 samples per run to generate approximately 1 million paired-end reads (150 bp × 2) per sample 21 .

The short reads from the MiSeq instrument were de-multiplexed, quality checked (median read Phred score of ≥35) and trimmed using QUASR v6.08 31 . Reads passing quality checks were de novo assembled into longer contigs using the SPAdes v3.5.0 32 . RSV contigs were identified by matching to a database of RSV sequences using USEARCH program 33 , examined for completeness of the expected open reading frames (ORF) using Geneious v8.1.6 (https://www. geneious.com) and, where necessary, partial contigs were further combined to longer ones using Sequencher v5.0.1 34 . These were subsequently checked presence of intact ORFs, sorted by household, re-aligned and positions of nucleotide variation double-checked if these were supported by majority of the raw reads associated with that sample 10 . Multiple sequence alignments were prepared in MAFFT v7.220 35 . phylogenetic analysis. Sequence phylogenies were inferred using Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods in MEGA7 36 and RAxML v8.2.12 37 . The best-fitting models of nucleotide substitution for each alignment were in IQ-TREE v1.4.3 38 . Best tree search was performed by Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI). Branch support was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated in pairsnp 0.0.6 39 . The phylogenetic relatedness of the household RSVA and RSVB genomes was assessed at three levels; (i) in combination with global sequences deposited in GenBank (RSVA, n = 657 collected between 1977-2015 while RSVB, n = 416 collected between 1978-2016), (ii) among the households viruses alone and (iii) among viruses collected from same households only. The potential transmission networks within and between households for each group were inferred in PopART package v1.7.2 using median joining tree (MJT) method with an epsilon of zero 40 . Evolutionary analyses were determined in maximum-likelihood-based TreeTime program 41
