A traditional scientific method is to use a reflectivity meter for measuring shell color intensity. Shell reflectivity, expressed as a percentage, is the amount of light that is reflected from the surface of an egg. It is an indication of shell color lightness -the higher the value, the lighter the color of the eggshell and vice versa. Shell reflectivity is less time consuming; however, it is not as accurate as other methods for measuring shell color. The reason could be that the reflectivity meter takes only one reading by targeting a small circular surface area (1 cm) of the eggshell. The most commonly used method for eggshell color quantification is spectrophotometry. One of the recent versions of spectrophotometer is the Konica Minolta hand-held spectrophotometer (CM-2600d) that works on the L * a * b * color space system, where L * has a maximum of 100 (white) and a minimum of 0 (black) and is the important component for simply measuring shell chromaticity. For a * , green is towards the negative end of the scale and red towards the positive end. For b * , blue is towards the negative end and yellow towards the positive end of the scale . The average value appears on the screen and is read as SCI L * a * b * and SCE L * a * b * . The SCI (specular component included) and SCE (specular component excluded) are very similar to each other, and usually SCI values are used for interpretation. The lower the L * value on the scale the darker the color of the shell surface and vice versa. One of the problems with spectrophotometer (CM-2600d) is how to interpret the results of a * and b * individually when the reading is taken on an unstained eggshell surface. For the amount of cuticle estimation, L * a * b * values are usually interpreted as single score. The single score, as described by Leleu et al. (2011) , measures the L * , a * , and b * values, before and after staining, and calculates a single value, ΔE * ab : A higher ΔE * ab denotes a higher staining affinity and hence more cuticle coverage (Leleu et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2013) . A Hunter lab calorimeter (working on the L * a * b * system) has been used for measuring eggshell color, but the values are less standardized compared to Minolta colorimeter values (Wei and Bitgood, 1990) . A Color Computer Vision machine is an alternative to the Konica Minolta Spectrophotometer (L * a * b * ). This machine measures the color of a larger surface area of eggshell and can also detect dirt (Mertens et al., 2005) . The Color Computer Vision machine operates on the same L * a * b * color space system (Odabasi et al., 2006) . Image analysis is another effective tool used for eggshell color estimation. In this method, a rectangular area, region of interest (ROI), of the shell is selected and the machine calculates the average values of intensity of the pixels in red, green, and blue bands (Sezer and Tekelioglu, 2009) . The values are then divided by 255 in order to produce a scale ranging from 0 to 1. This method is good for eggshells having numerous color spots. A High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) has been previously used to quantify the pigment from eggshell, uterine fluid, and parts of the shell gland . In HPLC, the sample is usually mixed with diluent (e.g. 50% HCl and acetonitrile), centrifuged, and read its absorbance in the machine. A shell (0.4 g) without shell membrane is dissolved in 0.08 g of celite and the pigment is then extracted with HCl, acetone, and oxalic acid (1:1:1). The extract is glass filtered and its absorbance is read in spectrometry at 409 to 412 nm (Nys et al., 1991) . This method seems to be quite tedious. In certain cases, eggshell color is masked by extraneous calcium deposition and thus the intensity of color is not measured precisely. In addition, the shell color measurement does not indicate how much pigment (g) is present in different shell layers. In order to confirm the intensity of shell color, the brown pigment in the eggshell (with and without cuticle) is quantified. Pigment (protoporphyrin IX) quantification is a more accurate way of determining the intensity and amount of pigment present in the shell. A method developed by Poole (1965) and modified by others (Wang et al., 2007 (Wang et al., , 2009a Samiullah and Roberts, 2013 ) may be used for pigment quantification.
