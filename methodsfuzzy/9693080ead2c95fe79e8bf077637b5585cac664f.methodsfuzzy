To assess the performance of RPM-Flu v.30/31 chip design, 34 known HRV serotype strains obtained from ATCC were tested. Of the 34 strains, 18 had corresponding 5'UTR sequences tiled on the microarray and were called prototype serotypes, which were used to verify the accuracy of the designed HRV probes. The remaining 16 strains, representing near neighbor serotypes, were selected from diverse clades based on phylogenetic classification of HRV serotypes [18, 19] . These strains were used to investigate the capability of the microarray to detect other HRV serotypes that did not have their sequences tiled on the microarray. Overall, the selected strains covered every single clade of 101 HRV serotypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the P1-P2 regions of 5'UTR sequences [18] . One metric of the hybridization in a reference region is to divide the number of bases reported as A, C, G, or T by the total number of bases for that region (probe length), which we refer to as the base call rate and proportionally reflects the hybridization strength or homology between the prototype and target sequences. A hybridization profile ( Fig. 2A) using the base call rates clearly showed a unique pattern for each serotype. The closely related serotypes with less nucleotide divergences had similar hybridization profiles across the tiled regions, so it is possible to assign species (HRVA and HRVB) based only on the hybridization patterns. The brighter red spots (higher base call rates) along the diagonal suggested that stronger hybridizations between the tiled probes and 5'UTRs from the prototype serotypes. It is also of note that HRV87 does not fall into either of two major clusters which agrees with other findings that it should really be classified as a HEV [20, 21] . To validate the accuracy of the array clustering, 5'UTR of each serotype was amplified by type-specific RT-PCR and subjected to conventional sequencing. The phylogenetic tree derived from the de novo 5'UTR sequences (Additional file 2) confirms the HRVA and HRVB classification. Pair-wise sequence comparisons also indicated that the average nucleotide divergence of 5 to database entries, this information could be integrated into the final identification. For these samples with high base call rates, the best hit would have tens to hundreds more matched bases than the next best hit. The remaining 16 ATCC strains represent near neighbor serotypes, which 5'UTR sequences share >80% identifies to those of prototypes. In all but the case of HRV5, the information was sufficient to identify the correct serotypes. In these samples, the difference in the number of base calls matching in the best hit and the next best hit was more variable and on average was fewer. The confidence of the identification depends on the accuracy of the base call. Since the best hit always had at least one base that matched the resequencing results and was a mismatch for the next best hit, it was Hybridization profiles of HRV and HEV serotypes from RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarrays Figure 2 Hybridization profiles of HRV and HEV serotypes from RPM-Flu v.30/31 microarrays. (A) 34 HRV serotypes were classified into two clusters corresponding to species HRVA and HRVB; (B) 29 HEV serotypes (including HRV87) were classified into two clusters corresponding to HEVA/B and HEVC/D species. Base call rates (number of base calls/probe length in each tile) generated from viral samples (rows) and prototype probes (columns) were calculated and clustered using dChip software. Rows standardized base call rates. Positive hybridization was represented by red color. Higher base call rates were shown as brighter red colors. Negative hybridization (no base call) was represented by green color. The sample HRV87 is underlined. possible to establish the lowest confidence level that the best hit was the correct identification. The resequencing microarray's accuracy for determining the base call has been established under a variety of conditions [23] . Using this information, there is a .000001 n that the next best hit is the most similar sequence in the database because a base is misidentified by the resequencing microarray where n is the number of mismatches between the next best hit and the matches for the best result. With .0001% being the largest level of uncertainty seen for these samples, it was deemed acceptable to treat the best hit as the correct identification. For HRV5, several database sequences representing different serotypes had the same score and since no further information was available it was only possible to determine that a HRV species B was present. The 5'UTR sequences from the tested strains generated with de novo sequencing were subjected to in silico predictive modeling analysis and the result of this was used as input in the CIBSI analysis program. For the case of HRV5, the in silico model predicted a larger fraction of base calls being made than were observed in the experiment. For all other samples there was a good correspondence on base call fractions between model and experiment as expected. This leads us to suspect there was a processing error or sample degradation leading to the less accurate identification. A panel of 28 HEV serotypes, including serotypes from all four HEV species, was similarly used to validate the specificity of RPM-Flu v.30/31 for HEV detection and identification. These serotypes were originally typed based on VP1 sequences (personal communication -Steve Oberste) Prototype serotypes having strong hybridization signals were designated in bold characters. The strain not identified at serotype level by microarray was underlined. *Serotype identities were made by searching 5'UTR sequences of HRV isolates against Genbank; () indicates the highest percentage of identity to the sequence in Genbank. and the majority of them belonged to members of HEVB. The hybridization profile ( Figure 2B) shows distinct clusters in a similar fashion to the HRV samples based on serotypes. In this case, HEVA and HEVB make up one cluster, while HEVC and HEVD (including HRV87) comprise a second cluster. This finding is consistent with the previously described clusters for HEV UTR sequences [24, 25] . The redundancy of the targets that was a consequence of how they were selected is apparent in the more uniform response observed within each cluster to the various strains. Analysis of sequences reported from RPM-Flu 30/31 array analysis indicated that two levels of identifications were obtained from 28 strains ( Table 2 ). Serotype level identification was made for 11 of the 28 strains, in which 9 cases correlated with typing made by the VP1 genes. For example, HEV71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CAVA16), known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, were unambiguously recognized as HEV71 and CAVA16 respectively using RPM-Flu v.30/31 and analysis program. Two strains were identified by RPM-Flu v.30/31 as HEV4 and HEV5, results in agreement with the conventional sequencing of each 5'UTR. However, the strains as provided by CDC were identified as HEV6 and CAVB3 respectively, based on the VP1 region. Specific serotypes could not be identified for the remaining sixteen samples using the sequence read generated from the array. Nevertheless these samples were easily categorized into the respective species. Due to amplification problems only a subset of strains were successfully de novo sequenced, which showed 3 -18% variations in 5'UTR sequences. The base call rates obtained by in silico predictions based on the de novo sequences were similar to the microarray results and the identifications agreed in all but one case.
