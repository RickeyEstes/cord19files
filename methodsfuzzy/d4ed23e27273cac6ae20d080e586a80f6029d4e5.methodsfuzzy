Bovine lymphocytes. An adult Holstein Friesian cow was immunized intramuscularly with 1.0 ml of 8% v/v of heat-killed and washed B. abortus cells. Additional similar injections were given 42 and 62 days later. On day 67, blood was aseptically collected in EDTA and the lymphocytes were separated using Ficoll-paque. Hybridization. Bovine lymphocytes ( 1 X 107 viable cells) were fused with mouse plasmacytoma cells (S/P 2, 1X 17 viable cells) using polyethylene glycol as described by Kennett et al. (1978) . Two to 3 weeks after the fusion and removal of unfused S/P 2 cells by addition of HAT and several changes of the culture medium, the cell supernates were tested for antibody activity. Hybridoma screening. An indirect ELISA procedure was used. Polystyrene 96well plates were coated passively with 200 ng of B. abortus LPS in 200 #l of carbonate buffer (0.06 M, pH 9.6) overnight at room temperature (RT). After washing four times with 0.1 M tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 M NaC1 and 0.05% Tween 20 (tris/T), 200 ttl of culture supernate was added to each well for 1 h at RT. After four washes, 200/tl of murine monoclonal antibody to bovine L-chain conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRPO, type VI from Sigma Chem., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), appropriately diluted in tris/T were added for 1 h at RT. Following four further washes in tris/T, 200 ]~l of substrate-chromogen containing lmM hydrogen peroxide and 4mM 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline sulfonic acid) (ABTS) were added and incubated at RT with constant orbital shaking. After 10 min of development, optical densities were assessed with a spectrophotometer. An arbitrary OD value of 0.100 or greater, based on OD values of negative controls, was considered positive. Cloning. Cells from wells giving a positive result on the screening test were cloned twice by the soft agar technique. The clone producing the highest OD in the screening test was selected for propagation. Production of ascitic fluid. Nu/nu mice, pristane treated 2 weeks previously by injection of 0.5 ml intraperitoneally (i.p.), were injected i.p. with 3.3 X 106 viable hybridoma cells. Approximately 10 days later and every 2 days thereafter, ascites fluid was drawn from the peritoneal cavities. Usually three collections were taken from each mouse. All ascites aliquants were pooled, clarified by centrifugation (10 000 Xg for 10 min), filter sterilized and frozen at -20 Â° C. Isotyping. The bovine isotype of clones producing antibody to B. abortus LPS was tested by an indirect ELISA in which LPS was used as the antigen, as above, but murine monoclonal antibody to bovine IgM, IgG1, IgG2 and IgA, conjugated with HRPO were used as detection reagents. The ELISA procedure was described above. Affinity purification. Murine monoclonal antibody to bovine IgG1 was covalently bound to agarose beads with cyanogen bromide using the technique of Johnson and Garvey (1977) and packed into a column which was run reverse to gravity with a peristaltic pump. Amounts of bovine monoclonal antibody were percolated through the column. Unbound materials were washed out with 0.1 M tris-HC1, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.15 M NaC1 until the OD of the effluent was less than 0.01 at 280 nm. Bound materials were then eluted from the column with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.4 and neutralized immediately by addition of 0.5 M tris-HC1, pH 8.0. Bound and unbound proteins eluted from the column were tested for antibody activity to B. abortus LPS by ELISA. Fractions containing antibody were pooled, dialized against 0.15 M NaCI and concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml. IgG1 was obtained by the same methods as the monoclonal antibody from serum from a cow infected with B. abortus which had a high complement fixation test titer. The affinity purified IgG1 was further affinity purified with B. abortus LPS (Stiller and Nielsen, 1983) . These reagents were used for serological testing. Serological tests. The indirect ELISA was performed as described by Nielsen et al. (1984) using a timing procedure (Wright et al., 1985) . A competitive ELISA for detection of antibody to B. abortus was used as described by Nielsen et al. (1987) . In both cases, monoclonal detection reagents were conjugated with HRPO as per Henning and Nielsen (1987) . The CFT as outlined by Samagh and Boulanger (1978) was used. Agglutination tests at a neutral or acid pH were done using doubling dilutions of the monoclonal antibody, mixing with appropriately diluted antigen (whole cell, 8% v/v, used at 1 : 200 or undi-luted 12% v/v whole cells at a final pH of 3.65, respectively), incubating for 48 h or 10 min, respectively, and then assessing agglutination visually. Other tests. Immunoelectrophoresis and double gel immunodiffusion were done using standard techniques using BM-8 and control IgG1 at 1.0 and 0.1 mg/ml. Polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS-PAGE ) were run with purified BM-8 preparations at 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 mg/ml as described by Towbin et al. (1979) .
