Animals and experimental protocol. Male C57BL/6 mice, (20±2 g, 6-8 weeks and free of murine specific pathogens), were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Guangdong Province (Guangzhou, China). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen free animal house at a temperature of 22±2˚C Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a potential novel biomarker for ventilator-associated lung injury and a relative humidity of 55±5% with a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Throughout the experimental process, the mice were housed in a laminar flow cabinet and maintained on standard laboratory food ad libitum. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Experiments were conducted on 42 wild-type mice, which were divided into 7 groups. The protocol for the control group was spontaneous breathing for 2 h. The protocol for the high peak inflation pressure (high-PIP) group was breathing under the condition of 50 cm H 2 O of PIP and 2. Table I . Collection of BAL fluid, serum or lung tissue. Following treatment, animals were sacrificed via administration of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Peripheral blood was extracted by removing the eyeball. Following overnight storage at 4˚C, serum was collected via centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 30 min at 4˚C. Immediately post-mortem, the heart-lung block was dissected and BAL fluid was obtained using the method previously described (12, 13) . BAL fluid was centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C and the supernatant was collected for western blotting. For reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting of lung samples, the right lung was cut into samples (~1x1 cm) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunohistochemical and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the left lung was fixed as previously described (14) . The vertical axis of each left lung was identified and the lung was cut perpendicular to this axis into 4-mm thick slices. RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen lung samples using TRIzol reagent (Ambion; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantified by measuring absorption at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm using the NanoDrop system (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). and stored at -70˚C until required. A total of 1 µg total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), and RT-qPCR was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR-Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) under the conditions as follows: preheating at 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95˚C for 10 sec, 60˚C for 20 sec and 72˚C for 10 sec. The primers were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and the sequences were as follows: Forward, 5'-CCC TGA ACT GAA GGA ACG-3' and reverse, 5'-TTG GTA TGG TGG CTG GTG-3' for NGAL, and forward, 5'-CAT CCG TAA AGA CCT CTA TGC CAA C-3' and reverse, 5'-ATG GAG CCA CCG ATC CAC A-3' for β-actin. PCR reactions were performed on an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Gene expression was measured in triplicate, quantified using the 2 −ΔΔCq method (15) and normalized to the β-actin internal control. Western blotting. Lung tissue protein was extracted using ice-cold RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Total proteins (30 µg) were separated by 8-12% SDS-PAGE at 120 V, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 250 mA for 90 min via wet transfer. Following blocking non-specific binding sites with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with Tween-20 (20 mM/l TBS pH 7.5, 500 mM/l NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h, the blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (sc-47778; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and anti-NGAL (MAB1857; 1:1,000; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) primary antibodies at 37˚C for 1 h. Bands were detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (7076; 1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 37˚C for 40 min followed by treatment with SuperSignal ® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and X-ray film exposure (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). The film was scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed using QuantityOne software version 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Squares of equal size were drawn around each band to measure the density, and the value was adjusted based on the density of the background near that band. Densitometric analysis was repeated three times. Results were expressed as a ratio of the target protein compared with the reference protein. The ratio of the target protein from the control group was arbitrarily set to 1. H&E staining. Lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution at 4˚C for 24 h, and dehydrated. The samples were wax embedded and cut into 4-6 µm sections on a microtome. The sections were flattened, mounted and heated on blank glass slides. Histological evaluations were performed by H&E staining and pathological examination using a CTR 6500 microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunohistochemical staining of NGAL. Following deparaffinization and dehydration, the sections were immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) with 0.05% Tween-20, for 5 min at 58˚C, and subsequently treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at room temperature for 20 min, the slides were incubated at 4˚C with a rat monoclonal anti-NGAL antibody (MAB1857; 1:100; R&D Systems, Inc.) overnight. Finally, slides were incubated with a rabbit anti-rat biotin-conjugated IgG H&L secondary antibody (ab6733; 1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at room temperature for 1 h, and detected using an avidin-biotin complex system (Vectastain ABC-kit; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's test. Statistical differences between two groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t-test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
