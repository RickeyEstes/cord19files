We performed phylogenetic analysis of HRV, hMPV, Inf-V, and RSV as a major cause of asthma attack in this study. HRV was the most commonly detected virus and consisted of diverse genotypes on phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) . This trend was also found in the analyses of hMPV (Fig. 3) , Inf-V (Fig. 4) , and RSV (Fig. 5 ).
