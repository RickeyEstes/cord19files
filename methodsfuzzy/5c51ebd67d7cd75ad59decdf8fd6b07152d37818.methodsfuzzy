Plasmids N (28102-29380), M (26372-27084), Sa (21460-23204), and Sb (23114-25301) genes were amplified by RT-PCR from SARS coronavirus (GenBank Accession No: NC_004718), and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 DNA vector (Invitrogen), and four plasmids pcDNAN, pcDNAM, pcDNASa, and pcDNASb were constructed. Briefly, SARS coronavirus RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed (RT) into cDNA. Then N, M, Sa, and Sb genes were amplified with PCR methods. PCR products were inserted into BamHI and EcoRI clone sites of pcDNA3.1 vector. Recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing analysis. For DNA immunization, pcDNAN, pcDNAM, pcDNASa, and pcDNASb were transformed into Escherichia coli Top10, and cultured in LB culture medium for 24 h at 37°C, plasmids were prepared using Qiagen Plasmid DNA Mid Kit (Qiagen), and the purified plasmids were dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg ml À1 .
