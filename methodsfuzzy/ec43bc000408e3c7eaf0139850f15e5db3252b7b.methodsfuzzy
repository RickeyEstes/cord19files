In microchip-based analytical devices (Jiang et al., 2011) , constraints are imposed by the small volumes and short optical path lengths (Myers and Lee, 2008) . Additionally, there is a need for low-cost and portable detection systems for POC applications, without compromising sensitivity and precision (Weigl et al., 2008) . The following section outlines how this challenge has been addressed, with Table 4 providing an overview of optical and non-optical on-chip detection methods. Absorbance detection is adversely affected by the reduced optical path lengths in microchips, as defined by the Lambert-Beer law. A number of elegant solutions have been developed to increase optical path lengths by rerouting the light by means of mirrors or lenses to probe a larger sample volume, as described in a review (Myers and Lee, 2008) . In contrast, Lee and coworkers used deep 6 mm detection chambers in a compact disk (CD)-based system and 450/630 nm LEDs coupled with Si-photodiodes to detect HRP label-induced TMB color change in an on-chip ELISA for hepatitis B (Lee et al., 2009a) . Maier and coworkers have used gold nanoparticle labels in a resonance-enhanced absorption for ELISA-based determination of food-based allergens (Maier et al., 2008) . Detection limits of 1 ng/mL were achieved with semiquantitative visual readout but could potentially be improved with readout instrumentation. Absorbance (Lee et al., 2009a; Maier et al., 2008) Fluorescence (Herr et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2011; Ruckstuhl et al., 2011; Jokerst et al., 2008; Meagher et al., 2008) Fluorescence polarization (Tachi et al., 2009) Phosphorescence (Yan et al., 2006) Chemiluminescence (Yacoub-George et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009; Bhattacharyya and Klapperich, 2007; Sista et al., 2008b) TLM (Ihara et al., 2010) SERS (Mulvaney et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009) SPR (Karlsson et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2007b; Feltis et al., 2008; Chinowsky et al., 2007) Potentiometric (Chumbimuni-Torres et al., 2006) Amperometric (Yoo et al., 2009; Nie et al., 2010) Conductometric Capacitive (Ghafar-Zadeh et al., 2009) FET (Cui et al., 2001; Stern et al., 2010) QCM (Uludag and Tothill, 2010) Cantilever (Waggoner et al., 2010; Luchansky et al., 2011) There has been extensive development of fluorescence detection capabilities in microchip-based immunoassays. Early work focused on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) where high-energy laser light is focused on a small area, with the narrow spectral emission facilitating discrimination between excitation and emission light (Chiem and Harrison, 1997; Jiang et al., 2000) . Multichannel microfluidic immunoassays with simultaneous readout based on a scanning fluorescence detection system have also been developed (Cheng et al., 2001) . More recently, an integrated portable LIF detection device for oral immunodiagnostics has been demonstrated, yielding nanomolar to picomolar sensitivity for saliva-based periodontal disease markers (Herr et al., 2007) . McDevitt and coworkers have reduced the functionality of a conventional benchtop epi-fluorescence microscope into a handheld diagnostic device for CD4 + T-cell counting in HIV patients by drawing on the unique spectral properties of Q-dots (Jokerst et al., 2008) . A compact integrated LIF immunodiagnostic system with picomolar sensitivities for a panel of biological toxins has been developed by Sandia National Laboratories (Meagher et al., 2008) . The system is based on integrated electronics and miniaturized optics comprising diode lasers, mirrors, lenses, filters, and a photomultiplier tube (PMT). As a first step toward potentially fully disposable fluorescence detection systems, Ryu and coworkers have developed an integrated immunodiagnostic detection system based on inorganic LEDs and organic photodiodes with nanograms per milliliter sensitivities reported for cardiac markers myoglobin and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme (Ryu et al., 2011) . Baba and coworkers have recently demonstrated a homogeneous microchip theophylline assay with fluorescence polarization detection (Tachi et al., 2009) . Detection is based on measuring polarization changes when the rotational motion of the fluorescent label is altered by binding to the analyte. In the cited work, this change is quantified via the use of a laser, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and fixed and rotatable polarizers. Very recently, a novel supercritical angle fluorescence (SAF) immunoassay concept has been implemented in disposable polymer test tubes and validated by detecting interleukin-2 at low picomolar levels (Ruckstuhl et al., 2011) . SAF occurs only at the surface of transparent substrates and as such can be used to discriminate between surface binding and bulk effects, hence circumventing the need for laborious ELISA-type washing steps. To overcome some of the limitations of fluorescencebased detection in terms of spectral overlap between excitation and emission light, longer lived phosphorescence could be exploited in a time-gated detection approach where excitation light is pulsed and emission detected after the pulse ends. However, this approach requires sophisticated lock-in detection electronics, which might explain why it has not yet been applied to POC immunodiagnostic assays. A separate approach based on up-converting phosphors (see Signal Generation) has recently been demonstrated for the determination of Yersinia pestis using a compact and portable readout device with 980 nm laser diode-based excitation and PMT-based detection of emitted light at 541 nm (Yan et al., 2006) . Chemiluminescence is a popular detection technology choice for immunodiagnostics, as optical excitation instrumentation is not required, which is particularly attractive for integrated disposable device formats. In early work on a model mouse IgG immunoassay, HRP-labeled conjugate was detected on a capillary electrophoresis microchip using standard luminol/peroxide chemistry (Mangru and Harrison, 1998 ). An aluminum mirror fabricated onto the back side of the detection zone provided a reflective surface to enhance collection efficiency of the emitted light, yielding a linear range for mouse IgG of 0-60 µg/mL. More recently, chemiluminescence detection has been extended to a 10-channel capillary flow-through sandwich immunoassay for biological agent detection (Yacoub-George et al., 2007) . Here, microperistaltic pumps were used to drive fluid in 10 parallel microchip mounted capillaries with HRP-based chemiluminescence detection on a multianode-photomultiplier array. A magnetic bead-based immunoassay for C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum has been demonstrated on a microchip with integrated pneumatically driven micropumps, microvalves, and micromixers ). Chemiluminescence detection was based on an acridium ester label on the detection antibody and off-chip luminometer-based readout, yielding a detection limit of 0.0125 mg/L for CRP. A 0.1 mg/L detection limit for an indirect CRP immunoassay has been demonstrated in serum on a multichannel injection molded cyclic olefin chip using HRP/ luminol-based chemiluminescence generation and benchtop imaging system readout (Bhattacharyya and Klapperich, 2007) . More interestingly, an onboard instant film module has also been tested which, when compared against reference films, could potentially be exploited in a qualitative POC setting. A magnetic bead-based immunoassay for insulin and interleukin-6 on a digital microfluidic platform has been demonstrated by Pamula and coworkers (Sista et al., 2008b) . Here, HRP labels were reacted with PS-Atto substrate and read out on a PMT. Thermal lens microscope (TLM)-based detection uses a dual laser beam system to measure the photothermal effect on nonfluorescent molecules, with colloidal gold labels typically employed. In early work, TLM has been effectively applied to an immunometric immunoassay for determination of human secretory immunoglobulin A and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Sato et al., 2000 (Sato et al., , 2001 . Using capture antibody-coated polystyrene beads confined in a 100 µm-deep × 250 µm-wide glass channel, a 0.03 ng/ mL detection limit for CEA was achieved after 10 min incubation. More recently, Kitamori and coworkers have applied high-sensitivity TLM detection to a microchipbased open-sandwich ELISA for human osteocalcin in serum (Ihara et al., 2010) . Using a 658 nm excitation, 785 nm probe beam, and a photodiode detector, a sensitivity of 1.0 µg/L could be demonstrated for osteocalcin, equivalent to plate-based ELISA results. In SERS spectroscopy, the molecular fingerprint signals of the Raman spectra are enhanced when the molecules come in close proximity of a metal surface where local electromagnetic field enhancements are generated. In early work by Natan and coworkers, glass-coated analytetagged nanoparticles (GANs) with a Raman active Au or Ag core were used in surface-bound immunometric (sandwich) formats (Mulvaney et al., 2003) . Lasers were used as the excitation light with scattered light being detected using a CCD. In more recent work, Lee and coworkers have demonstrated label-free determination of adenine on a polysilicon-coated glass wafer (Cho et al., 2009) . Here, an electric field was applied between a top cylindrical wire electrode and a bottom plate Au-electrode including the SERS-active region, resulting in charged analyte molecules accumulating on the oppositely charged electrode in the detection region. Electrokinetic preconcentration resulted in a sensitivity improvement of eight orders of magnitude when read out on an integrated Raman system, suggesting SERS potential for demanding low-concentration diagnostic applications. SPR allows direct label-free detection of immune complexes on a surface. For details, see Surface Plasmon Resonance in Binding Site, Kinetic and Concentration analyses. Notably, the SPR-based Biacore™ system has found widespread use as a commercial immunoassay development platform (see Commercial Microfluidic Immunodiagnostics). Here, we only describe applications of SPR to microfluidics-based immunodiagnostic devices. In early work, SPR has been used in conjunction with a microfluidic unit in contact with a sensor surface to measure the kinetics of monoclonal antibody-antigen reactions in real time. The antibody or antigen was immobilized in a dextran matrix that was attached to the sensor surface and binding events monitored by SPR (Karlsson et al., 1991) . Over the last 20 years, this highly sensitive and reliable method for low molecular weight analyte determination in complex analytical matrices has seen considerable improvements, particularly in terms of more robust sensing surfaces and more compact instrumentation . Lee and coworkers have demonstrated automatic PDMS microchips with micropumps and valves for immunoassay arrays with two-dimensional SPR phase imaging detection based on the Kretschmann configuration (Lee et al., 2007b) . To account for the temperature sensitivity of SPR measurements, a temperature control module comprising micro-heaters and temperature sensors was also incorporated, resulting in a preliminary detection limit for IgG of 0.67 nM. As an important step toward POC applications, Davis and coworkers have developed a fully self-contained hand-held SPR device powered by a 9 V battery (Feltis et al., 2008) . To demonstrate efficacy of the system, 200 ng/mL ricin has been detected in a plastic cylindrical sensor cell via an immobilized anti-ricin antibody immunoassay within 10 min Similarly Yager and coworkers have built a compact SPR imaging (SPRi) instrument based on a diode light source, image detector, integrated digital signal processor, and passive temperature control (Chinowsky et al., 2007) . Proof of concept was demonstrated with a competition immunoassay for phenytoin. While the above optical detection methods are very versatile and benefit from direct transferability of conventional clinical laboratory assay formats and associated optical label chemistry, the required hardware is often expensive, difficult to miniaturize, and optical readout performance can suffer at the microscale format. While novel approaches to integrated optical on-chip detection have overcome some of those limitations, as outlined above, there is still ample room for simpler miniaturizable detection technologies. Electrochemical detection provides a viable alternative, albeit at the expense of increased multi-analyte interference and remaining problems with electrode fouling and stability. While the following section reviews the current state of the art for electrochemical detection, more details are provided elsewhere (see Immunological Biosensors). In early work, pH-sensitive light addressable potentiometric sensors were used to monitor the pH change that accompanied enzymatic action of bound urease-labeled conjugate in immunocomplexes captured on a membrane (Briggs and Panfili, 1991; Owicki et al., 1994) . More recently, Bakker and coworkers have demonstrated potentiometric detection in nanoparticle-based sandwich immunoassays (Chumbimuni-Torres et al., 2006) . Following the catalytic deposition of silver on gold nanoparticle labels on the detection antibody, silver dissolution is potentiometrically detected using an Ag + -selective electrode, yielding a detection limit of 12.5 pmol IgG in 50 µL of sample. On-chip amperometric detection of an alkaline phosphatase label has been accomplished following separation of free antibody and antibody-antigen complex in a post-column reaction of the enzyme label with a 4-aminophenyl phosphate substrate and downstream amperometric detection of the 4-aminophenol product (Wang et al., 2001) . A detection limit of 1.7 amol was achieved in a model assay for mouse IgG conducted in 50 µm-deep × 20 µm-wide channels in a glass microchip. A bead-based microfluidic immunoassay for urinary hippuric acid determination in the range of 0-40 mg/ mL has been demonstrated on a PDMS microchip with enzymatically amplified amperometric detection (Yoo et al., 2009) . Whitesides and coworkers have demonstrated chronoamperometric analysis of glucose and square wave anodic stripping voltammetry measurements of heavy metal ions on microfluidic paper-based electrochemical devices (mPEDs) (Nie et al., 2010) . The simple low-cost device comprising two printed carbon electrodes as the working and counter electrodes, and a printed Ag/AgCl electrode as the pseudo-reference electrode is inherently compatible with immunoassay-based analysis. A conductometric immunometric (sandwich) immunoassay for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum has recently been demonstrated with nanogold labels on a microcomb-type electrode yielding a limit of detection of 0.01 ng/mL . As a variant of the above electrochemical methods, capacitive detection of microfluidic immunoassays on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based sensors has also been reported (Ghafar-Zadeh et al., 2009) . FETs with amine and oxide-functionalized borondoped silicon nanowires (SiNWs) between source and drain have been used by Lieber and coworkers to create highly sensitive real-time immunosensors (Cui et al., 2001) . Proof of concept was demonstrated by monitoring anti-biotin binding to biotin-modified SiNWs, but detecting biomarkers in physiological fluid samples has so far proven difficult, due to NSB and biofouling. Fahmy and coworkers have recently overcome this problem by developing a microfluidic chip that captures multiple markers from blood samples, followed by post-wash release into purified buffer for sensing with a FET-based silicon nanoribbon detector (Stern et al., 2010) . Efficacy was demonstrated with label-less sandwich immunoassay-based detection of two model cancer markers from whole blood within less than 20 min. Electromechanical detection methods are based on binding induced changes to a sensing surface, which can be measured by electrical means. The QCM measurement principle is based on a surface binding-induced oscillation change of a quartz wafer sandwiched between two electrodes. While this method is inherently label-less, addition of, for instance, Au nanoparticles can enhance assay sensitivity. Tothill and coworkers have applied this approach to the determination of cancer markers in 75% human serum, with a detection limit of 0.29 ng/mL, for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (Uludag and Tothill, 2010) . The main drawback for POC immunodiagnostic applications is QCM's sensitivity to matrix viscosity, which necessitates the use of on-chip controls. In the cantilever approach, the surface stress generated by antigen-antibody molecule recognition is measured (Hwang et al., 2009; Waggoner and Craighead, 2007) . In early proof of concept work, the detection of CK and myoglobin has been demonstrated at <20 µg/mL (Arntz et al., 2003) . Cho and coworkers have shown the detection of urinary PSA at picomolar concentration levels (Cho et al., 2005) . More recently, Craighead's group has pushed the sensitivity to 1-100 fM for PSA in serum using a nanoparticle-based mass labeling immunometric assay (Waggoner et al., 2010) . Silicon photonic micro-ring resonators have been applied to the detection of CRP in serum at 200 fM level with a dynamic range of six orders of magnitude (Luchansky et al., 2011) .
