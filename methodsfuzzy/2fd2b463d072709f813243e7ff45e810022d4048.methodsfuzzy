Fluorometric determination of 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) was conducted by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) as previously described (Suzuki et al., 1996) . The EBN extract was hydrolyzed with 200 l of 25 mM sulfuric acid. The hydrolysate was reacted with DMB reagent and heated at 60 • C for 2.5 h in the dark to develop fluorescence for determination of sialic acids. A 10-l aliquot of the resulting solution was used for determination of sialic acids. The fluorescence of DMB derivatives was detected at an excitation wavelength of 373 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm. For the establishment of calibration curves, standard mixtures of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc (Sigma, USA) were used. To identify sialyoligosaccharides reactive with sialic acid (SA) ␣2,3galactose (Gal)-or SA␣2,6Gal-specific lectins (glycan determination kit; Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), each section was incubated with 50 l of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) lectin [1 g/ml; specific for SA␣2,6Gal/Nacetylgalactosaminide (GalNac)] or Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) lectin (5 g/ml; specific for SA␣2,3Gal) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with cold PBS, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals) for 1 h at room temperature and then after three additional washes in cold PBS and buffered glycerol (pH 9.0) were visualized according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (glycan determination kit; Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals).
