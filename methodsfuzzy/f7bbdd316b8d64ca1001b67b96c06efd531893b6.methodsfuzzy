Number of studies have reported that PCR-based assays within 8 h with sensitivity similar to pyrosequencing method for seasonal H1N1. 56 Similarly, cycling probe real-time PCR assay has been shown to provide test results within 3 h after receiving the samples for resistance to oseltamivir and also to be able to detect both seasonal as well as H1N1 09 viruses resistant to oseltamivir. 58 However, the major drawback is that new sets of primers and probes have to be developed in the event when a novel drug-resistant strain would emerge during treatment. 58
