A total of eleven commercial broiler flocks on age 5-7 weeks in Zabol in the southeast of Iran were selected randomly for tracheal swab samples preparation. These flocks were vaccinated against IBV with a live attenuated vaccine during the first week of life. Five swabs were prepared from each flock and each swab was placed in a sterile tube containing PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) and was transferred to the laboratory in cold conditions. The swabs from each flock were placed in 1 ml PBS (pH 7.2) and were scraped on the side of the tube to facilitate removal of contents from the swab head. For extraction and purification of viral RNA, 200 μl of prepared sample was used and the procedure of viral RNA extraction and purification kit was utilized (High Pure Viral RNA Kit W , Roche, Germany). Briefly, 200 μl of the sample was added to a 1.5 ml sterile RNase and DNase free microtube containing 400 μl of working solution (polyA plus binding buffer) and processed as recommended by manufacturer. The extracted viral RNA was contained in a 1.5 ml sterile RNase and DNase free microtube and stored at −70°C until further use. RT-PCR: a commercial cDNA synthesis kit (2-steps RT-PCR kit, RTPL12 W , vivantis, Malaysia) was used. The recommended procedures of manufacturer with some modifications were utilized. Briefly, 8 μl RNA, 1 μl of Random Hexamer primer and 1 μl dNTPs were added to a 0.2 ml microcentrifuge tube, boiled for 4 min and cooled on ice for 2 min. 2 μl of 10x RT buffer, 1 μl M-MULV reverse transcriptase enzyme (200 u/μl), and 7 μl nuclease free water were added. The tube incubated 10 min at 25°C, 60 min at 42°C and 5 min at 85°C. Finally cooled on ice and stored at −20°C. Synthesized cDNA was amplified by PCR reaction. PCR was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing: 2.5 μl PCR reaction buffer, 0.5 μl dNTPs, 0.75 μl of each of XCE2+ and XCE2-primers, 0.75 μl MgCl2, 0.2 μl Taq DNA polymerase, 3 μl cDNA and 17.25 μl H2O. Amplification was carried out in a thermocycler using 35 cycles consisting of denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and extension for 1 min at 72°C, followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. Electrophoresis of amplified products was carried out using 1.5% agarose gel. The amplified cDNA fragment were visualized and photographed under UV light. A pattern with 100 bp ladder was used (Figure 1a ). Nested PCR: For serotype identification, a typespecific nested PCR was conducted. Oligonucleotide primers included MCE1+, DCE1+ and BCE1+ respectively specific for a hypervariable region in the S1 gens of serotypes Massachusetts, D274 and 4/91, and primer XCE3common for the three serotypes were used (Adzhar et al. 1997; Nouri et al. 2003; Roussan et al. 2008) . Table 1 show the sequences of primers which used in PCR reactions. Nested PCR reaction contained 1μl of RT-PCR product of positive reaction, 5 μl PCR buffer, 1μl dNTPs, 1.5 μl MgCl2, 0.25 μl Taq DNA polymerase, 34.5 μl H2O and 1 μl of each of the oligonucleotides primers XCE3-, MCE1+, DCE1+ and BCE1+. The thermalcycler parameters were the same as mentioned above. To fractionate DNA fragments, 10 μl of PCR product was loaded onto 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresed for 55 min in TAE buffer. DNA marker of 100 bp was as size marker for determination of the length of the amplified fragments ( Figure 1b) .
