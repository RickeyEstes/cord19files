During a 3-month study period commencing in July 2000, 18 adult lung transplant patients presenting with "flu-like" symptoms at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, underwent NT swabs for IFA testing and viral culture using the Bartels Respiratory Viral Detection Kit (cost $15 US). "Flu-like" symptoms were defined as any combination of sore throat, nasal irritation, low-grade fever, myalgia and arthralgia with or without lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms of cough, dyspnea or wheeze. Following NT swabs, blood samples were sent for acute viral serology (influenza A or B and adenovirus) using the complement fixation assay, cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction (CMV PCR) analysis, full blood count, biochemistry and immunosuppressant levels. Detailed pulmonary function tests, a chest radiograph and measurement of oxygen saturation were also performed. Selected patients with significant LRT symptoms and/or radiographic infiltrates proceeded to early fiber-optic bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB). BAL samples were not processed for viral studies and IFA test results were available within 24 hours of collection. Convalescent serology for respiratory viruses was collected 6 weeks after clinical presentation and lung function charted for 6 months post-infection. Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was defined as the average of 2 measurements recorded in the 4 months preceding clinical presentation separated by at least 4 weeks. Diagnosis of RVI required a positive viral culture, IFA test or demonstration of a 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer. Study participants received similar immunosuppressive therapy early post-transplantation consisting of oral cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisolone (maintenance dose on .20 mg/kg). Acute rejection was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg per day for 3 days and generally followed by an oral taper commencing at 1 mg/kg. Patients were switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus 0.15 mg/kg for recurrent or persistent rejection. ml of viral transport medium 9 and transported immediately to an outside reference laboratory 5 km from our institution. Upon arrival, the liquid medium from each swab was mixed together and centrifuged to provide a cellular supernatant. Only specimens with at least 3 epithelial cells per 400ϫ field under light microscopy were considered adequate for viral detection. Half of the cells were removed with a Pasteur pipette and placed onto 8-well slides. The IFA test consisted of two immunologic reagents. First, 20 l of each anti-viral mouse monoclonal antibody to adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B and parainfluenza 1-3 were inoculated with the wells. Then 20 l of non-immune mouse antibody was added to the final well as a negative control. Specimens were incubated in a humid chamber at 35°to 37°C for 30 minutes then washed with phosphatebuffered saline. Anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate was added and then washed to remove any unattached reagent. The antigen wells were examined at 400ϫ magnification with the non-immune mouse well examined first to detect any non-specific background immunofluorescence. Cells infected with virus displayed applegreen fluorescence that was cytoplasmic and/or nuclear, in a uniform or punctate distribution. The remaining cells with supernatant from the NT swab were processed for culture isolation and incubated with MDCK cells at 35°to 37°C. Cells were observed daily for cytopathic changes of vacuolation and stained for respiratory virus after 4 to 7-day incubation as outlined earlier. 4
