There are fundamental differences in methodology between TCM and biomedicine, due to the fact that they have been built up basing on the differences in epistemology, philosophy, form of clinical practice, and culture. [8] Biomedicine focuses on physical structure and its material changes in volume via experimental observations, to study physiology and pathology of human beings and their interrelationships. Therefore, medical morphology such as organs, tissues, and cells have been well documented by biomedicine and activities of human beings in physiology and pathology have been well determined by measuring inner material change in volume. In contrast, built upon Chinese philosophies and culture, TCM is based on the belief that the living phenomena of human beings are the refl ection of related functioning changes, with a macro method applied for the study of physiology and pathology of human beings. Therefore, abstractive function systems such as Zang Xiang Xue Shuo, Jing Luo Xue Shuo, and Jing Qi Shen Xue Shuo have been well documented. The differences in epistemology and methodology define fundamental differences in categories of illness studies between biomedicine and TCM. In biomedicine, disease is the basic unit of illness study and therefore treatment is based on the disease, but in TCM, syndrome is the basic unit of illness study and therefore treatment is based on differentiation of syndromes. [8] Biomedicine is very effective when the underlying mechanism of a pathogen has been well documented and an agent to break down the circle of pathogen is found. However, it is limited when diseases have either a pathogenous mechanism that is unknown or the agent to break down the circle of pathogen (an example can be viral infectious diseases) is unfound. It is also limited when illness is related to functional defects or diseases with multiple organ, tissue, or system defects. All of these can be overcome by the holistic approach of TCM.
