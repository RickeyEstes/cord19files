Cloning of chimeric construct expressing SPAG9 fused with green fluorescent (GFP) reporter protein. To generate the chimeric construct of SPAG9, a cDNA encoding complete open reading frame (ORF) of SPAG9 (comparable to 111-2410 bp of the published SPAG9, amino acid residues from 1 to 766) was amplified using forward 5 0 -ATGTCCATAA TTATATGGAACATTTA-3 0 and reverse 5 0 -TAAGTTGATGACCCAT TATTAACCA-3 0 primers, and cloned in pEGFPN2 vector. Briefly, the PCR product (which contains XhoI site at the 5 0 end and a BamHI site at the 3 0 end of the sense strand) was digested with XhoI and BamHI. The XhoI/BamHI fragment was inserted in-frame into XhoI/BamHI-digested pEGFPN2 plasmid (Clontech, USA) containing multiple cloning sites to obtain SPAG9-GFP. The nucleotide sequence of the constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Construction of small interfering RNA plasmid vector. The SPAG9specific siRNA constructs were designed to be homologous to SPAG9 mRNA (GenBank Accession No. X91879). We selected two siRNA constructs: (1) BS/U6/spag9; the two complementary oligonucleotides (5 0 -GGGCCCAGATCTCAGTGGATATAAATTCAAGAGATTTATATCCA CTGAGATCTTTTTTGAATTC-3 0 and 5 0 -GAATTCAAAAAAGATCT CAGTGGATATAAATCTCTTGAATTTATATCCACTGAGATCTGGG CCC-3 0 ), (2) BS/U6/spag9-I; the two complementary oligonucleotides (5 0 -GGGCCCACAGCTCATAGTAGAATTATTCAAGAGATAATTCTACT ATGAGCTGTTTTTTGAATTC-3 0 and 5 0 -GAATTCAAAAAACAGCT CATAGTAGAATTATCTCTTGAATAATTCTACTATGAGCTGTGGG CCC-3 0 , the 19-nucleotide sense or antisense strands are in bold letters and stem loop sequences are in italics), annealed to generate double-stranded DNAs, and ligated into the linearized empty vector pBS/U6.The siRNA plasmids encoded the hairpin RNAs that specifically targeted SPAG9 mRNA and had no significant homology with other known genes. The nucleotide sequences of SPAG9 siRNAs (BS/U6/spag9 and BS/U6/spag9-I) were verified by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmids BS/U6 and BS/U6/gfp RNAi were a gift from Dr. Yang Shi (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA). Cell culture and transfections. COS-1 cells were grown in DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) in a humidified incubator (5% CO 2 ) at 37°C. Cells grown on coverslips in 35 mm petri plates were transfected by Lipofectamine procedure (Life Technologies) and harvested 48 h after transfection. For dose-dependent experiment, 0.5 lg of chimeric construct (SPAG9-GFP) was cotransfected with siRNAs using different concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 6 lg. To evaluate the specificity of BS/U6/spag9, 0.5 lg pcDNA-SPAG9 and pFlag-CMV2-JNK-3, respectively, were cotransfected with 6 lg BS/U6/spag9. A constant concentration of 10 lg was used for all the transfection studies employing empty vector (BS/U6) or BS/U6/gfp. The MAPK expression vector, pFlag-CMV2-JNK-3, was a gift from Dr. Katsuji Yoshioka (Department of Molecular Pathology, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Japan). Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection and were processed for immunofluorescence assay as described earlier [1] . Briefly, the rat anti-SPAG9 and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies M5 (Sigma) were used as primary antibodies to probe SPAG9 and JNK-3, respectively. After washing, cells were probed with secondary antibodies goat anti-rat Texas red and anti-mouse FITC conjugate for SPAG9 and JNK-3, respectively, and were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy under ECLIPSE, E 400 Nikon microscope (Nikon, Fukok, Japan). Western blotting. After 48 h transfection, cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min [1] . The supernatant was used for protein determination by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting. SPAG9, chimeric (SPAG9-GFP), JNK-3, and GFP proteins were resolved on 10% and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, respectively, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Expression of GFP protein was probed with anti-GFP HRP-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA). Expressions of SPAG9 and SPAG9-GFP protein in cell lysates were probed with primary antibody using rat anti-SPAG9 antibody and subsequently with goat anti-rat IgG HRPO (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) as secondary antibody. JNK-3 protein was probed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody Bio-M5 (Sigma). The detection was performed with 0.05% 3,3 0 -diaminobenzidene (Sigma). Flow cytometry analysis. Cells transfected with SPAG9-GFP in the presence or absence of BS/U6/spag9 (using a range of concentrations from 0.5 to 6 lg) were harvested by trypsinization after 48 h transfection and washed twice with PBS. After the final wash, cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometer (BD-LSR model, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data acquisition and analysis were done using WinMDI (version 2.8) software.
