Viruses, cells, animals, antibodies . The isolation and characterization of JHMV-DL, from which variant viruses were derived, as well as the derivation of single antigenic variant virus 2 .2-V-1, have previously been described . 12 Viruses were propagated and plaque assayed on DBT or L2 cells ." Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine), seronegative for murine coronaviruses, were used in all experiments 48-72 hours after receipt . Mice were inoculated i .c . with a 30 yl volume containing various numbers of PFU of virus as indicated in each experiment . Hyperimmune and monoclonal antibodies to JHMV were made in this laboratory . 22 Negative control antibody 7 .16 .17 (anti-H-21 P) was a gift from Dr Jeffrey Frelinger, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill ." The temperature sensitivity of virus plaque formation was assayed as previously described . 12 Quantitation of infectious virus in brain and spinal cord samples was performed by assay of tissue homogenates on L2 cells as previously described .212 Selection of double antigenic variant viruses. Variant viruses were selected as previously described . 12 Briefly, variant virus 2 .2-V-1 was incubated with an excess of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 . Surviving viruses were isolated and subjected to three cycles of plaque-purification . To neutralize any possible revertant viruses, incubation with the selecting monoclonal antibodies was performed prior to each plaque-purification . Before use, viruses were tested by differential neutralization 12 with the selecting monoclonal antibodies and negative control antibody, 7 .16 .17 ; if the titers of the two assays were within 1 log 10 unit of each other, the virus was considered to be resistant to neutralization . Viruses failing to meet this criterion were considered revertants and were discarded . Clinical observations . The clinical status of infected mice was judged by a modification of the criteria of Brown et al." Animals were considered normal if they appeared alert and could turn over within 2 seconds after being placed on their backs . Mice that had a waddling gait and inability to rapidly turn over were scored as having mild paralysis . Mice with frank hindleg immobility were scored as having severe paralysis . Animals with hyperirritability or myoclonus were judged to have mild encephalitic signs ; seizures, persistent turning, or static, hunched postures were considered to be signs of severe encephalitis . Mice were scored by a single examiner after the cages had been coded with randomized numbers . Histology. Brain and spinal cords were embedded in paraffin or epon and stained as previously described . 12 The severity of histologic lesions was assessed by grading randomized, coded microscopic sections . Gray matter involvement was considered severe if lesions were extensive and there was marked inflammatory cell infiltration and neuronophagia ; lesser degrees of involvement were scored moderate or mild . White matter involvement was considered severe if there was intense, widespread inflammatory infiltrates with rarefaction ; white matter involvement with less inflammation and no tissue rarefaction was scored as moderate or mild, depending on the extent of lesions . Demyelination was evaluated in paraffin-embedded sections stained with luxol fast blue or with epon-embedded sections stained with toluidine blue . For immunohistochemistry, sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were stained by an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), using monoclonal antibodies to the JHMV N protein 23 as primary antibodies .
