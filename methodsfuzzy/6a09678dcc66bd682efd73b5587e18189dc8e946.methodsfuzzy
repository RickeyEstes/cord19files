Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weightmismatched pairs of adult mongrel dogs. Dogs weighing from 20 to 21 kg were used as donors, and smaller dogs weighing from 15 to 17.5 kg were used as recipients. The donor/recipient body weight ratio ranged from 1.2 to 1.25. Weight-mismatched pairs of dogs were used because Fujita and associates 15 found that the donor/recipient body ratio had an important effect on early graft function; a donor/recipient body weight ratio of 1.2 or greater was associated with stable graft function. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without CPB; group 2, in which transplantation was done with CPB and CPB flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with CPB and ultrafiltration was used until the termination of CPB.
