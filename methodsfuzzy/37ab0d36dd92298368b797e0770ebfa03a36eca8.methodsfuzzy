Synthesis of peptide-PMO conjugates. Peptides were synthesized by standard Fmoc chemistry and purified by highperformance liquid chromatography. The PMO sequence (5 ′-GGCCAAACCTCGGCTTACCTGAAAT-3′) was purchased from Gene Tools LLC (Corvallis, OR). Peptides were conjugated to PMO through an amide linkage at the 3′ end of the PMO, followed by purification by high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS as previously described in preliminary communication. 32 Full details of synthesis including improvements to the experimental procedures are described in detail in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Peptide-PMO conjugates were dissolved in sterile water and filtered through a 0.22-µm cellulose acetate membrane before use. Conjugates of PMO of Pip6a, Pip6b, Pip6e, and Pip6f were found to be predominantly stable and of similar stability to Pip5e-PMO in 100% serum for 2 hours at 37 °C, as seen by high-performance liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis. The conjugates all showed similar degradation patterns, and intact conjugates were still observed up to 4 hours (data not shown). In vitro assays: exon skipping in mdx mouse myotubes. H2K mdx myotubes were prepared and incubated with peptide-PMO conjugates in the absence of any transfection agent at concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 µmol/l by the method described previously. 29 The products of nested RT-PCR from total isolated RNA were examined by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Quantification of ∆23 transcript levels was calculated using densitometry. The MTS cell viability test (Promega, Madison, WI) showed 100% survival at the highest concentrations of peptide-PMO conjugates used in the study (data not shown). Animals and intravenous injections. Four and a half month old to 5½-month-old mdx mice were used in these experiments (n = 3). The experiments were carried out in the Biomedical Sciences Unit, University of Oxford according to procedures authorized by the UK Home Office. Pip6-PMO conjugates were prepared in 0.9% saline solution at a final dose of 12.5 mg/kg. The 160 µl total volume was administered via the tail vein of anaesthetized mice. Two weeks later mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation, and muscles and other tissues harvested and snap-frozen in cooled isopentane before storage at -80 °C. Immunohistochemistry and quantification of dystrophin expression. Transverse sections of tissue samples were cut (8-µm thick) for the examination of dystrophin expression. For dystrophin visualisation and quantification, sections were costained with rabbit-anti-dystrophin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rat anti-laminin (Sigma, St Louis, MO), and detected by goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G Alexa 594 and goat-antirat immunoglobulin G 488 secondary antibodies, respectively (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Images were captured using a Leica DM IRB microscope and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described. 16, 34 A representative image for each treatment was taken. For quantification, four representative frames of the dystrophin and correlating laminin were taken for each section (n = 3) of the quadriceps, diaphragm and heart for each treatment. Using ImagePro software, 10 regions of interest were randomly placed on the laminin image which was overlaid on the corresponding dystrophin image. The minimum and maximum fluorescence intensity for 120 regions were recorded for each treatment. The intensity difference was calculated for each region to correct for background fluorescence and untreated mdx and treated mdx were normalized to C57BL10. These values were plotted on a scatter graph. The "relative intensity means" were calculated using a multilevel statistics model. Using these values, the percentage recovery score was calculated by implementing the following equation, as described on the TREAT-NMD website (http://www.treat-nmd.eu/downloads/file/sops/dmd/MDX/ DMD_M.1.1_001.pdf): (dystrophin recovery of treated mdx mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice)/(dystrophin recovery of C57BL10 mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice). Staining of dystrophin associated proteins was performed as previously described 29 using a MOM blocking kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and α-sarcoglycan and α-dystroglycan (Novocastra, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK) antibodies (1:100 dilution). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase staining was performed using a goat anti-rabbit antibody (Abcam). Exon skipping in mdx mouse tissues. Total RNA was extracted from control and treated mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR: Four hundred nanograms of RNA template was used in a 50 µl reverse transcription reaction using One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and gene-specific primers (Ex 20-26, Fwd: 5′-CAG AAT TCT GCC AAT TGC TGA G-3′, Rev: 5′-TTC TTC AGC TTG TGT CAT CC-3′). Cycle conditions: 50 °C for 30 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 94 °C, 1 minute at 58 °C, and 2 minutes at 72 °C. Two microliters of cDNA was further amplified in a 50 µl nested PCR (QIAGEN PCR kit) using the following cycle control, mdx untreated and Pip6g-and Pip6h-PMO-treated mice. Dystrophin immunostaining in TA, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, diaphragm, heart, and abdomen muscle groups for C57BL10, mdx-untreated and mdx-treated mice are shown.

Ten micrograms of total protein was loaded (TA, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, diaphragm, heart, and abdomen muscles) relative to 50% (5 µg protein) and 10% (1 µg) C57BL10 controls, and normalized to α-actinin loading protein (for quantification, see Supplementary Figure S3c) . PMO, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide. conditions: 94 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 1 minute, and 72 °C for 1 minute for 24 cycles (Ex 20-26: Fwd: CCC AGT CTA CCA CCC TAT CAG AGC, Rev: CCT GCC TTT AAG GCT TCC TT). PCR products were examined by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Quantitative real time PCR: Two micrograms of RNA was reverse transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA Synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). Exon skipping qPCR was performed using Syber green Kits (Applied Biosystems), primer sets (IDT) and the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primer sets used were as follows: total dystrophin transcripts, ex19-20: Fwd: GCCATAG-CACGAGAAAAAGC, Rev: GCATTAACACCCTCATTTGC; Delta23 dmd transcript, Fwd: GCG CTA TCA GGA GAC AAT GAG, Rev: GTT TTT ATG TGA TTC TGT AAT TTC CC. Plasmids (total dystrophin and delta 23 skipped) were used for the standard curve. Protein extraction and western blot. Control and treated muscle samples were homogenised in lysis buffer comprising 75 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) and 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate complemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 minutes before centrifugation and removal of supernatant. Protein levels were measured by Bradford assay (Sigma) and quantified using BSA standards. Ten to fifteen micrograms of protein of untreated and treated mdx sample, and 50% and 10% of these concentrations of C57BL10 protein (positive control) were loaded onto 3-8% Tris-Acetate gels. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed for dystrophin using DYS1 (Novocastra) and loading control, α-actinin (Sigma), antibodies. Primary antibody was detected by binding of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G with lumigen. Western blots were imaged (LiCOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and analyzed using the Odyssey imaging system. Clinical biochemistry. Plasma samples were taken from the jugular vein of mdx mice immediately following sacrifice by CO 2 inhalation. Analysis of toxicity biomarkers was performed by a clinical pathology lab, Mary Lyon Centre, MRC, Harwell, UK. Statistical analysis. All data reported mean values ± SEM. A multilevel, repeated measures model was implemented for this study. The multilevel statistical approach builds upon traditional statistical methods and is being increasingly implemented in the social, medical and biological sciences. [38] [39] [40] [41] The model used for this study takes into account the multiple "relative intensity units" (level 1) for each mouse (level 2) for each treatment (level 3) as performed in the immunohistochemical staining quantification. In this example mdx untreated mice and Pip5e-PMO-treated mice were applied as the constant/ fixed parameter, to which the other treatments and wild-type control were compared. This was following a Box-Cox power transformation which was performed to ensure a normal distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using MLwIN version 2.25. Figure S1 .
