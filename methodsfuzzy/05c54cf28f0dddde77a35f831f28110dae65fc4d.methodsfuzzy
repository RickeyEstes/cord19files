Infectious disease transmission study is a rapidly developing field given the recent advent of widely available epidemiological, social contact, social networking and pathogen genomic data. In this section we briefly review multimodal integration methods for combining pathogen genomic data and epidemiological data in a single analysis, for inferring infection transmission trees and epidemic dynamic parameters. Advances in genomic technology such as sequences of whole genomes of RNA viruses and identifying Single Nucleotide Variations using sensitive mass spectrometry have enabled the tracing of transmission patterns and mutational parameters of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus [45] . In this study, phylogenetic trees were inferred based on Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP ‚ÅÑ ) using a maximum likelihood criterion [46] . Mutation rate was then inferred based on a model which assumes that the number of mutations observed between an isolate and its Fig. 3 . Study design and inclusion-exclusion criteria. This is a decision tree showing our searches and selection criteria for both PubMed and Google Scholar. We focused only on genomic epidemiology methods utilizing Bayesian inference for infectious disease transmission. ancestor is proportional to the mutation rate and their temporal difference [47] . Their estimated mutation rate was similar to existing literature on mutation rates of other viral pathogens. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed three major branches in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Gardy et al. [29] analyzed a tuberculosis outbreak in British Columbia in 2007 using whole-genome pathogen sequences and contact tracing using social network information. Epidemiological information collection included completing a social network questionnaire to identify contact patterns, high-risk behaviors such as cocaine and alcohol usage, and possible geographical regions of spread. Pathogen genomic data consisted of restriction-fragmentlength polymorphism analysis of tuberculosis isolates. Phylogenetic inference of genetic lineage based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms from the genomic data was performed. Their method demonstrated that transmission information inference such as identifying a possible source patient from contact tracing by epidemiological investigation can be refined by adding ancestral and diversity information from genomic data. In one of the earliest attempts to study genetic sequence data, as well as dates and locations of samples in concert, Jombart et al. [38] proposed a maximal spanning tree graph-based approach that went beyond existing phylogenetic methods. This method was utilized to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of the influenza A (H1N1) from 2009 and to study its worldwide spread. A total of 433 gene sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and of neuraminidase (NA) were obtained from GenBank. Classical phylogenetic approaches fail to capture the hierarchical relationship between both ancestors and descendants sampled at the same time. Using their algorithm called SeqTrack [48] , the authors constructed ancestries in samples based on a maximal-spanning tree. SeqTrack [38] utilizes the fact that in the absence of recombination and reverse mutations, strains will have unique ancestors characterized by the fewest possible mutations, no sample can be the ancestor of a sample which temporally preceded it, and the likelihood of ancestry can be estimated from the genomic differentiation between samples. SeqTrack was successful in reconstructing the transmission trees in both completely and incompletely sampled outbreaks unlike phylogenetic approaches, which failed to capture ancestral relationships between the tips of trees. However, this method cannot capture the underlying within-host virus genetic parameters. Moreover, mutations generated once can be present in different samples and transmission likelihood based on genetic distance may not be reliable. The above methods exploit information from different modalities separately. Recent methodological advancements have seen simultaneous integration of multiple modalities of data in singular Bayesian inference frameworks. In the following section we discuss state-of-the-art approaches based on Bayesian inference, to reconstruct partially-observed transmission trees and multiple origins of pathogen introduction in a host population [25, 34, 35, 49, 50] . We specifically focus on Bayesian likelihood-based methods as the methods consider heterogeneous modalities in a single framework and simultaneously infer the transmission network and epidemic parameters such as rate of infection transmission and rate of recovery. Several simplifying assumptions have been made in the reviewed Bayesian studies, limiting their applicability across different epidemic situations. In Cottam's [40] approach, the phylogenetic trees generated from the genomic data are weighed by epidemiological factors to limit analysis to possible transmission trees. However, sequential approaches may not be ideal to reconstruct transmission trees and a method that combines all modalities in a single likelihood function may be necessary. Ypma et al. [25] assumed that pathogen mutations emerge in the host population immediately before or following infections. Moreover, the approach weighed each data type via their likelihood functions and considers each data type independent of the others, which may not be a realistic assumption. Jombart et al. [38] also inferred ancestral relationships to the most closely sampled ancestor as all ancestors may not be sampled. Morelli et al. [24] assumed flat priors for all model parameters. However, the method was estimated with the prior for the duration from latency to infection centered on the lesion age making the method sensitive to it and to veterinary assessment of infection age. The method developed by Mollentze et al. [49] required knowledge of epidemiology for infection and incubation periods. Identifying parents of infected nodes, as proposed by Teunis et al., [56] assumes that all infectious cases were observed which may not be true in realistic, partiallyobserved outbreaks. Didelot et al. [26] developed a framework based on a timed phylogenetic tree, which infers within-host evolutionary dynamics with a constant population size and denselysampled outbreaks. Several of these approaches rely on assumptions of denselysampled outbreaks, a single pathogen introduction in the population, single infected index cases, samples capturing the entire outbreak, that all cases comprising the outbreak are observed, existence of single pathogen strains, and all nodes in the transmission network having constant infectiousness and the same rate of transmission. However, in real situations the nodes will have different infectiousness and rate of spreading from animal to animal, or human to human. Moreover, the use of clinical data only is nonrepresentative of how infection transmits to a population as it generally only captures the most severely affected cases. Our literature review is summarized in Table 1 .
