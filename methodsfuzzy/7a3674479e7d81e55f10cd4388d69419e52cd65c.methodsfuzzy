Demand for the Expo consists of international inbound tourists (hereafter foreign tourists) and domestic visitors, which are broken down into adult and adolescent visitors. Specific forecasting procedures are described for each of these groups. Twenty-seven of the 29 panel members responded to both the first and second rounds of the Delphi survey, representing a 93.1% of response rate ( Table 7) . The mean and median varied little between the two rounds changing by 0.3% and 1.4%, whereas, the mode decreased by 12.5%. In round two, these statistics in magnitudes vary by approximately 3%. Standard deviations of forecasted demand decreased from 1,240,500 in the 1st round to 887,300 in the 2nd round. Skewness and kurtosis decreased for 2nd round as compared to 1st round. In addition, the lowest forecast increased from 4 million in the 1st round to 5 million in the 2nd round, whereas the highest forecast decreased from 9 million in the 1st round to 8.5 million in the 2nd round. Taking all statistics into account, it appears that convergence in forecasts by the experts has occurred between two rounds of the Delphi survey. Given the mean, median, and mode values are similar, the mean value is used as the forecasts by the panel members. Based on the mean value, panel members predicted 6.8 million foreign and domestic visitors to the Expo. The 95% confidence interval ranges from a lower bound of 6.4 million to an upper bound of 7.1 million visitors. Comments by some of the experts indicated that the distance from major metropolitan cities to the Expo site would act as a major barrier to discourage people to visit the Expo. On the other hand, a few experts stated that the Expo event would act as an attraction to encourage people to visit Yeosu.
