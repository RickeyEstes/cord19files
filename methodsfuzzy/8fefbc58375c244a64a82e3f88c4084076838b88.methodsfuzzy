Expression vectors. E. coli expression constructs were generated by ligationindependent cloning (LIC) using the pET46Ek/LIC system (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Wild-type NSP4-EGFP was constructed by inserting the SA11 NSP4 (GenBank accession no. AF087678.1) coding region into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Internal deletions and mutations were generated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or encoding the desired mutation in the forward primer, and all constructs were sequenced (Lone Star Laboratories, Houston, TX). E. coli lysis assay. Assessment of NSP4 viroporin activity in E. coli was performed essentially as described previously (31) . Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB and grown until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) was 0.4 to 0.6, and 1 mM IPTG was added to induce protein expression. OD 600 measurements of each culture were taken before IPTG induction and at 10-min intervals postinduction for 90 min using a multiwell plate spectrophotometer. Immunoblot analysis. Samples were mixed with sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, run on 4 to 20% Tris-glycine or 10 to 20% Tris-Tricine polyacryamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corporation, Piscataway, NJ) as previously described (59) . Bacterially expressed NSP4 47-90 -His was partially purified using Ni 2ϩ -nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) as previously described (59) and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above, except sample buffer lacking BME was used under nonreducing conditions. Antibodies used were NSP4 MAb B4-2/55 ascites, anti-Penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), anti-EGFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech), anti-GM130 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), and anti-STIM-1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). E. coli viability assay. Stationary-phase cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) for the indicated NSP4 constructs were serially diluted in LB (without ampicillin), and 100 l of each dilution was plated on LB-ampicillin plates in the absence or presence of 1 mM IPTG. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C, and the number of CFU per milliliter was calculated. Membrane protein fractionation. BL21(DE3)pLysS broth cultures were grown to an OD 600 of 0.5 to 0.6, and protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and cultured for 1 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (21,000 ϫ g, 1 h) and resuspended in 5 ml ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (total protein lysate fraction [T]). A 1-ml aliquot was sonicated in PBS using a probe sonicator (soluble protein fraction [S]). The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 ϫ g, 1 h) and resuspended in 1 ml 100 mM sodium carbonate for 30 min on ice (peripheral membrane protein fraction [P]). The membranes were again pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml 1% SDS-PBS (integral membrane protein fraction [I]). Equal buffer volumes were used to maintain the same relative protein concentration as that of the starting material. Equivalent amounts of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells and transfection. African green monkey MA104 kidney cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained and transfected as previously described (45) . In experiments using N-(benzyloxycarbonyl) leucinylleucinylleucinal-Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132), at 4 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh Opti-MEM containing 50 M MG132. In all cases, cells were incubated overnight at 37°C. Confocal microscopy. MA104 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were stained with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen), and coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong gold antifade reagents (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Mounted slides were observed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 63ϫ immersion oil objective (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The pinhole was set to 1, and pixel time was set at 3.20 s for 16 scanning averages per track on each slice, and Z-stack slices were set to 1 m. The collected images were processed using LSM 510 image software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Indo-1 calcium measurements. Indo-1 (50 g; Molecular Probes) was resuspended in 50 l 20% F-127 and 50 l fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C. The Indo-1 loading buffer used was Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (HBSS-BSA) and 1.8 M Indo-1. At approximately 28 h posttransfection, the cells were gently washed with HBSS-BSA, and Indo-1 loading buffer was added for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in alpha-MEM (no phenol red) plus 10% FBS plus 10 mM HEPES, and maintained at 37°C until analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using an LSRII system running FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Indo-1 fluorescence was excited by a UV laser (355 nm), and Ca 2ϩ -free and Ca 2ϩ -bound emissions were split using a 505LP dichroic filter. Ca 2ϩ -free emission was collected with a 525/50-nm band-pass filter, and the Ca 2ϩ -bound emission was collected with a 405/20-nm band-pass filter. EGFP fluorescence was excited by the argon laser (488 nm), and emission was collected with a 520/20-nm band-pass filter. The mean bound Ca 2ϩ -to-free Ca 2ϩ fluorescence ratio (R) was determined for each sample. The concentration of calcium was calculated by using the following equation: Ca 2ϩ (nM) ϭK d (R Ϫ R min )S f2 /(R max Ϫ R)S b2 . Treatment of cells with 10 mM EDTA and 5 M ionomycin was used to determine the fluorescence ratios at zero (R min ) and saturated (R max ) calcium, respectively. S f2 and S b2 are the fluorescence intensities of the calcium-free and -bound dyes, respectively. The dissociation constant of Indo-1 is 250 nM. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results are presented at the mean calculated calcium level. Puncta formation assay. MA104 cells were either loaded with 50 M BAPTA-AM for 1 h at 37°C at 4 h posttransfection or maintained in normal medium. At approximately 20 h posttransfection, a subset of the transfected cells were treated with 1 M thapsigargin (TG) for 3 h, and then, all the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The number of NSP4-EGFP-expressing cells containing diffuse rather than punctate NSP4-EGFP was counted in 25 random fields per well using the 40ϫ lens objective on an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Cells with a completely uniform reticular NSP4-EGFP distribution were scored as having no puncta; however, cells with the presence of even one punctate structure were scored as having puncta. Statistical analysis. Statistical differences between groups were determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. P values of Ͻ0.05 were considered significant.
