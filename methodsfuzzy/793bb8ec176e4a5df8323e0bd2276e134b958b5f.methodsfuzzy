Establishing ASC-Derived Human AOs. The generation of four lines ASCderived human AOs was based on the previous protocol (14) with a success rate of 100%. Briefly, with ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 13-364) and informed consent of the patients, small pieces of normal lung tissue (∼0.2-0.6 cm 2 in size) adjacent to the diseased tissues were obtained from patients who underwent resection. The tissues were minced and digested with 2 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) for 1-2 h at 37°C, followed by shearing using a glass Pasteur pipette (Drummond) and straining over a 100-μm cell strainer (FALCON). The resultant single cells were embedded in 60% Matrigel (Growth Factor Reduced Basement Membrane Matrix; Corning) and were seeded in 24-well suspension culture plates (Greiner Bio-One). After solidification, Matrigel droplets were maintained with AO culture medium (SI Appendix, Table S1 ) at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . The organoids were passaged every 2-3 wk. The bright-field images of the organoids were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 Inverted Routine Microscope. PD of Human AOs. The AOs were split and maintained in AO medium for 3-7 d. The culture medium in half of the organoids was changed to PD medium, PneumaCult-ALI medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 μM DAPT (Tocris). The organoids were then cultured in AO or PD medium for 16 d. Bright-field images were taken every 3 d. Diameters of individual organoids were measured with ImageJ (NIH). The movies of organoids were acquired using a total internal reflection fluorescent (TIRF) microscope (Movie S1) and a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 Inverted Microscope System (Movies S2 and S3). At the indicated times, the organoids in the different media were harvested for detection of cellular gene expression or for flow cytometry analysis. Establishing 2D Differentiated AOs with Transwell Culture. Transwell culture of AOs was performed as described elsewhere (24, 25) with modifications. Briefly, the organoids were dissociated into single-cell suspensions after digested with 10× TrypLE Select Enzyme (Invitrogen) for 1-5 min at 37°C, sheared using a Pasteur pipette, and strained over a 40-μm filter. Approximately 3.5 × 10 5 cells were seeded into each Transwell insert (product no. 3494; Corning). The cells were cultured in AO medium at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 for 1-2 d. When cells reached >90% confluence, the AO medium was changed to PD medium in both the apical and basal chambers. The medium was changed every other day, and the cells were maintained for 14 d. TEER was measured every other day using a Millicell ERS-2 Volt-Ohm Meter (EMD Millipore). To assess the integrity of the 2D organoid monolayer as an epithelial barrier, at day 12 after seeding, FITC-dextran with an average molecular weight of 10,000 (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the medium in the upper chamber at a concentration of 1 mg/mL followed by incubation at 37°C for 4 h. Subsequently, the culture media were harvested from the upper and bottom chambers to detect the fluorescence intensity using the Victor XIII Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). eggs at 37°C for 36 h. The eggs were chilled overnight at 4°C; then the virus-containing allantoic fluid was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay.
