Flavonols identified as 8, 10, 12, 20, 21, 28, 29, 31, 32 and 34 were purchased from Sigma and others were synthesized [26] . Flavones identified as 49, 54, 55 and 57 were synthesized [26] and others were purchased from Sigma. Compounds were assayed for their toxicity to MA104 cells by microscopical morphology evaluation [27, 28] and for their antirotavirus activity (Wa-1 strain) by cytopathogenicity inhibition [29] . They were dissolved in 1% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) diluted in 199 medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and filtered through 0.22 μm membranes (Millipore, Bedfore, MA, USA). All stock solutions were stored at 4°C protected from light until used. The used cell line was MA104 cells (Biological Science Institute, University of São Paulo, Brazil), grown in 199 Medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, New York, USA), penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and amphotericin B (0.025 μg/ml) (Gibco BRL, New York, USA). The cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The human rotavirus Wa-1 (ATCC: VR2018) was used and it was propagated in MA104 cells in the presence of trypsin (Sigma, 5 μg/ml). Stock viruses were prepared as previously described by Barardi et al. [27] and the supernatant fluids were harvested, titrated and stored at − 80°C until used. Virus titers were estimated from cytopathogenicity by the limit-dilution method and expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose per ml (TCID 50 /ml). The CC 50 (cytotoxic concentration for 50% of cells) and IC 50 (inhibitory concentration for 50% of infected cells) values were estimated from concentration-effect curves after linear regression analysis, and represent the mean values of three independent experiments. The selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /IC 50 ) was calculated for each tested flavonoid. According to Sidwell [30] , when SI ≥ 4 promising antiviral activity must be considered.
