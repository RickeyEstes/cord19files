For preparation of viral antigen, the TO-163 strain of TGE virus (Harada et al., 1967; Furuuchi et al., 1975) was propagated in cultures of the CPK cell line derived from swine kidney (Komaniwa et al., 1981) . Infectious culture fluid was concentrated about 10-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, layered onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (10--60%) in a Beckman SW25.2 rotor and centrifuged at 24 000 r.p.m, for 2 h. The virus bands formed were collected, mixed with an equal volume of fluorocarbon (Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo) and vigorously shaken for 2 min. The water phase separated by centrifugation was layered onto a linear sucrose density gradient (10-60%) in a Beckman SW25.2 rotor and centrifuged at 24 000 r.p.m, for 4 h. Fractions with densities of 1.18--1.20 g ml -I were pooled and centrifuged at 77 000 × g for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in a 1/500 volume of NTE buffer (0.1 M NaC1, 0.01 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.001 M EDTA). The suspension was treated with 1% Triton X-100 at 4°C for 1 h and dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M NaC1, 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Supernatant fluid from CPK cell cultures was concentrated 10-fold by ammonium Sulfate precipitation and used as the control antigen. For the ELISA, virus antigen prepared as above was appropriately diluted with carbonate buffer (0.05 M, pH 9.6) and delivered in 100-~1 volumes into wells of 96-well, flat-bottomed Microelisa plates (Dynatech Lab., U.S.A.). The plates were allowed to stand overnight at 4°C, washed four times with 0.85% NaC1 solution containing 0.02% Tween-20, and 100 pl of the test serum diluted 100-fold with PBS containing 10% calf serum and 0.05% Tween-20 was added to each well. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the plates were washed, and 100 gl of optimal dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody against porcine IgG (Miles Lab., U.S.A.) was added to each well. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, each well was washed, received 100 pl of substrate solution and was incubated at 25°C for 20 min in a dark room. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 0-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.1 mg m1-1 in 0.1 M citric acid--0.2 M Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 4.8) and adding 0.2 pl m1-1 of 30% H202. At the end of incubation, the reaction was stopped with 3 N H2SOa solution and absorbancy measurement was performed at a wave length of 492 nm. The value obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the control antigen from that of the viral antigen was taken as the ELISA value. Neutralization (NT) tests were carried out by the serum dilution method in CPK cell cultures prepared in flat-bottomed microplates (Coming Glass Works, Coming, NY) . In wells of a transfer plate, 25 pl of each of serial 2fold dilutions of the serum inactivated at 56°C for 30 min was mixed with 25 pl of maintenance medium containing 200 TCIDs0 of virus. Four wells were employed for each serum dilution. The virus--serum mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 60 min, transferred into wells of a microplate containing CPK cell cultures, and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37°C for 5 days. The antibody titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the antibody dilution showing 50% neutralization calculated by the method of K~ber.
