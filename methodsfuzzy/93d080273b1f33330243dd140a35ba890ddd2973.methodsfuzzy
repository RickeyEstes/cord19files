We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts -ASSIA, CINAHL plus (EBSCO) and SCOPUS -V.4 (Elsevier) from 1990 to 2015 (searches conducted January 2015). Search strategies were guided by a systematic approach to the research questions [35] and a Medline search strategy was developed (Table 1 ) and converted or modified to run on other databases (Additional file 1). We identified additional studies by searching on PubMed by using the "related citations" algorithm and screening the reference lists of included studies for other reviews [36] . The 11-point Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist [37] was used to assess the quality of each included review. This tool has been widely used in previous similar overviews and it is considered to be a valid and reliable instrument [38] . Using the AMSTAR scale two authors appraised each included paper. Reviews that scored eight or higher were considered at low risk of bias (high quality), between five and seven were at moderate risk of bias (moderate quality) and four or less were at high risk of bias (poor quality). The primary studies included in each review were also listed and compared across the reviews to assess the degree of overlap in the reviews comprising our overview.
