SARS is a typical case of a communicable disease about which a set of observed data has been obtained across space and time, and its potential determinants are available in a geographical information system (GIS) format. Below, several tools are considered for exploring epidemic determinants, spatial patterns and temporal processes on the basis of the available datasets. Certain statistics pairs share common elements that can be used to link these determinants, patterns and processes, and to formulate informative associations between them. In this study, it is assumed that the pair-wise linking of the various SARS determinants is mathematically represented by a system of the general form f(R, C, F, Q, s, t) Â¼ 0, which is constructed mainly on the basis of the available datasets. The underlying epidemic mechanisms (usually represented in terms of differential equations) are not considered in this formulation, but they will be the topic of forthcoming publications.
