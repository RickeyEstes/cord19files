IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, Maine, USA Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a globally-distributed oncogenic retrovirus that can cause fatal disease in cats. Immunoassays that detect FeLV p27 antigen and are readily used to aid in the diagnosis of FeLV have been commercially-available for more than two decades. While single-sample rapid test formats are preferred for in-clinic use, the microtiter plate format enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the methodology most commonly employed in reference laboratory settings to facilitate batch testing. However, current commercially-available microtiter plate format ELISAs for FeLV are not well suited for this purpose because they rely on manual wash steps, drop-wise addition of reagents from reagent bottles, and visual interpretation of results. The purpose of this study was to validate a microtiter plate format ELISA designed specifically to maintain performance while enhancing throughput in a reference laboratory setting. The FeLV microtiter plate format ELISA method validated in this study facilitates high throughput operation by combining parallel fluid transfer processes with automated data acquisition and results interpretation. The assay method is based on sequential orthogonal screening and confirmatory protocols. The screening protocol utilizes two distinct anti-FeLV p27 mouse monoclonal antibodies that produce a colorimetric response in samples containing FeLV p27 antigen. The confirmatory protocol requires neutralization of positive samples in a separate set of controlled assays using an anti-FeLV polyclonal antibody that blocks binding of the mouse monoclonal antibodies to FeLV p27 antigen and thereby inhibits color generation. The confirmatory step offers increased assurance of specificity by enabling discrimination between infected true positives and false positives associated with several factors including anti-mouse heterophilic antibodies in patient samples. Precision of the screening assay was determined using 3 samples (negative, low positive, and high positive). The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 3.9% to 7.9% while the interassay CV ranged from 6.0% to 8.6%. For the confirmatory assay, the same low positive and high positives samples were used demonstrating an intra-assay CV which ranged from 3.0% to 4.7% and an inter-assay CV between 7.4% and 9.7%. No interference was observed for either protocol at bilirubin, hemoglobin, and lipid concentrations up to 14.4 mg/dl, 550 mg/dl, and 6.4 OD 660 nm , respectively. The analytical sensitivity for FeLV p27 antigen was established at 1.7 ng/mL for inactivated whole FeLV and at 1.0 ng/mL for purified recombinant FeLV p27. Discriminating analytical specificity was demonstrated based on the absence of cross-reactivity to related retrovirus antigen from murine leukemia virus and Feline RD-114. Overall, the assay exhibited 100% diagnostic accuracy in 83 patient samples (n = 63 negative; n = 20 positive) with FeLV status defined on the combined basis of PCR (FeLV RealPCR; IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) and independent ELISA (ViraCHEK FeLV; Zoetis, Inc.). Results of this study validate that the new microtiter plate format ELISA is a highly specific, precise, and accurate method for detection of FeLV p27 antigen in feline patient samples and is appropriate for high-throughput applications in a reference laboratory setting. In small animal veterinary medicine, two of the most common pathogenic spirochete genera are Borrelia spp. and Leptospira spp.. While antibodies that develop against these organisms over the course of infection in dogs are thought to be genus specific, studies evaluating for cross-reactive antibodies against individual Borrelia spp. or Leptospira spp. peptides are for the most part lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine if Leptospira spp. antibodies induced by administration of one of four commercial vaccines would cross-react with the B. burgdorferi antigens used in a commercially available assay.
