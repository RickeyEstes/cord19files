We investigated the medical records and chest radiographic findings of six previously healthy children with MP, who were treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy at Nishi-Kobe Medical Center between January 1998 and December 2006. This is a pilot and retrospective study with a small number of subjects. During the study period, 190 children with MP were admitted to our institution. The mean age of the six children was 5.8 AE 2.3 years (range, 3e 9 years); three were male and three were female. Serological M. pneumoniae testing consists of M. pneumoniae IgM enzyme immunoassay (Meridian ImmunoCard Mycoplasma Meridian Bioscience, Inc, Cincinnati, OH) and particle agglutination (PA) method (Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Japan) using both acute and convalescent serum when available. MP was diagnosed in one patient based on positive results for IgM antibody in a single sample and in five patients by four-fold or greater rise in serum PA titers from the acute phase (<1:80[n Z 4]e1:160[n Z 1]) to convalescent phase (1:640e1:5120). All patients were treated initially with macrolides (erythromycin, clindamycin, or azithromycin), and in some cases, together with minocycline. Refractory pneumonia was defined as a case of prolonged fever and deterioration of radiological findings despite antibiotic treatment for 7 days or more. For the refractory cases, we intravenously administered methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days. Microbiologic tests, to exclude other respiratory tract infections, included blood cultures, nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab for common respiratory tract virus antigens (respiratory scincytial virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus), and serology for Chlamydia pneumoniae. None of the tests detected any of the other pathogens examined.
