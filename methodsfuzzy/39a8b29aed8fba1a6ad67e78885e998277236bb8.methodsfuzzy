A successful LAMP reaction produced many bands of different sizes upon agarose electrophoresis, since LAMP products consisted of several inverted-repeat structures. The amplification by LAMP showed a ladder-like pattern (Fig. 1) . The result indicated that the detection limit of the PPV LAMP was 5 copies whereas that of PCR was 25 copies per reaction (Table 3 ). The detection sensitivity of the PPV LAMP was therefore 5-fold better than that of the PCR. DNA extracted from tissues of healthy animals, pigs infected with CPV, B19V, PCV1, PCV2 and PRV were used as templates for PPV LAMP. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that PPV LAMP reaction did not detect CPV, B19V, PCV1, PCV2 or PRV and gave a negative reaction with tissues of healthy swine. Only with templates of PPV DNA did PPV primer set give the positive reaction.
