Chemicals. -Fongizone (Biopro, Mulhouse, France) was used as indicated by the supplier in the state of its delivery. ArnB (Sigma, Mo, USA) was dissolved in ethanol and used immediately. DOC was from Sigma. DEAE-dextran was purchased from Pharmacia (M W 500,000) and proteinase K (Boehringer, Mannheim, Western Germany) was dissolved (l mg/rnl) in distilled water and kept at -70째C. Cells and virus. -TOEV strai ns Purdue-US, D-52 and 188-S0, as well as swine testis (ST) and pig kidney (RPD) cell lines have been described elsewhere [1] . Virus stock was prepared by growing TOEV in RPD cells. The plaque assay of TOEY carried out on confluent monolayer ST cells in 6-welJ plastic plates (Costar) has also been described [1] . Effects of fongizone, ArnB and DOC. -TOEV was prepared (about 5 x 10 2 PFU per ml) in appropriate concentrations of these compounds. After the desired times of incubation at 37째C, 0.2-ml volumes of the preparation were removed and inoculated onto confluent monolayer cells. Following virus-cell incubation for 1 h at 37째C, the inocula were removed by washes with minimal essential medium (MEM), and agarose-overlay medium without serum was replaced for plaque formation. Virus suspensions treated with MEM and/or ethanol (at the same concentration as used in the ArnB-treated virus suspension) served as controls. Plaque size and numbers were also recorded when these compounds were added into agarose-overlay medium without serum to study their eff ects on virus after attachment. IFN titration. -Confluent monolayer cells in 6-well plates were infected with TOEV at a m.o.i. of 5 to 8 PFU per cell. The inocula were removed after 1 h of incubation at 37째C; fongizone and/or ArnB at different concentrations in MEM with or without 2 % bovine fcetal serum were replaced. Virus was harvested at 18 h postinoculation and titrated. IFN in the virus su spensions was also titrated [11] . TGEV-RNA infectivity. -Virus purification and phenol extraction of TGEV-RNA were performed according to the method described by Brian et 01. [4] . Precipitated viral RNA was diluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI and I mM EDTA pH 7.2) to obtain the initial virus volume (1 ml, virus titre: 10 9 PFU/rnl). To test infectivity, the RNA solution was serially two -fold diluted in the following solutions; MEM, MEM+DEAE-dextran (l00 ug/rnl), MEM +DEAE-dextran+AmB (2 ug/ml), MEM+DEAE-dextran+fongizone (2 ug/ml), MEM+AmB and MEM + fongizone. The RNA dilutions were inoculated into the cells grown to confluent monolayers in 24-welJ plastic plates (Costar). The cells were observed daily during the following 4 days, then frozen and thawed twice; the presence of TOEV was sought and identified by a seroneutralization test using specific antibody from previous studies [1, 14] .
