The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated by the paper-disk agar diffusion method described by Özer et al. [17] with some modification. Suspension in sterile water of the tested bacteria (0.1 mL of 10 5 cells per mL) was spread on the solid MH media plates. Paper disc (8 mm in diameter) were impregnated with the essential oil (25 mg/mL) and then placed on the surface of inoculated plates. These plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The diameter of the inhibition zones (DIZ) was measured by vernier calipers. Penicillin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin (2.5 μg/mL) were used as positive controls and the DMSO solution as negative control.
