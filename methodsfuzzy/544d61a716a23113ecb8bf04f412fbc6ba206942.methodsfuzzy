Preparation of vaccine antigens and PLGA nanoparticlekilled PRRSV vaccine (Nano-KAg) MARC-145 cell-monolayer was infected with the PRRSV VR2332 strain [22] at 0.001 MOI (multiplicity of infection), and the harvested infected cell culture fluid was clarified and subjected to ultracentrifugation (20% sucrose overlay) at 100,0006g for 2 hr at 4uC. The semi-purified viral pellet was suspended in PBS; titrated, inactivated by UV irradiation (at 254 nm UV-irradiation [EL series UV lamps, UVP, LLC (CA); 8 watt/115V -60 Hz/ 0.32 Amps] for 1 hr), sonicated, and the protein content was estimated using the BCA kit (Biorad, CA). Viral inactivation was confirmed by cell culture immunofluorescence assay in MARC-145 cells. The viral pellet was aliquoted and stored at 270uC. Control antigen was prepared similarly using uninfected MARC-145 cells. Sterile precautions were followed throughout the antigen preparation and processing procedures to avoid any bacterial contamination. Nanoparticles were prepared using standard double emulsion solvent evaporation technique [23, 24] . Briefly, 15% of PLGA 50/50 (750 mg) was dissolved in 5 mg of killed VR2332 proteins, homogenized at 6000 rpm for 90 seconds, then added to aqueous solution of 10% polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized. Finally, the preparation was stirred overnight and the washed nanoparticles were freeze-dried and stored at 4uC. The amount of entrapped PRRSV protein in the nanoparticles was determined as described previously [25] . The size and shape of nanoparticles was determined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3500N).
