Subjects with CF were recruited from both the inpatient and outpatient services at the Royal Children's Hospital and The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Inclusion criteria were age .9 years, a confirmed diagnosis of CF and culture of P aeruginosa or B cepacia complex from sputum on at least one occasion within the previous 12 months. Exclusion criteria included known pregnancy, pneumothorax within the previous 6 months, history of cough syncope or vomiting associated with coughing. After the first subject experienced recurrence of mild haemoptysis during the cough study, we excluded those with haemoptysis in the previous 7 days. Subjects were excluded from hypertonic saline inhalation if there was a history of intolerance of hypertonic saline, presence of asthma symptoms or a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) (40% predicted and no previous trials of hypertonic saline. Subjects were asked to withhold all nebulised therapy for 12 h prior to testing.
