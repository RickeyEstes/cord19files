The studies with rats were all performed in accordance with the protocols required by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Forty-five male Wistar rats (6-7 weeks old), weighing 200 720 g, were purchased from the Institute of Experimental Animals, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). The rats were randomly and equally divided into three treatment groups (nÂ¼ 15, each), and fasted overnight (14 to 16 h) prior to oral administration of a low-(10 g/kg body weight, 0.5 g/mL), moderate-(20 g/kg body weight, 1 g/mL) or high-(40 g/kg body weight, 2 g/mL) dose YPFS decoction. Blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes by retro-orbital plexus puncture at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the oral dose. A kinetic study was carried out; data from at least 5 rats was recorded at each time point. After centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min, 4 1C), plasma samples were stored at -80 1C until used for analysis. All pharmacokinetic parameters were processed by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, USA). Fig. 2A) . Therefore, these ions were selected for quantification using selected ion monitoring mode in multiple channels (Fig. 2B) . A gradient elution was employed to reduce retention time and avoid excessive broadening of the peaks. Under the developed chromatographic conditions, the retention times were approximately 16.2 min for cycloastragenol, 10.5 min formononetin, 7.3 min for calycosin, 6.5 min for GMV, and 4.8 min for cimifugin. ProElut TM C18-U SPE cartridges were used for the preparation of plasma samples not only because of their absorption capacity for non-polar compounds but also for polar compounds. Trichloroacetic acid was used to precipitate the protein and the diluted plasma to avoid blocking the SPE cartridge. Polysaccharides, phospholipids, proteins, and interfering compounds can be removed by deionized water, reducing the matrix effect of the sample and improving sensitivity to the constituents. Methanol-water was used to reconstitute the dry residue to produce better peaks. In summary, the method of sample preparation achieved satisfactory results simultaneously for the five constituents. Based on the results of the trial test, the respective lower limits of determination for cycloastragenol, formononetin, calycosin, GMV, and cimifugin were set at 0.18, 0.17, 0.17, 0.18, and 0.17 ng/mL; the lower limits of quantification at 0.54, 0.51, 0.51, 0.53, and 0.51 ng/mL; and the upper limits of quantification at 54. 25, 50.75, 50.75, 52.50, and 1736 .00 ng/mL (Table 1 ). All standard curves exhibited good linearity in the selected ranges. The square of the correlation coefficient (r 2 ) for cycloastragenol, formononetin, calycosin, GMV, and cimifugin were 0.9998, 1.0000, 0.9999, 0.9999, and 0.9940, respectively. The extraction recoveries determined for all analytes at three concentrations were Z88.42%, with relative standard deviation values r10.38%. The matrix effects ranged from 88.08% to 113.17%, with relative standard deviation values r9.20% (Table 2) . The precision relative standard deviation values for intra-day and inter-day ranged from 3.19% to 10.95% in the quality control samples; the accuracy (i.e., relative recovery, RR) ranged from 95% to 115% (Table 3) . The stability results showed that all analytes were stable in plasma samples after 4 h at room temperature (RR: 85.41-110.75%), 12 h under auto-sampler conditions after preparation (RR: 88.41-102.02%), and two freeze-thaw cycles (RR: 92.73-104.96%), except for calycosin at the lowest level (Table 4) . Thus, subjecting samples to repeated freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.
