The study performed a panel regression test based on Eq. (4a) to examine the association between GTA and GS by incorporating the potential influences of MRs into the test equation: where GS it is the sales growth rate of hotel i at the month t. Similarly, Eq. (4b) is used to test the relationship between GTA and HERs: If GTA can significantly (positively) affect GS (HER), the coefficient b 11 (b 21 ) is expected to be significantly positive and different from zero, since a high GTA would benefit GS (HER). The panel regression tests given in Eqs. (4a) and (4b) can be estimated based on the OLS estimation. The study also used a quantile regression method for panel data to analyze whether the relationship between GTA and GS/HER is sensitive to different quantiles of HER dispersions. The quantile regression is more robust and generates more efficient estimates compared to the OLS regression because the quantile regression allows us to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables at any specific quantile. The quantile regression to estimate the effect of GTA on GS/HER for quantiles is given as (Koenker, 2005) : where y is a dependent variable, x is a vector of independent variables and ˇ is a vector of coefficients. The estimates of ˇ for a given (ˆ ) in Eq. (5a) are obtained by minimizing weighted deviations from the conditional quantile: where the conditional distribution of the dependent variable y (GS/HER) is characterized by different values of the th quantile given x (GTA and MR), ∈ (0, 1) and is a weighting factor called a check function defined as: where u t = y t − x tˇ. The quantile regression coefficientˆ determines the dependence relationship between GTA and the th conditional quantile of GS/HER, which offers a broader picture, showing the link between GTA and GS/HER.
