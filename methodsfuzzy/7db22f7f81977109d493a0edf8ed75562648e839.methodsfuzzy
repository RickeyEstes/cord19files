Bacterial Strains, Vectors, and Enzymes E. coli DH5a (maintained in our laboratory) was used for subcloning and plasmid amplification. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, USA) was used as the expression host. The linearized pSUMO vector with Bsa I and Xho I restriction sites and T7 promoter and kanamycin resistance and 66His sequence was purchased from LifeSensors (LifeSensors, Malvern, PA, USA). SUMO protease containing a histidine-tag was also the product of Lifesensors (Malvern, PA, USA). All the restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Takara Biotech Co. Ltd (Dalian, China). Strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 were purchased from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC, China) and cultured according to the method provided by CGMCC.
