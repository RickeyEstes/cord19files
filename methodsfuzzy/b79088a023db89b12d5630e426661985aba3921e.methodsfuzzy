Protein sequence data from all subtypes of HA and NA The amino acid sequences of HA and NA were obtained from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) Influenza Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ FLU, accessed 15th March 2012) [5] . To fully understand the distributed regularity of the glycosites in each subtype, we downloaded the 29 sets of HA and NA with the customized definition ''.{serotype} {strain} {segname}'' using the following combinations: H1Nx,H17Nx and HyN1,HyN10 (where x and y represent ''any'' by default), in addition to the HA and NA from the H5N1 virus. All the sequence alignments of the various HAs and NAs were performed using Clustal 2.0. Repetitive, incomplete and mixed sequences were removed. For the purpose of convenience, one representative sequence with the generally longest length from each subtype was chosen for further description (Table S1 and S2). To assess the relationship between the distributed regularity of the glycosites in the envelope glycoproteins and the evolutionary position of various HAs and NAs, firstly, the preliminary trees for each HA and NA subtype were constructed using all available sequences; secondly ten representative sequences from discrepant clades, with consideration of host source and areas, were picked up (excluding H14, H17 and N10 due to limited records). Finally, the phylogenetic trees of HA and NA were constructed by these hundreds of sequences (File S1). The phylogenetic trees of the HA and NA were constructed by MEGA5.05 with N-J methods and a p-distance model with a bootstrap value of 1000 [41, 42] .
