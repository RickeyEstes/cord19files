Five general approaches are used to detect organisms and the host response to specific infections: microscopy, culture, detection of bacterial antigens or nucleic acids, and detection of antibodies directed against the organism (see Table 16 -4). An overview of detection methods for bacteria is summarized in this section. Table 16 -5 is a summary of the stains used to detect bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Bacteria are detected most commonly with differential (e.g., Gram, acid-fast, Giemsa) and fluorescent stains (acridine orange, auramine-rhodamine stains). The Gram stain is a simple, yet reliable stain that can provide important preliminary information on whether a bacterial infection is caused by a gram-negative or a gram-positive organism and whether the organism is a rod or a coccus. An experienced microscopist can further classify organisms based on subtle differences in morphology or special arrangements of the cells. For example, staphylococci are gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters; streptococci are gram-positive cocci arranged in chains; S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus are gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs; Enterobacteriaceae are gram-negative rods that stain more intensely at the ends rather than the center [bipolar staining]; Pseudomonas, Stenotroph omonas, and Burkholderia are small gram-negative rods frequently arranged in pairs; Acinetobacter are fat, coccobacilli that retain crystal violet when stained and resemble gram-positive cocci. Nocardia, mycobacteria, yeasts, and molds may also stain with the Gram stain. We believe that most readers of this chapter would either have minimal interest in identification methods for bacteria, would consult specific chapters in this book for an overview of the subject, or would refer to a microbiology reference book for detailed information. For that reason, the information covered in this section is restricted to general comments concerning identification methods. For more detailed information, please refer to the individual chapters in this book or to a microbiology reference book. 5 The microscopic morphology and characteristics, such as colony size, color, and shape, and the presence or absence of hemolytic activity, are used by the microbiologist in selection of the appropriate identification procedure. An experienced microbiologist often is able to provide a reliable presumptive identification of common bacteria on the basis of these early characteristics and some preliminary identification tests. For example, an opaque white or light yellow colony that appears as gram-positive cocci found predominantly in clusters will be tested with a rapid coagulase test to identify the isolate as S. aureus or a coagulasenegative Staphylococcus species. Table 16 -9 describes key tests that are commonly used, along with colony and Gram stain morphology, to identify selected species of bacteria. 32 The historical classification of bacteria was based on their microscopic properties (e.g., gram-positive, gram-negative, acid-fast; cocci, rods, spiral-shaped), oxygen tolerance (i.e., aerobic, anaerobic), and patterns of biochemical reactivity (Table 16 -10). The biochemical tests included fermentation or oxidation of carbohydrates (e.g., fermentation of glucose or lactose), use of carbon sources, presence of specific enzymes, or production of volatile fatty acids. A minimum number of these tests performed in test tubes could identify most of the for bacteria responsible for meningitis (i.e., S. agalactiae, S. pneu moniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae type B) are not recommended as a screening assay because they are no more sensitive than a Gram stain; however, these assays can be useful for the presumptive identification of an organism observed on Gram staining. A diagnosis of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila can be confirmed by detection of specific antigens in urine; however, negative assays must be confirmed by culture. Likewise, although group A Strep tococcus antigen tests are widely used, negative assays must also be confirmed by either culture or a nucleic acid amplification assay. Antigen tests for the detection of Campylobacter or Helicobacter antigens in stool specimens or Shiga toxin produced by E. coli are rapid, sensitive assays for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms. Antigen tests are also widely used for detection of C. difficile toxins in stool specimens; however, the tests are insensitive and nonspecific and should not be used. 31 Immunoassays for C. trachomatis antigens have now been replaced in most laboratories by NAA tests. Thus, the value of antigen tests must be carefully assessed based on the performance characteristics of the individual assays and the availability of alternative detection methods. reactions that could be interpreted after a few hours of incubation and the introduction of instrumentation for the interpretation of the individual reactions and metabolic profile. Further improvements include the development of fully automated systems for the inoculation, incubation, and interpretation of these tests. Extensive databases exist that allow the theoretical identification of most clinically important bacteria. These systems have also been integrated with antimicrobial susceptibility tests (to be discussed later). A detailed discussion of the manual and automated commercial identification systems is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, most laboratories use a combination of these systems. commonly recognized bacteria. For example, until the early 1970s, most laboratories identified all known members of the family Enterobacteriaceae by using reactions in six test tubes. As the number of clinically important organisms expanded, the number of additional tests that needed to be performed made this approach impractical and prohibitively expensive. The first commercial kits for organism identification were introduced in the 1970s. These consisted of a series of reactions that were incorporated in disposable strips or microwell plates. The pattern of reactions could be converted into a "metabolic profile" that was compared with an established database for the organism identifi cation. Refinements of this approach included selection of  The fundamental procedures for identification of organisms are rapidly being replaced by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a method currently in widespread use in Europe for the identification of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, and molds. [34] [35] [36] Use of MALDI-TOF is limited in the United States only until FDA approval is obtained. The method is technically simple and inexpensive. Bacteria or yeast are selected from a culture plate or positive broth culture (e.g., blood culture), transferred to a target plate, pretreated with formic acid, overlayed with a matrix, and then analyzed. Upon exposure to a laser beam, the matrix ionizes proteins present in the sample, which are then separated by size as they move through a vacuum tube, creating a unique protein spectrum. Processing mycobacteria and molds is slightly more complex, but identification of all organisms can be achieved in less than an hour, with an accuracy that exceeds all previous methods. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry alters workflow in the microbiology laboratory, eliminating the need for Gram stains, subcultures, and delays associated with biochemical testing, and it dramatically improves time to definitive identification results. Dilution methods were the first susceptibility test procedures that were developed. In these procedures, serial dilutions of antibiotics are prepared in either a liquid or agar medium. Typically, a twofold dilution scheme is used (e.g., 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.1, 1.5, 0.75, etc., Âµg/mL). Each dilution is then inoculated with a standardized concentration of the test organism and, after a specific incubation period, the lowest (minimum) concentration of antibiotic that inhibits the organism is determined. These methods are referred to as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests or quantitative susceptibility tests because the results are expressed numerically. 37 The quantitative values can be converted into qualitative interpretations-susceptible, intermediate, resistant-based on interpretive criteria defined by CLSI for each organism-antibiotic combination. 38 An organism is defined as susceptible to an antibiotic when the MIC value is at or below the concentration achieved with the usual recommended dose of the antibiotic, intermediate when the MIC value is at the concentration of the antibiotic achieved with higher doses or in body sites where the active antibiotic is concentrated (e.g., urinary tract), and resistant when the MIC value is greater than the The agar diffusion method was developed as a practical alternative to the agar and broth tube dilution procedures. The most popular agar diffusion method is the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. 39 In this method, the test agar plate is swabbed with a standardized concentration of the test organism, and then paper disks containing a defined antibiotic concentration are placed on the lawn of bacteria. After overnight incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibited growth around the disk is measured. This zone is influenced by a number of variables, including the susceptibility test medium (Mueller-Hinton agar is the standard for bacterial tests), the concentration of the test organism, the rate of growth of the test organism, the concentration of antibiotic in the disk, the diffusion of the antibiotic in the agar, and the susceptibility of the organism to the antibiotic. The first five variables are standardized by CLSI; therefore, if the test is properly performed, the size of the zone of inhibited growth is directly related to the susceptibility of the organism-the larger the zone, the more susceptible the organism is to the antibiotic. As would be expected, the results of the dilution tests and diffusion tests are related. There is an inverse linear relationship between the size of the zone and the MIC value-the larger the zone of inhibited growth (more susceptible the organism to the antibiotic), the smaller the MIC value. Thus, it is possible to extrapolate from the measured size of the inhibitory zone to the corresponding MIC value. In addition, the interpretive criteria that are applied to MIC tests apply to the diffusion tests. Thus, for most organism-antibiotic tests, the diffusion tests and dilution tests are equally accurate in predicting antimicrobial susceptibility. The dilution tests are commonly referred to as quantitative tests, whereas the diffusion tests are referred to as qualitative tests. That is, the dilution tests are usually reported as a number or MIC value, whereas the diffusion test results are reported as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. This is an oversimplification. Both tests are quantitative; in fact, the diffusion tests assess a greater range of quantitative values (zone sizes from 6 mm [diameter of the paper disk] to about 40 mm), compared with dilution tests, which typically measure two to five concentrations of a drug in most microdilution panels. So, the definition of a quantitative or qualitative test is determined by the reporting method rather than the testing method. One variation of the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test is the E test (bioMÃ©rieux, Lyon, France), which is a gradient diffusion test. In this test, the antibiotic is in a commercially prepared strip, with a concentration gradient extending from the top to the bottom of the strip. When this is placed on a lawn of bacterial growth, an elliptic pattern of inhibited growth develops (greater inhibition at the end with a higher concentration of antibiotic). The strips are calibrated so that the area where the bacterial growth meets the strip corresponds to the organism's MIC value for the antibiotic. The advantage of the E test is that MIC results can be obtained easily for one or two antibiotics. However, when a large number of organism-antibiotic combinations need to be tested, the broth microdilution method is preferred. Specialized methods have been developed to detect some specific resistance mechanisms. An example of this is the detection of real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification) must be validated before they can be used for diagnostic testing. One gene target, the secA1 gene, is useful for the detection and identification of a large number of mycobacterial species in clinical specimens. 44 Although direct detection of both mycobacterial antigens and tuberculostearic acid may have some usefulness for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly tuberculous meningitis, such testing is not generally available. Nucleic acid amplification may be more sensitive than tuberculostearic acid detection for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and meningeal tuberculosis. 45  To aid their further identification to the species level, nontuberculous mycobacteria were divided into several groups by Runyoun. Rapid growers (Runyoun group IV) take less than 7 days for growth after subculture to a solid medium from a dilute suspension; however, they generally also take less than 7 days to grow on solid or in liquid medium on initial isolation. Slowly growing mycobacteria are further divided into photochromogens, scotochromogens, and nonphotochromogens (Runyoun groups I, II, and III, respectively), depending on their ability to produce pigment and the relationship of pigment production to light stimulation. Photochromogens produce pigment after light stimulation but not when grown continuously in the dark with no light exposure. Scotochromogens produce pigment when grown in the dark as well as  As with bacteria, five general approaches are used for the detection of viruses: microscopy, culture, detection of viral antigens or nucleic acids, and detection of antibodies against the organism (Table . In contrast with bacteria, microscopy and culture are generally less useful than alternative detection methods. In addition, the tests used for the detection of viruses are usually considered definitive, and supplementary identification tests are not performed. As with the other microorganisms discussed in this chapter, five approaches exist for the detection of parasites: microscopy, culture, antigen or nucleic acid detection, and antibody detection. In contrast with the other groups of organisms, microscopy is the primary detection and identification procedure for most parasites. Culture is used for only a few parasites and, when available, is not the primary diagnostic method. Antigen testing is used for a limited number of parasites, and nucleic acid-based tests are primarily restricted to reference or research laboratories. Serology is useful for populations where endemic infections are uncommon but has little value in countries with a high incidence of infection.
