In developing the essential competencies for nursing related to HIV and AIDS, a participatory action approach of regional nursing experts from the sub-Saharan African region, including educators, clinicians, and policy/regulatory experts, was used. From the outset, the participating nurse leaders from the region viewed the competencies related to HIVand AIDS as supplemental to the general competencies expected of all nurses that were achieved as a result of education, training, examination, and licensure. The general nursing competencies serving as the basis for refinement in the context of HIVand AIDS were those published by the ICN entitled Nursing Care Continuum -Framework and Competencies (ICN, 2008a) . The primary operating assumption of the regional nursing leaders involved in the development of the HIV and AIDS nursing competency process focused on regional collaboration. This collaboration was essential because of the following reasons: It facilitated sharing of expertise and resources through a South-to-South collaboration of nursing leaders; It expanded partnerships and networks to reduce duplication of efforts and to facilitate action; It mitigated the effects of regional migration of nurses; and It established a regional network for sharing best practices related to task-shifting. The participating nurse leaders unanimously supported the development of essential nursing competencies for HIV and AIDS if the competencies were comprehensive in nature, holistic in approach, and not merely focused on ART delivery. To be comprehensive, the participating nursing leaders firmly articulated that the identified competencies must address the cognitive, affective, psychomotor domains specific to HIV and AIDS as well as the professional expectations of nurses related to HIV and AIDS. Finally, to address the complex issues associated with HIV and AIDS, the nurse leaders participating in the development process supported a holistic approach examining the contribution of nursing across the care continuum (prevention, care, and treatment) while also addressing the psychosocial, spiritual, ethical perspective, individual, and community level stigma associated with the disease as well as the essential leadership, mentoring, and professional development required of nurses and nursing. Figure 1 illustrates the complex nature of HIV and AIDS nursing care. The client, delineated in the middle of the graphic, is defined as the individual, family, and/or community living with, at risk for, and/or affected by HIV and AIDS. Surrounding the client are the nursing care activities demonstrating the complex, multilevel needs of persons living with, affected by, or at risk for HIV or AIDS. In partnering with the client to address these needs, the nurse uses many roles, which are illustrated in the outer circles.
