Generation of recombinant viruses. Viruses with mutations in SARS-CoV viroporins E, 3a, and 8a were constructed in an infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV-MA15 within a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15) (49, 73, 76) . Generation of the E deletion mutant was described previously (61) . The 3a gene was deleted by overlap extension PCR using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 and the primers shown in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Mutations included deletion of a region (nt 25270 to 25668) of the SARS-CoV genome, resulting in deletion of the 3a protein while retaining the 3b protein; a disruption of the ATG start codon of the 3a gene; and point mutations at nt 25673 and codon. A PCR product was generated from nt 24937 to 26060 of the SARS-CoV genome, digested at flanking SwaI and BamHI sites, and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV (which contains the nt-18404-to-26044 sequence of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone) to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-Δ3a. Finally, that plasmid was digested with PmeI and BamHI and the fragment carrying the 3a deletion was reinserted into a similarly digested pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 plasmid to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-Δ3a. To construct the 8a deletion mutant, a DNA fragment containing nt 26790 to 28753 of the SARS-CoV genome flanked by restriction sites XcmI and NheI was assembled by overlap extension PCR using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as the template and the primers indicated in Table S1 ; this process resulted in the deletion of the first 82 nt of the 8a gene without affecting the 8b gene. The final PCR products were digested with XcmI and NheI and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV (which contains nt 26044 to 29782 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone [49] ), thus obtaining pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-Δ8a. That plasmid was digested with BamHI and RsrII, and the fragment carrying the deletion of the 8a gene was reinserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, generating pBAC-SARS-CoV-Δ8a. To generate mutants with mutations in the 3a IC, DNA fragments containing nt 25016 to 26044 of the SARS-CoV genome were produced by overlap extension PCR using plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as a template and the primers indicated in Table S1 . The following mutations were introduced: S40A (TCA to GCA), S48A (AGC to GCC), Y91A (TAT to GCT), H93A (CAT to GCT), Y109A (TAT to GCT), Y113A (TAT to GCT), Q116A (CAA to GCA), TMD1 Ϫ (including both S40A and S48A), TMD2 Ϫ (including both Y91A and H93A), TMD3 Ϫ (including Y109A, Y113A, and Q116A), and TMD [2, 3] Ϫ (including Y91A, H93A, Y109A, Y113A, and Q116A). The PCR products were digested at flanking SwaI and BamHI sites and cloned into pBAC-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV (49) . Intermediate plasmids were digested with PmeI and BamHI and recloned into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate infectious SARS-CoV cDNA clones for each mutation. To mutate the PBM sequence of 3a, overlap extension PCR was performed using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 as the template and the primers indicated in Table S2 , resulting in a DNA fragment containing nt 26044 to 26790 of the SARS-CoV genome. The core 3a PBM (SVPL; nt AGCGTGCCTTTG), was replaced with an alternative sequence (GMSM; nt GGCATGTCTATG). As the 3a and 3b genes overlap in this region, care was taken to introduce only silent mutations into the 3b ORF. The resulting PCR fragment was digested at flanking BamHI and XcmI sites and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV (49) , resulting in pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-3amutPBM. This plasmid was digested with BamHI and RsrII, and the fragment carrying the mutated 3a PBM was reinserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-3a-PBM Ϫ . Viruses combining deletion of the 3a gene with mutations throughout the E gene were generated by digesting previously described plasmids pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-EΔ1, -EΔ2, -EΔ3, -EΔ4, -EΔ5, and -EΔ6 (75) and -E-PBM Ϫ and -E-PBM* (46) with BamHI and RsrII and cloning the fragments with mutations into a similarly digested pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-Δ3a plasmid. In order to generate recombinant baculoviruses for 3a protein (rBV-3a), all constructs of the SARS-CoV 3a gene were cloned into a pFastBac vector (Invitrogen) containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavable site and 10 histidine residues fused to the C terminus of the 3a constructs. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Recovery of recombinant SARS-CoV variants from the cDNA clones. BHK cells were grown to 95% confluence in 12.5-cm 2 flasks and transfected with 6 g of infectious cDNA clone and 18 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. At 6 h posttransfection (hpt), cells were trypsinized, added to confluent Vero E6 cells monolayers grown in 12.5-cm 2 flasks, and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Cell supernatants were harvested and passaged once on fresh cells, and the recovered viruses were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification following standard procedures. Cells. Vero E6 cells and BHK cells were kindly provided by E. Snijder (University of Leiden, the Netherlands) and H. Laude (Unité de Virologie et Immunologie Molecularies, INRA, France), respectively. In all cases, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; BioWhittaker, Inc.). Virus titrations were performed in Vero E6 cells as previously described (61) . Mice. Eight-week-old specific-pathogen-free BALB/c Ola Hsd female mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories and maintained for 8 additional weeks in the animal care facility at the National Center of Biotechnology (Madrid). For infection experiments, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated at 16 weeks of age with 100,000 PFU of the indicated viruses. All work with infected animals was performed in a biosafety level 3ϩ (BSL3ϩ) laboratory (CISA, INIA) by technicians wearing personal protection equipment (3M). Generation of polyclonal antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV 3a protein. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 11 to 24 of the SARS-CoV 3a protein (C-ESITAQPVKIDNAS) was generated and used to immunize two rabbits (Biogenes, Berlin, Germany) according to the standard protocol of the supplier. Serums were collected at 45 dpi and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis using Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-wt or SARS-CoV-Δ3a as a negative control. Virus genome sequencing. Regions of the SARS-CoV genome corresponding to the 3a, E, and 8a genes were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Briefly, total RNA from infected cells or homogenized mouse lungs was collected and purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For RT reactions, 100 ng of RNA, random oligonucleotide primers, and ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used. RT products were subsequently subjected to PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the following primer pairs: 24937-VS (GGCGAC ATTTCAGGCATTAACGC) and 26086-RS (GGCACGCTAGTAGTCGTCGTCGGC), which amplify the 3a gene; E-VS (CTCTTCAGGAGTTGCTAATCCAGCAATGG) and E-RS (TCCAGGAGTTGTTTAAGCTTCTCAACGGTA), which amplify nucleotides 26017 to 26447, including the E gene; and 27545-VS (GGAGGTTCAACAAGA GCTCTACTCGCC) and 28008-RS (GACAGTTGATAGTAACATTAGGTGTGC), amplifying a region that includes the 8a gene. Sequence assembly and comparison with the parent consensus sequence were performed with SeqMan software (Lasergene, Madison, WI). Growth kinetics. Subconfluent monolayers (90% confluence) of Vero E6 cells in 12.5-cm 2 flasks were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 with the indicated viruses. Culture supernatants were collected at 0, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi), and virus titers were determined as previously described (61) . For the analysis of cell-associated virus, Vero E6 cells were infected at a MOI of 0.001 with the indicated viruses. At 24 and 48 hpi, cells were recovered in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and disrupted by four freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were then centrifuged to remove cell debris, and supernatants were titrated as previously described (59) . Virus infection and growth in mice. BALB/c mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 100,000 PFU of virus mixed with 50 l of DMEM. Weight loss and mortality were evaluated daily. To determine SARS-CoV titers, lungs were homogenized in PBS containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone), using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.). Virus titrations were performed in Vero E6 cells as previously described (61) . Viral titers were expressed as PFU counts per gram of tissue. Histopathology. Mice were sacrificed at 2 and 4 dpi. Lungs were removed, fixed in zinc formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Histopathological examinations were performed on sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Ion channel reconstitution and ionic current recording. Planar bilayers were formed by apposition of two monolayers prepared from a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) at a DOPC/DOPS/DOPE ratio of 3:1:1 (wt/wt) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) mixed in pentane at 5 mg/ml. Lipids were added on~100-m-diameter orifices in the 15-m-thick Teflon partition that separated two identical chambers (50, 77) ; the orifices were pretreated with a 1% solution of hexadecane-pentane. Aqueous solutions of KCl, NaCl, or CaCl 2 were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. All measurements were performed at room temperature (23 Ϯ 1°C). Ion channel insertion was achieved by adding 0.5 to 1 l of a 300 g/ml solution of recombinant protein in a buffer containing acetonitrileisopropanol (40:60) on one side of the chamber (here referred to as the cis side). An electric potential was applied using Ag/AgCl electrodes in 2 M KCl-1.5% agarose bridges assembled within standard 250-l pipette tips. The potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the cis side, whereas the trans side was set to ground. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used in the voltage-clamp mode to measure the current and the applied potential. The chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). Single-channel conductance data were obtained from current measurements under conditions of an applied potential of ϩ100 mV and were evaluated using the Gaussian fit tool of Sigma plot 12 (Systat Software, Inc.). The reversal potential, E rev , was determined as follows. First, a lipid membrane was formed at a given salt concentration gradient. Second, one or several channels were inserted into the bilayer and a net ionic current appeared due to the concentration gradient. Third, the ionic current through the channel or channels was manually set to zero by adjusting the applied potential. The potential needed to achieve zero current was then corrected using values corresponding to the liquid junction potentials of the electrode salt bridges (78) to obtain the final E rev . Confocal microscopy. Vero E6 cells were grown to 90% confluence on glass coverslips and infected with wt SARS-CoV at a MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell. At 24 hpi, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with ice-cold methanol, and then blocked with PBS containing 10% FBS for 40 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was performed using mouse Abs specific for SARS-CoV E protein (generated as described in reference 56) (1:500), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI; Abcam, Inc.) (1:500), 58 K (Abcam, Inc.) (1:100), aconitase 2 (Abcam, Inc.) (1:500), rab5 (BD Biosciences) (1:100), rab7 (BD Biosciences) (1:100), lamp-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (1:50), and Na ϩ /K ϩ ATPase (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (1:50) and rabbit Abs specific for SARS-CoV 3a protein (1:500). Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% FBS and incubated for 90 min at room temperature, and then coverslips were washed four times with PBS before incubation with secondary antibodies was performed. Alexa 488-or Alexa 546-conjugated antibodies specific for the different species (Invitrogen) were diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 5% FBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma) (1:200), and coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and examined on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (79) and the JACoP plug-in (57) . Three areas per image of 120 by 120 pixels with high accumulation of 3a protein were analyzed to determine Pearson's coefficient (Pc). Pc values below 0.6 were considered negative for colocalization. Partial colocalization was considered to have occurred for Pc values between 0.6 and 0.85. Pc values between 0.85 and 1 were considered positive for colocalization. Production and purification of SARS-CoV 3a protein and its mutant variants from a recombinant baculovirus (rBV-3a). H5 cells at 80% confluence were infected (MOI ϭ 1) with rBV-3a (constructed as specified in the "Generation of recombinant viruses" section above) and incubated at 22°C for 72 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer 2 (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Each sample was sonicated three times for 20 s each time and centrifuged at 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, the protein present in the supernatant was purified through metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using cobalt resin (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Every fraction from the purification process was analyzed in 12% polyacrylamide gels using Coomassie Blue EZBlue gel staining reagent (Sigma). Then, the obtained protein was desalted using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in PBS. Statistical analysis. Two-tailed, unpaired Student's t tests were used to analyze the differences in mean values between groups. All results were expressed as means Ϯ standard deviations; P values of Ͻ0.1 were considered significant.
