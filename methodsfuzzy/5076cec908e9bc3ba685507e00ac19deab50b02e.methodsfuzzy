Experimental techniques for T-cell epitopes mapping can be roughly divided in two main groups defined as cell based and cell free. Cell-based techniques mainly involve the screening of synthetic peptides on T-cell population to evaluate binding specificity. The aforementioned computational methods play a fundamental role to focus the analysis on a selected cohort of peptides, reducing the number of potential ligands to be tested. Hereafter, we review the most common approaches used to date [82] . A broadly used cell-based approach is the enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) [83] ; it evaluates Tcell cytokines secretion levels (generally IFN-) after antigen recognition. In details, lymphocytes are incubated on plates coated with anticytokines Abs with different peptides to be tested. Produced cytokines are captured and secretory activity is then evaluated immunochemically. The advantages derived from this technique mainly consist in its high resolution (single-cell) and high throughput results that can be further improved by the use of dedicated scanners allowing the scaling-up of the technique. Other cell-based assays are based on flow cytometry techniques that allow the selection of activated T cells. A widely used approach involves the culture of T cells in copresence of putative epitopes and a secretion inhibitor [84] . Activated cells are then sorted through after intracellular staining of retained cytokines with labeled Abs; different cytokines can be simultaneously evaluated using specific fluorescentlabeled antibodies. The most important limitation of this technique consists in the requirement of high quality sorting facilities. Lymphoproliferation assays rely as well on cytometric relevation; they consist in the uptake of the CFSE dye from T cells before activation [85] . After incubation with different peptides, antigen stimulation is evaluated through dye dilution caused by activated T-cell proliferation. The use of cell-based techniques presents several advantages, most notably the possibility to test the putative T cellactivating peptides directly against target cells. The main drawback consists in the need to be addressed by preliminary computational studies to reduce time and resources expense. Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3.5. In Vitro Approaches: Cell-Free Methods. Many cell-free methods have been developed to identify a definite antigen region potentially able to stimulate an effective T-cell response. Here, we briefly review one of the most promising approaches adopted in this research field [86] . It consists in recreating the antigen-processing compartment through the proteolytic digestion of an antigen of interest. The whole antigen is incubated with adequate soluble MHC molecules and proteases (mainly cathepsins and exopeptidases). Digested peptides specifically recognized by MHC molecules are bound and eluted after immunoprecipitating the complex, and T epitopes can then be analyzed by MS to identify immunogenic protein domains. The most important advantage of this assay relies on the direct employment of the whole antigen present on the pathogen to be targeted and on the simulation of its protelytic digestion into immunogenic peptides. The use of the entire antigen can permit, in fact, the identification of antigen-derived peptides that can be omitted during a synthetic peptide library design and/or during the in silico evaluation of the peptides to be assayed [87] . Moreover, the use of mass spectrometry methods allows the recognition of peptide posttranslational modifications that can affect the binding.
