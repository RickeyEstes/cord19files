Cell culture. DBT-9 (delayed brain tumor, murine astrocytoma clone 9) cells were maintained as described previously (88) . Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably expressing the MHV-A59 receptor CEACAM1 (BHK-R; 15) were maintained under conditions of selection with 0.8 mg/ml of G418 (Mediatech) as described previously (88). Long-term passage of virus and stock generation. The infectious cDNA clone for MHV-A59 and the recovery of MHV-ExoN(-) were described previously (14, 88) . Long-term passage was initiated by infecting subconfluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells in 25-cm 2 flasks with either wild-type MHV-A59 or MHV-ExoN(-) at an MOI of approximately 0.1 PFU/cell. One lineage of each virus was subjected to a total of 250 passages (P250). Supernatant was harvested at each passage and stored at Ϫ80°C. Total RNA was harvested for most passages using 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Ambion) per 25-cm 2 flask and stored at Ϫ80°C. Virus stocks of select intermediate passages were generated by infecting a subconfluent 150-cm 2 flask of DBT-9 cells at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. At approximately 24 hpi, the flask was frozen at Ϫ80°C and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 ϫ g (Sorvall RC-3B Plus; HA-6000A rotor) for 10 min at 4°C. The virus titer of each stock was determined by plaque assay using DBT-9 cells as described previously (14, 88) . For plaque assays of viruses containing the spike protein from MHV-ExoN(-) P250, which does not form syncytia, plaques were visualized with neutral red (Sigma catalog no. N6264) (dilution at 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing calcium and magnesium). Neutral red was added 24 h after plating, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 3 to 8 h before formaldehyde fixation. Plaque purification was performed by infecting DBT cells with serial dilutions of virus and overlaying the cultures with agar. Single plaques were isolated, resuspended in PBS containing calcium and magnesium, and inoculated onto fresh DBTs. This process was completed 3 times before experimental stocks were generated as described above. Sequencing of virus stocks. Following P250, RNA was purified from the harvested TRIzol samples according to the manufacturer's protocol and reverse transcribed (RT) using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) as described previously (14) . Full-genome di-deoxy sequencing was performed for both WT-MHV P250 and MHV-ExoN(-) P250 using 12 overlapping amplicons approximately 3 kb in length. All coding regions were sequenced fully, and, of 31,409 nucleotides, Ͼ99% were sequenced for each virus [for WT-MHV P250, 21 to 31,279; for MHV-ExoN(-) P250, 21 to 31,275]. Two microliters of RT product was used for each PCR (16) . Di-deoxy sequencing was performed by Genhunter Corporation (Nashville, TN) and Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ). Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector version 14 (MacVector, Inc., Apex, NC) and the MHV-A59 infectious clone reference genome (GenBank accession number AY910861). The nucleotide sequences of the amplicon and sequencing primers are available upon request. Sequencing of nsp12 and nsp14 from intermediate passages was performed using TRIzol-purified RNA from infected monolayers and the primers listed below. Primers 6M1F (5=-TTTTGGCGAGATGGTAGC-3=) and 7M2R (5=-GGTAAGACAGTTTTAGGTGAG-3=) were used to generate a 3,425 nucleotide amplicon containing all of nsp12. Primers 7M3F (5=-ATGCTTACCAACTATGAGC-3=) and 8M3R (5=-CCGATTTGAATGGCGTA G-3=) were used to generate a 2,713 nucleotide amplicon containing all of nsp14. The PCR conditions for these reactions were the same as those used to generate the amplicons used for full-genome sequencing (16) . Replication and RNA synthesis kinetics. Viral replication kinetics in DBT-9 cells were determined at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell or an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell as described previously (15) . Supernatant (300 l) was harvested at the indicated time points, and the virus titer was determined by plaque assay. The accumulation of genomic RNA at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell was measured by two-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Intracellular RNA was harvested using TRIzol and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). The levels of cDNA derived from intracellular positive-sense viral RNA were measured using primers directed to nsp10. Values were normalized to levels of the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). No mutations within the primer binding sites emerged in either P250 population. The primers and amplification conditions were the same as reported previously (15), except that the RT product was diluted 1:10 prior to use. Samples were plated in technical duplicate to minimize well-to-well variation. Data are presented as 2 ϪΔCT , where ΔCT denotes the threshold cycle (C T ) value for the target (nsp10) minus the C T value for the reference (GAPDH). Determination of specific infectivity. Subconfluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells in 24-well plates were infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell, and supernatant was harvested at 12 hpi. The levels of genomic RNA in supernatant were measured using one-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of TRIzol-extracted RNA as described previously (17) . Briefly, genomic RNA was detected with a 5= 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled and 3= black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1)-labeled probe targeting nsp2 (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA), and RNA copy numbers were calculated by reference to an RNA standard derived from the MHV A fragment. Samples were plated in technical duplicate to minimize well-to-well variation. Titers were determined by plaque assay in DBT-9 cells, and specific infectivity was calculated as PFU per supernatant genomic RNA copy. Nucleoside and base analogue sensitivity assays. 5-azacytidine (AZC), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and ribavirin (RBV) were purchased from Sigma (product numbers A2385, F6627, and R9644, respectively), and stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). CMeA (2=-C-methyladenosine) was received from Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA). Sensitivity assays were performed as described previously (16) , except that 24-well plates were used at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell. Supernatants were harvested at 24 hpi, and titers were determined by plaque assay. Phyre 2 modeling of MHV-nsp14. The MHV nsp14 structure was modeled with the Phyre 2 online program (62) using nsp14 residues 3 to 519, corresponding to residues 6,056 to 6,573 of the ORF1ab polyprotein. The model was analyzed using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3 (Schrödinger, LLC). Generation of nsp12 and nsp14 swaps. Viruses containing nsp12-P250 or nsp14-P250 or both were generated using the MHV-A59 reverse genetics system (88) . RNA from the MHV-ExoN(-) P250 virus was reversed transcribed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and used to generate amplicons containing either nsp12 or nsp14. Each amplicon was flanked by 15 bp that overlapped an amplicon generated from the backbone plasmid. Amplicons were inserted into MHV-A59 fragments using an InFusion HD cloning kit (TaKaRa Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA). nsp12 is split across MHV E and F, while nsp14 is contained within MHV F. Reaction mixtures contained 50 ng of vector, 200 ng of insertion, and 2 l of enzyme and were incubated for 15 min at 50°C. Errors were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The nsp12/14-P250 swap was generated through restriction digestion of the individual swaps using BsmBI and StuI followed by gel purification and assembly using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Ipswich, MA). Viable viruses were constructed and rescued as described previously (88) . Competitive fitness assays. Competitor viruses were competed with an MHV-ExoN(-) virus harboring 10 silent mutations in the probe-binding region within nsp2. Subconfluent DBT-9 monolayers in 24-well plates were coinfected at a total MOI of 0.01 PFU/cell with competitor and reference viruses at a 1:1 ratio and passaged 4 times. For each passage, supernatants were harvested at 24 h. RNA was extracted from 100 l of supernatant using 900 l of TRIzol reagent and PureLink RNA minikit columns (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 150 l of supernatant was used to infect fresh cells in a 24-well plate (total MOI estimated at 1 PFU/cell). The proportion of each virus was determined by real-time RT-qPCR from the infection supernatant using two TaqMan probes with different fluorescent dyes in separate reactions. Competitor viruses were detected with the same probe used in specific infectivity analyses (14) . Reference viruses were detected by a probe targeting the same region but with 10 silent mutations (5=-TCCGAACTACTGCAACCCCAAGTG-3=) and labeled with 5= quasar 670 and 3= black hole quencher 2 (BHQ-2) (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA). RNA copy numbers were calculated by reference to an RNA standard generated by in vitro transcription of the corresponding MHV A fragment, and relative RNA abundances were calculated as ratios of competitor genomes to reference genomes. Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA) was used to perform statistical tests. Only the comparisons shown (with statistical significance indicated as ЉnsЉ [nonsignificance] or asterisk[s]) within each figure or described in each legend were performed. In many cases, the data were normalized to the results obtained with untreated controls. This was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. The number of replicate samples is denoted within each figure legend. Accession numbers. Full-length genome sequences for WT-MHV P250 and MHV-ExoN(-) P250 have been deposited in GenBank (accession numbers MF618252 and MF618253, respectively).
