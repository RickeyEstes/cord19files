Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province, Indonesia, is the center of the high intensity bushmeat trade in Indonesia. The predominantly Christian population is not prohibited from eating wildlife like bats and boar, unlike other parts of Indonesia where a majority of people are Muslim and must observe halal dietary restrictions (Lee et al., 2005) . Eight markets scattered throughout the province represent the trading hubs for bushmeat: Karombasan (PK) and Beserhati (PB) in Manado; Airmadidi (PAi) in North Minahasa; Tomohon (PT), Kawangkoan (PKa), and Langowan (PL) in Minahasa; and Amurang (PA) and Motoling (PM) in South Minahasa (Fig. 1) . Using a questionnaire modified from Harrison et al. (2011) , a total of 71 respondents (31 vendors and 40 consumers) were interviewed from January to February 2013. The questionnaire was modified to reflect the different ethnic groups that occur in Sulawesi and conducted in the local dialect of the respondent. We removed hunter-related questions and focused on interviewing vendors and buyers directly at the market because hunters were in other provinces where there are flying fox colonies at the time of this study. Detailed information on hunting methods was not the focus of this study. We defined a ''vendor'' as a person selling the bats at the market and a ''consumer'' as the person who came to the bat vendors and wanted to buy a bat-all were asked the same set of questions. Every person was asked if he or she wanted to be interviewed and we only approached available consumers for interviews. No incentive was given to the respondents and questioning was not met with any resistance, so answers were considered to be truthful. We recognize that the number of respondents may be too small for any significant statistical analyses, but that is the total number of vendors in the entire trade network at the time of this study. We therefore supplement quantitative evidence with anecdotal evidence regarding attitudes towards flying foxes and population trends volunteered by the respondents. Respondents also volunteered additional information the relation of the bushmeat trade to religious events, the market network, and methods of preparing bats. Some of the vendors have sold bush meat for over ten years, including a vendor in PK who was able to provide a detailed history of the flying fox trade since he was one of the first bat vendors. In a precursory awareness survey (Appendix 1) in August 2013, we interviewed 15 individuals from each group (local villagers and local university students) to assess the level of flying fox knowledge and provide a basis for determining whom to approach to act as local ambassadors. These were new questions that were created in Bahasa Indonesian and translated to English for this manuscript. We asked every previously identified consumer if they were available to be interviewed as local villager respondents. The interview was conducted in the local dialect and questions were modified according to local daily conversational practices to avoid potential biases. Students were chosen at random from the biology program at Sam Ratulangi University. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significant differences in levels of knowledge between the local villagers and university students. As the student group learned about ecology and conservation in university classes prior to this study, this group was expected to know significantly more about bats and conservation compared to local villagers. Their higher level of knowledge would indicate the utility of education as an awareness tool and identify if there would be a difference in using the students as ambassadors for a flying fox conservation program.
