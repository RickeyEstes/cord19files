Other means of improving the safety and efficacy of biologics by reducing their immunogenicity include humanization and PEGylation. Following FDA approval of the first therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb), many were found to elicit anti-drug antibodies in immunecompetent patients [78] [79] [80] [81] . For example, OKT3, an immunosuppressive drug used to treat transplant rejection and the first monoclonal antibody approved for human use, elicited antibodies in 86% of patients [82] . Not surprisingly, in hindsight, the explanation for immunogenicity was patient response to foreign (mouse) sequences. To improve the next generation of mAbs, constant domain sequences of antibody light and heavy chains were replaced by human constant regions to produce chimeric antibodies. This approach met with mixed success because chimeric antibodies still raised human anti- Fig. 6 . We have discovered conserved T cell epitopes in IgG that engage natural regulatory T cells. We hypothesize that antibody-derived Treg epitopes (dark blue epitope on the top) activate regulatory T cells, which leads to suppression of effector T cells that recognize effector epitopes (red epitope on the bottom), like those of IgG hypervariable regions to which central tolerance does not exist. Whether this suppression is mediated by regulatory cytokines alone or by contact-dependent signaling, or both, has yet to be determined [95] .
