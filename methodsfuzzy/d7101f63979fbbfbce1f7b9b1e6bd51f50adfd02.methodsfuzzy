In this study, peripheral blood derived lymphocytes (PBL) of a total of 132 cows were used. Eleven of these cows had previously been vaccinated with PregSure BVD, of which six did not produce BNP-inducing antibodies (BVD vaccinated control cows) and five showed alloreactive antibody production (BNP dams) resulting in their calves dying from hemorrhagic diathesis with confirmed thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia and bone marrow depletion. The remaining 121 cows were healthy controls (female, age: 2-10 years, first to eight lactation period) from one dairy farm never vaccinated with PregSure BVD. No experimental animals were killed through this study. Withdrawal of blood was permitted by the local authority Regierung von Oberbayern, Munich, permit no. 55.2-1-54-2532.3-22-12.
