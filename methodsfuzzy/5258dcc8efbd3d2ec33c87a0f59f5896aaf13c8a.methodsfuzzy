Standard microbiological testing Blood, urine, sputum and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at enrolment. Blood cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically using the BacT/ALERT 3D blood culture system (bioMerieux, Durham, North Carolina, USA). Sputum was examined by Gram stain microscopy and cultured on sheep blood agar and chocolate agar. Plates were incubated aerobically in CO 2 at 37 C, were read at 24 h and at 48 h. Urine was tested for S. pneumoniae antigens using the NOW S. pneumoniae urinary antigen tests (Binax, Portland, Maine, USA). Nasopharyngeal swabs were stored in viral transport medium and frozen at Ã€80 C prior to testing. Urine was tested for Legionella pneumophilia (Binax, Portland, Maine, USA) antigen at physician's discretion in patients with pneumonia.
