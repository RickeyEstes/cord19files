To analyze virus replication, single-step and multistep growth curve experiments were carried out with cell monolayers seeded into six-well plates. Cells were inoculated with the Hom-1 virus at an MOI of 5 or 0.05. Following 1 h of incubation at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed with 1 ml of growth medium. After washing, 2 ml of growth medium was added and cells and culture fluids were collected at the postinfection times indicated. The collected samples were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles, and virus titers in Vero cells were determined with a plaque-forming assay. The titration experiments were carried out similarly to what has been described previously for FCV (51) . Sequencing and sequence analysis. Viral RNA purified with the Qiagen RNeasy kit was employed to synthesize cDNA with random hexamer primers. Several cDNA fragments overlapping the entire genome were amplified with multiple pairs of primers (available on request). Following gel purification, direct sequencing of the amplified cDNA fragments was performed with an automated sequencer and a genome walking procedure. The 3=-and 5=-end sequences of the Hom-1 genome were determined with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) system kits from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN) or Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Derived nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed, aligned, and compared with sequences available from GenBank with the MacVector 14.5.3 (MacVector, Inc., Apex, NC), Mega 6.06 (52) , and MrBayes 3.1.2 (53) software packages. Full-length genomic cDNA clone construction and virus recovery. Standard recombinant DNA methods were used for plasmid construction (54) . To assemble the full-length sequence of the Hom-1 virus genome in pX12ΔT (a gift from U. Buchholz, NIAID), the 5=-end (nt 1 to 4068) and 3=-end (nt 4069 to 8399) parts of the virus genome were amplified and cloned separately into the pSPORT1 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The 5=-end sequence was amplified from cDNA with primers 5= ATTTAT TTAATGGTCTCAAGCTTTAATACGACTCACTATAGTTAAATGAGAATTTGAGCTATGGCTC 3= and 5= CTTGTCA CCACCCGATCC 3=. The sequence of the first primer contained 27 nt corresponding to the beginning of the Hom-1 genome (underlined), the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (in italics), and BsaI site (in bold). The second primer contained a sequence complementary to nt 4071 to 4088 of the Hom-1 genome. The amplified cDNA fragment was treated with BsaI and SphI and cloned into HindIII-SphI-linearized pSPORT1. The 3=-end sequence was amplified with primers 5= TTGTGGGCTACCATACACCGACGAAC 3= and 5=-AATTTAATATCCCGGGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCTAATGCAACCTACCAATTGGCTAAGT C-3=. The first primer corresponded to nt 4019 to 4044 of the Hom-1 genome, and the second primer contained a sequence complementary to the last 29 nt of the virus genome (underlined), a poly(T 30 ) sequence, and an XmaI site (in bold). The amplified cDNA fragment was treated with XmaI and SphI and cloned into XmaI-SphI-linearized pSPORT1. Clones were screened by sequencing analysis, and plasmids containing consensus sequences of the 5= and 3= parts of the virus genome were selected and designated p548 and p432, respectively. To construct a full-length genome clone, plasmids p548 and p432 were treated with SmaI and SphI or SphI and XmaI, respectively. The 4,133-bp SmaI-SphI and 4,362-bp SphI-XmaI fragments containing nt 1 to 4068 and 4069 to 8399 of the virus genome, respectively, were purified and ligated into the EcoRV-XmaI-linearized pX12ΔT vector (19) . Clones were screened by restriction analysis and selected for further sequencing analysis. The resulting plasmid was designated pBH4 and contained the full-length consensus genome sequence of Hom-1 placed under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of MVA-T7-infected Vero or CHO cells with pBH4 and virus recovery of Hom-1 were performed as described previously for FCV (38) . Recovery of infectious virus was monitored by detection of a CPE in the monolayer of Vero cells and by further virus titration. Recombinant baculovirus construction, VLP expression, and anti-VLP serum production. To express Hom-1 VLPs, the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System and Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were used. Briefly, the 2,006-bp sequence encoding Hom-1 VP1 (aa 153 to 711 of ORF2) and VP2 (ORF3) was amplified with primers HVLPfrw (5=-ATTTATATTAGGATCCACCATGTC GGATGGTCCGGGAAGCTCCGAGATTGTG-3=) and HVLPrev (5=-ATATTTATTTAGGTACCTTACTAGTCCGTTTT ATAGAAGCTATAATAAGAG-3=). The primer sequences contained BamHI and KpnI restriction enzyme sites (in bold), an ATG translation initiation codon, and a sequence corresponding to two stop codons (underlined). The PCR fragment was treated with BamHI and KpnI and cloned downstream of the polyhedrin promoter into the baculovirus donor plasmid, pFastBac-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) linearized with the corresponding restriction enzymes. Baculovirus DNA containing the Hom-1 VP1-VP2 Hom-1 Receptor hJAM1 ® sequence was produced by site-specific recombination in Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells harboring a bacmid vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting baculovirus was isolated from Sf9 cells transfected with the recombinant bacmid DNA with Cellfectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). After three consecutive passages, the amplified baculovirus was titrated, aliquoted, and stored for further experiments. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus at an MOI of 5, and at 6 days postinfection, the cells and growth medium were freeze-thawed twice and VLPs were purified as previously described (55) . Antisera against Hom-1 VLPs were prepared in guinea pigs as previously described (56) . All guinea pig studies were conducted at the NIH, Bethesda, MD, under an animal protocol (LID 73) approved by the NIAID Division of Intramural Research Animal Care and Use Committee. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Western blot analysis of virus and cellular proteins in cell lysates was performed with standard techniques (54) . The virus capsid protein was detected with guinea pig polyclonal sera raised against VLPs that were produced either for Steller sea lion vesivirus strain v810 (16) or for the Hom-1 virus. Anti-␤-actin and anti-␤-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse MAb 2E3-1C8 from Acris Antibodies, San Diego, CA, was used for the detection of hJAM1. Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies that were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD. Blots were developed with Amersham ECL Western blotting Reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). For immunofluorescent staining, cells grown in six-well tissue culture plates were washed with 2 ml of PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 to 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min prior to washing with PBS and the addition of primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). After a 1-h incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and binding of the primary antibodies was detected by the addition of affinity-purified Alexa Fluor-labeled goat antibodies (10 g/ml) raised against either guinea pig or mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For nuclear staining, mock-and Hom-1-infected cells were treated for 20 min with a PBS solution containing 1 g/ml DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescent staining was visualized with a Leica DMI4000B microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). Images were acquired with a Retiga 2000R camera (QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) and processed with iVision 4.5.5 software (BioVision, Exton, PA). For confocal microscopy experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm-diameter dishes before being transfected with plasmid DNA or infected with the virus. The cells were then fixed, stained, and processed as previously described (57) . Confocal microscopy images were obtained with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) equipped with a white laser and with a 63ϫ oil immersion objective. The collected images were analyzed with Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Screening of the library of hPMPs. Screening for human protein ligands of the Hom-1 virus was performed by the Retrogenix Cell microarray technology (Retrogenix Ltd.). For the binding analysis, 3,559 expression vectors, each encoding a full-length hPMP and ZsGreen1 protein (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), were arrayed in duplicate on 10 microarray slides. The vectors were reverse transfected into human HEK-293 cells, and ZsGreen1 levels were measured to ensure that efficient transfection had been achieved. Hom-1 VLPs (5,000/cell) were added to the slides after cell fixation. The slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and VLP binding was detected with anti-Hom-1 VLP hyperimmune guinea pig serum (diluted 1:2,000 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA) and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG (diluted 1:500 in PBS-0.5% BSA). Slides incubated with both hyperimmune serum and anti-guinea pig IgG antibodies were used as a negative control. Fluorescent images were collected with an Ettan difference gel electrophoresis fluorescence scanner (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). LAPD. A modified version of the LAPD assay (27) was employed to test interactions of hJAM1 and Hom-1 VP1 in vitro. Briefly, CHO cells (n ϭ 2.4 ϫ 10 7 ) were transfected with expression constructs containing the Renilla luciferase (Ruc) gene fused to the Hom-1 VP1 (Ruc-VP1) sequence or its P domain (Ruc-P) sequence (28) . Two days after transfection, cells were lysed with 1.4 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol, and 1ϫ Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific. Inc.). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ϫ g for 5 min, aliquoted, and stored at Ϫ80°C. In addition, lysates of cells transfected with the empty expression vector pRen2 (58) were prepared for use as a negative control. The luciferase activity in the cell lysates obtained was assayed with the Renilla luciferase assay substrate (Promega, Madison, WI), and luminescence was measured in relative light units (RLU) with the Synergy Neo2 Multi-Mode Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). To examine Hom-1 VP1 interactions with hJAM1, cell lysates containing equal amounts of RLU (n ϭ 10 7 ) were incubated with 0.5 g of either hJAM1-Fc (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) or hFc (G&P Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA) recombinant protein for 1 h at room temperature. Cell lysate-recombinant protein mixtures were then transferred to a 96-well filter HTS plate (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), where each well was preloaded with 5 l of a 30% suspension of protein A/G Plus UltraLink Resin beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. The filter plate with samples was incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a rotary shaker. The samples were washed seven times on a vacuum manifold (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1% Triton X-100 at 200 l/well and three times with PBS at 100 l/well. Following washing, the amount of Ruc antigen bound to hJAM1-Fc was determined by measuring luminescence as described above. Cell transfection and selection. For transient expression, cells (2 ϫ 10 6 to 3 ϫ 10 6 /well) were transfected with 1 to 5 g of plasmid DNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 or 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 to 48 h before further manipulations. For transfected cell selection, cells were grown in the presence of the antibiotic G418 (1 mg/ml) or puromycin (2 to 5 g/ml) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
