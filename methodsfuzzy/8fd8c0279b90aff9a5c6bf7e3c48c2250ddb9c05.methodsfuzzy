We conducted a 2-part study during the month of February 2010. The study took place at 2 hospital sites of Sherbrooke University Hospital Center, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Community Health. First, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed, consisting of an anonymous systematic observation of nurses in triage from 11th to 18th of February. Five students in medicine documented actual observance of respiratory hygiene by emergency triage nurses in the presence of a patient with fever and cough. The sample was a nonprobability convenience sample because all nurses meeting a patient with symptoms of respiratory infection between the 11th and 18th of February, during day, evening, and night shift, were part of our study (n Â¼ 115 observations). Nurse participation was voluntary, with only 1 refusal. They were also informed that the observations were designed to improve the quality of care. The shift observed (day, evening, or night), as well as the sex of the worker were recorded. Data were gathered on respiratory precaution etiquette. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Nine items (Table 1) regarding proper identification and isolation of respiratory infection were evaluated (observation tool available on request to corresponding author). If the patient was already wearing a mask or appropriately isolated before seeing the nurse, these facts were noted. Several opportunities could be reported for a single nurse. Because of ethical issues, all health workers chosen for observation were nurses because direct observation could be performed in the waiting room without disturbing patient care. We then conducted a second cross-sectional descriptive study with a knowledge-attitudes-practices questionnaire (questionnaire available on request to corresponding author), distributed on February 18 and 19 to health care personnel at the 2 emergency units. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and subjective compliance and was administered on a voluntary basis to all health staff members present in both emergency rooms (triage and observation rooms) on February 18 and 19, 2009, during different shifts (day, evening, night). The questionnaire was a combination derived from the literature. 13, 15, [19] [20] [21] [22] This tool allowed us to collect demographic data on (real or perceived) knowledge, attitudes, and practices collected in connection with the observance of the respiratory precautions. A 0 to 4 Likert scale was used for the following elements of the questionnaire: frequency of recommendation of wearing mask by patient, wearing mask by staff, hand hygiene before and after patient contact, as well as informing other colleagues of respiratory precautions. These elements were combined to calculate a score of perceived compliance. A perceived knowledge score was calculated with a 0 to 4 Likert scale using a question about perceived level of knowledge on respiratory precautions. The actual knowledge score was calculated by combining the following elements: the mode of transmission of infectious agents, the usefulness of hand hygiene, and the recommendation of the handwashing and droplet precautions. The attitudes section was rated using a modified visual analogue scale from 0 to 8 and evaluated the fear of acquiring infection respiratory, beliefs on effective protection by mask, and barriers to use of mask. In addition, vaccination against influenza in the year of the study was assessed. To verify the quality of the questionnaire, the clarity of the questions, and the length of the latter, we conducted a 10subject pretest on a population of medical students and nurses and subsequently reconstructed some of our questions.
