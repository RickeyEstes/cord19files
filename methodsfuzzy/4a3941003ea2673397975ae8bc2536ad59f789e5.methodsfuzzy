Our evaluation concerns the performance of the MIH itself. Inclusion of the prehospital evaluation for 34 incidents is beyond the scope of this analysis. We retrieved all data from the evaluation reports of every MIH deployment since its founding in 1991. Reports had been made directly after the event as part of the debriefing in almost every admission, and had been discussed among involved disciplines for learning points and accuracy. One of the authors (JvdE) participated in all admissions and evaluations until 2008 except the repatriation of fugitives from Kosovo (1999) . Missing data were retrieved retrospectively from the charts and medical files. These files had all been kept on paper within the MIH. Demographic and quantitative data were registered (such as number of patients, types of injuries, hospital resources). All applicable data were registered according to the PMRD protocol [11] , which is divided into 18 headings that we used to direct our evaluation (see Table 1 ). The standardized tables from the protocol were used, sometimes extended with additional columns. For qualitative, descriptive values we abstracted the results of all admissions and further discussed admissions which revealed the most interesting learning points.
