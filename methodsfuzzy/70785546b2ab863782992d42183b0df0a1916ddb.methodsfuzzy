Demographic and clinical data were obtained through the use of standardised contact tracing forms populated by the public health database maintained by the MOH Command & Control Center (CCC). According to the CCC, a confirmed MERS-CoV case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. A suspected case of MERS-CoV in adults (>14 years) is defined as follows: (1) acute respiratory illness with clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; (2) a hospitalised patient with healthcare-associated pneumonia based on clinical and radiological evidence; (3) upper or lower respiratory tract illness within 2 weeks of exposure to a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection; or (4) unexplained acute febrile illness (≥38°C) presenting with body aches, headache, diarrhoea or nausea/vomiting, with or without respiratory symptoms, and with leucopoenia.
