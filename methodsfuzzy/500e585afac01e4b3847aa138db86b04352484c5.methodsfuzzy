The study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, doubleblind, double-simulation, oseltamivir-controlled and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial, in which eligible subjects will be allocated randomly into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: oseltamivir treatment (positive control), CLD treatment (test) and placebo groups. The randomisation allocation number will be provided by the third-party unit (Chinese Evidence-based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China). Based on the current evidence 23 of oseltamivir in treating seasonal influenza 24 and the patient's disease burden, we also referenced the course of treatment of another Chinese prescription Lianhuaqingwen capsule 25 in treating influenza. Participants in each group will receive treatment for 5 days and observation for 21 days, and will be followed up by research interviewers on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 after treatment 26 ; the study flowchart is shown in figure 1 . In the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). During the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. The symptoms based on Western medicine (case report form (CRF) tables) and TCM syndrome differentiation based on TCM (table 1) will be recorded. Pharyngeal/throat swabs from the upper respiratory tract will be used for RT-PCR and cultivated the influenza virus, and blood samples will be used to test for influenza virus antibodies. 27 Figure 1 Study flowchart. Participants that meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited and assigned randomly into three different groups. All participants will accept a 5-day treatment and 21-day follow-up period of observation. Data will be collected to evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of Chou-Ling-Dan (CLD). AUC, area under the curve; CRF, case report form; TCM, traditional Chinese medicine. Table 1 Continued Open access subject screening and selection A pharyngeal/throat swab from outpatients with probable influenza will be taken first to detect the influenza virus via a point-of-care testing kit before enrolment. Patients with a positive result will be referred to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (shown below). Patients will be enrolled if they meet all inclusion criteria and will not be enrolled if they have any one of the exclusion criteria. Patients will be removed from the trial if they meet one of the rejection criteria or termination standards. The enrolled participants will be required to provide written informed consent, to cooperate with the doctor's treatment, to cooperate with the follow-up and provide information that is not beyond the remit of the ethical approval. Patients that do not comply will be removed from the study. In this period, pharyngeal/throat swabs and blood samples will be collected from participants. The participants will also be distinguished according to TCM syndrome differentiation criteria (described below). The study is designed to enrol 318 patients in six units. The six units include the main central unit: the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University; the subcentral unit: the Outpatient Department of Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital; the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University; the first people's Hospital of Yulin City, Shaanxi Province and the second people's Hospital of Liwan District, Guangzhou and the first people's Hospital of Yunnan Province. Each unit is charged with specific responsibilities of the study, including enrolling patients and collecting specimens and data. The virus and antibody detection will be performed in the laboratories of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Clinical Virology Division of the National Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou, China. Data analysis will be carried out at the Chinese Evidencebased Medicine Center (the third-party unit). To ensure the safety of patients, blinding of the study design, data quality and adherence to the study protocol, personnel who participate directly in this study will be adequately trained and follow guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP).
