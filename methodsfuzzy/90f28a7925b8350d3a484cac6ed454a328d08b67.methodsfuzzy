Specimens are collected from patients by submitters and sent to PHOL for testing as part of routine clinical service. These data are also used for routine laboratory surveillance, which is a mandate of Public Health Ontario. Therefore, consultation with our organization's privacy office or ethics committee was not required. To protect patient privacy and confidentiality, data are reported in an aggregated anonymized format. Data for this study included specimens submitted for EV-D68 testing at PHOL from patients who presented with respiratory symptoms in different health care settings across Ontario, from September 1, 2014 to October 31, 2014. For the purpose of this investigation, cases were individuals who tested positive for the virus whereas controls were individuals who tested negative for EV-D68; the term "patients" refers to both cases and controls. PHOL has had the capacity to test respiratory specimens for EV-D68 since September 24, 2014. Prior to that time, all EV-D68 testing on behalf of PHOL was performed at the National Microbiology Laboratory, (NML) Canada's reference laboratory. At both laboratories, primary specimens underwent total nucleic acid extraction using the bioMérieux NucliSENS 1 easy-MAG 1 protocol (bioMérieux Inc. Marcy I'Etoile, Rhone, France). Screening of clinical specimens for EV-D68 at PHOL was performed using a real time PCR assay targeting the 5'NTR region) [16] . Subsequently, all positive specimens were subjected to a semi-nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the VP1 gene coding for the capsid protein followed by Sanger sequencing with Bigdye V3.1 kit (Life Technologies Inc. California, USA) to amplify of a 375 bp partial VP1 region for serotype identification) [17] . A similar testing method was performed at NML, with sequencing performed by the Genomics core facility at NML [18] . Sequences were assembled using Sequencer 5.2.4 and compared to VP1 sequences in GenBank using BLAST. NML also employed an EV-D68 strain-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR test [19] . Testing at PHOL continued until December 1, 2014 and it was also performed retrospectively for some patients from whom specimens were submitted before September. A selection of specimens included in this investigation were also tested by viral culture and/ or multiplex PCR as per PHOL's routine laboratory testing algorithm. For virus culture testing, rhesus monkey and WI-38 (and /or MRC5) cell lines were used to isolate viruses from different specimens including respiratory specimens. Growth of viruses (cytopathogenic effects) were confirmed using fluorescent monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Multiplex PCR (Seeplex1 RV, Seeplex1 RV15 ACE; Seegene, USA) were used to test for adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/ rhinovirus influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and RSV. Statistical analyses were performed at the patient and specimen level using Stata/SE version 10.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Clinical and demographic information provided on PHOL's laboratory requisition was used for this investigation; patient charts were not available for review as PHOL is the provincial reference laboratory and as such has no direct access to patient records. Specimen collection date was used for these analyses and in the event that this was missing, it was replaced by the date when the specimen was received at PHOL. Data were transformed from specimen to patient level by probabilistic patient linkage; when discrepant results (both a positive and a negative result) were identified for the same patient, the positive result took priority over the negative one. In the event more than one specimen was submitted per patient, specimen collection date of the first specimen submitted was used and the setting that indicated the highest clinical severity (e.g. hospitalized vs. community dwelling) was used to describe disease severity. Percent positivity and descriptions of EV-D68 cases by timing of specimen collection, age, sex, setting, symptoms and local health unit of residence were analysed at the patient level. Reports of other viruses identified in addition to EV-D68 and specimen type were described at the specimen level. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed at the patient level to compare cases and controls in terms of age, sex, settings, symptoms and timing of specimen collection. P-values and odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported.
