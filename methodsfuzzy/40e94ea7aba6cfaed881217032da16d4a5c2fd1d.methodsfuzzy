Though pathogen detection by microarray is a young field, a number of different platforms and approaches have been described, each with important attributes. For example, the array described by Wang et al. [9] is based on probes designed to recognize the most conserved viral domains, facilitating the detection of a taxonomic fingerprint that provides powerful clues to viral identity with minimal probe usage. Lin et al. [8], on the other hand, described a probe-dense resequencing array capable of detecting a smaller set of predefined pathogens, but with higher detection specificity, including the ability to discern highly related subtypes. The microarray described herein represents a blend of these two concepts, integrating a probe tiling approach for substantial genomic coverage (though with lower probe density than a resequencing array), with a taxonomy-based strategy for binning probes into pathogen recognition signatures. Thus, our analytical output includes both family-and genus-level predictions (for r-signatures restricted to conserved probes) as well as species-specific predictions (for r-signatures composed of conserved and unique probes). Indeed, this capability allowed us to detect and accurately identify viruses in clinical samples ( Table 2 ). Central to pathogen prediction are the algorithms that weigh the microarray data against pre-defined recognition signatures. Unfortunately, few such algorithms exist, and only one algorithm, E-Predict, has been reported and validated [5, 29, 30] . E-Predict matches hybridization signatures with predicted pathogen signatures derived from the theoretical free energy of hybridization for each microarray probe. To examine the performance of E-predict on our microarray platform, we analyzed a number of samples with both E-predict and our PDA algorithm. When applied to our microarray data, E-Predict performed well, with its first prediction tending to be the correct one (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). However, for each specimen, a number of false positive calls were also made, which seemed to reflect species with considerable sequence similarity to the true infecting pathogen (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). For example, in patient sample 412, E-Predict detected RSV (the correct pathogen), but also multiple species of coronavirus (which share some sequence similarity with RSV), yet real-time PCR using pancoronavirus primers as well as primers specific for strains OC43 and 229E indicated the absence of coronavirus from this sample ( Figure S4 in Additional data file 1). These false positive calls can be explained by the fact that the function of E-Predict is less geared towards identifying and distinguishing specific pathogen strains, and aimed more at elucidating the best possible candidates as supported by the available probes. Thus, E-Predict is particularly advantageous in situations where a pathogen's sequence is not fully known [5] . In contrast, our PDA algorithm is designed to make calls with greater species-level resolution. A major strength of PDA is its ability to specifically identify sequence-characterized and coinfecting pathogens with low false positivity. This is aptly demonstrated by the ability of PDA to detect specifically the presence of Dengue 1 in the clinical sample, where 7/35 viruses on the array are from the Flaviviridae family, including 4 dengue serotypes that share 70% sequence homology. The benefits of using both algorithms simultaneously for detecting both known and novel pathogens should be further evaluated. An important discovery in this study was that the composition of the random primer tag has a significant impact on the efficiency of viral genome amplification, as assessed by an amplification efficiency score. The measurement of amplification efficiency allowed us to predict which probes would provide the most informative recognition signatures, markedly improving our pathogen prediction capability. Moreover, this finding allowed us to design AES-optimized primers that increased the amplification efficiency of our samples, resulting in greater sensitivity of pathogen detection. Whether multiplex RT-PCR using a variety of AES-designed primer tags can further increase amplification efficiency warrants further investigation. Additionally, it is feasible that other tag-based PCR applications, such as the generation of DNA libraries and enrichment of RNA for resequencing, may benefit from primer optimization using the AES algorithm. DNA microarrays have the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnostics through their ability to simultaneously investigate thousands of potential pathogens in order to make a diagnosis. However, questions remain regarding their sensitivity and reliability. In this work, we investigated the myriad factors that influence microarray performance in the context of virus detection in clinical specimens, and describe an optimized platform capable of identifying individual and coinfecting viruses with high accuracy and sensitivity that brings microarray technology closer to the clinic. Future improvements will include significant reductions in microarray manufacturing and usage costs. Multiplex microarray formats and 're-usable' arrays are developing technologies that promise to drive down these costs. Furthermore, alternative technologies, such as beads [31] , microfluidics [32, 33] and nanotube microarrays [34] , might provide advantages in both assay cost and speed relative to traditional microarray platforms. Technology considerations aside, the advantages of a highly parallel, nucleic acid-based screening approach for detecting disease pathogens are clear. Validations in larger patient cohorts and in diverse clinical settings will be an important next step towards establishing the clinical role of pathogen detection microarrays.
