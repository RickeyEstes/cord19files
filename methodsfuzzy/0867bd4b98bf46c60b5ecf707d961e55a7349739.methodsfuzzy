In situations where an animal has experienced a severe adverse reaction to vaccination or when the owner refuses conventional vaccination, there is appropriate justification for selecting alternative methodologies, such as homeopathic nosodes (Pitcairn, 1993; Dodds, 1995a Dodds, , 1997 , to protect against the common infectious diseases of animals. A word of caution is in order here, however, because a recently conducted, preliminary trial with a parvovirus nosode failed to protect puppies against challenge with a street virus strain of CPV (S. G. Wynn and R. D. Schultz, personal communication, 1997) . Additional trials are obviously needed to assess the efficacy of the various nosode preparations currently in use. These alternative techniques must be performed under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian with an established doctor/client/ patient relationship, and requested by the owner of the pet after receiving appropriate informed consent. Obtaining a signed disclaimer and release form from the client is also advisable. Finally, minimizing the risk for exposure to infectious diseases should always be kept in mind, by avoiding areas where animals of unknown health status congregate or exercise.
