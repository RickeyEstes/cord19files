Expression, purification, and crystallization. The construction, expression, purification, and biochemical studies of MuV fusion core protein was described previously [20] . The purified MuV fusion core protein were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH8.0, 10 mM NaCl, and concentrated to 20 mg ml À1 . Crystallization was performed by the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method at 291 K. One microliter protein solution was mixed with 1 ll reservoir solution and the mixture was equilibrated against 200 ll reservoir solution at 291 K. Crystallization conditions were screened using Crystal Screen reagent kits (Hampton Research). Crystals with good quality can be obtained in 15% PEG800, 0.5 M lithium sulfate in 2 weeks. Data collection and processing. Data collection of MuV fusion core was performed in-house on a Rigaku RU2000 rotating-copper-anode X-ray generator operated at 48 kV and 98 mA (CuKa; k = 1.5418 Å ) with a MAR 345 image-plate detector. The crystal was mounted on nylon loops and flash-cooled in cold nitrogen-gas stream at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems with reservoir solution as the cryoprotectant. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs [26] . b Phase determination and model refinement. The structure of MuV fusion core was solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS [27] . A model derived from the SV5F N1/C1 trimer [16] was used as a search model. The MuV fusion core trimer molecules were built into the electron density map using the program O [28] . After several cycles of manual building and refinement using the programs O [28] and CNS [27] without non-crystallographic restrain, the structure was subsequently refined to a final resolution of 2.2 Å with an R-value of 23.5% and free-Rvalue of 27.9%. The quality of the structure was verified by PROCHECK [29] . No residue was in disallowed regions and 98% residues were in mostpreferred regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection statistics and the structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . The figures were generated with the programs GRASP [30] , SPDBViewer [31] , and MOLSCRIPT [32] . Protein Data Bank Accession numbers. The coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with Accession code 2FYZ.
