Test material. Brown HT was supplied by Williams (Hounsiow) Ltd, Hounslow, Middlesex. Analysis carded out by the suppliers showed that the material contained: dye, 70.4%; subsidiary dyes, < 15%; volatile matter, 2.1%; water-insoluble matter, 0.06%; sodium chloride, 31.3%; arsenic, <lppm; lead, < 5 ppm; iron, 30 ppm; copper, < 1 ppm; chromium, < 1 ppm; zinc, 1 ppm; cadmium, < 1 ppm; mercury, 0.8 ppm; free aromatic amines (as aniline), < 10 ppm; ether extractable material, 0.1%; naphthionic acid, 0.7%. (Figures for impurities have been prorated to correspond to 100% dye content.) Animal maintenance. Weanling rats of a Wistarderived outbred strain were outlined as litters from a specified-pathogen-free breeding colony (University of Nottingham, Joint Animal Breeding Unit, Loughborough, Leicester). Groups of six of the same sex and treatment were housed in polypropylene cages with open-mesh stainless-steel wire tops and floors (North Kent Plastic Cages Ltd, Dartford, Kent), suspended on racks over high-wet-strength paper for collection of excreta. Pregnant females were housed in similar cages with solid floors and sawdust bedding. Throughout the study the animals were maintained in air-conditioned rooms with an ambient air temperature of approximately 20Â°C, relative humidity in the range 40-60%, and an automatic 14/10-hr light/dark cycle. The weanling rats were allowed to acclimatize to the environmental conditions for 2 wk before receiving the test diets. Diets. The animals were allowed free access to food and tap-water during all phases of the study. Control rats received a basic powdered diet, Spratt's Laboratory Animal Diet No. 2 (Spratt's Patent Ltd, Barking, Essex) . Test diets contained concentrations of Brown HT calculated on the basis of food intake and body weight measurements to provide, as accurately as possible, a constant intake of 0 (control), 50, 250 or 500 mg Brown HT/kg body weight/day throughout the experiment. When rats of more than one age shared the same cage the dietary concentration was calculated on the basis of the youngest animal's food intake and body weight. A sample of each diet was analysed for Brown HT content prior to use.
