Most hybridisation and PCR methods generate products that require definitive identification by sequencing. One method of achieving this is the commonly used 'chain termination method', often referred to as 'Sanger' or 'dideoxy sequencing'. This method is based on the DNA polymerase-dependent synthesis of a complementary DNA strand in the presence of natural 2 0 -doexynucleotides (dNTPs) and 2 0 ,3 0 -didoexynucleotides (ddNTPs) that serve as non-reversible synthesis terminators (Sanger et al., 1977) . A limitation of this technique in terms of virus identification can be the requirement to clone viral sequences into bacteria prior to sequencing, although direct sequencing of PCR products can also be employed. When cloning is performed using this method, host-related bias can occur (Hall, 2007) , and, as only a relatively limited number of clones can be sequenced, methods to enrich for virus prior to amplification are required. Recently, use of the Sanger method has been partially succeeded by 'next generation sequencing' technologies that circumvent the need for cloning by using highly efficient in vitro DNA amplification (Morozova and Marra, 2008) . Next generation sequencing technology includes the 454 pyrosequencing-based instrument (Roche Applied Sciences), genome analysers (Illumina) and the SOLiD system (Applied Biosystems). This approach dramatically increases cost-effective sequence throughput, albeit at the expense of sequence read-length. Compared to read-lengths in the region of up to 900 bp produced by modern automated Sanger instruments, read-lengths of approximately 76-106 bp are generated by Illumina and of 250-400 bp by 454 technology. The comparatively short read-length of next generation sequencing technologies is however compensated for by the large number of 'reads' generated. Typically 100 kilobases of sequence data are produced from a modern Sanger instrument with 454 sequencing capable of generating up to 400 megabases of data, and Illumina sequencing technology can produce up to 20 gigabases of sequence data/run (Metzker, 2010) .
