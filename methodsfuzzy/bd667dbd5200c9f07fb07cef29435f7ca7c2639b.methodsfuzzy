Samples from domestic ferrets: From animal hospitals in Japan, 9 serum and 26 plasma samples were collected from domestic ferrets between Aug 1st, 2012 and Feb 4th, 2014 and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. We analyzed and reported the results for 79 of the feces samples in our previous study [9] . One fecal sample from a ferret in our animal facility was used to amplify the N gene of the FRcoV Yamaguchi-1 strain. Amplification of N genes: RNA of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was extracted from feces using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. N genes of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was amplified by RT-PCR using TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM Kit (AMV) Ver. 1.1 (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). RT was performed using random 9-mer oligonucleotide primers, and PcR was performed using primer pairs, NF2 (5′-TTA CAT ATG GTA TAA GAA CTA AAC-3′) and NR2 (5′-CGA TGT AGG AAC CTT CAA AAT A-3′). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Construction of expression plasmids: Yamaguchi-1 strain fragments were amplified using primer pairs, N1F (5′-TGG GAT CCA TGG CTG GAA ACG GAC CAC-3′) and N179R (5′-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTA TTG GAT CTA TTG TTG GAC-3′) for nt 1-537 encoding a.a. 1-179, and N180F (5′-TGG GAT CCA TTA ACA GTA ACA GTG GTG ATA T-3′) and N374R (5′-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTT AGT TCA TCA ATA ATT TCA-3′) for nt 538-1125 encoding a.a. 180-374. These forward and reverse primers contained BamHI and XhoI sites at the 5′-end, respectively. Fragments were purified using a MinElute PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN) and digested with restriction enzymes, BamHI and XhoI. Two fragments of the Yamaguchi-1 strain were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Fragments were then cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.) using a DNA Ligation Kit Ver. 2.1 (TaKaRa). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia (E.) coli strain DH5α (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Expression and purification of glutathione-S transferase (GST)-fusion proteins: Two N protein fragments, N1-179 and N180-374, were expressed as fusion proteins with GST, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374), respectively. E. coli containing recombinant or control plasmid was cultured in 2 × yeast extract and tryptone (YT) medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract and 0.5% Nacl, pH 7.0) containing 50 µg ampicillin ml −1 . Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1thiogalactopyranoside (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 4 hr. The bacterial cells were suspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 50 mM Nacl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and lysed using a Multi-beads shocker (YASUI KIKAI, Osaka, Japan). After centrifugation, supernatants were mixed with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 1% for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,630 × g at 4°c for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, mixed with glutathione sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated at 4°c for 30 min. After centrifugation, beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and once with sonication buffer. The beads were mixed with 300 µl of 10 mM glutathione and incubated at 4°c for 1 hr. After incubation, supernatants were harvested as purified recombinant proteins and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. The purified proteins were confirmed to be single bands by coomassie-brilliant blue (cBB) staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant proteins: Purified recombinant proteins were mixed in equal volumes of 2 × sample buffer (125 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 3 min. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and stained with cBB. Quantification of recombinant proteins: concentration of purified proteins was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent concentrate (BIO-RAD, Hercules, cA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was constructed using bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 595 nm. ELISA: The concentration of purified recombinant proteins was adjusted to 5 µg ml −1 with adsorption buffer (0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). GST was used as a control at 5µg ml −1 . One hundred microliters of purified recombinant proteins and GST were added to 96well microplates (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After incubation at 37°c for 2 hr, plates were placed at 4°c overnight. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with 200 µl of 1% Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) in PBS at 37°c for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 µl of diluted sera or plasma were added to duplicate wells and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. Sera or plasma was diluted to 1:100 or 1:500 with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace. Subsequently, wells were washed three times with PBS-T before 100 µl of peroxidase-conjugated anti-ferret immunoglobulin (ROcKLAND, Limerick, PA, U.S.A.) diluted with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace was added and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. Following three washes with PBS-T, 100 µl of Horseradish Peroxidase Substrate (BIO-RAD) was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of 2% oxalic acid to each well. The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 415 nm. All results were subtracted from the value for GST, and the cut-off value was arbitrarily set at 0.5. Phylogenetic analysis: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the program MrBayes Ver. 3.2.2 [7] for MrModeltest analysis with a WAG substitution matrix [10] . We referred to the following sequences to construct the phylogenetic tree of N protein sequences; FREcV strain MSU-2 (GU338457), FREcV strain MSU-1 (DQ340562), FRScV strain MSU-1 (GU338456), mink coV strain WD1127 (HM245925), mink coV strain WD1133 (HM245926), ccoV type II strain fc1 (AB781790), FcoV type II strain M91-267 (AB781788), FcoV type I strain c3663 (AB535528), SARS-coV strain BJ182-12 (EU371564) and FRcoV strain Yamaguchi-1 (Lc029423). The tree was represented graphically using FigTree Ver. 1.4.2 [1] . Statistical analysis: Significant differences were statistically analyzed using chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests. P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
