Analysis of apoD N-glycosylation. Aliquots of plasma (20 µg protein) from C57BL/6J mice (male, 10 weeks old) were incubated without (-) and with (+) 1,000 U of N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 30 µl at 37°C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was resolved on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-apoD (developed in our own laboratory). RNA isolation and RT-PCR assay. Total RNA isolation from tissue (20 mg) was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Aliquots of purified RNA (100 ng) from were subjected to RT-PCR analysis using apoD sequence-specific primers flanking the apoD mRNA for forward reaction (5'-TAAGGCCTCTCCTGCAGCCA-3') and reverse reaction (5'-CTTTACAGGAAGTCCGGGCAG-3'). The resulting PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Immunohistochemistry. Mice were sacrificed and the proximal aorta of individual mice was dissected free of adipose and connective tissue, and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The aorta was mounted in Cryomatrix (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and frozen in isopentane that has been pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Transverse cryo-sections (10 µm) were cut and stained by oil red O to visualize the atherosclerotic lesions. Consecutive sections were immunostained using either rabbit control IgG derived against bacterial βgalactosidase or polyclonal rabbit anti-apoD, followed by incubation with the donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3. All animal studies were approved by the IACUC of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (protocol #30-07).
