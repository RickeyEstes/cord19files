Cell lines and mice. Murine L2 (L2) and baby hamster kidney cells expressing MHV receptor (BHK-MHVR) were cultured as described previously (7, 44) . Calu-3 clone 2B4 cells (a kind gift from Chien-Te Tseng, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) were cultured with Gibco minimum essential medium (MEM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburg, PA), penicillinstreptomycin (Gibco), and amphotericin B (Fungizone) (Gibco). Vero CCL-81 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured, and the MERS-CoV plaque assay was performed as previously described (22) . Human A549 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . B6 mice and RNase L Ϫ/Ϫ mice were bred and maintained in the University of Pennsylvania animal facility, and the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania. Primary BMM were derived from bone marrow harvested from the hind limbs (tibia and femur) of 4-to 6-week-old B6 or RNase L Ϫ/Ϫ mice and described previously (29, 45) . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 20% L929 cellconditioned media for 6 days before infection. Plasmids and recombinant viruses. NS4b sequences for MERS-CoV (GenBank accession no. AFS88939.1), SC2013 (GenBank accession no. AHY61340.1), and HKU5 (accession no. YP_001039965.1) were obtained from NCBI. NS4b cDNA sequences were synthesized with the addition of a 5= SalI site and 3= Flag epitope and NotI site and then cloned into pUC57 (Bio Basic, Markham, Ontario, Canada). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on each NS4b plasmid to generate point mutants (CAC to CGC) containing histidine-to-arginine mutations within the second catalytic motif yielding H182R, H186R, and H183R for MERS-CoV, SC2013, and HKU5 NS4b proteins, respectively, and subsequently sequence verified. Each NS4b gene was then PCR amplified and subcloned in frame with maltose binding protein into pMAL protein expression vector. MHV NS2 and NS2 H126R were previously cloned into pMAL parallel-2 vector (29) . MHV WT , MHV Mut , and all chimeric viruses were constructed with the MHV strain A59 infectious clone (44) . Each WT or mutant NS4b cDNA was subcloned into open reading frame 4 (ORF4) of the infectious clone plasmid G EGFP (EGFP stands for enhanced green fluorescent protein), and sequences were confirmed as described previously (28) . The fulllength cDNAs were assembled with A to E (MHV WT ), F (MHV Mut ), and G (NS4b) fragments, and RNA was in vitro transcribed and recovered as previously described (44) . Briefly, infectious clone fragments were excised from their respective plasmids by restriction enzyme digestion. The fragments were gel purified and ligated in vitro to create a full-length cDNA. cDNA was in vitro transcribed with mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion; Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY), generating fulllength genomic RNA. Each genomic RNA transcript was split into two distinct pools and electroporated into BHK-MHVR along with N-protein transcript using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Electroporated cells were incubated until cytopathology was evident throughout, freeze thawed three times, and plaque purified, and one plaque from each pool was utilized in parallel for all assays. MERS-⌬NS4b was constructed using the MERS-CoV infectious clone (22) . To delete NS4b, sequence was synthesized (Bio Basic) in which mutations were made in the overlap region between NS4a and NS4b to abrogate putative start codons (T2C and T17C; all positions relative to the NS4b start) and to insert premature stop codons (A91T, C97A, and C102G). Additionally, residues 106 to 669 were deleted to remove the majority of NS4b but leave in place transcriptional regulatory sequence 5. The truncated NS4b cassette and MERS-CoV infectious clone F plasmid were digested with PacI and SanDI, and truncated NS4b was ligated into the MERS-CoV F plasmid. To construct the MERS-NS4b H182R mutant, two PCRs were performed using the F plasmid as the template to synthesize overlapping DNA fragments and introducing an H182R substitution. These two templates were then joined in an overlapping extension PCR. The resultant product was digested with PacI and SanDI and cloned into the MERS F plasmid. Assembly of the infectious clone and recovery of infectious virus were performed as described previously (22) . The potential gain-of-function (GOF) concerns of MERS-⌬NS4b and MERS-NS4b H182R were evaluated and reviewed by NIH under grant U19AI107810 and approved for continued study. The MERS-⌬NS3-5 mutant (22) was generated prior to GOF regulations. The MERS-⌬NS3-5 and catalytic mutant display attenuated growth on select interferon-competent human cell lines. FRET assay and enzyme kinetics. NS4b of MERS-CoV, SC2013, and HKU5 were cloned into pMal parallel-2 vector (46) and expressed in BL21 T7 express competent E. coli (NEB, Inc., Ipswich, MA) as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ GL10/100 using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 M in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and gel filtration in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mM NaCl as described earlier for purification of MHV NS2 (29) . Briefly, purified proteins (10 M MBP as control or 1 M concentration of MBP fusion proteins with NS4b of MERS-CoV, SC2013, and HKU5 or their catalytically inactive mutants described in the previous section) in 150 l of assay buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol) were incubated at 30°C with various concentrations of (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 . Aliquots of 20 l were withdrawn at different times, and the reactions were stopped by heat inactivation at 95°C for 3 min followed by 30-min centrifugation at 20,000 ϫ g (4°C) and supernatants were carefully removed. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based RNase L activation assay was used to determine enzyme kinetics by measuring the uncleaved, intact (2=,5=)p 3 A 3 as previously described (47) . The amounts of 2-5A cleaved were determined by the relative fluorescence units (RFU) using standard curves with different concentrations of authentic 2-5A. The reaction velocities were determined by nonlinear fit of the data. The k cat and K m were determined in GraphPad Prism 5.0 for Windows by plotting velocity against substrate concentrations, and data were analyzed by the following equation: where Y is the velocity of the reaction in micromolar per second, X is the substrate concentration in micromolar, and Et is the concentration of enzyme catalytic sites. The kinetics were determined in triplicate reactions. Virus was added to cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37°C. Cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (three times) and fed with medium. At the times indicated in the figures, cells were fixed and analyzed for protein expression by immunofluorescent staining, lysed, and analyzed for protein expression by immunoblotting or analyzed for degradation of RNA, or supernatants were harvested for quantification of viral titers by plaque assay on L2 cells (48) .
