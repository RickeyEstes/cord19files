The study was carried out in 3 stages. PPC available in Hong Kong were sorted by their physical properties in the first stage. The second stage was a single-blinded study examining the different usability aspects of the PPC. The third stage was a simulated viral load test. Results: Four types were identified: good water repellency and water resistance, poor air permeability (Type A PPC); good water repellency and air permeability, poor water resistance (Type B PPC); poor water repellency, poor water resistance, and fair air permeability (Type C PPC); and good water repellency, poor air permeability, and fair water resistance (Type D PPC). Type D PPC had a significantly higher number of contamination sites on the subjects' dorsum and palm. Type C PPC had the highest contamination over the trunk. Findings in the viral load test showed that there was a significant difference in the contamination of the face (t = 4.69, df = 38, P\.00) between 1 and 2 strokes. Conclusion: Type A PPC is effective in providing a desirable protective function against droplet splash, if a disposable PPC is required. Type C PPC, the surgical gown, is also appropriate, as the cost is low, air permeability is fair, and the level of possible hand contamination is lowest among the 4 groups in the current study. (Am J Infect Control 2004;32:90-6.) The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic continues to affect the world. SARS has been described as a highly contagious disease, and health care workers are the most vulnerable group. So far in Hong Kong, more than 1700 cases of SARS have been reported, with more than 22% of the total affected being health care workers. 1 To prevent cross-infection, 1 of the most effective strategies is the use of personal protective clothing (PPC). [2] [3] [4] PPC in this study refers specifically to gown. In Hong Kong, various PPC types are available (eg, Barrierman, Airmate, Tyvek, surgical gowns), but despite their use, health care workers have still been affected. It is interesting to note that hospitals using traditional PPC such as surgical and plastic aprons have a lower incidence of staff-contracted SARS. 5 Whether the available types of PPC provide full protection against the virus has not yet been determined. However, important in ensuring high PPC performance is the PPC's usability. PPC usability is defined as the level of comfort, ease of use, time taken to put on/take off, and risk of contamination. Optimal usability is crucial in providing protection for health care workers who are exposed to the virus day and night while taking care of SARS patients. No research study has yet tested PPC usability. To this end, a team of academic and clinical investigators designed a study to examine the usability of each PPC type available in Hong Kong. It would be both dangerous and unethical to conduct PPC tests by exposing participants (health care workers) to SARS patients. Therefore, this study was conducted in the laboratories of the School of Nursing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and a fluorescence stain was used, instead of the live virus, to simulate viral attachment. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the usability of the PPC types. The objectives were to (1) examine the physical properties of the PPC; (2) assess the usability of the PPC; and (3) evaluate the effect of increased viral load. The study comprised 3 stages. The first stage investigated the physical properties of the PPC. The second stage was a single-blinded study: subjects were allocated a PPC using a random table. The third stage was a simulated viral load test. Details of the procedures in stage 2 were as follows. Explanation of the study's purpose was given and written consent was sought before study implementation. The researcher demonstrated the method for putting on and taking off a gown. For Type D PPC, subjects were asked to read the user instructions that came with the PPC. Subjects were asked to put on the allocated PPC, and the researcher recorded the time required for put-on. Subjects were then asked to go to laboratory 2 next door and stand in front of a perplex box that exposed the trunk while blocking the remaining parts of the body. The researcher sprayed the exposed part with either fluorescein or water with an atomizer (subjects were blindfolded during this process). Subjects then returned to the first laboratory and took off the PPC, while the researcher recorded the time required for take-off. Subjects were next asked to go to laboratory 3 for a UV scan and to have the stains photographed. Subjects were then asked to remove the stains, if any, by washing with alcohol; afterward, the researcher scanned subjects with UV light to ensure the stains had been removed. Subjects were then asked to repeat the above procedure twice. Upon completion of all 3 trials, subjects were asked to fill out the usability questionnaire.
