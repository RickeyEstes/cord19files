The technological advances in medicine have resulted in a vast array of different materials being used to manufacture devices for insertion into the body for therapeutic purposes. Ever since antisepsis was first demonstrated to reduce postoperative sepsis by Joseph Lister in 1867, it has been axiomatic that devices should be pathogen free. Antisepsis was replaced by asepsis at the turn of the century, but the comment that is ascribed to the surgeon Berkeley Moyhnihan (1865-1936) that 'every operation in surgery is an experiment in bacteriology' remains as true today as in the 1920s.
