The main goal of the present work is to compute adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death from COVID-19 considering age intervals, gender and comorbidities as possible risk factors. Complete data is not accessible but a thorough description of the outbreak was made available by China CDC on the 14 th February 11 . Based on these data we implemented a Monte Carlo simulation § in the R programming language 15 to create a synthetic dataset from which a logistic regression can be computed along with ORs. The dataset includes four variables: age, gender, comorbidities and death. All variables are treated as qualitative and follow the same rationale expressed in the China CDC report. Age is described by intervals of decades (0-9; 10-19; up to ≥ 80 years old) and the comorbidities are: hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. The outcome variable, death, is dichotomous with states dead and alive. The aforementioned report has information about age and gender distributions, which we used to populate the dataset. However, these distributions are described independently making it impossible to know the exact gender frequency for each age interval. We assumed that the distribution by gender would be similar across age intervals. To render the gender, male or female, for each subject a random number is drawn following a Bernoulli random experience with probability given by the gender distribution ( Figure 1 ). male is 1. § The routine is free available at https://apps.uc.pt/mypage/faculty/fcaramelo/en/covid .

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing the comorbidity distribution by age and gender feeds the routine. Comorbidities' empirical prevalence can be computed from China CDC report for all subjects, but does not allow different values for each age interval and gender and, for that reason, we considered that prevalence values for each comorbidity were constant across age groups and gender. Despite this limitation, tests can be run using worldwide prevalence for each disease. Finally, comorbidities classes were assumed to be exclusive, i.e., no subject could have more than one comorbidity. After populating age, gender and comorbidities variables in the dataset, it still misses the death variable, which highly depends on the previous items. To fill in this variable, we used a Naïve Bayesian approach considering that age, gender and comorbidities would be independent. Therefore, the probability, ( | , , ), of dying given the age interval (A), the gender (G) and the comorbidity (C) is given from where D stands for dying (or death), G for gender, C for comorbidity and ̅ is the complementary of dying, which is to be alive. The notation P(A|B) means probability of A given B. The values at the right-hand side of Equation 1 can .

Once the dataset is created, a logistic regression model is fitted taking as dependent variable the death variable and as independent variables age, gender and comorbidity. The values of the regression coefficients are then transformed with an exponential function in order to obtain the adjusted OR, which are stored. The procedure is repeated 1000 times, allowing to obtain different datasets, each one with corresponding ORs (Figure 4) . After ending the random sampling procedure, the median is computed as well as percentiles 2.5 and 97.5, which allows to obtain the 95% confidence interval of ORs. .

Slight departures are observed in some of the frequencies (e.g. comorbidities and CFR) but in general, the reported frequencies are within the confidence intervals meaning that synthetic datasets are reasonably representative of the observed data. Still, this is a limitation of the method. Logistic models assume a reference class for each qualitative independent variable and the ORs interpretation of the remaining classes is made relatively to the reference. In the present case, the reference classes were: '0-19' years old, 'female' and 'no comorbidities'. Therefore, the OR=1.8518 for males means that the ratio of the odd of dying to the odd of not dying is 1.8518 times greater in males than in females. As expected ORs increase with age, but the rate of increasing is very high. ORs for comorbidities were expected to be greater than 1, but once again the values are somehow greater than what one could have anticipated.
