Ribavirin was qualitatively analyzed by TLC Silicagel 60 F 254 (Merck, Germany), as previously described. Ribavirin was detected using a thermo-chemical reaction, using ethanol:panisaldehyde:glacial acetic acid:sulfuric acid (89:5:1:5%, p/v) as developing solution. Dry TLC was then heated at 150 • C during 5 min [15] . Moreover, ribavirin bioconversion was quantitatively monitored by HPLC (Gilson) at 225 nm (Detector UV/vis 156, Gilson) using a Phenomenex Luna ® C-18 column (5 m, 4.6 mm, 250 mm). An isocratic mobile phase (100% water) was used with a flow of 1.2 mL/min. Product identification was performed by MS-HPLC under the above mentioned conditions (Ribavirin; M + : 245.1) using a LCQ-DECAXP4 Thermo Finnigan Spectrometer with the Electron Spray Ionization method (ESI) and one ion trap detector.
