Patient visits for respiratory syndromes were identified based on presenting complaints, which are routinely elicited from all patients or parents on presentation to the ED and recorded by triage nurses. This free-text description is subsequently numerically encoded, using a constrained list of 181 possible codes. Seventeen of these describe respiratory problems and were used to define a group of patients as having a respiratory illness, using a previously validated classification. 12 Viral tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 3, adenovirus, and enterovirus performed by the hospital during the study period were identified. These tests were ordered by physicians during routine clinical care for patients treated in the ED. We included tests that were ordered up to 7 hours before the ED visit and 24 hours after the ED visit to capture tests performed on patients during clinic visits before referral to the ED and on patients admitted to the hospital from the ED with a respiratory illness and tested after admission. Results for influenza A and B viruses were grouped, as were results for parainfluenza virus types 1 through 3. If a test was positive for more than 1 virus, all viruses identified were included in the analysis. For the validation group, we screened patients aged 7 years and younger and presenting to the ED with a respiratory problem, such as difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Patients presenting with fever were also screened because this is frequently the complaint reported by parents of young children with respiratory illnesses. Patients were then further screened to determine whether they met our definition of an infectious respiratory illness and were recruited for the study if they did. We defined an infectious respiratory illness as the presence of at least 2 of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, or congestion. This criterion was chosen because we sought to determine the viral distribution among patients with respiratory infections and
