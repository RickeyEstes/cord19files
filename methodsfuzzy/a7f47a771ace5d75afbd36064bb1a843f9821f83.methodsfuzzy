We modelled the dynamics of infection within a single LBM in rural China, where birds were moved into the LBM on a daily basis from different sized farms and geographical locations, and then moved out of the market on a daily basis through selling to other smaller markets, farmers or directly to individuals for consumption. Interactions and importations between external farms and the market were modelled such that at one time point within a day, birds would be brought into the market and at the same time point approximately the same proportion were sold onwards (i.e. instantaneous turnover). As turnover rates within markets remain poorly quantified, we also examined the effects of different fixed turnover rates (above and below 50%) on our model outcomes. We assumed the market population size remained approximately constant, which is the prevailing opinion of fieldworkers as physical space is a scarce resource within LBMs and is therefore highly utilized [19, 20] . However, although the market population may be approximately constant across days (except at major holidays), it is unlikely to be constant throughout the course of a day-i.e. most birds come in in the morning (highest population size) and gradually leave throughout the day (population size decreases gradually throughout the day). Thus, we also evaluated how fluctuations in population throughout the day impacted CCS estimates. Insights from the variable population sizes throughout the day could be extrapolated to interpret the effects of variable population sizes during holiday seasons. We developed a within-market probabilistic multi-strain SEIR Markovian model that allowed for co-infection with two strains [21, 22] . The stochastic infection dynamics were governed by transitions between states depicted in the electronic supplementary material, figure S1. Infection was either transmitted by direct within-flock transmission or environmental transmission through direct contact with infected drinking water, faeces or fomites [3, 21, 23] . Parameter values are provided in the electronic supplementary material, table S1. Birds in the S compartment were susceptible to infection with all strains (A, B and AB, which denote strain A, B and the co-infection with independent strains A and B (AB), respectively). Exposed (E) birds were infected but not infectious to other birds, and susceptible to infection with a second strain. I birds were infectious to other birds, and temporarily immune to infection with a second strain [24, 25] as a consequence of the innate immune response to infection [26] . In terms of adaptive immunity, R birds were fully recovered, and immune to re-infection with the same strain (i.e. full homologous immunity) but were susceptible to infection with a second strain with the same probability as fully susceptible hosts (S) (no cross-immunity). States in which birds were S, E, I or R to both strains were denoted as subscripted state symbols. We do not explicitly model particular AI strains, but generally model possible multi-strain dynamics. Additional model description is provided in the electronic supplementary information. Co-infection here represents simultaneous infection with strain A and B, thus our notation for co-infection reflects the host's state. Supporting quantitative evidence for the relative infectivity of two strains in co-infected birds was limited, therefore, we assumed co-infected birds always transmitted strains A and B rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 284: 20170715 concurrently (i.e. equal fitness for both strains) and that this led to direct co-infection in a susceptible bird. As a minimum criteria for co-infection, each individual strain must be capable of establishing sustained transmission for a period of time in a rapid-turnover market. Therefore, we define R total 0 for a single strain as the sum of R wf 0 and R env 0 . The contribution from the environment R env where s is the duration of the latent period, e is the rate at which birds are sold, g is the duration of the infectious period, v is the rate at which infectious birds shed virions, N is the number of birds in the market, h is the rate of virion decay in the environment, c is a restricted half-saturation constant for environmental transmission, and b env is the transmission rate from the environment to birds. The within flock R wf 0 was calculated as: where b wf is the transmission rate between birds. Therefore, R total 0 ¼ R wf 0 þ R env 0 . We note that an analytical derivation of an invasion criteria for the co-infecting strains in the system is not feasible here [21] .
