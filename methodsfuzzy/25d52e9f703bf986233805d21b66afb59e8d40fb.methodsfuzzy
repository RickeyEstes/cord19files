Subjects. Thirty infants with recurrent wheezing (three or more previous episodes of physician diagnosed wheezing) and without antecedents of hospitalisations; severe lower respiratory infection in the last 8 weeks; emergency room visits; or oral corticosteroids in the last 8 weeks, were randomly recruited from our paediatric respiratory outpatient clinic to measure their spirometric lung function. Lung function measurements were performed at random in two occasions for each patient (each one was its own control), either during the first days of an URTI or when they had been asymptomatic during 4 weeks and had normal physical examination at the measurement day. Infants with fever; respiratory distress; RSV bronchiolitis; pneumonia; chronic lung diseases; neonatal respiratory illness requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation; or any other condition potentially affecting airway responsiveness, were not eligible for the study. URTI (common cold) was defined by the presence of runny nose (watery nasal rhinorrea), sneezing, nasal obstruction, without fever, and eventually cough, plus the antecedent of family members with similar symptoms at home (parent, siblings) or other children with a cold if they attended daycare. No viral determinations were done because they were not available at the hospital. Infants were on treatment with inhaled salbutamol on-demand and regular budesonide delivered by valved holding chamber with mask; treatments were continued as prescribed by their doctors, excepting salbutamol which was withheld 12 h prior to measurements. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and full informed written and signed consent was obtained from all parents. Lung Function Testing. Forced expiratory manoeuvres were obtained using the raised volume rapid thoracic compression technique (RVRTC) as previously described. [17] [18] [19] Infants were measured 4 hrs postprandial and while sleeping under sedation with chloral hydrate (70-90 mg/kg). Lung inflation pressure was set at 30 cm H 2 O, and after delivering several sequential inflations rapid thoracic compression was from raised lung volume and maintained until residual volume was reached. Forced expiratory manoeuvres were repeated with increases of 10 cm H 2 O in jacket pressure until there was no further increase in flows with subsequent increase in jacket pressure. The best curve was selected from three reproducible curves, as the single best shaped curve with the highest product of forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEF between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75% ). The following parameters were recorded for all curves: FVC, FEV 0.5 , FEF 50% , FEF 75% and FEF 25-75% . Data analysis. Values for each pulmonary function parameter were converted to z-scores using the equations of Jones et al 18 and the comparisons of spirometric values during URTI and when asymptomatic were done using parametric test for paired samples; p o0.05 was considered as statistically significant. For all computed lung function parameters a change of one or more z-score (increase or decrease) was considered as significant. Abnormal lung function at the time of measurements was defined as a zscore of r Ã€1.65 for a given spirometric parameter in both occasions (symptomatic or asymptomatic patients). Spearman correlation was used for continuous variables whereas chi-square tests and regression analysis were used to relate the change in lung function to history of a first-degree relative with asthma, gender, age, exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy or intra-domiciliary, order of measurement, time elapsed between measurements, age at onset of wheezing, and number of previous episodes of physician-diagnosed wheezing.
