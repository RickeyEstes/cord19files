Phylogenetic analysis. A total of 201 EV-D68 sequences obtained in this study and detected between 2014 and 2018 were included in a phylogenetic analysis with different EV-D68 sequences available in GenBank in the same 3'-VP1 region from American, Asian and European countries (N = 89). The prototype strain Fer-monUS/1962 was included as the outgroup. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 7.0 software using a neighbour-joining distance method under the maximum composite likelihood substitution model with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings. The sequences obtained in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MN403103 -MN403299. Statistical analysis. Clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were compared using the Student's t test and Fisher exact test. A 2-sided value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
