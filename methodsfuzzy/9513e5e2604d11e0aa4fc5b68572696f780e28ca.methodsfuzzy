Solvent/detergent inactivation of plasma. Solvent/detergent inactivation uses the membranedisruption solvent tri-n-butyl phosphate (1%) with a detergent such as Triton X-100 during a 4-hour, 30°C incubation of pooled plasma from thousands of donors, followed by the removal of the SD with oil and adsorption chromatography. 6 Historical large-scale SD inactivation methods in the United States have been associated with an increased prothrombotic product risk, on account of the undesired incidental decrease in integral antithrombotic plasma proteins, such as protein S or α 2 -antiplasmin. 7 Photochemical PI in plasma and/or platelet products. Methylene blue (MB) is a phenothiazine dye that, when added to an individual unit of plasma at 1 μmol/L and photodynamically activated by UV light at 590 nm, produces singlet oxygen. Deoxyribonucleic acid is damaged by dye intercalation with free radical roles in strand cross-linking, guanosine oxidation, and indirect depurination. 8 Like SD, the application of MB is restricted to plasma and is also limited in its PI abilities. However, the basis for these limitations is different. Red blood cell hemolysis can occur from the effect of reactive MB singlets on lipid and protein components of membranes. On the other hand, the capsids of nonenveloped viruses, and the membranes of bacteria, protozoa, or the infected leukocytes that persist after plasma freeze-thaw, may resist not only these perturbations but MB penetration itself. An elimination micropore filter is thus used to remove residual leukocytes alongside the dye and its photoderivatives. The psoralens are also photoactive planar molecules, the small size of which facilitates membrane penetration. The dark reaction (base intercalation) is followed by a UV-A-dependent light reaction (320-400 nm over several minutes), in which adducts form between the psoralens and the pyrimidine bases of the nucleic acids, in turn producing irreversible cross-linkages in singleand double-stranded nucleic acids. 9 Significant photodegradation, and a prolonged (4-6 h) incubation with a compound absorption disk or affinity device, removes the psoralen and byproducts before storage. INTERCEPT (Cerus Europe BV, Leusden, The Netherlands), an S-59 (amotosalen) system, has been tested in plasma as well as platelets. The remarkable activity of psoralens is illustrated in their capacity to inactivate more than 5.4 logs of T lymphocytes and to disrupt disproportionately more base pairs (1:83) than γ-irradiation (1:37 000). 10 Riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ), like the other photoactive PI agents, binds to DNA by intercalation. Ultraviolet photolysis of the complex induces guanine oxidation, single-stranded breaks, and the formation of covalent adducts. 11,12 Unlike the other agents, toxicities are not a concern because this is a naturally occurring and safe compound. This agent, like the previous, has been evaluated in platelets and plasma, and its potential use in RBCs is being explored. Success with all blood components would make this a uniquely generalizable technique compared with the others. Pathogen inactivation techniques explored in RBC products. Pathogen inactivation is challenging in RBC products because hemoglobin is capable of absorbing or scattering UV and visible light up to red wavelengths (700 nm), and the RBC membrane itself is particularly vulnerable to a variety of PI techniques. The alkylators in a class derived from quinacrine mustard attempt to overcome these issues with their light-independent activity and are known as the "frangible anchor linker effector" compounds. 13 An intercalating acridine ring structure is linked to an effector group that covalently attaches to the nucleic acid, and the link between these 2 structures is a hydrolyzable bond capable of "releasing the ring" under the conditions of pH change (ie, neutralizing the typical acidity of storage to a more physiologic level). The INTERCEPT system of one particular frangible anchor linker effector, S-303 (Helinx, Cerus Corp, Concord, CA), incubates with RBCs for 12 hours, during which time nucleic acid cross-linking occurs, with the release of S-300 as its degradation product. S-300 is rapidly eliminated before a final compound removal step. Some S-303 may remain bound to proteins, on or within RBCs, and thus serve as an immunogen with respect to acquired or preformed antibodies of unclear significance. The INACTINE system represents another PI technique using PEN110, a low-molecular-weight, highly water-soluble cationic ethyleneimine derivative that instantly traverses cell membranes and damages nucleic acids without cross-linking. Over a 6-hour incubation period, PEN110's tail covalently binds to negatively charged phosphate groups, and the protonation-activated aziridine site selectively alkylates N7 on guanosine, breaking open its imidazole ring. 14 The structural change is recognized as a stop signal, the base is lost, and strand breakage occurs. PEN110 is subsequently removed by washing because of its residual mutagenicity risk. As with S-303, antibody formation has also been seen, although this never appeared to be clinically significant, and antigenic RBC surface changes were never detected. Nevertheless, clinical trials with PEN110 have been suspended. Any exponential model of PI, with a log-linear dynamic, is truly no more than a pathogen reduction technique because complete inactivation ("zero leftover pathogen") may not be achievable with high-input inocula. Reduction is also variable, depending upon inoculum size, species, and the type and duration of PI. The applicable intensity of PI is ultimately restrained by potential collateral damage to the integrity and function of the product. Pathogen inactivation is also subject to the errors and dangers of fallible human processing, which may lead to a failed inactivation or the missed removal of toxic byproducts.
