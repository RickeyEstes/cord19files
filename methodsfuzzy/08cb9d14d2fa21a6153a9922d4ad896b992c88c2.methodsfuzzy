MS based methods are commonly used to identify and quantify proteins, to profile protein-interactions or whole proteomes. Therefore, proteins are isolated and proteolytically digested, the resulting peptides are separated via LC, and then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (bottom-up approach or shotgun proteomics) (Vermeulen et al., 2008) . Alternatively a top-down approach can be used, where the protein is fragmented during the mass spectrometric analysis (Boeri Erba, 2014). For quantitative proteomics, most often bottom-up high resolution MS techniques are used in combination with either labeling or label-free methods: A powerful and the most commonly used label-based method for the quantification of proteins is SILAC (Ong et al., 2002) . In short, an isotope label is metabolically incorporated into peptides and proteins of a cell. Typically, essential amino acids with heavy isotopes (e.g., 15 N, 13 C) are fed to cells over several passages until nearly all unlabeled amino acids are replaced. As the physicochem- ical properties of light and heavy amino acids are nearly identical, cells labeled with the isotopic analogs behave similar or even identical to unlabeled cells. Based on the isotope label SILAC allows the direct comparison of two cell populations (heavy and light) from two distinct experimental conditions; for instance, from cells with surface-bound virus or cells without bound virus (Gerold et al., 2015) . Prior to proteomic analysis, i.e., whole cell lysate analysis or AP of protein complexes, the differently labeled samples are mixed. This is advantageous as all samples are processed equally excluding sample handling biases. Proteins are then digested, peptides reduced and alkylated, separated by LC and analyzed by MS. Peptides derived from heavy or light cells are subsequently differentiated by their characteristic mass offset. Relative abundances of proteins in each sample are calculated based on the heavy and light signal intensities in the same spectrum. Typically, SILAC is used for relative quantification of protein levels under two different cellular conditions. Of note, medium labeled amino acids are additionally available and allow expanding a SILAC experiment to three cellular conditions (Hilger and Mann, 2012) . The high accuracy of SILAC typically requires analysis of only two experimental replicates. In addition, two replicates of a label swap experimental condition allow assessing label-specific effects. Thus, a typical dual SILAC experiment starts with eight experimental samples mixed into four SILAC pairs. Those are duplicates of the forward label pair (light-condition 1; heavy-condition 2) and duplicates of the reverse label pair (light-condition 2; heavy-condition 1). Fig. 3A depicts the SILAC workflow. SILAC followed by LC-MS/MS can answer various questions in virology. For example, it can be used to compare the proteome of uninfected to that of virus infected cells (e.g., Zhang et al., 2013) . Also cells at different time points post infection can be analyzed to understand how viruses alter host cell protein expression (Weekes et al., 2014) . For instance, Berard et al. performed a temporal quantification of cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and by this showed how HSV1 modulates the metabolic function of the host cell (Berard et al., 2015) . Beside this, SILAC followed by LC-MS/MS can also be used to identify cellular targets of viral enzymes, as it has been done for the identification of the HCV protease NS3-4A targets: by comparing whole proteomes from hepatoma cells with and without the NS3-4A protease, Morikawa et al. discovered that 'probable glutathione peroxidase 8' is cleaved by the viral protease (Morikawa et al., 2014) . SILAC is also suitable to analyze how viruses alter the proteome of distinct cellular compartments. For instance, Xie et al. defined the modification of lipid raft composition in HBV infection (Xie et al., 2012) . In combination with AP of a protein of interest, SILAC followed by LC-MS/MS can also discover protein-interactions and dynamic changes in interaction complexes (reviewed e.g., in (Gingras et al., 2007; Trinkle-Mulcahy, 2012) ). High-throughput AP-MS has led to important findings regarding virus entry, for instance the identification of receptors or receptor-complexes. A successful example is the AP-MS analysis of the HCV receptor CD81, which revealed HRas as a CD81-binding partner and signaling molecule needed for HCV entry (Zona et al., 2013) . A clear benefit of SILAC is its high reproducibility, robustness and relatively easy execution. SILAC is applicable to most cell culture cells and sample conditions. Even SILAC mice have been developed in the past for ex vivo proteomics analyses (Zanivan et al., 2012) . Box 2: Definitions and abbreviations in mass spectrometry based proteomics. Proteome: entity of proteins expressed at a given cellular state or in a given tissue. The term was coined in analogy to 'genome' in 1996. MS: mass spectrometry. ESI: electrospray ionization; ionization technique based on spraying of a sample solution into a strong electric field. MALDI: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; ionization technique based on mixing of samples with a matrix, which absorbs ultraviolet light and converts it to heat energy leading to sample vaporization. Bottom up proteomics: identification of proteins based on MS peptide fingerprints after digestion of a protein into peptides using a sequence-specific enzyme such as trypsin. Top down proteomics: MS analysis of entire proteins. Shotgun proteomics: bottom-up proteomics technique to identify proteins in a complex mixture. Proteins are digested to peptides, peptides separated by liquid chromatography and then identified by tandem MS. Quantitative proteomics: shotgun proteomics with the additional dimension of measuring the quantity of a protein in a complex sample. Relative quantities in two or more samples are determined either by SILAC or LFQ (see below). Absolute quantification can be achieved using spike in standards or a proteomics ruler (see paragraph on protein complex stoichiometry). Interaction proteomics: unbiased identification of protein-protein interactions by affinity enrichment followed by MS. SILAC: stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture; first quantitative method for the comparison of cellular protein amounts in two to three different cellular states. SILAC is based on the isotope labeling of cellular proteins by feeding cells with heavy isotope amino acids (e.g. N-15 and C-13 labeled arginine and lysine). Label-free quantification (LFQ): quantitative proteomics technique based on either signal intensity measurement or spectral counting followed by computational matching of peptides from multiple samples and signal normalization. PPI: protein-protein interactions. PTM: posttranslational modification. Common protein modifications include among others phosphorylation, lipidation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation. AP-MS: affinity purification of proteins using antibodies against endogenous epitopes or epitope tags followed by mass spectrometric identification or quantification of the bound proteins. AE-MS: affinity enrichment of proteins using fast single step methods, which preserve transient and low affinity interactions, followed by mass spectrometric identification or quantification of bound proteins. Caveats of SILAC are the limited sample number of maximum three and the additional labeling step requiring culturing of cells for two to three weeks prior to analysis. Thus some primary human cells, which rapidly dedifferentiate ex vivo, are not suited for SILAC. Similarly, clinical samples cannot be labeled and are thus not amenable to SILAC analysis. Increasingly popular alternatives to SILAC are LFQ methods. These can determine the relative or absolute abundance of a protein in complex samples. The first semi-quantitative labelfree method developed, which has since then been continuously refined, is based on the measurement of MS/MS peptide intensities (Bondarenko et al., 2002) . To this end, peak areas of all identified peptides from one protein are summed up and normalized to one or several proteins with constant concentration or even to all iden-tified proteins in the sample. Bondarenko et al. showed that there is a linear correlation of the abundance of a protein and its total reconstructed peak area. An alternative semi-quantitative method used is spectral sampling (Liu et al., 2004) . It was shown that highly abundant proteins are sampled more frequently by LC-MS/MS and that the spectral copy number obtained increases linearly with the concentration of a protein. Accordingly, the number of MS/MS spectra gained for one protein can be counted and compared between different samples measured using the same experimental conditions. Several computational approaches to predict specific protein interactions in label-free datasets have been developed, among them Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) and Mass spectrometry interaction STatistics (MiST) (Choi et al., 2011; Jager et al., 2012) . These tools compute interaction probabilities based on spectral counts of all interactions that a prey-bait pair is involved in or based on abundance, reproducibility and specificity of a preybait pair, respectively. Recent developments in MS technology and analysis algorithms now allow highly sensitive, efficient and robust intensity-based label-free protein quantification (reviewed e.g., in (Nahnsen et al., 2013) ). For this, samples are processed in parallel and not mixed, as in SILAC. Thus, an unlimited number of samples can be compared. Normalization is achieved post LC-MS/MS analysis by comparing all peptide signals from all MS runs and assuming that most protein signals remain unaltered in the different sample conditions. Thus, no external standards are needed . However, acquisition of accurate datasets requires the analysis of at least three, typically four, biological replicates (Fig. 3B ). MS combined with LFQ algorithms is suitable for virological research and has been used e.g., to show that subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) differ in their ability to sense single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (Luber et al., 2010) . Briefly, Luber at al. compared the whole cell proteome of DC subsets by high-resolution MS combined with LFQ. They found, that DC subsets differently express proteins involved in pattern recognition pathways and that this correlates with their ability to sense ssRNA viruses, such as Sendai virus and influenza A virus. Label-free methods also allow the analysis of protein complexes. Importantly, extensive purification of complexes prior to LC-MS/MS is no longer necessary for LFQ. Instead one AE step is sufficient for precise complex profiling, when controls are designed appropriately . False positive interaction partners, which are proteins unspecifically binding to the affinity resin, are computationally eliminated by comparing datasets to those of a control AE sample from cells without bait. Fig. 3B outlines the here described LFQ workflow. When compared to label-based methods, LFQ techniques have several advantages: nearly all kinds of samples can be measured, including clinical material and primary cells; sample number is unlimited; no special sample processing steps are needed; slight differences in sample preparation and measurement between the different samples are tolerated. Both, labeling and label-free quantification methods identify and quantify proteins with high confidence and lead to highly accurate results. Each step of the proteomics workflow can be quality controlled, e.g., by immunoblotting, computational analysis of peptide intensity distributions, and clustering analysis of biological replicate datasets (Fig. 3C ). To study virus entry both SILAC and LFQ are valuable tools. LFQ is ideally suited to study steady state virus receptor interactions. To this end, virus receptor-complexes are purified from cells expressing the receptor and cells lacking the receptor. Comparison of both datasets then allows to define receptor interacting proteins in a given cell line. SILAC on the other hand can sensitively distinguish low degree quantitative changes, as they occur when virus receptor complexes change upon virus binding. Briefly, heavy labeled cells are incubated with virus and light cells are left untreated (forward label); and vice versa (reverse label). After sample mixing, AP of receptor complexes and LC-MS analysis, changes in interaction strength of each protein in the receptor complex can be determined. Importantly, the untreated control should ideally contain all extracellular components as the virus sample, i.e. the ideal control is incubation with virus, which had been neutralized by blocking antibodies, or incubation with a "mock" virus preparation if such antibodies are not available. Using SILAC, we recently identified transient, virus-triggered interactions of the HCV receptor CD81. Among the 26 dynamic CD81 interactors we identified serum response factor binding protein 1 as a host factor aiding HCV entry (Gerold et al., 2015) . Of note, similar studies will soon be possible with advanced LFQ methods. Fig. 3 illustrates how quantitative proteomics can identify steady state and dynamic virus-triggered receptor interactions. In summary, SILAC and LFQ are powerful tools for analyzing virus-host interactions and global proteomic changes upon virus infection. Due to the recent improvements in high resolution MS and label-free analysis tools, the highly accurate, cost effective and broadly applicable LFQ methods will soon become the method of choice for profiling proteins, their interactions and whole proteomes.
