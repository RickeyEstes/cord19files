The sample consisted of patients aged less than 14 years who underwent microbiological testing for MP (PCR for detection of MP in nasopharyngeal swab samples and/or serological testing for MP in the acute phase) due to clinical suspicion of CAMP at the discretion of the paediatrician in charge in an urban paediatric emergency department in Valencia (Spain) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. We performed a retrospective review of the health records and the findings of chest radiographs for these patients. The inclusion criteria were having undergone a chest X-ray examination in the emergency department in the previous 72 h or at the time of diagnosis. We excluded patients in whom the radiographic findings ruled out CAP, as determined by a paediatrician---researcher that was blinded to the patient's demographic and clinical information. Patients underwent additional microbiological studies and other diagnostic tests at the discretion of the physician. At the time of diagnosis of CAP, a sample was collected for measurement of the white blood cell (WBC) count and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin. We defined a CAMP case as a patient presenting with the following two criteria: (1) MP infection confirmed by positive PCR for MP in nasopharyngeal swab samples (Progenie Molecular RealCycler ® ) or detection of antibodies against MP through a MP-specific IgM assay during the acute phase of disease (ELISA IgM, Vircell ® ) and (2) radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 5 The radiographic criteria included presence of consolidation (lung opacity with or without air bronchograms), other infiltrates (alveolar or interstitial densities) and pleural effusion. We did not consider peribronchial thickening or atelectasis criteria for pneumonia. The exclusion criteria were relevant chronic illness (neoplasia, transplant, lung disease other than asthma, immunodeficiency or severe heart disease), recent hospitalization (within the past 7 days), residency in an extended-care facility, and previous inclusion in the study in the past 28 days. We obtained follow-up data on the patients following the collection of the sample for MP detection from the electronic health records, which include information for all health care services received in the public health system of the province of Valencia (emergency, inpatient, primary and hospital outpatient care).
