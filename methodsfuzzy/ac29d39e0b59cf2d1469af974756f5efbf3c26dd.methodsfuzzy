Cells, short interfering RNAs, short hairpin RNAs and plasmids HEK293, 293T and MCF7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting PCAF (siPCAF-6: 5 0 -CGGAG TGTACTCCGCCTGCAA-3 0 and siPCAF-7: 5 0 -CAGCA AATAATTGTCAGTCTA-3 0 ) and p300 (sip300-7 siRNA: 5 0 -TTGGACTACCCTATCAAGTAA-3 0 and sip300-10: 5 0 -CCCGGTGAACTCTCCTATAAT-3 0 ) were purchased from Qiagen, and the short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against PCAF (shPCAF: 5 0 -TAGATGAGGT GCTTTGAGCAGTTCTGAAA-3 0 ) was obtained from Origene. Human XBP-1S and XBP-1U expression plasmids were previously described (26) . The plasmids for expression of human PCAF and p300 were obtained from Open Biosystems. The plasmids containing a series of hemagglutinin (HA) tagged XBP-1 deletions were generous gifts from Dr Hiderou Yoshida (27) . The firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, HTLV-Luc and BiP-Luc [including wild-type and ER stress response (ERSE) mutant BiP-Luc plasmids], were kindly provided by Dr Arnold Rabson and Dr Kazutoshi Mori, respectively (28, 29) .
