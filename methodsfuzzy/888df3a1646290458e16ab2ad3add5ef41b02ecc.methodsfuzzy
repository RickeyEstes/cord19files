To test our hypotheses, we targeted, by RT-PCR, the Coronavirinae RdRp RNA sequence (more precisely a coding fragment of a subunit of the RdRp, the non-structural protein 12 -nsp12 -) in bat samples and compare it with the published sequences downloaded from public online databases. The SRAS-CoV nsp12 and nsp13 exhibit the highest conservation profiles among proteins from all coronaviruses (Stadler et al., 2003) . Moreover, as RdRps (nsp12) are involved in replication and transcription processes and therefore play a central role in the virion offspring genome synthesis (the vertical information transmission), its relatively conserved ribonucleic acid sequence is appropriate for both viral detection and phylogeny reconstruction.
