Thirty Holstein dairy herds with membership in the DHIA were involved in this prospective cohort study, conducted between January 1991 and May 1992. These randomly selected herds are located in Dakota and Rice counties in Minnesota and are representative of DHIA herds in the state of Minnesota as a whole, based, on milk production, farm size, and cattle numbers. Minnesota DHIA herds in 1991 had an average cow number of 52 and an average annual rolling herd milk production of 7717 kg per cow. Rice county DHIA herds had an average size of 52 cows, and a rolling herd average of 7507 kg, while Dakota county DHIA herds had an average of 61 cows and a rolling herd average of 7698 kg. Use of a random sample ensured that producers with a variety of management abilities were included. The randomization mechanism involved numbering the herds on the list of DHIA members in Rice and Dakota counties that had more that 40 cows. A random number list was generated using a computer program and herds were contacted in order, using the random number list. Additional producer selection criteria included regular use of veterinary services, herd size of greater than 40 cows, milk sales revenue comprising a major component of total farm income, and the producers must raise their own replacement heifer calves. At the beginning of the study, a pretested questionnaire which has been developed and modified based on those of Curtis (Curtis et al., 1988a ,Curtis et al., 1988b and one designed by the National Animal Health Monitoring System for the 1992 National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project was administered by personal interview by one of the investigators to the producers in the study to determine their calf management practices, including feeding, housing, and vaccination (a copy of the questionnaire is available on request). Predetermined standards were used to assess the adequacy of calf housing, based on the type of housing, location, division of age groups, ventilation adequacy, manure handling effectiveness, and stocking density. Two different prepared check-off forms were distributed to producers for recording individual calf data from birth to 16 weeks of age for all heifer calves born on the farm for the duration of the study (copies of these forms are available on request). The 'birth sheet' was completed by producers at the time of birth of a heifer calf. It contained information about the sire and dam, as well as events surrounding the calf s birth (e.g. time of delivery, ease of delivery, treatments given at birth). The 'treatment sheet' was used to record all diagnoses and treatments given by producers. Any occurrence of illness was recorded for each calf. All calves in the study were individually identified using ear tags. Individual calf sheets were collected monthly and data stored on a computer herd management program (DairyCHAMP@ ; DairyCHAMP@, University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, 385 AnSci/Vet Med, 1988 Fitch Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA). Monthly herd visits were conducted to collect calf sheets and serologic samples for respiratory pathogens, using the standard serologic tests of the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea virus, parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Every other heifer calf that was born on each farm during the study was sampled monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. These calves also received a brief physical examination and were weight taped at each monthly visit. In addition, physical examinations were performed on any calf that the producer identified as 'sick', in order to facilitate assessment of morbidity. Also, any calves that were less than 1 week of age at the time of the visit were sampled for serum immunoglobulin levels in order to assess the effectiveness of colostrum feeding on each farm, using the sodium sulfite turbidity test (Bova-STM, Veterinary Medical Research and Development, Inc., PO Box 502, Pullman, WA 99163, USA). Carcasses of as many of the heifers that died between birth and 16 weeks of age during the study as possible were retrieved within 24 h and necropsied according to standard protocol at the Minnesota Diagnostic Laboratory, in order to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Producer diagnoses were obtained at the time of calf retrieval from the farm. Postmortems were performed in similar studies of pneumonia in feedlot cattle and preweaning pig mortality and were useful in the validation of mortality (Martin et al., 1980; Vaillancourt et al., 1990) . Data analysis involved calculating incidence rates for morbidity and mortality by dividing the number of events by the number of calf-days at risk during the time period of interest. Multiple events for a single calf were noted; events were considered independent if a minimum of 3 days elapsed between them. Effects of seasonality were assessed by dividing calves into winter (1 November-30 April) and summer groups, based on date of birth. All statistical tests were two-tailed and used an alpha of 0.05. A chi-square test examined the differences between morbidity and mortality between the two seasonal groups. A weighted least squares regression was used to examine the relationship between farm level rate of gain and morbidity and mortality. Chi-square tests were used to compare the farm level rates of gain between those farms with adequate calf housing and those that had inadequate housing. Age of occurrence for morbidity and mortality were also calculated. A simple-linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between immunoglobulin status and rate of gain. The relationship between producer diagnosis of mortality and necropsy diagnosis was explaineNd in terms of sensitivity and specificity, using necropsy as the gold standard. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistix program (Statistix, Analytical Software, PO Box 130204, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA) on a microcomputer.
