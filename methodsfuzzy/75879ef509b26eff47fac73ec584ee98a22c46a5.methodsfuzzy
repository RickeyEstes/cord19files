Healthcare workers, including physicians, nurses, health inspectors, and others, who served pilgrims during the 2009 Hajj season were included. Three-fourths of the healthcare workers in the study were from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH), and the rest were from medical missions other than MOH. Most of the healthcare workers had treated pilgrims previously and had been practicing medicine for more than 10 years. Nasal and throat swabs were collected using the same method during both phases of the study. Nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport media using Dacron swabs on stainless steel wire and plastic shafts, respectively (Remel, MicroTest M4RT, USA). Immediately after collection, samples were transported to the Jeddah Regional Laboratory where they were stored at Ã€80 C until tested. Nucleic acid was extracted using the X-Tractor Gene, Corbett from Qiagen using 25101 VX DNA/RNA purification protocol. The multiplex PCR using micro fluid arrays and Luminex x-Map system, with xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST Assay (Manufactured By Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada, distributed by Abbott Molecular, Wiesbaden-Delkenheim, Germany) was used for nucleic acid testing for 18 circulating respiratory virus types and subtypes: influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, influenza B, RSV, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC 43, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus HKU1, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3, parainfluenza 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. The xTAG Data Analysis Software for RVP FAST(TDAS RVP FAST) analyzed the data and provided a report summarizing which viruses were present. The RVP FAST detects influenza B, influenza A H1 seasonal, and influenza A H3 only. If any other subtypes are present, it will indicate the presence of influenza A matrix protein only. Therefore the samples in which influenza A matrix protein was detected were run separately by a singleplex PCR to detect H1 2009 pandemic strain using Artus Inf/H1 LC/RG RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) and for avian influenza A H5N1 (subtype Asia) by LightMix Kit (TIB, MOLBIOL,GmbH, Berlin, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any strain in which RNA was not detected for these four influenza A types (i.e., H1, H3 seasonal in RVP FAST and independent singleplex PCRs for H1 2009 pandemic strain, and H5N1 [subtype Asia]) was labeled as unsubtypeable influenza A virus.
