After ethics board approval was obtained, the subject inhaled aerosolized 3% saline fluid droplets that were produced by an ultrasonic nebulizer (DeVilbis Ultra-Neb-99 Large-Volume Ultrasonic Nebulizer; Sunrise Medical; Somerset, PA). The breath was then held briefly (approximately 2 s), while one of three oxygen masks was fitted to the face. The subject then exhaled smoothly for Ï¾ 2 s through the mask while a series of photographs were taken. Photographs were not altered except for adjustments to brightness and contrast. The procedure was repeated three times with each of three oxygen masks. Two of the masks had side vents for exhaled gas (a nonrebreathing mask [Airlife Adult Oxygen Mask; Allegiance Healthcare Corp; McGaw Park, IL] and a Venturi-type mask [Airlife Percento 2 Mask; Allegiance Healthcare Corp]). The third mask had no vents. All exhaled gas exited through a single 22-mm port in the attached manifold (Hi-Ox80; Viasys; Yorba Linda, CA). The Hi-Ox80 was tested without and with a respiratory filter (Barrierbac "S"; Mallinckrodt; Mirandola, Italy) on the expiratory port. No oxygen flow was supplied to any of the masks during testing.
