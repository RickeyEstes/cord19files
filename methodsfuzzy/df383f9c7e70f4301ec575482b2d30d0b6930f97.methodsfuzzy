Materials BOC-amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem AG (La È ufel®ngen, Switzerland), and BOC-amino acid phenylacetamidomethyl (PAM)-resin was obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). NBD-¯uoride and other reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nut®eld, U.K). N-[Lissamine-rhodamine B-sulfonyl]dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rho-PE), N-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl]-dioleoylphosphatidylethano-lamine (NBD-PE), N-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-¯uoride] (NBD-¯uoride), and 5-(and 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Rho), succinimidyl ester were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is composed of NaCl (8 g/l), KCl (0.2 g/l), KH 2 PO 4 (0.2 g/l), and Na 2 HPO 4 (1.09 g/l), pH 7.3.
