Blood sampling is best performed retro-orbitally (Niewiesk, 2009; Prince, 1994; Ward, 2001) since the cotton rat does not have easily accessible tail or other peripheral vasculature. Cardiac collection is also used in some instances. Dosing may be performed by methods commonly used for other rodents (Ward, 2001) . Inhalant anesthesia can be performed using isoflurane (Niewiesk, 2009; Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) . The use of methoxyflurane has also been reported (Prince, 2004) . Injectable anesthetics include ketamine HCl (25 mg/kg) and acepromazine maleate (2.5 mg/kg) (Prince, 1994) or a mixture of xylazine (7.5 mg/kg), ketamine (25 mg/kg), and acepromazine (2.5 mg/kg) (Ward, 2001) . Euthanasia may be performed by an overdose of carbon dioxide gas. A variety of immunologic reagents and methods have been developed for cotton rats. Macrophage isolation from the peritoneal cavity 2-3 days after injection of bacteria or bacterial lysates, and induction of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells from bone marrow have been reported (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) . Chromium uptake of fibroblasts and macrophages in T-cell cytolysis systems is lower than that seen in mice, and spontaneous release or leakiness is high. The mouse lymphoma YAC-1 line has been used for NK activity assays (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) . These authors also report that cotton rat T-cells derived from the spleen or lymph nodes adhere to nylon wool columns at over 90%, which should be taken into account when purifying T-cells from these samples. In addition, they note that cotton rat sera should be incubated at 4°C for enzymatic B-cell response assays to prevent non-specific findings, and that B-cells do not proliferate well after in vitro stimulation with LPS unless membrane-bound immunoglobulins are cross-linked with antiserum. Cell lines that are available include the CCRT osteogenic sarcoma line that expresses MHC I but not MHC II antigens, and CR-T1 and CR-T2 lymphoid cell lines that express cotton rat T-cell markers (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) . Monoclonal antibodies against cotton rat IgA, IgM, IgG, CD4 cells, and cotton rat macrophages have been developed. In addition, antibodies to human β-2 microglobulin have been shown to cross-react with cotton rat MHC I, while a mouse MHC II antibody crossreacts with cotton rat MHC II (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) . Cytokine assays for IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, TNF, and IFN-γ have also been developed. Reagents and gene sequences for a wide variety of cytokines and cellular markers are available commercially.
