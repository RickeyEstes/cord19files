Animals . Pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were immunized and their offspring inoculated with MHV-JHM as described previously .' Cells and viruses. MHV-JHM, kindly provided by Dr S . Weiss, was grown in BALB/c 3T3-17CL1 cells and titered in L-2 cells as previously described .' Antibody preparations . Rabbit polyclonal antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein was the generous gift of Dr Lawrence Eng . Mouse monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of MHV-JHM (IgG2B/k antibody) was kindly provided by Dr Julian Leibowitz . Hyperimmune mouse serum was obtained by repeated immunizations of MHV-JHM in Freund's adjuvant . Biotinylation of antibody . The monoclonal anti-MHV-JHM antibody was biotinylated by standard procedures . Z ' Immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence assays on same sections . In preliminary experiments, we optimized conditions of sectioning and fixation and antibody concentration . We used frozen sections, prepared as previously described,' in order to maximize signal detection of viral antigen . We used thin sections (6-8 microns) to minimize the likelihood of fortuitous overlap of labels . Initial experiments were performed with methanol fixation, whereas later experiments were done with PLP fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 M lysine, 0 .01 M sodium periodate, and 0 .037 M phosphate buffer, pH 7 .5) . 22 We also found that the presence of biotinylated antibody did not affect the subsequent immunofluorescent analysis, in agreement with previous reports . 23 In control experiments, anti-MHV-JHM antibody did not react with uninfected brains . In the first set of experiments, sections were prepared and fixed with methanol containing 0 .3% hydrogen peroxide . Slides were treated with normal horse serum, and then simultaneously with the biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-MHV-JHM antibody (1 :25) and rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (1 :100) for 2 hours . The slides were treated with Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories) used according to the manufacturer and then developed by exposure to diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0 .5 mg/ml) in hydrogen peroxide (0 .01%) . After washing and counterstaining with hematoxylin, the samples were treated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel Laboratories) . Anti-MHV-JHM staining was not blocked by prior treatment with non-specific IgG2b/k antibody (Litton Bionetics) . In the second set of experiments, sections were fixed with PLP solution . 2' The sections were treated sequentially with 20% normal goat serum, with a mixture of hyperimmune polyclonal mouse anti-MHV-JHM (1 :25) and rabbit anti-GFAP antibodies (1 :100) and then with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody . Development and counterstaining were as above . The sections were finally treated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1 :50 or 1 :100) (Cappel Laboratories) . No fluorescent cells were observed if the mouse anti-MHV-JHM serum was replaced by normal mouse serum . Slides were air dried, mounted and examined using the Olympus BH-2 microscope by both standard light and fluorescent microscopy . To count cells, each section was scanned for cells containing virus . Once a cell was determined to be positive for virus, the same cell on the section was examined under the other phase . Thus in the second set of experiments, virusspecific cells were initially detected by fluorescent microscopy, and then analyzed for the presence of GFAP by light microscopy . Two to six sections were assayed for each mouse . Some mice were assayed by both methods described above and the results were very similar . In all cases, questionable cells were counted as negative, so that the fraction of virus-specific cells which are astrocytes may in fact be higher than reported above .
