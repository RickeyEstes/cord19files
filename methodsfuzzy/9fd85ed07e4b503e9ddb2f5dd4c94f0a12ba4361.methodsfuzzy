Rapid advancements in therapeutics against persistent inflammation are hindered by difficulties in monitoring their effect on airway inflammation. Obtaining lower airway specimens from children is challenging. Young children find it difficult to expectorate until at least 7 years of age and bronchoscopy with lavage is an invasive procedure performed under anesthesia. Non-invasive approaches for monitoring inflammation in the lungs, including the resolution of inflammation, are required. Approaches that warrant investigation include the use of exhaled breath condensate (201) and biomarkers from upper airway mucosal secretions (202) and blood (23) reflective of lower airway inflammatory processes.
