This was a cohort study; all subjects were selected randomly from the Chest Outpatient Clinic and Pulmonary Function Unit in the National Research Centre and Chest Department of Cairo University over 24 months. Our study included 115 male subjects. Their age ranged between 40 and 78 years. They were divided into non-COPD groups, group 1 (non-smokers) which included 15 non-smoker healthy controls with normal spirometry and group 2 (resistant smokers) which included 25 smokers who did not develop COPD proved clinically and by normal spirometry, and a COPD group (group 3) which included 75 smokers with COPD. Patients were assigned to the study according to one or more of the following criteria: age above 40 years, smoking history above 20 pack years, clinical and radiological examination fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of COPD [19] . Exclusion criteria included diseases other than COPD and working in industrial areas. All patients gave written informed consent; the study was approved by the ethical committee of the National Research Centre. All subjects of the study were subjected to medical history taking, clinical examination, plain chest X-ray postero-anterior view, and pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometric measurements of FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC (forced vital capacity) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25/75% of predicted. Normal pulmonary function test (PFT) was considered as FEV 1 % of predicted > 85%, FEV 1 /FVC % of predicted > 70%. Bronchodilators were stopped 24 h before PFT. Thirteen of our COPD patients were admitted to the ICU for acute (on top of chronic) respiratory failure, so spirometric measurements were not performed on them. Identification of adenovirus C gene and genotyping of TNF-Î±, SP-B, and IL-13 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR).
