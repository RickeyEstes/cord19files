2.1. Source of preweuning morbidity and growth data (previous trial) One hundred and fifty Holstein-Friesian heifer calves, assessed as clinically healthy (i.e. calves that breathed, walked and nursed normally) had been enrolled in a clinical trial which lasted from birth to weaning at lo-12 weeks of age on a dairy milking 5000 cows in the Central Valley of California (Jamaluddin, 1995) . The dairy was organized into five smaller dairies, four of which were about 1.5 km from each other; the fifth was located about 4 km from the others. Calves in this study originated from all five dairies and were raised at one site. Seventy-five of the calves in the previous trial were assigned to the treatment group (based on the dam's eartag number) and fed 2-4 1 of pasteurized colostrum (obtained by pooling colostrum from all five dairies) within 2-3 h after birth, followed by pasteurized waste milk at 4 1 day-' until weaning. Waste milk originated from cows with mastitis or other disorders, and treated with antibiotics. The other 75 calves were assigned to the control group and were fed the same quantities but of nonpasteurized, pooled colostrum and nonpasteurized waste milk. Daily, colostrum and waste milk from all five dairies were taken to a pasteurization site, pooled, and later divided into quantities to be fed either pasteurized or nonpasteurized. Calves were housed individually in hutches and identified by an eartag. Calves were run concurrently; treated and control calves were placed in separate, adjacent rows of hutches on the same premises. Grain feeding consisted of calf-starter pellets (crude protein (CP), 22% dry matter (DM) basis; crude fat, 2.5% DM basis; crude fiber, 8% DM basis) and water ad libitum from the third day after birth until weaning. Age at occurrence, severity., and duration of each episode of diarrhea and respiratory signs were recorded daily afi:er feeding by a trained worker supervised by the senior author, from birth to weaning. For calves with an episode of diarrhea or respiratory disease signs, recurrence of signs after 2 consecutive sign-free days was considered a new episode. Calf weight measured by a trained worker was estimated at birth and once every week until weaning using a heart-girth tape (Nasco Agricultural Science, Modesto, CA). The evaluator was not blinded regarding treatment group.
