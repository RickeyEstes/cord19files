Over the past 20 years, there has been an increasing use of virus-specific adoptive T-cell therapies in which donor-derived virus-specific T lymphocytes are administered to patients with the primary goal of counteracting the effects of uncontrolled viral replication in immunosuppressed patients after HSCT. To optimize this approach, numerous in vitro studies have been conducted by various groups in an attempt to identify the best methodology for the expansion or selection of virus-specific T lymphocytes for clinical use ( Figure 1 , Table I ) (9e15). The first experiences with the use of antiviral adoptive immunotherapy used T cells expanded with CMV-infected fibroblasts (16, 17) or CMV lysate (18, 19) . Although effective, this made them difficult to export because of the regulatory hurdles required for such a production. Indeed, the expansion of virusspecific T cells often requires clean rooms, quality control, quality assurance, release testing and documentation to meet current good manfuacturing practice (cGMP) compliance. One of the first cGMPcompliant strategies reported for the manufacture of virus-specific T cells was the selection of virus-specific T cells from bulk donors' T lymphocytes by tetramer selection (9) . The advantages of this method were the rapid availability of the T cells and the ease of the selection process, which does not require antigen-presenting cells (APCs), exogenous cytokines or extended ex vivo manipulation and can be performed with the use of closed-system devices outside of a dedicated clean room or GMP facility. However, tetramer-mediated selection only selects T cells specific for a single HLArestricted epitope of a single virus (in this case CMV) and is generally only available for donors with the most common of HLA types. Although sometimes effective, focusing the antiviral response to one epitope leaves the patient vulnerable to antigenic escape, as has been observed clinically for EBV (20, 21) . Another method to isolate virus-specific T cells is by immunomagnetically selecting T cells that secrete interferon (IFN)-g in response to virus-derived overlapping peptides (10, 22) . This technique is advantageous because the cells are rapidly available and do not require extensive manipulation while still targeting entire antigens or viruses, depending on the stimuli. However, the selection of unexpanded T cells has been associated with GvHD, and, as with the tetramer technology, this option is currently only available for donors who are seropositive for the virus being targeted. Another GMP-applicable method to generate virus-specific T cells involves the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with APCs. This approach was investigated in the 1990s to generate EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) by stimulating PBMC with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) (23) and was later modified to include a first stimulation with dendritic cells transduced with clinical-grade adenoviral vectors expressing viral antigens for EBV or CMV, thus expanding the antiviral specificity of the CTL (11) . Furthermore, CTL expanded in this way enable T cells to recognize three viruses (EBV [from the LCL], CMV [from the engineered adenoviral vector], and adenovirus [from the adenoviral vector]) in a single culture with a very high specificity starting from a relatively low blood volume (50e60 mL). The limitation of this approach is that it is time-consuming (up to 3 months), requires the use of a clinical grade viral vector, which is expensive, and can be a major regulatory hurdle. To remove the need for viral vectors, more recent approaches have used dendritic cells that were either nucleofected with plasmid DNA encoding different viral antigens or pulsed with overlapping peptides for viral antigens to stimulate and expand multi-viruse specific T cells. After only a single stimulation (a total of approximately 10e17 d), the CTL were frozen and ready for use pending the release testing (12, 13) . Despite the manufacturing advances made for the generation of virus-specific T cells, none of the approaches described above are able to expand virusspecific T cells from donors who are virus-seronegative. This is a limitation because one of the biggest risks for viral infection (excluding immune suppression) is when the graft does not contain a specific T-memory compartment (such as in cord blood or seronegative adult donors) and the recipient is latently infected by these pathogens (24e26). To peptide of interest to stimulate the T cells. Once the T cells are stimulated, antibodies bind IFN-g and the T cell, allowing the T cells to be isolated by magnetic selection. (D) To improve on the classic ex vivo expansion system, the rapid system utilizes the APCs present in the PBMC. The PBMCs are pulsed with overlapping peptides representing the viral antigens(s) of interest. APCs pulsed with the peptides then stimulate the T cells to grow. When coupled with a G-rex gas-permeable culture device, these CTL are ready 9e12 d after initiation. address this unmet need, several groups have evaluated strategies to stimulate the naive T cells present in cord blood (27e31). Furthermore, with the use of the G-Rex gas-permeable device (32) , it was possible to expand cord bloodederived T cells to numbers sufficient for clinical use, demonstrating for the first time that it is possible to generate multivirus-specific T cells in a virus-inexperienced setting in a cGMPapplicable manner (14, 33) .
