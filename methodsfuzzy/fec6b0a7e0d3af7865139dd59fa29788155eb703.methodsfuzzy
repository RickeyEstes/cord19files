Cell culture and viral plaque assay. The African green monkey kidney cell line Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2). Vero cells have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [4] . All cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C. In all the experiments, the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 0.01. Aurintricarboxylic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was prepared in the culture media and added into the samples in serial dilutions composed of 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/ml. Plaque assays were performed 24 h post-infection using procedures as described [16] . We also performed the inhibition analysis with interferons a and b both at the concentration of 5000 IU/ml [10, 12] . Western blotting. Protein samples from Vero cell extracts were fractionated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to PVDF membrane using semi-dry protein transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris base, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.2% Tween 20. The membrane was then probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV spike protein (unpublished data). Rabbit anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was subsequently added for an additional incubation of 1 h at 37°C. The results were finally revealed by using Pierce Biotechnology SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Rockford, IL). Real-time RT-PCR analysis. The analysis was performed with Prism 7700 real-time PCR instrument from Perkin-Elmer (Wellesley, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Supernatant samples from SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells were collected for viral RNA extractions using RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Primers and probe used in the RT-PCR are as follows: probe: 6FAM-ACCC CAAGGTTTACCC, forward: ACCAGAATGGAGGACGCAATG, and reverse: GCTGTGAACCAAGACGCAGTATTAT. Inhibition of adenovirus expressing EGFP. ATA was used in a comparative study for inhibition of the adenovirus Adeno X, which carries a replication reporter gene expressing EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Approximately 5 mg of adenovirus X was transfected into HEK293 cells, using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by addition of serial dilutions of ATA Western blot analysis was followed using the antibody against EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cell proliferation assay. The XTT kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used to measure the toxicity of ATA. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, dilutions of ATA and interferons were added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. The colorimetric detection reagent from the XTT kit was subsequently added to the cells. Results were determined by a spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 450 nm.
