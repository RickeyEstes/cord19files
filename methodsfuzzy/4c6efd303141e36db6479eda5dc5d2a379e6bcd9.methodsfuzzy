Samples of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani), and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) were provided by the CIBIO Lagomorpha tissue collection. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the EasySpin Genomic DNA Minipreps Tissue Kit (Citomed, Torun, Poland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Mini Kit also according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from one specimen of European rabbit and one of European brown hares. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using oligo(dT) as primers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The European rabbit and American pika IL17A sequences were retrieved from public databases (accession numbers are given in bold in Figure 1 ). PCR amplification was performed with the Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) by using two pairs of primers designed according to the retrieved sequences (for genomic DNA F1-CGTCCAACCTCAGTTGATC + R1-CACTGTACCATC-TATCCTGC and F2-CCTTCATTTACTCCCATTCG + R2-CATCCATCACATGGCCTAA; for cDNA the combination of primers F1 + R2 was used). Sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and PCR products were sequenced in both directions. The sequences obtained were submitted to GenBank with the following accession numbers: KU163611-KU163619. Haplotype phases of the sequences obtained were reconstructed with the program PHASE, built into the software DnaSP [38] . Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) [39] was used for sequence alignment. The putative N-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetNGlyc/) [40] . The number of nucleotide differences per site between sequences was estimated in MEGA6 [41] with the following options: bootstrap method (1000 replicates), p-distance as model, and pairwise deletion for gaps/missing data treatment. A Maximum Likelihood approach was used to estimate the phylogenetic relationships between the IL17A nucleotide sequences by using MEGA6; the best-fit nucleotide substitution model was predicted by the same software and 1000 bootstrap replicates were used. The secondary structure of IL17A was predicted using PsiPred (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) [42, 43] and DiAminoacid Neural Network Application (DiANNA) (http:// clavius.bc.edu/âˆ¼clotelab/DiANNA/) [44] . Both methods predict protein cysteines that create disulfide bonds, but while PsiPred uses Position Specific Iterated-BLAST (PSI-BLAST) to obtain evolutionary information used to predict the secondary structure of the query protein, DiANNA is a neural network that recognizes cysteines in an oxidized state (sulfur covalently bonded) distinguishing them from those in a reduced state.
