CeUs and wirus. The A59 strain (Manaker et d, 1961) of MHV was used for these studies. Cells used were the L-2 line (Rothfels et al, 1959) , here designated L, and the thymidine kinase-deficient LM line (Kit et al, 1963) , here designated LM-K. This latter cell line is not the same as the LM cells (Merchant and Hellman, 1962) used in previous studies (Anderson and Bilan, 1981; Cheley et aL, 1981b) . For comparison, LM-K cells were found to be more infectible by MHV and gave rise to higher virus titers than LM cells (unpublished). In&e&&m an& culture conditions. Cells were propagated in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Monolayers of either L or LM-K cells were inoculated with pretitered stocks of MHV, adsorbed 30 min at 32.5", washed three times with MEM, and then incubated at 37" in MEM containing 5% FCS. For long-term culture studies, medium was changed on a daily basis. Aliquots were removed from culture media at various time intervals for analysis of virus yields by plaque assay on L cells (Lucas et al, 1977) . Irlfectious center assay. To determine the number of infected cells in MHV-inoculated cultures, cells were harvested at 2 hr postinoculation (p.i.) by trypsinization after thrice washing with citrate saline. Harvested cells were freed from trypsin by centrifugation (2 min at 600 9) and resuspended in MEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Aliquots of the resuspended cells and dilutions therefrom were plated on monolayers of L cells, allowed to attach for 2 hr at 32.5", then overlaid with MEM containing 5% FCS and 0.5% methylcellulose (4000 cps). Plaques were read after 24 hr at 37". Assay for ceU surface fusion activity. Sparse cultures of L and LM-K cells (lo5 cells/35 mm plate) were inoculated with MHV at a multiplicity of inoculation (m.o.i.) of 0.01 and 10, respectively (to produce roughly equal infectious centers). After adsorption and washing as above, cultures were incubated 5 hr at 37". At this time lo6 uninfected L or LM-K cells were added to the cultures to fill in the spaces left unoccupied by the original, sparsely seeded cells. Cultures were photographed and scored either positive or negative for syncytial formation after 3 hr incubation at 37'. RNA extraction and semiquantitation bp clot blotting. Cell monolayers (lo6 cells in 35 mm plates) were harvested with a modified guanidine hydrochloride (Strohman, 1977) procedure. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 7.6 M guanidine-HCl in 0.1 1M potassium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and the viscous mixture was homogenized by aspiration five times through a l-ml sterile plastic syringe (Yale) fitted with a 21-gauge needle. Samples were transferred to tissue culture tubes (Falcon), mixed with 0.6 vol of 95% ethanol, cooled for 12 hr at -2O", and centrifuged at 5000 Q for 20 min to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were dissolved in 250 ~1 7.6 M guanidine-HCl in 0.1 1K potassium acetate, pH 5.0, to which was added 250 ~120 X SSC (1 X SSC (standard citrate saline) is 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M trisodium citrate). Samples were subsequently heated for 15 min at 50". For dotblot hybridization, 50-~1 aliquots of the samples or of serial lo-fold dilutions therefrom were applied in a Schleicher and Schuell "Minifold" filtration apparatus to nitrocellulose sheets (0.45 pm, Millipore) supported on three layers of slab dryer filter paper (Bio-Rad). Both nitrocellulose sheets and filter paper had been previously equilibrated with 10 X SSC. After sample application, sheets were dried at SO" for 1 hr. Sheets were nreannealed, annealed with   TABLE 1 p2P]cDNA (prepared as described (Cheley et ok, 1981a) against MW nucleocapsid protein mRNA), and washed essentially according to the procedure of Thomas (1980) . The ability of this cDNA to detect all positive-sense MHV-specific RNAs identified to date has been documented (Cheley et aL, 1981a, b) . The annealed and washed sheets were autoradiographed to yield the dot blots. Densitometric scanning analysis was performed on selected sample dots for which autoradiographic intensities were less than saturated. MHV(A59) antiserum. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography as previously described (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) .
