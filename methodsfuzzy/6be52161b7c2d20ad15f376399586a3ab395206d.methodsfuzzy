Here, 296 undergraduate students (148 women, 148 men) were recruited from Shandong Normal University. The mean age of the participants was 19.41 years (SD = 0.75). Participants completed all measures individually and received a gift valued at Â¥15 for their participation. To control common method biases, in the questionnaire design, we used the Podasakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) method as follows: (i) participants complete the questionnaire anonymously, and facilitators ensure the subjects know that the survey is only for group study, not for individual analysis; (ii) each part of the questionnaire measures different points and has different scoring rules; (iii) each part of the questionnaire has a different reaction statement. Some have a probability from 0 to 100, some are in agreement from 1 to 6, and some are fill-in-the-blanks. In addition, Harman's single-factor test (Harman, 1976; Podasakoff et al., 2003) was used to check for the potential for common method bias. Harman's single factor test is a widely used technique to diagnose common method variance (e.g., Andersson & Bateman, 1997; Aulakh & Gencturk, 2000; Greene & Organ, 1973; Krishnaveni & Deepa, 2013; Schriesheim, Kinicki, & Schriesheim, 1979) . Therefore, we entered all the variables in the study into exploratory factor analysis using unrotated principal component factor analysis and principal component analysis with varimax rotation to determine the number of factors that are necessary to account for the variance in the variables. The factor analysis revealed the presence of six distinct factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 rather than a single factor. The six factors accounted for 59.45% of the variance, and the largest factor was found to account for only 17.7% of the variance. Thus, no general factor was apparent. According to the two criteria, there was no common method bias problem in this study.
