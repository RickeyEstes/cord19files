Various approaches for the detection of jump points have been extensively studied in the literature. Muller (1992) adopted a nonparametric regression approach to obtain weakly consistent estimators for the locations of jump points and the corresponding jump sizes. Yin (1988) proposed a detection method for the number, location and magnitudes of jumps of a regression function in the presence of noise. While the aforementioned methods work well, satisfactory results are obtained by manually selecting an appropriate regression kernel. We remark that a small kernel will lead to spurious jump point locations whereas a large kernel may not detect jump points with relatively small jump sizes. Based on the sequence of parameter constancy tests in the smooth transition regression framework, a sequential method was used in Strikholm (2006) for determining the number of breaks in a piecewise linear structural break model, which breaks the time series into a number of polynomial functions. In addition, Yang and Song (2014) proposed a polynomial spline approach for jump point detection and the estimation of the discontinuities of regression functions. Although these methods provide a sound mathematical theory that underpins the validity of the framework, we note that their methods may miss the jump points with small jump sizes. Moreover, some of the detection methods perform well only for a data set with moderate size. In addition to the approaches mentioned above, a timefrequency transformation method is also popular in the literature. Lombard (1988) applied Fourier transform to extract details from the signal. With the use of Fourier analysis, jump points could be detected but their locations (i.e. time) cannot be identified. In addition, some jump points may be missed due to the smoothness of the Fourier basis function. To remedy the shortcoming of Fourier transform, Hui et al. (2010) presented a wavelet method with non-smooth Haar wavelet for detecting jump points in the time series of the private domestic price indices and stock price index. They found that jump points detected by the wavelet approach reflect the announcement of regulations/policies or some regional/international events. With reference to the wavelet approaches in Ip et al. (2004) and Donoho and Johnstone (1994) , Hui et al. (2013) employed an improved nonparametric wavelet model to detect jump points in the Asian office markets. Although wavelet approaches usually achieve promising results, the major drawback is that it adopts a fixed basis function which may not approximate signals very well.
