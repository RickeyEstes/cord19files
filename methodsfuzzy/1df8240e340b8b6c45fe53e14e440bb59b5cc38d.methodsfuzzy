ProOmpA purification and translocation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described by Ito et al. (1980) . Trigger factor and ribosome protein profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide, 0.12% N,N'-methylene his-acrylamide, and 6 M urea (Ito et al., 1981) . Silver staining was performed by the method of Ansorge (1983) . Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography (Chamberlin, 1979) . Immunoblotting was according to the method of Towbin et al. (1979) . We thank Marilyn Rice and Douglas Geissert for expert assistance, David Eisenberg for computer searches, D. Meyer for stimulating discussions and generous gifts of microsomal salt extract and purified SRP, and Peter Walter for generous gifts of SRP This work was sup ported by a grant from the NIH and a contract with Eli Lilly and Co.
