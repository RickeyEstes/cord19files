ProDect BCS RV CHIP method is a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a chip hybridization assay (bcs Biotech, Italy). CAPvir method is a multiplex RT-PCR followed a nitrocellulose strip hybridization assay (Genome Identification Diagnostic GmbH, Gen ID, Germany). In this method, 10 specimens were randomly selected out of 24 frozen specimens that were positive for parainfluenza virus type 3 using shell vial cell culture and negative with ProDect BCS RV CHIP. The viral nucleic acids of the selected thawed specimens were extracted as previously described and used in CAPvir method. In the present study, IFAT, shell vial cell culture, and ProDect BCS RV CHIP method were performed in 100 specimens. CAPvir method was carried out on 10 specimens that were randomly selected out of 24 frozen specimens that were positive for parainfluenza virus type 3 using shell vial cell culture and negative with ProDect BCS RV CHIP. In the 40 respiratory virus positive specimens, IFAT detected respiratory viruses in 24 specimens in which five were dual virus infections and 19 were single virus infections. Therefore, 29 respiratory viruses were detected in 24 specimens using IFAT. Shell vial cell culture detected respiratory viruses in 40 specimens in which five were dual virus infections. Thus, 45 viruses were detected in 40 specimens using shell vial cell culture. The last assay ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected respiratory viruses in 10 specimens in which one of them was dually infected. Eleven respiratory viruses were detected in 10 specimens by ProDect BCS RV CHIP method. The combination of IFAT and shell vial cell culture which is considered as the "gold standard" in the present study detected respiratory viruses in 40 specimens in which 9 (22.5%) were dual virus infections and 31 were single virus infections. In these 40 specimens, 49 respiratory viruses were detected using the combination of IFAT and shell vial cell culture. As a result, shell vial cell culture, IFAT and ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected 92% (45/49), 59.2% (29/49), and 22.4% (11/49) of the respiratory viruses in the specimens, respectively. In addition, ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected only one dual infection compared to the combination of IFAT and shell vial cell culture which detected nine dual infections (Tables 2 and 3 ). The sensitivity of ProDect BCS RV CHIP in detecting RSV, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus type 3 were 55.5%, 20%, and 11%, respectively, and the specificity was 100% for these viruses. As influenza virus type A and B were detected only in a small group of specimens (n = 3) in this study, the ProDect BCS RV CHIP results were not compared with shell vial cell culture and IFAT. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of ProDect BCS RV CHIP were 25.0%, 100%, 100%, 66.6%, and 70%, respectively, compared to the combination of IFAT and shell vial cell culture. Ten specimens which were parainfluenza virus type 3 positive with shell vial cell culture and negative with ProDect BCS RV CHIP assay were also positive for parainfluenza virus type 3 using CAPVir method. Inhibitory substances were not detected in any of the specimens by the ProDect BCS RV CHIP and CAPvir methods.
