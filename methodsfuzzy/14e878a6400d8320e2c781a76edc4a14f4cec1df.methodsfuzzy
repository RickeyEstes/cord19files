Patients and samples collection. Infants and children younger than 18 years of age with symptoms of ARI disease presenting to the emergency department or the departments of pediatrics of the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), Beirut, Lebanon were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. An ARI was defined as an acute infection of the upper and lower respiratory airways. Recruited patients had one or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, wheezing, dyspnea, and vomiting. Medical history and demographic data were obtained from the patients and their medical records. A respiratory sample was collected and stored at -80°C for viral assessment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the AUBMC, and written informed consent was obtained from all parents. Nucleic acid extraction and viral detection. Nucleic acid was extracted from clinical specimens by using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 200 µl aliquot of each specimen was used for nucleic extraction. Specimens were then analyzed by the ResPlex II panel (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's protocol. The ResPlex II panel can detect 11 viral targets: RSVA, RSVB, INFA, INFB, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, hMPV, CVEV (coxsackievirus and echovirus), and RhV. Briefly, 10 µl of each specimen were added to 40 µl reverse transcription-PCR (ResPlex II) master mix, including the supplied primers. Targets were detected by mixing 5 µl portions of amplification products with ResPlex II bead in hybridization buffer at 52°C for10 min. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added, and mixtures were incubated at 52°C for a further 5 min before the addition of stop buffer. The samples were then analyzed on a Luminex Bio-Rad BioPlex 200 System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using Bio-Rad BioPlex Manager software. The cutoff value for each target was determined, as previously described by Lia et al. 19 Statistical analysis. The data were checked for completeness, and responses were coded and entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 23 for Windows, which was later used for statistical analyses. 32 Descriptive statistics were presented to summarize the study variables of interest as counts and percentages for the categorical variables and as medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for the continuous ones. The Chi-square test was used to calculate the association between two categorical variables. Pearson's chi-square analysis with Bonferroni-Holm p-value correction was used for multiple comparisons to assess infectivity enhancing correlations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine which factors are associated with rhinorrhea. In the regression model, rhinorrhea was used as the dependent variable. Odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For all analysis done, a pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
