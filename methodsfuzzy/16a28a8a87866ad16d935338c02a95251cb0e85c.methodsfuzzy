The sequence of ORF3 protein in SARS-CoV was downloaded from GenBank (NP_828851) and used for fold prediction by 3D Jury system [2] , it is a comprehensive protein structure prediction servers including more than 10 novel fold recognition methods, which made a dramatic impact on the critical assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP-5) in 2002. The proteins with a sufficiently high 3D score were used as templates to construct 3D models of ORF3 using the MODELLER program [4] . The quality of 3D models was evaluated by ProQ program [5] and the best model was used for further analyses. Specifically, in order to get possible information about the function of ORF3, VAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch. html), DALI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) and CE [6] programs were employed to search the structure neighbors of ORF3 protein. The structural comparison was performed by LGA [7] . Finally, NCI program [8] was used to identify noncanonical interactions in protein structures. The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).
