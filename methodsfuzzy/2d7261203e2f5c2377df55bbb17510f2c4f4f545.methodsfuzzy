The classification of lyssaviruses has evolved over time. Initially lyssaviruses were subdivided into serotypes based on their assorted cross-reactivities in classical serologic assays. 2 However the introduction of monoclonal antibody techniques and later molecular typing provided a much improved level of resolution of this genus. Presently, lyssavirus species can be grouped into phylogroups based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis, each with unique genetic, immunogenic and pathogenic properties. 43 Within the lyssavirus genus, phylogroup I includes all lyssavirus species except Lagos bat virus, Shimoni bat virus, Mokola virus, and West Caucasian bat virus. 13, 36, 43 The phylogroup II viruses diverge more at the amino acid level on the glycoprotein gene (Fig. 1) . West Caucasian bat virus may represent a new phylogroup; however, only a single isolation of this virus has been reported, thus precluding official designation. 36 The operational term "genotype" has been used for lyssavirus classification since the time when molecular techniques replaced serotyping for classification purposes. Demarcation of genotypes has been based largely on genetic distances between members of the genus and on the bootstrap support of phylogenetic constructions. 44, 45 However, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) does not recognize operationally defined genotypes, and only recognizes viral species for taxonomy at this level. Comparison of all five concatenated lyssavirus genes has been shown to provide the most robust level of resolution thus far, with threshold for differentiation between 76.4% and 81.6% nucleotide sequence identity. 13, 46 Summary of the natural history of lyssaviruses and their capacity to cause rabies Rabies virus is well known to most as being transmitted between bats (virus maintenance) and from bats to other vertebrates, which acquire the virus and die, either before or after transmitting it to other individuals. Bats of many species have been shown to be involved in the natural cycle (bat-to-bat or bat-to-other vertebrate-to-other vertebrate, etc.) and in the dead-end road represented by a vertebrate which dies before transmitting the virus. Since 1953, rabies virus has been reported to occur in insectivorous bats in North America. 47 Subsequently, increased surveillance revealed rabies virus infection in insectivorous bats of the majority of species throughout the U.S.A. and Canada. 48 Estimates of rabies virus prevalence in North American bats have varied between species and across years within species. 49 These include not only the commonly recognized vampire (hematophagous) bats but bats that feed on insects, fruits, flowers, pollen, or nectar, fish, frogs, lizards, small rodents, small birds, and other bats. Bats of many species are colonial in nature and spend a great deal of their time in close proximity to one another, either daily while resting, seasonally while in hibernation, when breeding, or in maternal colonies. No matter the reason for their close proximity, infected bats are able to transmit rabies virus to their cohorts and to their offspring, perhaps vertically, although whether the latter is an important means of virus maintenance is unknown. 50 The epidemiology of rabies virus appears simple (infected vertebrate-to uninfected vertebrate) but is complex. The virus can be transmitted directly from bats (virusinfected bat to uninfected human, equid, bovid, canid, raccoon, skunk, or other terrestrial vertebrate) but the terrestrial vertebrate that becomes infected may serve as a temporary (until it dies) source of virus which can then infect other terrestrial vertebrates, thus establishing a cycle not involving bats. It is instructive to recognize the correlation between rabies virus variants in terrestrial vertebrates and rabies virus variants in bats in the same area. Clearly, the rabies virus-infected bats above them somehow infect the terrestrial vertebrates below, whether by scratch or bite by the bat or by the terrestrial vertebrate eating a virus-infected bat.
