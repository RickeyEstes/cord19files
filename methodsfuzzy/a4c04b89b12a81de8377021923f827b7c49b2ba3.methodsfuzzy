Molecular methods are valuable diagnostic tools whenever culture is either not possible or is negative [2, 22, 49] . Moreover, they reduce the high risk of laboratory-acquired infections over conventional biochemical typing [2, 21, 77] . During recent years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based methods have been successfully used for the rapid identification and classification of Francisella isolates, with increased sensitivity and specificity [54, 78] . However, false positive results related to non-pathogenic closely related Francisella subspecies, occurring naturally in the environment, may hamper species and subspecies identification [78] . Conventional PCR targets are tul4 and fopA genes, which encode for F. tularensis superficial membrane lipoproteins. Both protocols show a good level of sensitivity and reasonable specificity in F. tularensis detection and may be used in blood, tissue or aerosol samples [4, 49, 54] . PCR product specificity is confirmed by sequencing, reverse-line blotting (RLB) or restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) [54] . Real time PCR for F. tularensis detection has been developed, in particular, TaqMan TM (Applied Biosystems) real time PCR multiple assay shows high specificity and sensitivity using four target genes: ISFtu2, 23 kDA, tul4 and fopA [49, 54] . Real-time PCR for the differentiation between the subspecies tularensis and holarctica is also now available [79] . Further discrimination has been achieved using highresolution genotyping methods including pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP), ribotyping, 16S rDNA gene sequencing, canonic insertion deletions and paired-end sequence mapping [26, 27, 34, 80] . Still, as F. tularensis exhibits highly conserved genomic sequences among strains of diverse origin, genetic polymorphisms allowing for individual strain typing have been difficult to find [77] . As for other bacteria, more recent PCR-based techniques such as variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR), multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) and short-tandem repeats (STR) typing have been successfully used for identification at the subspecies level and for molecular epidemiology purposes [54, 77, 80] . One of the most discriminatory methods for the molecular subtyping of F. tularensis is MLVA, which consists of a series of VNTR loci that are PCR amplified via flanking primer sites and examined for size variation [79] . One MLVA system designed for F. tularensis is based on polymorphisms of 25 VNTR loci, Ft-M1 to Ft-M25. This MLVA typing system has a greater discriminatory power when applied to a worldwide set of F. tularensis isolates and provides accurate classification at the subspecies level [77] . This MLVA system has recently been improved by redesigning the subset of the 25 previously identified VNTRs to produce a new optimised, multiplexed MLVA system with a similar level of discrimination but with fewer time and cost requirements [79] . Ten of the previously described VNTR loci were selected based on their discrimination ability within the subspecies: Ft-M02, Ft-M03, Ft-M04, Ft-M05, Ft-M06, Ft-M010, FT-M20, FT-M22, Ft-M23 and Ft-M24. Locus Ft-M20 was split into two loci, Ft-M20A (which contains the originally described 12 bp repeat and is polymorphic across subspecies) and Ft-M20B (which contains the insertion with its 15 bp repeat and varies only among type A.II and F. novicida isolates) [79] . While providing discrimination among strains, VNTRs are unsuited for determining deeper phylogenetic relationships due to mutational saturation. In this case, more accurate and alternative markers should be used, such as whole-genome sequence single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) [79] . Additional studies have shown a remarkable degree of discrimination of the F. tularensis phylogenetic structure, using a combined analysis with canonical whole-genome SNPs for major clade typing, and MLVA for high-resolution typing [26, 79] . In a different study, the combined analysis of insertion-deletion markers, for subspecies and major clade typing, along with MLVA, was used [80] . Microarrays have also allowed for the differentiation of the four F. tularensis subspecies and have been proven useful for pathogenicity and virulence marker identification [54] .
