The parameter estimation for the model was carried out by fitting the time series of 361 confirmed SARS case data to the model using three-stage least-squares (3SLS) method, commonly used in econometrics for estimating multiple parameters of simultaneous equations (Pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1998) . The detailed description of the 3SLS estimation procedure is given in the Appendix. To simplify the estimation, we will make use of previously published estimates of the model parameters for Taiwan SARS, whenever available. In Hsieh et al. (2005) , the mean onsetto-diagnosis times for quarantined and unquarantined individuals were computed from the Taiwan SARS case data to be 1.20 days and 2.89 days, respectively, hence we obtain m 2 ¼ 1/1.2 ¼ 0.833 and m 1 ¼ 1/2.89 ¼ 0.346 for the respective removal rates of the quarantine and unquarantined infective. Moreover, also from the result in Hsieh et al. (2005), we can obtain o ¼ 1/7.55 ¼ 0.132 for the reclassification rate of the hospitalized persons.
