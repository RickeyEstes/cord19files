The more frequently used techniques are described below. Specialist literature should be consulted for such methods as the negative staining carbon film technique developed by Horne and Pasquali-Ronchetti (in which suitable virus preparations are simultaneously crystallized and negatively stained), shadowing, and low temperature techniques such as freeze drying, freeze etching, and examination of viruses frozen in thin layers of ice. This is the simplest and most widely used method. 1. Using fine, clean forceps and finebore pipettes, mix equal amounts (approximately 25 #1) of virus suspension and negative stain on a glass slide or a waxed surface. 2. Place a drop on a coated EM grid or flo&t grid on surface of stain/virus drop. 3. After a few seconds remove the bulk of the fluid with the edge of a strip of filter paper. The longer the grid is in contact with the suspension the more virus will be absorbed. However, the need for any greater sensitivity must be balanced against any deleterious effects of the stain on the virus. 4. Air dry the grid. 5. Examine in the EM: an initial examination will indicate if more/less stain is required. Some specimens contain high salt concentrations which are likely to mask virus particles. In addition longer adsorption times might be necessary (e.g. with low virus concentrations). 1. Apply virus suspension alone to the coated grid or float grid on a drop of virus suspension for from a few seconds to several hours (use a humidified chamber for adsorption times greater than 1 min). 2. Wash the grid gently with one or more drops of distilled water. 3. Add a drop of the negative stain. Penetration of stain into virus can be controlled by varying the staining time. 4. Remove the bulk of the fluid with the edge of a piece of filter paper. 5. Air dry the grid and examine in the EM.
