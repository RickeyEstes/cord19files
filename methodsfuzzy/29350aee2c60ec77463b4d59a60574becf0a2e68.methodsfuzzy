The limited number of published canine values by capture ELISA and flow cytometry, caused a robust set of acceptance criteria to be applied prior to use in Good Laboratory/Good Automated Laboratory Practices regulatory studies (Taylor, 1987) . The acceptance criteria for ELISA included: linearity, intra-assay reproducibility (system precision), inter-assay reproducibility (method precision), accuracy (% observed/expected), and immunological specificity. The acceptance criteria for flow cytometry was intra-assay reproducibility (system precision), while biological specificity for both assays was determined by use of positive control challenge substances in the target species.
