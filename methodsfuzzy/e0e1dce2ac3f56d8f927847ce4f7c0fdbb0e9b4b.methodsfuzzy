A polyclonal antibody preparation to a field strain of bovine rotavirus was made by immunising a laying hen with partially purified virus and harvesting the egg yolk antibodies by the method of Jensenius et al. (1981) . The yolk proteins were partitioned using dextran sulphate (0.01 mM), and the IgG was precipitated from the aqueous fraction by 40% ammonium sulphate. The IgG was resuspended in, and dialysed against, the appropriate buffer for the subsequent assays. Murine monoclonal antibody A3M4 (Beards et al., 1984) to the rotavirus group antigen was kindly provided by Dr T.H. Flewett, WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rotavirus, East Birmingham Hospital, Birmingham, England. The ELISA was developed from the method of Reynolds et al. (1984) using the hen antibody both for antigen capture and, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, as the detector system. The chromogen was o-phenylene diamine. Specificity of the reaction was monitored by adding the samples to wells coated with antibody lacking any detectable anti-rotavirus activity. This was prepared from eggs from the same hen, collected prior to the rotavirus immunization. Samples were classified as positive if the colour in the test well (coated with virus-specific antibody) was at least 0.2 absorbance units more intense than in the control well. The RPHA was carried out as described by Cranage et al. (1985) using antibody linked by chromic chloride treatment to chymotrypsin-treated sheep erythrocytes. Faecal suspensions of approximately 1/10 dilution, prepared for the ELISA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20, were further diluted 1/2 in PBS, then mixed with an equal volume of 10% washed sheep erythrocyte suspension. The final faecal dilution was thus 1/40. The mixture was left to settle overnight at 4°C for the absorption of non-specific haemagglutinating activity from the samples. This procedure was adopted for working convenience, and shorter absorptions (e.g. 10 min at 37°C) have also been found satisfactory. Serial doubling dilutions of the supernatant were made in round bottom 96-well microtitration plates. Equal volumes (50 or 30 pl) of 1% red cells coupled to antibody were added to all wells, and the haemagglutination reaction was read after 1--2 h at room temperature. Non-specific haemagglutination was monitored by the use of red cells coupled to rotavirus-negative antibody. This was either the pre-inoculation egg antibody or, where the monoclonal antibody was used as the detecting antibody, normal mouse IgG. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed essentially as described by Herring et al. (1982) . Viral double-stranded RNA was extracted from faeces with phenol-chloroform and run for 16 h on 5% polyacrylamide slab gels, in a voltage gradient of approximately 4 V cm -1. The nucleic acid bands in the gels were subsequently made visible by silver staining. A strong positive control was run on each gel and test samples were recorded as positive if the characteristic ll-segment rotavirus electropherotype could be detected visually. The samples examined were bovine faeces submitted to the Central Veterinary Laboratory through the Veterinary Investigation Service for the routine diagnosis of neonatal gastroenteritis. In a preliminary study, 20 samples, collected during 1984, were examined by ELISA and RPHA. A second batch consisted of all bovine faeces samples received during a 3-week period in March 1985, amounting to 209 samples after exclusion of those for which insufficient material was available for all three tests. In each case, the person interpreting the test was unaware of the results of the other two tests.
