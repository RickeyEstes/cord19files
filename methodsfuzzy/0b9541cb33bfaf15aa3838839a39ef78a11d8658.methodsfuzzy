Statistical analysis of data obtained from only five to eight respondents within each actor group will result in inherently unreliable results due to the effects of outliers in small samples. Consequently, the challenge of the current multi-actor research is to develop a robust method of data analysis for small samples. These small samples are due to the relative young age of the technological field of biopharmaceuticals and the rareness of the area of orphan diseases, which together result in only a limited number of specialists and patients involved and only a few well-informed individuals. The method of data analysis that was developed and applied is based on the combination of majority counts and average scores, thereby eliminating the effects of outliers in the data on the results. Case 1: A Likert scale in which "1" represents "strongly negative" and "5" represents "strongly positive". If the majority and the average of the scores for each indicator are below or above the neutral scale value of 3, then the coincidence of the indicator with the concept it represents is interpreted as negative or positive, respectively. The neutral value of 3 is assigned 0 for this coincidence. In this case, the association between an indicator and the concept its represents is indicated as âˆ’, 0, or +. Case 2: A Likert scale in which "1" represents "no influence" and "5" represents a "very strong influence". If the majority and the average of the scores are between 0 and 1.5, 1.5 and 3.5, or 3.5 and 5, then the coincidence of the indicator with the concept it represents is interpreted as non-existent, weakly positive, or very positive, respectively. In this case, the association between an indicator and the concept its represents is indicated as 0, +, or ++. In both cases, if the average score of an indicator does not coincide with the majority of all scores, then the coincidence of that indicator with the concept it represents is interpreted as non-existent because it is generated by outliers. Such non-existence of the coincidence of an indicator with the concept it represents is also assigned 0 for their relationship. To investigate the nature of the relation among the independent concepts, positive, negative or no correlations among their indicators are assessed as follows. The sign of the correlation of each pair of indicators is derived from their combination of categories of coincidence with the concepts represented by them. If one indicator coincides positively with its concept, which implies that the overall score of the respondents on that indicator is relatively high (see above), and another indicator coincides negatively with its concept, which implies that the overall score of the respondents is relatively low (see above), then the indicators are considered to be negatively associated and their concepts also. If two indicators coincide negatively with the concepts they represent, then the indicators are considered to be positively associated and accordingly, the concepts are also considered to be positively associated. If one indicator of each pair of indicators does not coincide with the concept it represents, then the association between both indicators and, accordingly, between the concepts represented by them, is considered to be zero. All possible associations between the coincidences of two indicators with the concepts Table 1 Perceived coincidences of empirical indicators with the concepts they represent
