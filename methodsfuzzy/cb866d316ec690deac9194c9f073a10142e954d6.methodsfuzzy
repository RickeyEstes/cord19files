These epidemiological data indicate that genetic factors infl uence both susceptibility to, and outcome of, Review infection. The various study designs and methodological issues are important in interpreting previous data and in designing contemporary and future studies in infection. As the fundamentals of genetic epidemiology have recently been reviewed in detail, 42-48 only a brief overview will be provided here. Some of the terminology is explained briefl y in the panel. Of note, although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the workhorse of current high-throughput genotyping technologies, other forms of genetic variation are also common in the human genome and may have important eff ects on disease risk. These include repeating sequence motifs (microsatellites and minisatellites), insertions and deletions, and diff erences in gene copy number. 55 For example, recent data indicate that there is a strong inverse correlation between the number of copies of an HIV suppressive chemokine gene (CCL3L1) and HIV susceptibility. 56
