This project aims on the cellular mechanisms of Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) traversal. Therefore a transwell based in vitro BBB model was established and optimized using endothelial like ECV304 [3] , glial C6 cells and a semi-synthetical basement membrane. The cell layers were analysed by electron microscopy (EM) and barrier integrity was evaluated by bacterial transmigration comparing a non invasive E. coli HB101 strain with meningitis causing E. coli K1 strain. J774 macrophages and blood stream cultures of different trypanosome strains, namely T. b. brucei TC221, T. b. gambiense STIB930 and T. b. rhodesiense STIB900, were used to analyse the transmigration across the in vitro BBB model. Results: EM microscopy revealed a confluent layer of ECV304 cells with partly overlapping neighbour cells inside the transwell inserts and a loose meshwork of C6 cells underneath the insert membrane. The optimized ECV304-C6 model was permeable for pathogenic E. coli K1 transmigration whereas apathogenic E. coli HB101 did not transmigrate even at 100fold higher inoculums. African trypanosomes transmigrated efficiently and T. b. gambiense STIB930 strain showed the highest transmigration rate. The analyses of macrophage transmigration across the optimized ECV304-C6 BBB model indicated that paracellular extravasation of J774 macrophages does not enhance trypanosomal transmigration. An upside-down array of the BBB cells, representing an inverse BBB model, revealed brain to blood traversal of trypanosomes with similar amounts. Discussion: The optimized ECV304-C6 BBB is a reproducible in vitro BBB model and selectively permeable for meningitis causing E. coli K1. Trypanosomal transmigration across the optimized ECV304-C6 model occurs in both directions underlining the possibility of a relapsing parasitemia after treatment with drugs that have no access to the CNS. This model promotes the analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the CNS invasion, which is urgently needed for therapy improvement and drug development. We stimulated human dermal fibroblasts with the staphylococcal toxins TSST-1 and enterotoxin B (SEB), with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) as well as with soluble products from clinical Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Lactobacillus crispatus isolates. The release of the chemokine IL-8 was analyzed by ELISA as well as by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Activation of TLRs (TLR [2] [3] [4] [5] [8] [9] , hyaluronan acid synthases (HAS 1-3) and hyaluronidases (HYAL 1-3) was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: Fibroblasts responded to LPS, TSST-1, to soluble products of S. epidermidis and of L. crispatus with the release of high amounts of IL-8 and an up to 200-fold increase in mRNA levels. The most pronounced changes in TLR expression were seen for TLR 4, TLR 5 and TLR 9 by S. epidermidis, for TLR4 by the staphylococcal superantigens TSST-1, SEB and by PGN, for TLR-2 and TLR-4 by LPS. PGN activated IL-8 release predominantly through NOD1 activation, while the additional stimuli used MYD88 signalling as well. In unstimulated fibroblasts the highest mRNA expression was seen for HAS 2 and HYAL 2, moderate expression was seen for HAS 3 and HYAL 3, no signal was obtained for HAS 1 and HYAL 1. However, all microorganisms and the microbial products under study did not modulate HA metabolism. Breakdown of hyaluronan by staphylococcal hyaluronidases did not change mRNA expression of HAS 1-3 or HYAL 1-3 as well. Conclusion: Our data clearly show that fibroblasts interact with microorganisms/microbial products to a different degree, e.g. through TLRs. However, a possible role of HA metabolism in host-microorganism interacting needs further studies. To gain insight into the function of CYLD in listeriosis, we infected C57BL/6 CYLD -/and wildtype (WT) mice with a lethal dose of Listeria monocytogenes. The bacterial burden in both the mice groups were determined on days 1, 3 and 5 p.i., On day 5 p.i., tissues from liver and spleen were obtained for RT-PCR and WB analysis. To further characterize the role of CYLD, functional assays like inhibition of fibrin production by Warfarin and in vivo IL-6 neutalisation were performed. Finally CYLD was knocked down in WT mice by siRNA to show its importance in listeriosis. Results and Discussion: Whereas all WT mice succumbed to the infection up to day 7 p.i., CYLD -/mice survived the infection indicating that CYLD inhibits protective host responses. A macroscopic examination revealed that WT mice suffered from multi-organ bleeding and succumbed to liver failure as shown by increased AST and ALT levels compared to the CYLD -/mice. In contrast, the bacterial burden was only partially increased WT mice. Additional WB analysis showed an increased activation of NF-B and MAPK as well as an increased production of protective IL-6 and IFN in CYLD -/mice. Importantly, CYLD -/mice had increased fibrin deposition in the liver and upon inhibition of fibrin production by warfarin CYLD -/mice succumbed to listeriosis indicating that (i) CLYD inhibits fibrin production via inhibition of PAI-1 and (i) illustrating the importance of fibrin in limiting the spread of listeriosis. In good agreement, IL-6 stimulation of CYLD -/hepatocytes resulted in a stronger activation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 and fibrinogen production as compared to WT hepatocytes in CLYD -/hepatocytes upon IL-6 stimulation. Neutralization of IL-6 abolished the protective effect of CYLD-deficiency and resulted in multi-organ bleeding in CYLD -/mice. Conclusion: Absence of CYLD is essential for survival during murine listeriosis. Our observation that neutralisation of CYLD in WT mice by siRNA partially protected WT mice from lethal listerioses identifies CYLD as a potential therapeutic target in listerioisis. The complement system directs immune effector functions and modulates the intensity of innate and specific immune responses. It is activated by extracellular pathogens and damaged cells. Almost nothing is known about the role of the complement system in infections with intracellular bacteria.This project demonstrates its important role in C. psittaci lung infection using several complement factor and receptor knock-out (or deficient) mice. Mice were intranasally infected with the non-avian C. psittaci strain DC 15 and sacrificed on days 4, 9, and 21 for detailed analysis. Weight and clinical score were determined daily. Complement activation occurred before symptoms of pneumonia became apparent. Surprisingly, following a phase of partial protection, all complement factor C3 -/mice died until day 17 post infection. Compared to wildtype controls, the mice lacking most complement effector functions were 100 times more susceptible to the intracellular bacteria. During the phase of partial protection of the C3 -/mice until day 9, more granulocytes migrated into their inflamed lungs, proinflammatory cytokines were more elevated, Th1polarization seemed to be even stronger. The bacterial load in the lung of the knock-out mice was significantly decreased, they lost less weight and their clinical score was better. Experiments on additional knock-mice are performed to identify the responsible complement effector function downstream of C3. In summary: Our data indicate that C3-effector functions are harmful early in C. psittaci infection; increased Chlamydia uptake mediated by C3b might be the reason for that. However, later in infection, when specific immunity becomes essential for defence, complement activation seems to be necessary for the fine-tuning of an otherwise deleterious immune response. Our data show for the first time the strong influence of complement activation on the outcome of an infection with intracellular bacteria. The D-value was analyzed in CASO bouillon and reconstituted infant formula, both were inoculated with C. sakazakii (DSM 4485) in a concentration about 10 7 cfu/ml and inoculated at 58°C. Samples were taken every two minutes. The bacteria count was determined by the cast plate method on CASO agar.For optical detection of biofilm formation, cellulose and polypropylene filter were inoculated with C. sakazakii and exposed to dry conditions. The filter material was fixed in 4% Glutaraldehyde and then dried in ethanol and in a critical point dryer. The pictures were made by a scanning electron micrograph LEO Stereoscan 420. An agar diffusion test and a qualitative suspension test were made to test the effect of acids and bases to C. sakazakii. Sodium hydroxide and nitric acid were used in different concentrations (2 %, 2.5 %, 3 %, 4 %, 5 %, 10 %). The bacteria count was determined by cast plate method on CASO agar with an inactivator. The pgk gene was cloned using pQE30expression system (Qiagen) and the expressed recombinant His-tagged protein was purified by affinitychromatography. Plasminogen binding was analysed using Western blot overlay, dot spot analyses and spot membranes representing the amino acid sequence of PGK by overlapping peptides of 16 amino acids each immobilized on a membrane. Localization of PGK on the pneumococcal surface was performed by immune electron microscopy. Binding kinetic parameters of plasminogen-PGK interaction was determined by surface plasmon resonance. Results: In plasminogen binding analyses, PGK of Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as plasminogen-binding protein. Electron microscopic studies using PGK-specific antibodies visualized its localization on the pneumococcal surface of both encapsulated and non capsulated strains. Protein overlay analyses demonstrated that PGK binds to angiostatin. The dissociation constants for PGK-plasminogen interaction revealed a kD within the nanomolar range. Peptide spot array indicated the presence of two plasminogen/angiostatin binding sites located within the Nterminal PGK fragment and detected lysines 14/15 and arginines 53 as crucial for plasminogen interactions. Protein structure of the pneumococcal PGK was determined by crystal structure analysis performed at the CSIC in Madrid and confirmed localization of these amino acids on the PGK molecule surface. Discussion: Pneumococcal glycolytic enzymes provide a group of multifunctional proteins displayed on the bacterial surface and binding to plasminogen. Interestingly, the amino acid sequences, which are crucial for plasminogen binding seem to vary with respect to localization within the glycolytic proteins and with respect to charge properties required for specific interaction. Since PGK binds preferentially to the N-terminal kringle domains of plasminogen, the interaction between pneumococcal PGK and angiostatin displays a new mode of interaction.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) colonize the human mucosal respiratory epithelium and are able to cause severe local infections such as otitis media and life-threatening diseases including community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis. Pneumococci have evolved sophisticated strategies to encounter its host and produce a wide variety of virulence factors contributing to the pathogenicity. The pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a major virulence factor and adhesin interacting with the complement regulator Factor H and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) of respiratory mucosal epithelial cells. The human specific PspC-pIgR interaction mediates pneumococcal adherence to and invasion of host cells. However, the mechanism of pneumococcal endocytosis via the PspC-hpIgR interaction is not known. Here, we demonstrated that PspC-mediated endocytosis requires clathrin coated vesicle formation, which is regulated by dynamin, and visualized the subsequent endosomal trafficking of pneumococci upon ingestions by host cells. Pretreatment of epithelial cells with dynasore, which is a potent inhibitor of dynamin, reduced pneumococcal uptake up to 60% compared to untreated cells. Similar, the knock-down of dynamin by shRNA also impaired pneumococcal internalization suggesting that pneumococcal uptake requires functional dynamin. Pneumococcal internalization was also reduced significantly by inhibiting clathrin with chlorpromazine and clathrin shRNA, indicative of the important role of the clathrin machinery for pneumococcal internalization by pIgR expressing host epithelial cells. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed to elucidate the endocytic pathway of pneumococci. Thirty minutes post infection pneumococci were co-localized with clathrin and 1 hour post infection pneumococcal trafficking was visualized to the various endosomal compartments including early, recycling and late endosomes by using GFPlabeled Rab proteins. In conclusion, the results suggest that pneumococci are internalized via the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and then sorted into different endosomal compartments of the epithelial host cells. However, the intracellular fate after reaching the phago-lysosomes is still a matter of debate. To characterize the binding of OppA to host cell structures, OppA mutants were generated with mutations of the Walker A and B motif of the ATPase domain and regions, which are conserved in OppA proteins of other species. The attachment of the histidine-tagged mutants to extracellular matrix (ECM) components was analyzed in microplate format and compared to their adherence to HeLa cells in the presence of increasing amounts of ECM components as competitors. Results: Wild type OppA was shown to bind to sulfated components, like heparin, fucoidan and dextran sulfate, as well as to plasminogen, plasmin and laminin. No binding was observed to mucin. By the addition of plasminogen (1.2 μM) adhesion of OppA to HeLa cells was reduced to 45 %. In the presence of fucoidan (5 μM) or dextran sulfate (0.2μM) adhesion was nearly abolished (6%). Interestingly, mutation of the Walker A motif as well as deletion of the entire ATPase domain lead to a twofold enhanced binding to sulfated ECM structures, like heparin and dextran sulfate. Deletion of CS1, an N-terminal region which is conserved in bacterial OppA proteins, resulted in a reduced binding of this OppA mutant to dextran sulfate (to 38 %) and heparin (17%) demonstrating that this region is involved in binding to sulfated components which are abundant in human endometrium.

Friedrich 1 1 University Medical Center Groningen, Medical Microbiology, Groningen, Niederlande Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasing health problem in both hospital and community settings worldwide. MRSA are characterized by the carriage of diverse Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements, conferring resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. To date, ten major SCCmec types were described on the basis of the combination of ccr and mec complexes. Although, several PCR-based procedures were designed for typing the SCCmec cassettes, they were often found to be limited in their ability to characterize MRSA isolates. The goal of our study was to compare the SCCmec typing results produced by well-established multiplex-PCR protocol with those obtained by a microarray-based assay. Methods: Two hundred-six non-repetitive MRSA isolates were obtained from the collection previously characterized by spa typing, Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Fingerprinting (MLVF). All isolates were subjected to SCCmec-typing using a multiplex-PCR protocol described by Kondo et al., (Kondo et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 51:264-74, 2007) . Microarrays (StaphyType by Alere Technologies GmbH, Jena, Germany) were implemented in 117 selected MRSA isolates. Results: Using the multiplex-PCR protocol, 179 MRSA isolates were typeable whereas from 27 MRSA isolates, the SCCmec type could not be determined. The most prevalent SCCmec type was SCCmec type IV (n=108), followed by SCCmec type V (n=36), SCCmec type I (n=20), SCCmec type II (n=8), SCCmec type III (n=4), SCCmec type VI (n=2) and SCCmec type VIII (n=1). We further analyzed by the microarray-based approach all MRSA isolates of SSCmec types I-III,VI and VIII as well as all non-typeable MRSA isolates. Based on MLVA, MLVF and spa typing characteristics, representatives of the most prevalent SCCmec types, IV and V (n=30 and n=25, respectively), were selected for microarrays characterization. For all isolates typeable by the multiplex-PCR method, there was perfect agreement of the results between the two methods tested. Among 27 isolates non-typeable by multiplex-PCR approaches almost all (n=26) were typeable by microarrays. Among them the SCCmec type V was the most prevalent (n=21), followed by SCCmec type IV (n=4), and SCCmec type I (n=1). A single MRSA was non-typeable based on the microarrays results. Conclusions: The microarray approach appeared to be more efficient than the PCR-based protocol in identification of SCCmec types among genetically diverse MRSA isolates. Moreover, the microarray-based method is an inexpensive and fast procedure, and can be easily implemented for investigations in routine clinical laboratories. North branch, Korea, Republik Introduction: Rotavirus is the major cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children. Rotaviruses, belonging to a genus of doublestranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae, infect the mature villus epithelial cells of the small intestine, often leading to fever, vomiting, and diarrhea in children. Methods: A total of 5,872 stool specimens collected from patient with acute gastroenteritis in northern Gyeonggi province of Korea during 3 years surveilence (August 2007 through July 2010) were analyzed by using antigen-capture enzyme-linkes immunosorbent assay(ELISA) and RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Results: Of the 5,872 specimens, rotavirus were selected 347 specimens as rotavirus-positive specimens by means of antigen-capture enzyme-linkes immunosorbent assay(ELISA Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci, GBS) is a common commensal of the female urogenital tract and is well known for causing life-threatening infections in neonates. For several years now increasing infection rates of immunocompromized adult patients have been reported In rare cases an infection in neonates, pregnant women and immunocompromized elderly patients can lead to a toxic shock syndrome with necrotizing fasciitis. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a highly invasive bacterial infection with a mortality rate ranging between 30-70%. It is typically caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and mutations of a general virulence regulator (cov) have been reported in association with STSS cases. To investigate if similar mutations are found in S. agalactiae strains or if a certain clone is responsible for this uncommon course of S. agalactiae infections, we performed a detailed molecular analysis and DNA sequencing of the cov virulence regulator genes in a collection of 30 S. agalactiae STSS strains. The strains originated from 28 adults and 2 children and were collected in the US, Germany and Switzerland. Molecular typing was performed by multi locus sequence typing (MLST), capsular typing, and surface protein determination by PCR. For analysis of the cov gene locus the genes covS and covR were amplified by PCR and subjected to DNA sequencing. Molecular subtyping by MLST showed that 7 of the 30 S. agalactiae STSS strains were ST1 and capsular serotype type V and 5 belonged to ST23 and capsular serotype Ia. The rest of the strains harbored different common MLST types. Genetic analysis showed a 1 bp deletion leading to a frame shift in covS in one of the strains. The two component cov regulator represses hemolysis and the mutation was associated with an increased hemolysis and pigmentation in the mutated strain. Another strain harbored a 3 bp deletion that had previously been reported. The rest of the strains had cov alleles matching the genes sequence of completely sequenced S. agalactiae strains in the Genbank database or were harboring silent mutations. In conclusion virulence regulator gene mutations in strains causing streptococcal toxic shock syndrome as they have been described for S. pyogenes can also be found in S. agalactiae. A detailed molecular epidemiologic characterization of STSS S. agalactiae strains by MLST, capsular typing and surface protein determination showed them to be heterogenous, despite a certain predominance of ST1 and ST23 strains.
