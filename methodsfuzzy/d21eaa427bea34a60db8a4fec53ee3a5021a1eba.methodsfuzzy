Young adult (6-8 weeks) and middle aged (8-9 months) male and female C57BL/6J were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were aged in house to 18-24 months old or purchased from the National Institute of Ageing NIA. Throughout the text "young" or "young adult" refers to 6-8 week old mice and "aged/old" refers to 18-24 month old mice. Groups of 5 to 8 mice were used for each test group/condition. Ethics Statement: All experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, 1996). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UMASS Medical School approved the animal protocol used in this study. monitored daily after H1N1 infection for survival and weight loss. Mice were bled periodically to monitor antibody production using standard facial vein bleeding protocols. Mice were sacrificed for ethical considerations when they lost >20% of their original body weight as stated in our approved protocol. For euthanasia, asphyxiation through CO 2 was used and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. No unexpected deaths were observed during the infections. Weight loss charts show the average weight loss for 5 to 8 animals +/-standard error.
