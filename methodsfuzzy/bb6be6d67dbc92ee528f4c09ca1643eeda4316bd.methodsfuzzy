Viral RNA was extracted at the participating national laboratories (NIC/IPC, NIPH and AFRIMS) using commercial extraction kits (e.g. MagNa Pure LC, Qiagen Viral RNA mini kits) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was amplified using real-time RT-PCR to detect influenza A and B viruses using standard protocols. Influenza A virus subtypes H1, H1pdm, H3 and H5 were detected using subtype-specific real-time RT-PCR assays. All samples that tested positive for influenza were sent to the NIC for confirmation and further characterization. At the NIC's lab, viral RNA was extracted from 140 mL of virus transport medium containing the nasopharyngeal swab by using the MagNa Pure LC system (Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Seasonal influenza viruses (A/H3N2, A/ H1N1 and influenza B virus) were detected and subtyped by a multiplexed conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described previously [12] . The detection of A/H1N1pdm09 viruses was performed by using a one-step realtime RT-PCR according to the CDC protocol for detection and characterization of influenza A 2009 H1N1, with the use of a 96well format IQ5 instrument (BioRad). Primer and probe reagents, reaction master-mix, and cycling parameters were used as described in the protocol [17] . The H5N1 virus was detected by a one-step real-time RT-PCR developed by the laboratory at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Tokyo, Japan, and recommended by WHO as the protocol for laboratory procedures to detect avian influenza A H5N1 virus in specimens from suspected human cases [18] . All of the influenza strains described in this study were isolated at the IPC laboratory by inoculation of the specimens that tested positive by molecular methods onto Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a biosafety level 2+ laboratory for seasonal influenza viruses and in a biosafety level 3 laboratory for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (until 2010, only) and for highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus. In brief, two hundred microlitres of each specimen was inoculated into MDCK cells, with 2 ml per well of maintenance medium containing TPCK trypsin (except for H5N1 virus) at a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml, in a 6-well plate. The plates were incubated at 35uC in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 1 week to assess cytopathic effects. The influenza isolates were characterized by a hemagglutination inhibition assay using reference antigens and anti-sera kindly provided by the WHO Collaborating Center (WHOCC) for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. A representative number of influenza isolates collected by the various surveillance and eventbased systems were sent each year to the WHOCC in Melbourne for confirmation and further analysis (Table 1) .
