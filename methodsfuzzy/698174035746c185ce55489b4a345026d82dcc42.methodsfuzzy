Six week-old Dutch Landrace pigs were purchased from a high health status herd, which was shown to be negative for PRRSV and other major porcine respiratory diseases, including enzootic pneumonia, swine pleuropneumonia and porcine circovirus-associated diseases. This herd did not show any enzootic episode of acute disease due to S. suis for at least the last three years. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines and policies of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and specifically approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Montreal (certificate number RECH-1570).
