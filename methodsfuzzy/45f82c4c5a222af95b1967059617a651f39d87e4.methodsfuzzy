We carried out an electronic search in Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science, using the keywords "laboratory" OR "platelets" AND "coronavirus 2019" OR "COVID-19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "SARS-CoV-2", between 2019 and present time (i.e., March 6, 2020), without language restriction. The title, abstract and full text of all documents identified using these search criteria were screened independently by two investigators (GL and BMH), and all documents reporting information on platelet count (either the value or the rate of thrombocytopenia) in COVID-19 patients with a clinically validated definition of severe disease were finally included in our meta-analysis. The reference list of all identified documents was scrutinized, with the aim of identifying additional potentially eligible studies. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe COVID-19. Subgroup analysis was performed based on study definition of severity. The statistical analysis was performed with MetaXL, software Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia). When unavailable, mean and standard deviation of platelet count were extrapolated from sample size, median and interquartile range (IQR), according to Hozo et al [10] . The study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and with the term of local legislation.
