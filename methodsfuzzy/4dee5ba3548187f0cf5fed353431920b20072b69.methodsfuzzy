Gentian violet (GV) and dyeing of cotton cloth Gentian violet (hexamethyl-pararosaniline chloride; GV) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan). GV and CuCl 2 stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 4 mg/ml (0.4%) in distilled water. This triphenylmethane dye is widely used as a stain, and as a dye for silk, cotton, and leather (GV color index [CI], 42555). Therefore, simple common procedures were used for dyeing the cloth. Briefly, washed 20-mm-square pieces of cotton cloth were boiled in 3% tannic acid for 10 min, cooled, and then dyed in 0.005-0.001% GV heated to 100°C. After vigorous washing with soap and hot water, they were color-fixed in 0.01% CuCl 2 (or other metallic mordants). Bacterial susceptibility tests and bactericidal activity tests MRSA (strain ATCC29213), VRE (Enterococcus faecium strain ATCC51559), MDPR (a clinical isolate of Fukuoka University Hospital strain FP1), and strain ATCC27853 as a standard strain of P. aeruginosa were used. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MICs of GV and metals were determined by the agar dilution of brain heart infusion (BHI) agar, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) method, and expressed as percentages (%) instead of micrograms per milliliter. Bactericidal activities of the dyed cloth against MRSA, VRE, and MDRP were determined on cotton cloths treated with tannic acid only, CuCl 2 only, GV alone, and a combination of GV and CuCl 2 . Samples of 50 l, of about 10 6 colony forming units (cfu)/ml, of MRSA, VRE, or MDRP in BHI broth were dropped on triplicate sample cloths, and they were kept in enough moisture to exclude drying effects at 37°C. After 18 h of incubation, a piece of cloth was put into 5 ml of BHI broth in a 50-ml tube and shaken vigorously with a vortex mixer to release bacteria. Bacterial suspensions were diluted with BHI broth and plated on BHI agar to determine cfu/ml.
