Participants were 314 trainees. The evaluation was conducted in two parts. The first consisted of a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test with each item worth two points. The items were chosen according to the core knowledge required, as indicated by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA). The second part involved six 10-min stations objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Standardized patients (SPs) were used in four stations including internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. Two stations concerned clinical skills performance such as endotracheal tube intubation and infection-protective clothing. The evaluation was held in the last month of the training program the Group PGY trainees accepted mentioned as below. All of the 314 trainees participated in the MCQ exam. They were divided into four groups according to their training program. Group R2 contained 156 2nd-year residents enrolled in a 6month PGY training program. Groups R1a and R1b contained 61 and 49 1st-year residents, respectively who were also enrolled in a 6-month PGY training program. According to the TJCHA's policy, the 61 R1a residents were enrolled in the PGY training program from July to December 2011 and then continued onto their 1st-year resident training program. The 49 R1b residents proceeded with their resident training program and then enrolled in the PGY training program from January to June 2012. Group PGY consisted of 48 general residents who had just completed their internship training and then enrolled in a 1year PGY training program from July 2011 to June 2012. In Groups R2, R1a, and R1b, the residents chose their specialization for residency prior to enrolling in the PGY training program. The trainees of Group PGY had not decided on their specialization for a residency at the time the study was conducted. In the second part, 24 residents from each group (n ¼ 96) chosen randomized participated in the OSCE. The criteria for passing or failing each station were determined by the Angoff method. The results of every checklist were divided into three possible scores, not completed (score of 0), partially completed (score of 1), and fully completed (score of 2). The final score obtained at each station was determined by using the following equation: (Score obtained/maximum obtainable score) Â 100. The mean score was then calculated across all stations. All the raters were qualified by the Taiwan Association of Medical Education after completing the rater training program. The item difficulty index and the item discrimination index of the MCQ test were analyzed after the assessment. The trainees were scored by arrangement, taking the upper and lower quartiles, and then categorized into high-and lowgrade groups with respect to the correct rate for each item as percentage in high (PH) or percentage in low (PL). The item difficulty index was calculated as (PH þ PL)/2 and the item b i o m e d i c a l j o u r n a l 3 8 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 5 4 4 e5 4 9 discrimination index as (PHÀPL). An unpaired t-test, ANCOVA, and Pearson correlations were used to analyze the data via SPSS Version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value below 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
