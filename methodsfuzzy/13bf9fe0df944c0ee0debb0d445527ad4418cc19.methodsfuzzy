Cells were stained with HE-Fc/anti-IgG complex 386 for 1 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Antifade-Gold 387 with DAPI (Invitrogen). Cell were imaged using a Nikon TE300 fluorescent microscope. 388 For flow cytometry, cells were seeded onto non-adherent cell culture dishes and left 389 overnight at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
