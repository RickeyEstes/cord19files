This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccination regimens against H7N9 Influenza as shown in Table  2 . A vaccination regimen with the VRC-FLUDNA071-00-VP (H7 DNA) vaccine administered alone or concurrently in different arms with inactivated A/Shanghai/2/2013(H7N9) (MIV) as a prime followed by MIV boost will be compared to MIV-MIV prime-boost with a 16 week boost interval for all schedules. The primary hypothesis is that all vaccination regimens will be safe for human administration. A secondary hypothesis is that the DNA-MIV regimen will elicit a greater frequency and/or magnitude of antibody responses against H7 than the MIV-MIV regimen. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy adults of the investigational vaccines' regimens. Secondary objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the vaccination regimens. The study will be conducted by the VRC Clinic, NIAID, at a single site at the NIH Clinical Center. The visit schedule is shown in Appendix III. The expected duration of time on study per subject is approximately 28 weeks. H7N9 MIV injections are 45 mcg administered as 0.75 mL IM by needle/syringe. Prime injections in Group 2 will be administered in different arms. *Up to 6 subjects over target enrollment are permitted in the study. Randomizations will be stratified by age; up to 9 subjects ages 51-60 years will be enrolled.
