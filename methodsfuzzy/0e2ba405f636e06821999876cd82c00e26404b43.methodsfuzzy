Virus genome sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=439488) or Genbank (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). The data set (given in Table 1 ) was that of Lauber et al. [21] , to which novel or recently described genome sequences (retrieved in NCBI of GenBank) were added purposely. Additionally, the putative and unpublished Palaemon nidovirus and Western flower thrips nidovirus, and the proposed Botrylloides leachii nidovirus [23] , were identified in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) runs SRR5658389, SRR492945 and SRR2729873, respectively, and the virus sequences were assembled, curated and annotated as described elsewhere [24, 25] . The resulting sequences are available upon request to H.D. The conserved Nidovirales C-terminus RdRp core was used to build phylogenetic trees based on MAFFT v7.427 multiple sequence alignment with BLOSUM62 scoring matrix and G-INSi iterative refinement method. The alignments were used as input for maximum likelihood trees generated with the FasTtree v2.1.5 software (best-fit model = JTT-Jones-Taylor-Thorton with single rate of evolution for each site = CAT). Local support values were computed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH) with 1,000 replicates. Structural alignment of reference or retrieved Mtases were done using EXPRESSO [26] and proofed with Chimera [27] . N7-Mtases reference motifs were inferred and defined based on visual inspection and analysis of the structures. The subsequent motifs were used as orthogonal validation and not used for the search. Sequences were analyzed using HHblits and HHpred tools of the BioInformatics tookit ( [28] ). When available, authentic cleavage sites were used to predict protein gene products of the Orf1ab, Orf1a, and Orf1b polyproteins. The boundaries were otherwise approximately (+/-10 aa) determined using structural homologies detected using HHPred, except for the N-term boundary of the Orf1b gene product: In Nidovirales, the absence of any structural data nor homology (outside the order) on the N-terminus of the RdRp gene (nsp9 Arteriviridae, nsp12 in Coronaviridae), which was used for phylogenic analysis, precludes precise sequence homology search in this limited area comprised between the nsp10 and nsp12 proteins (Coronavirus gene-product naming). Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated using Muscle in SeaView [29] . For each sequence of unknown structure, secondary structures were predicted using Predict Protein [30] . The predicted secondary structures were used to validate the alignment with structural references. The MSA was rendered using ESPript 3.0 [31] , together with appropriate structural models as indicated, to assign secondary structures. When possible, structural 3D models were generated using Phyre 2.0 [32] . Conserved patches of amino-acids were generated using WebLogo [33] and mapped in the structural models rendered in Chimera.
