Pseudovirus VSV-MERS/GFP, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype, integrated with the GFP gene and coated with the spike protein of MERS-CoV was used in the neutralization test [8] . The infectivity of VSV-MERS/GFP was detected based on GFP expression observed using fluorescence microscopy. GFP-expressing cells in photographic images were counted using VH analyzer. The VSV-MERS/GFP titers were then expressed as focus forming units (FFU) per ml. Cell culture 293T and Vero cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin at 37°C [8] . 293T cells were used to prepare VSV-MERS/GFP and MERS-CoV recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) for the cELISA antigen. Vero cells were used for neutralization tests by live MERS-CoV and VSV-MERS/GFP, respectively.
