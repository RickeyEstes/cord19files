Through personal and phone interviews we contacted employees at business facility in Saudi Arabia who may have had contact with Patient #1 during the incubation period; we investigated the places he visited, presence or absence of MERS symptoms in the individuals he contacted, history of visiting medical facilities in the Middle East, and history of consuming camel milk or meat, among other things. The patient's specific activities in Saudi Arabia were verified with the help of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health. Additionally, the timing of symptom occurrence and the initial symptoms were reevaluated by confirming the history of visiting domestic medical facilities after arrival in Korea via personal interviews with the patient and his guardians and examining his medical records. The KCDC performed a diagnostic serum antibody test for MERS for individuals whose contact with Patient #1 was confirmed by personal interviews or closed-circuit television (CCTV) reviews. This study was conducted as an epidemiological investigation of the MERS outbreak, and thus, additional processes for review and approval by institutional review board were not required on the basis of the Life Ethics and Safety Law Enforcement Rule Item 2 (human subject studies).
