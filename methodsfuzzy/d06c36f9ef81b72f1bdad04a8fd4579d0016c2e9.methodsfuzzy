Mice pBI-CXCL1-rtTA double transgenic mice (developed on the C57BL/6 background) were developed as previously described [21] . In brief, pBI-CXCL1 transgenic mice were generated by the University of California, Irvine transgenic mouse facility through DNA microinjection of fertilized C56BL/6 eggs using the linearized pBI-CXCL1 construct [57] . The five resulting founder transgenic (tg) mice were mated to WT C57BL/6 mice to identify F1 offspring containing the transgene. To generate double transgenic (tg) mice, hemizygous pBI-CXCL1 transgenics were crossed to hemizygous GFAP-rtTA*M2 mice (JAX), resulting in double transgenic mice (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA), single tg (rtTA-GFAP or pBI-CXCL1) or WT. Dox administration to double tg results in elevated CXCL1 transgene expression within astrocytes corresponding with increased CXCL1 protein and neutrophil accumulation whereas Dox treatment of single tg had no effect on CXCL1 expression nor neutrophil accumulation within the CNS [21] .
