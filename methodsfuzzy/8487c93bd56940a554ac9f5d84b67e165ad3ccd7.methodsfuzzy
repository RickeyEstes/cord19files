The cases with the presumptive place of infection in a foreign country (hereafter referred to as imported cases) were extracted from the NESID data from April 1999 to March 2008. Data in 1999 are only available in AprileDecember because of the change of the law in April 1999 and data in 2008 are included until March. Finally nine years data are reviewed. Annual trend of total, imported, and domestic cases of disease containing one or more imported one are recorded and attributable events and causes are investigated with information in the line listing data and relevant epidemiological reports. Incidence rates per 1,000,000 population are calculated using the 2002 census population and imported disease per 1,000,000 outbound travelers are calculated using the 2002 outbound travelers by the Japan National Tourist Organization.
