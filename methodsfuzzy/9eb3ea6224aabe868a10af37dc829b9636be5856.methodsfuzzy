Ethics statement. The use of human PMBC for scientific research was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (METC) of the Erasmus MC (permit number MEC-2015-095). All participants gave informed consent and permission for use of materials to study infectious diseases, no identifying information was published. All work described has been carried out in accordance with the code of ethics of the world medical association (declaration of Helsinki). Animal experiments were conducted in strict compliance with European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 2010/63/EU) and the animal protocol was approved by an independent animal experimentation ethical review committee (Erasmus MC permit number EUR3293). Animal welfare was observed on a daily basis and to minimize animal suffering all animal handling was performed under light anaesthesia using 4% isoflurane in oxygen (mice) or a mixture of 10 mg/kg ketamine and 0,05 mg/kg medetomidine (ferrets and non-human primates). To antagonize the effect of medetomidine, atipamezole was administered after handling. Generation of rMVA-GFP. rMVA-GFP was generated by homologous recombination as described previously 49 . Briefly, MVA clonal isolate F6 1 served as the parental virus for generating rMVA-GFP. Vector plasmid pG06-P11-GFP was used to direct insertion of GFP coding sequences under the transcriptional control of the natural VACV late promotor P11 into the deletion III site in the MVA genome. Virus stocks were generated in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose and reconstituted in a 120 mM NaCl 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Titre of the rMVA-GFP stock was determined by plaque assay on CEF and the construct was validated by PCR, nucleotide sequencing and transgene expression in various cell types. In vitro infections of human PBMC. PBMC were isolated from blood obtained from healthy humans and seeded into 96-wells low-adherent v-bottom plates at 50.000 cells/well. Subsequently, cells were inoculated with rMVA-GFP at incrementing MOI (range MOI 0.01-100, 3-fold titration), for 1 h, washed and incubated for 24 h in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (HI-FBS, Greiner Bio-One), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100U/ml streptomycin (Lonza) and 2mM L-Glutamine (Lonza) (P/S/G) at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were harvested and stained with CD3 APC/Cy7 (BD Pharmingen), CD11c APC (BD Pharmingen), CD14 PerCP/Cy5.5 (BD Pharmingen), CD56 PE (BD Pharmingen), CD20 PE/Cy7 (Becton Dickinson) and HLA-DR PB (Biolegend), in combination with LIVE/DEAD aqua fixable stain (Invitrogen). Cells were analysed on a flow cytometer (FACS Canto II) and the percentage of infected cells (GFP + ) within the respective subsets was determined using FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences).
