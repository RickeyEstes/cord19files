interest is expressed on the external surface of the pathogen). 78, 79 A combination of proteomic and serologic methods to select potential novel vaccine immunogens, called serological proteome analysis, or SERPA, 80, 81 can be used to screen the pathogen proteome for expressed proteins that are recognized by antibodies present in sera obtained from individuals who have recovered from an infection with the pathogen. The proteomic approach to antigen discovery has been applied to identify novel vaccine candidates for a number of human pathogens, including Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Plasmodium falciparum. As in new genomic methods for antigen discovery, having identified a gene encoding a candidate antigen by proteomic methods, it is then necessary to show that an immune response of the desired type can be raised against the protein. In addition, it is necessary to show that immune responses elicited following immunization with the candidate antigen engender some degree of protection. Often, pure protein antigens produced by recombinant methods are not very immunogenic. As such, many of the emerging recombinant vaccines so produced will likely require enhancement of their immunogenicity by means of an adjuvant. their increased representation in the population as a result of HIV infection and therapeutic immunosuppression), desirably immunogenic (including in individuals who may have been previously exposed to the virus from which the vector was derived, e.g., vaccinia or adenovirus), and able to be produced in large quantities and in a stable manner. A limited number of vaccine vector approaches now being pursued are likely to meet these criteria. Should successful approaches emerge, there will likely be interest in applying them for use in vaccines targeting diverse pathogens. Thus, while definition of promising, broadly applicable, vaccine vector approaches may help simplify certain aspects of vaccine regulatory review and manufacture, they may also present challenges to prioritize use for specific applications should administration of a given vaccine vector on one occasion compromise or preclude successful administration at a later time. Nevertheless, the development of novel vaccine vectors is laying essential groundwork for the development of next-generation vaccines. Several novel vaccine vectors currently being studied in preclinical studies and human clinical trials are described below, all of which depend on the delivery and expression of a candidate pathogen-derived gene sequence. In a number of ways, DNA vaccines represent the simplest approach to deliver pathogen-derived genes. Viral vectors similarly serve to deliver pathogen gene sequences to host APCs, either directly or indirectly, but do so in a manner that depends on and takes advantage of the lifecycle and tropism of the virus that is being adapted to express the exogenous pathogen gene products. does not appear to be efficient or site-specific when replicationdefective adenoviruses of the type being developed as vaccine vectors are used. The propensity for chromosomal integration and poor immune response to the virus made AAV a good candidate for gene therapy; cells with an integrated viral genome could deliver a gene product for a long time without the immune system killing the infected cell. Recently, efforts have been made to adapt replicationdefective AAV as a vaccine vector. Although encouraging results have been reported in preclinical studies, phase I studies in humans have demonstrated disappointing immunogenicity. n SuMMARy n The challenges to optimizing the full public health potential of existing vaccines largely relate to programmatic considerations. In contrast, the terrible impact of infectious diseases that cannot now be prevented by vaccines (such as the 'big three' killers of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria) pose direct challenges to the scientific community to develop new generations of vaccines that overcome the largely biological obstacles to control and elimination of these diseases. The nature of the challenges posed by such pathogens necessitates that future vaccine efforts will not simply recapitulate the immune responses engendered by natural infection (as has been the premise of traditional vaccine development efforts), but rather, substantially improve upon them. As the development of vaccines to prevent infections with the so-far refractory pathogens is pursued, improved understanding of the immune response to natural infection, as well as delineation of the reasons why host immune responses fail either to clear incipient infections or prevent future new ones, will be essential. Fortunately, early empiric approaches have now been replaced with hypothesis-driven strategies enabled by improved insight into the functioning of the human immune system, as well as new technologies, including higher-resolution tools to describe and quantitate pathogen-specific immune responses; novel methods for antigen discovery and targeted optimization of immunogenicity; the development of new, mechanism-based adjuvants; and the advent of innovative methods for vaccine vector-mediated antigen delivery. Thus, although the challenges may be vexing, the scientific and technical foundations on which vaccine development efforts rest have never been stronger. n ReFeReNCeS n
