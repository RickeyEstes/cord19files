The annotation and subsequent analysis were mainly performed on the complete genome sequence of Isolate BJ01 (Accession No. AF278488 in Gen-Bank). FGENESV, a program for gene prediction provided by Softberry Inc. (Mount Kisco, USA) through a web-based interface, has been specially modified and trained with parameters for virus (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=gfin dv). Glimmer (Version 2), from TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research), is a program for gene identification with high performance in handling small genomes like bacteria and archaea (23 , 24 ) . ZCURVE-CoV, developed by researchers in Tianjin University, is an approach to recognize ORFs with Z-Curve theory (25 ) . BGFV is a program developed by Beijing Genomics Institute, based on the self-organizing theory (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102048). Fundamental principle of BGFV is the compositional discrepancy between coding and non-coding regions, which is relatively distinctive for simpler species. The prediction have been compared with previous annotations of other isolates for cross-checking. The length threshold for ORFs is the same as that applied by Marra et al. to Isolate Tor2 (5 ). One ORF is postulated to be a protein-coding region, if its translated sequence is longer than 40 amino acids. A unique segment, the leader-mRNA junction (26 ) , should exist upstream to the transcription initiation site, within a distance of 100 nt, except for the R protein (to R, the distance is 131 nt). For nomenclature, most of the previously reported ORFs were designated by their original names (11 ) , while some PUPs got suffixes. "PUP-Int-1" refers to a PUP locating in intergenic region. Especially, those that are first reported in this paper were named with a prefix of "BGI". If an ORF embedded in or overlapped with a known one, the name of the known hosting ORF will be inserted in its name and a sequential number will be attached. BGI-PUP-R-1, for example, stands for the first identified ORF overlapped with the R protein. Physiochemical features, such as MW and pI, were calculated with a program from Dr. Yan Li, Beijing Genomics Institute (personal communication), and the transmembranous domains of proteins were identified by TMHMM (27 ) , while DAS (28 ) provided similar results (figures from DAS are not shown).
