The application of molecular techniques for the detection of microorganisms has arguably revolutionized the diagnosis of infection. These methods represent a rapidly expanding and exciting field, particularly when considering novel and emerging infections. However, testing must be undertaken rationally and appropriately in order to produce meaningful results (Procop, 2007) . Conventional staining may lack sensitivity and specificity to detect and speciate microorganisms. Microbial culture is not viable from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. In comparison, molecular identification of pathogens is rapid with high sensitivity and specificity and can be applied to a variety of histological specimens (Rogers et al., 2009) . Common molecular techniques used include direct hybridization and nucleic acid amplification (often referred to under the umbrella term of polymerase chain reaction -PCR) (Procop, 2007) . In situ hybridization (ISH) uses reporter synthetic DNA probes which hybridize and label specific RNA sequences in target microbes present in the sample. This technique is most useful when type or genus of the microorganism has been elucidated, e.g. to identify the exact species of staphylococcus or yeast. It has been used successfully to detect and accurately differentiate a range of morphologically related organisms such as Legionella spp., filamentous bacteria and fungi in tissue samples (Hayden et al., 2001 (Hayden et al., , 2003 Isotalo et al., 2009) . PCR relies on the detection of unique regions of microbial DNA or RNA following the extraction and amplification of genetic material from specimens, and can be used to diagnose microbial infections from autopsy tissues and surgical specimens. Whilst fresh/frozen tissues provide the best-quality nucleic acids for analysis, DNA and RNA extracted from FFPE samples can be used successfully for PCR testing. A number of specific PCRs have been developed and applied to detect a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites in histopathological specimens (Denison et al., 2011; Surat et al., 2014; Rickerts, 2016; Gebhardt et al., 2015) . Since formalin cross-links proteins and nucleic acids resulting in significant degradation, it is essential to begin processing of specimens as quickly as possible, ensuring that a 10% concentration of formalin is used for fixation, and making certain that fixation times are kept to less than 48 hours (von Ahlfen et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2002.) . Individual PCRs are useful when a particular infecting organism is suspected; in contrast, micro-array and multiplex PCR has the ability to identify a variety of related and unrelated microorganisms simultaneously from a single sample (Fukumoto et al., 2015) . Broader still, although less sensitive, are pan-bacterial and pan-fungal 16S and 18S RNA PCR probes which will detect the presence of any bacterial or fungal RNA. Further analysis and sequencing of any relevant genetic material identified is used to characterize the species. A benefit of investigating samples using PCR analysis is the generation of quantitative data which indicate the microbial burden. This aids interpretation of results, as the presence of an organism does not necessarily mean infection. Indeed, PCR positivity may be misleading if the patient has been exposed to prior antimicrobial agents or where the microorganism persists despite clinical resolution, as is the case with many respiratory viral infections (Lehners et al., 2016) . Although relatively expensive, molecular methods of diagnosis are becoming increasingly routine and available with less restrictive costs. These techniques have a unique role to play in the identification of novel infectious diseases from histological samples, particularly at autopsy, for example, pandemic influenza virus (Shieh et al., 2010) , and will continue to play a key role in the detection of emerging infections and bioterrorist attacks (Hajjeh et al., 2002) . In addition, as technology advances, it is now possible to obtain detailed genetic sequencing information which provides important information relating to microbial transmission, virulence and resistance mechanisms. This is increasingly important in an age of global communities and the advent of unprecedented antimicrobial resistance. However, further studies are still required to answer a more fundamental question, which is whether molecular testing improves patient outcomes, and this is an area for future work. In summary, molecular methods offer the ability to make a rapid and accurate diagnosis of infection of a broad range of potential pathogens. It is vital that these tests are used judiciously and interpreted with care. Whilst modern advances in technique are important, emphasis is also placed upon the ability of the microscopist to interpret suspicious signs from a good H&E stained section. The growing number of patients whose immune status is compromised, or those who can mount only a minimal or inappropriate response to infection, further complicates the picture. This justifies speculative use of special stains, such as those for mycobacteria and fungi on tissue from such patients. It should be remembered, that for a variety of reasons, negative results for the identification of an infectious agent do not exclude its presence. In particular, administration of antibiotics to the patient before a biopsy is often the reason for failure to detect a microorganism in tissue. Fixation 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF).
