The bis-AAF-R110 peptide was purchased from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Both the human coronavirus NL63 strain and the Vero118 cell line were kindly provided by Ron A. Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The HCoV-NL63 strain was isolated from an 8 months old boy suffering from pneumonia . Vero-118 cells are a subclone of Vero-WHO cells (Kuiken et al., 2004) , and are cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Life Technologies, Gent, Belgiumcat no 21980-032) with 10% FBS, 100 IU penicillin/mL and 100 g streptomycin/mL. Cells are split ¼ twice weekly. Anti-ACE-2 IgG and polyclonal goat IgG control were obtained from R&D systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom) (cat no AF933 and AB-108-C), solubilized in DPBS at 0.2 mg/mL and stored at −20 • C until use. After different rounds of optimization the following antiviral protocol was developed: Vero-118 cells in 96-well plate format are infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01, 200 L cell culture, 20,000 cells/well, IMDM 5% FBS medium). Cultures are incubated subsequently for 5 days at 35 • C after which 20 L of the peptide solution (16 M final concentration) is added. Fluorescence is measured after 2 h incubation at 37 • C using parameters for rhodamine fluorescence read-out. For the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) reduction assay an MTS/Phenazine methosulphate (PMS) stock solution (2 mg/mL MTS (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) and 46 g/mL PMS (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) in PBS at pH 6-6.5) was diluted 1/20 in MEM (Life Technologies, Gent, Belgium -cat no 21090-022). Medium was aspirated from wells and 70 L of MTS/PMS solution was added. After 1-2 h incubation at 37 • C absorbance was measured at 498 nm.
