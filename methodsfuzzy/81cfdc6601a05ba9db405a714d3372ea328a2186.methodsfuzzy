Samples were sent in viral transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) for etiological testing within 24 hours of collection. During the 5-year study period, the ResPlex II multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was used from December 2009 through 29 June 2012 to detect viral pathogens, after which it was replaced by in-house viral multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays (Supplementary Materials) [16] . BMT is tailored to the physical, medical, and vocational needs of a recruit. The majority enlist into the main intake types, with standard durations of around 9, 17, and 19 weeks, with a small proportion having a mix of shorter courses (termed "others"). Dropout rates are low, and our study clinic served most of the healthcare needs for recruits at the training center. We were hence able to reanalyze the individual FRI episodes as a cohort study by linking consultation episodes through coded subject identifiers. The first FRI episode (FRI-1) for a given participant served as the point of entry into the study (t 0 ). Individual participants then accumulated follow-up time ( Figure 1A) , with subsequent FRI episodes being the event of interest. Those with no further episodes accumulated follow-up time until their exit date from BMT, while participants with ≥2 episodes contributed additional follow-up intervals after each subsequent episode. Other than subsequent consultation for any FRI episodes, additional definitions for events of interest were episodes positive for any of the respiratory viruses tested and specific groups of etiological agents. We grouped the agents by using broad categories that accommodated changes in testing protocol during the study period while reflecting virus taxonomy: adenoviruses (AdVs)-species B, E, and others for which the type was undetermined; coronaviruses (CoVs)-CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, and other CoVs; enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (ERVs); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); influenza virus (FluV)-influenza A(H3N2) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), influenza A(H1N1) virus, influenza A virus-positive samples for which the subtype was undetermined, and influenza B virus; human parainfluenza virus (hPIV)-types 1-4; and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-RSV-A and RSV-B. The virus categories described above were also our exposures of interest, to investigate whether an FRI episode caused by one virus group conferred relatively greater protection against a subsequent FRI episodes than FRI episodes testing negative for that virus group. In individuals with ≥1 subsequent FRI episode, exposure to prior infections was regarded as cumulative. For instance, for scenario 3 in Figure 1A , with 2 subsequent FRI episodes, hMPV exposure occurred only during interval C, CoV exposure occurred during intervals B and C, and AdV occurred during all 3 intervals. Potential confounders included the year of the surveillance program, participant's age and ethnicity, type of BMT intake, history of smoking and asthma (including childhood asthma), and receipt of influenza vaccine before the FRI episode. Assessment of whether the participant received MIV or TIV was based on self-reported vaccination history up to 1 year prior to the first FRI episode (since antibody titers and vaccine effectiveness could wane thereafter [17] [18] [19] ), supplemented with Singapore Armed Forces records for vaccines received after enlistment. Since FRI episodes are concentrated differentially during a BMT course, we adjusted for this effect using the FRI incidence rate during successive 2-weekly phases after the time of enlistment for that intake type ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Materials). Observation time was split into subintervals if the observation period straddled different BMT phases and was analyzed in a multilevel modeling framework ( Figure 1C ). The framework included random effects terms for the BMT companies that participants belonged to, within which were nested the intervals (delineated by consecutive FRI episodes), within which, in turn, were nested the subintervals straddling BMT phases (levels 4 to 1 for model 2). Models 1 and 3 only had 3 levels. Model 1 omitted the subintervals used to adjust for FRI incidence. Model 3, which stratified subintervals by whether they ended <4 weeks or ≥4 weeks after the initial FRI episode, used only the first FRI episode for each participant (episode BMT phase, wk Figure 1 . A, Scenarios for febrile respiratory illness (FRI; defined as consultations at the primary healthcare clinic in which a temperature ≥37.5°C was detected, plus either cough or sore throat) episodes and intervals in time-to-event analyses. In scenario 1 (no subsequent FRI episode), a participant accumulates follow-up time from the first FRI episode (FRI-1) to the date of exit from basic military training (BMT). In scenario 2, follow-up time accrues between the first (FRI-1) and second (FRI-2) episodes (interval A, level was therefore redundant). Models 2 and 3 adjusted for FRI incidence rates by time from enlistment and, hence, excluded the BMT intake type termed "other" (for which data used to estimate incidence rates were unavailable).
