Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 77 patients admitted to the Uppsala Academic Hospital with an episode of acute respiratory infection. The samples were taken routinely for respiratory virus diagnosis by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 and human respiratory syncytial virus (the respiratory panel kit; cat. nr 3105, Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA, USA; or the Influenza A and B kits; cat. nr 5001 and 5002; Chemicon). For comparison, a nested RT-PCR for influenza A and B was used as previously described (Herrmann et al., 2001) . Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected at the hospital by using a baby feeding tube and an aspiration trap. After suction the feeding tube was rinsed with approximately 2 mL of sterile saline and immediately transported to the lab. Anjuman Hyder, Kåre Bondeson and Björn Herrmann participated in the IFA diagnoses. Fecal samples of 100 mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were collected (Ottenby Bird Observatory, Sweden) and pooled in 11 pools of autumn 2003 and in 24 pools of spring 2004 and stored at −70 • C until RNA extraction.
