Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 13 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, including RSV, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus 1-4, adenovirus, human coronavirus Group 1 (229E, N6L 63) and Group 2 (OC43 and HKU1), rhinovirus, and human bocavirus. Subtyping was performed for RSV-positive samples according to previously published protocols. 19, 20 RSV-positive samples were sequenced using a hemi-nested PCR protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein coding region. 21 Complementary DNA (M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase, USB Corp, Cleveland, OH) was amplified with forward primer GAB (5 -YCAYTTTGAAGTGTTCAACTT-3 ; G gene, 504-524 nt) and reverse primer FV (5 -GTTATGACACTGGTATACCAACC-3 ; F gene, 186-163 nt). The amplification procedure included 2 min at 98 • C, 35 cycles of 98 • C for 30 s, 55 • C for 1 min, and 72 • C for 1 min, followed by 72 • C for 7 min. A hemi-nested PCR was then performed using M13-tagged forward primer GAB and reverse primer F1AB (5 -CAACTCCATTGTTATTTGCC-3 ; F gene, 3-22 nt) and 2.5 L of PCR product with the same protocol as in step 1. Five hundred base pair amplicons were gel-extracted (QIAquick Gel Extraction kit, QIAGEN, Germany) and sequenced (Applied Biosystems 3730XL sequencer). PCR products from some samples were cloned (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) prior to sequencing. RSV-positive community samples during the same respiratory seasons were sequenced to serve as controls.
