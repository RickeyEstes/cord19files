Static analysis with purely cross-sectional data Anderson et al. (2000) DEA-CCR and DEA-BCC 48 hotels/motels in the United States, 1994 (1) average employee annual wage, (2) average price of a room, (3) average price of food and beverage operations, (4) average price of casino operations, (5) average price of hotel operations, (6) average price of other expenses. Total revenues which consist of revenue from rooms, gaming, food and beverage, and other type. (1) Number of hotel rooms, (2) food and beverage capacity, (3) number of employees, (4) total cost of the hotel. (1) Yielding index, (2) (1) Sales, (2) number of guests, (3) nights spent in the hotel. Yang and Luu (2006) DEA-Window analysis 46 international tourist hotels in Taiwan , 1997-2002 (1) Total operating expenses, (2) number of employees, (3) number of guest rooms, (4) total area of catering division. (1) Total operating revenues, (2) average room rate, (3) average production value per employee in the catering division, (4) average production value of the catering division (per 36 square feet). (1) Labor cost. (1) Sales revenue; (2) value added. Note. See Appendix A for an overview of DEA-CCR and BCC models. time employees in a regional hotel sector; (2) total number of guest rooms in a region; (3) total fixed assets in a regional hotel sector. Outputs are often concrete measurements that an organization uses to see if its objectives are met (Hwang & Chang, 2003) . Thus, the analysis includes the following output indicators: (1) total revenue comprised from the revenue generated by room occupancy, food and beverage service, and other sources such as laundry, night clubs, and service fees; (2) average occupancy rate calculated by taking total occupied room-nights as a percentage of total available room nights. Haugland, Myrtveit, and Nygaard (2007) employ two input variables (i.e., number of hotel rooms and number of employees) and two output variables (i.e., sales revenue and occupancy rate) to calculate efficiency scores among 101 Norwegian hotels. More recently, Pulina et al. (2010) employ one input variable (i.e., labor costs) and two output variables (i.e., sales revenue and generated value added) to obtain efficiency scores among 20 Italian hospitality regions. The fact that four out of five variables used in the current study are the same as the parameters used in Haugland et al.'s (2007) article and two out of the three variables considered in Pulina et al.'s (2010) paper are used in this research paper indicates that the input and output measures of the present study are in accordance with recent DEA research in the hotel industry. Table 2 includes the descriptive statistics of all the variables utilized in the DEWA-BCC model.
