Outcome Data. We collected the H5N1 and H7N9 influenza data reported on the Chinese mainland from The climate dataset contained the air temperature, ground surface temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure of all meteorological stations in the reported provinces at the reported dates for each record. There is more than one meteorological station in each province, and the site-level climate datasets were aggregated into the province-level (average for the climate factors), which are able to represent the weather situation in the study areas. Furthermore, several indices were derived from the province-level climate data for further analysis, i.e., the maximum, minimum, and mean value of the air temperature (TEM.mean, TEM.high, and TEM.low), the minimum and mean value of the relative humidity (RHU.mean and RHU.low), the mean value of the ground surface temperature (GST.mean), the pressure (PRS.mean), and the wind speed (WIN.mean) on each reported date. Briefly, the average daily data from each weather station in the province, observed four times on a daily basis (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00), were used after removing outliers. According to province-level climate data, the daily mean data were selected to average total weather stations of each province from January 2003 through December 2013. The monthly mean data were calculated from the daily reports of each province.
