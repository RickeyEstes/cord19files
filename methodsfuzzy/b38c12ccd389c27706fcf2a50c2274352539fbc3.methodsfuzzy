Reagents and solvents used were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. All organic reactions were monitored with the use of thin layer chromatography (TLC) using aluminum sheets silica gel 60 F254 (Merck). Compounds were purified by flash column chromatography using silica gel with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether mixture as the eluting solvent. All 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature on 300, 400 (100 MHz, 13 C) or 500 MHz Bruker spectrometer. The chemical shifts (Î´) are shown in parts per million (ppm). The residual solvent peaks were used as references for the 1 H (chloroform-d: 7.26; dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 : 2.50) and 13 C (chloroform-d: 77.0; dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 : 39.5) NMR spectra. The mass spectra of the compounds were obtained via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization source (LCMS-ESI) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (electron ionization) (HRMS-EI). Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) purified RNA and DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Singapore.
