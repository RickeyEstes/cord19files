Principal components analysis (Jackson and Wiley, 1991) is a projection method to analyze data set and reduce it from high dimensional space to few hidden variables while keeping information on its variability. It and its many expanded methods have been successfully applied to the resolution of some problems (Costa et al., 2009; Du et al., 2006) . Since the patterns in 16-component vectors of genome of an organism can be hard to find in high dimension space, where graphical representation is not available, the possibility of grouping the variability in few variables is an important step to visualize and consequently uncover the information. In Wang et al. (2008) , an effective dimension-reducing approach was introduced for predicting membrane protein types. Here, we reduce 16-dimension vector to 2-dimension by using PCA. Then we give the 2D graphical representation of the patterns of PN compositions and utilize the representation to intuitively observe the evolution patters among different organisms. We now give the simple description of PCA. Assume that the mean of sample Diagonal matrix^is made up of the eigenvalues of S, where^¼ diagðl 1 ; . . . ; l D Þ and l 1 ! Á Á Á ! l D . The principle com- The mean and covariance matrix of Y are 0 and diagonal matrix^, respectively. Now we ignore the components of lesser significance and leave out some important components. Then the final data set will have fewer dimensions than the original. In this paper, the original data set is 16 dimensions. The final data set has only two dimensions by choosing only the first two eigenvectors.
