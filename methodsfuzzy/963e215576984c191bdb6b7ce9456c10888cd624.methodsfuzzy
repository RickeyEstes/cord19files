O 2 flow to the masks was controlled by a calibrated flow meter (Voltek Enterprises, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Gas was sampled continuously from the oropharynx and analyzed for CO 2 (IR1507; Servomex Fairfax, CA) and O 2 (UFO130-2; Teledyne-AI, City of Industry, CA) partial pressures (PCO 2 and PO 2 , respectively). Tidal gas was sampled from the oropharynx by a catheter inserted through a sealed port in the mask, which allowed accurate sampling of end-tidal gases without dilution from the high flows of O 2 . A particle generator, model 8026 (TSI Inc, Shoreview, MN), was used to generate a steady flow of ultrafine (approximately 0.2 m) sodium chloride particles that are easily suspended in air. Particle concentrations were measured with Portacount Plus, model 8020 (version 2003 Rev K; TSI Inc), which is rated for detecting the concentration of particles as small as 0.02 m. 12
