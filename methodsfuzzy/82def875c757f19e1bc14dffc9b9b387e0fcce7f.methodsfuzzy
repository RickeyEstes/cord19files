Whilst some strains of AEEC and C. rodentium clearly have a role as enteric pathogens, there may be an additional effect of the LEE, namely the promotion of persistence of AE organisms in individual animals and in animal populations. The presence of eae, typically in conjunction with approximately 40 other LEE genes, in a substantial proportion of diverse E. coli strains from healthy animals is described above for various host species. Only some of these putative AEEC strains are demonstrably pathogenic, suggesting that the maintenance of the LEE in the wider E. coli population confers a survival advantage. One AEEC strain, the human pathogen EHEC O157:H7, is normally non-pathogenic but persists in a proportion of cattle and sheep (Cray and Moon, 1995; Kudva et al., 1995; Cornick et al., 2000; Wray et al., 2000; Conedera et al., 2001; Cookson et al., 2002a) , pigs and possibly other non-human species. The LEEmediated capacity of E coli O157:H7 to adhere to epithelial cells may play a role in its persistence in animals (Gyles, 1998) . In fact, isogenic eae mutants are less persistent than wild-type E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and sheep Woodward et al., 2003) . When commensal AE organisms colonize the ovine intestinal tract, AE lesion formation sometimes occurs. In seven of 39 experimental lambs, incidental AE lesions were detected in the intestines of clinically normal animals colonized by naturally acquired E. coli O115 and O26 and at least one other AE organism (Wales et al., 2005a) . Similar observations were made in three of six kid goats (Wales et al., 2005b) , and further evidence of AE lesions in the absence of symptoms was reported in turkeys (Guy et al., 2000) and calves Schoonderwoerd et al., 1988) . Together, these findings suggest that the results of interactions of AE bacteria with their hosts may range from overt pathogenicity to LEE-promoted commensal persistence. If it becomes possible to intervene in LEE-host interactions, there may be significant benefits in terms of protection against enteric disease and reduction in the persistence of zoonotic AE pathogens in animals.
