for analysing overall gene expression patterns by generating short sequence tags (10214 bp), each uniquely identifying a transcript, linking these together to produce a long serial molecule that can be cloned and sequenced and then quantifying the number of times a particular tag is observed, this being a measure of the expression level of the corresponding transcript. The necessary software is freely available. Link to Sagenet homepage: http://www. sagenet.org/ sagittal section Section through the median vertical longitudinal plane of an animal. salicylic acid A naturally occuring antiseptic and anti-inflammatory compound (2-hydroxybenzoic acid) found especially in the bark of willow (Salix); the acetylated form is aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The ester, ethyl salicylate, is oil of wintergreen. In plants can act as a hormone and is a second messenger of oxidative stress signalling. It is involved in plant defence responses, senescence and regulation of flowering time. salinosporamide A A potent proteasome inhibitor from the marine bacterium, Salinispora tropica. Currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Gram-negative bacteria that, if invasive, cause enteric fevers (e.g. typhoid, caused by S. typhi), food-poisoning (usually S. typhimurium or S. enteridis, the latter notorious for contamination of poultry), and occasionally septicaemia in non-intestinal tissues. (2) Soluble heat-stable antigens (2502650aa, very variable between isolates) from the surface of Plasmodium falciparum that are responsible for antigenic heterogeneity and are found in sera of some infected individuals. Spliceosome-associated proteins of various sizes (e.g. SAP145, pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF3b 145 kDa subunit, 895aa). (5) SIT4-associating protein SAP155 in S. cerevisiae, a positive regulator of protein phosphatase SIT4. (6) Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP30 (sin3-associated polypeptide p30, 220aa). (7) Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase H (EC 3.1. 3 .48, stomach cancer-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase 1, SAP-1, 1115aa). sapintoxin D Fluorescent, highly potent phorbol ester (12-N-methylanthraniloylphorbol 13-acetate; SAPD) that is a selective activator of protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha.
