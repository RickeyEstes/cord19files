The method developed, to identify critical factors for emerging risks related to dynamics in production chains, was based on a two-stage approach: 1. Identification of the most important critical factors indicating changes in production chains. 2. Linking the selected factors to the occurrence of emerging food safety risks. For this purpose, a comprehensive list of potential critical factors was established based on a literature review (Section 2.1) and their importance evaluated for three cases. The cases consisted of a traditional product versus a relatively novel product on the (0), more (+1) much more (+2). b Substantially declined food safety risk (À2), declined risk (À1), no impact (0), increased risk (+1) substantially increased risk (+2). c Excluding animal feed. Dutch market for the same food chain (Section 2.2). By means of expert elicitation, the critical factors indicating change in a production chain and their subsequent potential food safety implications were evaluated in each of the three cases (Section 2.3).
