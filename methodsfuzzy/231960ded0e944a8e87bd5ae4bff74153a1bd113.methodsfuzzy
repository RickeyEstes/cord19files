Two separate experiments were carried out: experiment I subserved the replication of published data in order to verify the sensitivity of animals and methods used and to characterize neurotoxic effects and systemic toxicity produced by intramuscular (i.m.) administration of AM. In experiment II AM was administered by both the oral and the intramuscular route at various dose levels to test its neurotoxic potential under conditions similar to those intended for clinical use. For both studies healthy, pedigree Beagle dogs (initial age 42 to 50 weeks) were used. The animals underwent antiparasitic therapy and had been vaccinated against rabies, distemper, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, kennel cough, parvovirus and coronavirus. They were housed in pairs in solid-bottom kennels with available indoor and outdoor runs (total area 10 m 2 ). Light was provided during at least 12 hours daily and the room temperature was maintained above 15°C. Certified pelleted standard diet (NAFAG No 9405; Eberle Nafag AG, 9200 Gossau, Switzerland) was given at 350 g per animal daily and tap water was freely available. An injectable solution of AM in peanut oil (80 mg/ml; Kunming Pharmaceuticals Corp., China) was used for intramuscular administration; control animals received sterile peanut oil. For oral administration artemether was administered in gelatin capsules as active substance (a white crystalline powder; Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland); control animals received empty gelatin capsules. 508 Exp Toxic Pathol51 (1999) 6 Experiment I The dose of 20 mg/kg i.m. of AM was selected because it is above the therapeutic dose and it was expected to produce toxicity after prolonged administration. Groups of one control and 3 treated male dogs were dosed for 5 or 30 days (8 dogs in total). The test and control articles were administered once daily in equal volumes of 0.25 ml/kg into gluteal or infraspinous muscles alternating both hind legs and both forelegs. Clinical investigations included observation for mortality, general clinical signs and detailed neurologic examination, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, electrocardiography, clinical laboratory investigations (blood biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis) and pharmacokinetics. For ECG measurements a Cardiovet Cs-6/12 (Schiller-Reomed AG, 8953 Dietikon, Switzerland) six-channel electrocardiograph was used. The dogs were held in right lateral recumbency with forelimbs and hindlimbs perpendicular to the body. Limb leads (Einthoven I, II, Ill), augmented unipolar leads (Goldberger a VR, a VL, a VF) and the thoracic leads (Wilson vI, v2, v3) were used and heart rate (HR), P-wave (P), PQ-interval (PQ), QRS-complex (QRS), QTinterval (QT), were measured over a period of 10 seconds and averaged by an integrated measurement program. In addition, electrocardiographic tracings were visually compared with the pretest pattern of the same dog. As PQ-and QT -intervals vary with heart rate they were adjusted to an RR-Interval of 500 msec, corresponding to a heart rate of 120 using following equations: PQ_500 = PQ -0.023 * (RR -500) and QT_500 = QT -0.084 * (RR -500). For pharmacokinetics about 5 ml of blood was drawn from the antebrachial cephalic or jugular vein into heparinized tubes and immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 12 minutes. The plasma was then immediately transferred to 2 ml polypropylene tubes and stored on dry ice. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid were drawn from the cisterna magna and immediately transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored on dry ice. Samples were kept at -80°C until analysis using a HPLC method (SANDRENAN et al. 1997) . For pathological examination the surviving animals were necropsied 2 hours after the last administration. One moribund dog had to be necropsied prematurely on study day 28. Deep anesthesia was induced by Vetanarcol™ (0.5 ml/kg i.v.) with the addition of 5000 IU heparin and followed by wholebody perfusion with 4 % neutral, phosphate-buffered formalin. A total of 48 different organs and tissues, including brain, optic nerves, peripheral nerves (sciatic and plantar), skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris and all injection sites), and spinal cord were taken from all animals and postfixed in formalin. The specimens were embedded in paraplast, sectioned at nominally 4 to 6 microns, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light-microscope. The brain was sectioned at multiple transverse levels to obtain the brain regions reported as susceptible (BREWER et al. 1994b ). To improve the definition of the brain lesions, special stains were applied on selected duplicate sections: cresyl violet (Nissl stain), binding of lectin RCA-l as a marker for microglia cells and Bodian' s silver stain for neurofilaments and axons combined with luxol fast blue counterstain for myelin sheaths. Additional samples of the cervical (Cl) and thoracic (Tl) spinal cord were postfixed in 5 % glutaraldehyde, impregnated with Dalton's solution, embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned at 1 micron and stained with toluidine blue. All preparations were examined under a light microscope. For this experiment a total of 64 dogs was used. AM was administered once daily for 8 consecutive days to groups of 4 male and 4 female dogs either by the intramuscular or by the oral route. Intramuscular dosages were 0, 20, 40 or 80 mglkg (injection volumes 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mllkg) with the control group receiving 1.0 mllkg of sterile peanut oil. The injection sites were the gluteal and infraspinous muscles. Oral administration was performed about 2 hours after feeding at the daily dosages of 0, 50, 150 or 600 mglkg. Clinical investigations included general clinical signs, detailed neurologic examination, body weight, food consumption, electrocardiography (ECG), and pharmacokinetics, as described with experiment I. For pathological examination, the animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused with formalin as with experiment I. Following perfusion the brain was removed for postfixation. One high-dose, i.m. treated female died spontaneously on day 8. The brain of this animal was removed and fixed by immersion in formalin. Each brain was divided in two parts by a longitudinal-vertical cut about 2 mm left of the midline. The right, larger part was postfixed in formalin and used for paraffin processing. The left, smaller part, was cut in multiple transverse slices about 5 mm thick and postfixed in 5 % glutaraldehyde for optional embedding in epoxy resin which was performed on selected specimens. Tissues embedded in paraffin were sectioned at nominally 4 to 6 microns and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Duplicate brain sections of all i.m. treated animals and of high-dose and control animals treated orally were stained with cresyl violet. In the brain the areas identified in experiment I as highly susceptible were examined to establish the dose-effect relationship: the cerebellar roof nuclei, pontine nuclei, vestibular nuclei and paralemniscal / raphe region. Body weight and food consumption data were compared to the control group by Wilcoxon's two-sample test and tested for increasing or decreasing trends from control up to the respective dose group by Jonckheere's test for ordered alternatives. Electrocardiographic data were analyzed by parametric PC-SAS procedures. Treated groups were compared to the control group by repeated t tests based on the pooled variance estimate. Group means were tested for a linear trend from control to the highest dose group by group number.
