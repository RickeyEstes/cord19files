In order to identify existing interaction databases, a bibliographic search and exploration of grey literature was carried out. The bibliographic search was performed on M E D L I N E u s i n g t h e f o l l o w i n g k e y w o r d s : " d r u g , " "database*," and "interaction*." Subsequently, all the bibliographic citations found in the works obtained were reviewed. The search of grey literature was carried out using general information Internet search engines, using the following search terms: "drug," "database*," and "interaction." Databases detailing interactions with no clinical practice, interactions with food, medicinal plants, or other products, results in languages other than English, French, or Spanish, results contained in systems covering very small localised areas, results containing information regarding only one group of medications, interactions concerning new drugs still in development or drugs which are not readily available for purchase or prescription, and medicines designed for the PDA since they compile their information from more general DIDs. For the databases included in the study which were not freely available, an access licence was obtained or the relevant book or cD was purchased, as appropriate.
