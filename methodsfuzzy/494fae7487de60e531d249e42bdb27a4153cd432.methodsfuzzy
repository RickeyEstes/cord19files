By 2015, CIDARS has leveraged three early warning methods, namely, fixedthreshold detection method (FDM), temporal model, and spatial-temporal model. Among them, FDM and temporal model have been seen extensively applied throughout China, while spatial-temporal model is piloted in only 221 counties/districts. FDM is primarily applicable to category A infectious diseases (as defined in the Chinese Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases), category B diseases that are managed as category A infectious diseases, rare diseases, or diseases drawing strong concerns. When the number of reported cases reaches a fixed value, the system will generate warning signals. In CIDARS, the threshold defined for FDM is 1, i.e., early warning on single case. In CIDARS, this method is applied to 12 diseases, including plague, cholera, etc. (Table 7 .1). MPM is used to detect aberration of disease occurrence by comparing the reported cases in the current observation period to certain percentile in historical data. If the former is higher than the latter, a signal of aberration is indicated. In CIDARS, to account for the weekend effect and the stability of data, the most recent 7-day period is used as the current observation period and the previous 3 years as the historical period. The number of cases (C) in the current observation period is the sum of reported cases within the recent 7 days. The corresponding historical period included, for each of the previous 3 years, the same 7-day period, the two preceding 7-day periods and the two following 7-day periods that resulted in 15 historical 7-day data blocks (C 1 -C 15 ) ( Table 7 .2). We set the percentile (P) of the 15 blocks of historical data as the warning threshold. If the number of cases in the current observation period exceeds the warning threshold (C ! P), the system will generate a warning signal. The method is applied to calculation on a daily basis. The current observation period and historical data block are dynamically moved forward day by day, and the above calculation and determination are repeated.  Note: Assumes that the current year is 2008; C refers to the number of cases in the current observation period (last 7 days); C 1 -C 15 refer to the number of cases in the corresponding historical period for each of the previous 3 years, the same 7-day period, the two preceding 7-day periods and the two following 7-day periods. Users from CDCs at all levels can adjust the early warning method from spatial-temporal models to FDM for specific diseases prioritized by locality, so as to receive signals in a timely fashion after a case is reported.
