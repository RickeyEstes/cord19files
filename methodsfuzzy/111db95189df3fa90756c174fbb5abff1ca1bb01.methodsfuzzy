We compared our method with two other methods, DeNovo [6] and Barman's method [14] , using their datasets. For comparison with DeNovo's SVM model, we tested our SVM model on DeNovo's SLiM testing set, which contains 425 positive and 425 negative PPIs (Supplementary file S12 used in DeNovo's study ST6). While DeNovo's SVM model showed an accuracy of 81.90%, sensitivity of 80.71%, specificity of 83.06%, our SVM model achieved an accuracy of 84.47%, sensitivity of 80.00%, and specificity of 88.94% (Table 7) . Our model showed a slightly lower sensitivity, but showed a higher specificity and accuracy. The dataset used for comparison of our SVM model with DeNovo is available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/VirusHostPPI. In Barman's study [14] three machine learning methods (SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest) were used to predict virus-host PPIs using several features such as domain-domain association in interacting protein pairs and composition of methionine, serine, and valine in viral proteins. In a 5-fold cross validation with virus-host PPIs from VirusMINT [15] , their SVM showed higher sensitivity and F1 score than Naïve Bayes and Random Forest. Thus, we tested our SVM model on the same dataset used in Barman's study, which contains 1035 positive and 1,035 negative interactions between 160 virus proteins of 65 types and 667 human proteins. As shown in Table 8
