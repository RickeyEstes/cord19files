Of the 24 papers, only 2 sought to introduce a priority setting method, while 22 sought to describe and/or evaluate the existing priority setting process. Of the latter, 13 sought to SETTING HEALTHCARE PRIORITIES IN HOSPITALS describe and evaluate the priority setting process, 7 sought only to describe the priority setting process and 2 sought only to evaluate the priority setting process. Thirteen of the evaluation studies employed the ethical framework accountability for reasonableness (AFR) (Daniels 2000) , while one evaluated health technology assessment using an adapted mini-health technology assessment tool and another using no specific framework or tool. The allocation of hospital resources and budgets to departments and service areas within the hospital was examined in 11 of the selected studies, while the remaining 13 specifically examined health technology assessment in hospitals. Of these, three looked at the medicines formulary management process, two looked at acquisition of surgical technology, while the remaining eight looked at the technology acquisition process in general. Most papers (n Â¼ 18) employed case study methodology, while six employed quantitative survey methodology. Two of the 18 case studies were interventional, while the rest were descriptive explanatory, and all were qualitative, with the exception of one mixed method case study.
