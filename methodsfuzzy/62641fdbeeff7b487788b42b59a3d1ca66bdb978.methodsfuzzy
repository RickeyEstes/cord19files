Reagents. 17β -Estradiol (E 2 ), ICI 182,780 (ICI; an ER antagonist), tamoxifen, clomiphene citrate, U18666A, and filipin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma, US). D-erythro-sphingosine (Sph) and C17-d-erythrosphingosine (C17-Sph) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabastar, US). High-affinity (with the strong calcium buffering) Rhod-dextran was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Life technology, US). DMSO (Sigma, US) was used as solvent for tamoxifen and clomiphene citrate, PBS was used for U18666a and high-affinity Rhoddextran, and methanol (Sigma, US) was used for Sph and C17-Sph. Cell and plasmids. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2, Hela cervical carcinoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cell line were obtained from the Cell Resource Center, Peking Union Medical College (licensed from ATCC). HepG2 was maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Gibco Invitrogen, US), Hela and 293 T was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (DMEM-HG; Gibco Invitrogen, US) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco Invitrogen, US) and 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma, US) and 100 μ g/ml streptomycin (sigma, US). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The Ebola (Gueckedou strain) GP, Ebola VP40, VSV GP, WSN HA/NA and pNL4-3-Luc-R − E − vector have been generated as described previously 56, 57 . We deleted the mucin (313-463aa) of Ebola GP by overlap-PCR to reduce the cytotoxicity of Ebola GP. The TPC2-EGFP and LAMP1-BFP expression vector were constructed by inserting TPC2 and LAMP1 to pEGFP-N1 and pBFP-N1 vectors. Expression and purifications of the A and C domains of NPC1. The NPC1 domains A and C were constructed, expressed and purified as previously described 34, 35 . Briefly, Sf9 cells infected with NPC1 domain A (23-252, N70Q/N122Q/N185Q) baculovirus were used to infect Hi-5 cells. After incubation for 96 h at 27 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the medium was concentrated by tangential flow filtration. The concentrated medium was applied to a Ni-NTA column. Fractions containing NPC1-A were pooled, concentrated. The concentrated NPC1-A was then applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The cDNA encoding NPC1 domain C (374-620) was cloned into pET21a vector. The NPC1 domain C was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as an inclusion body and then refolded in vitro using the method previously described 58 . The refolded NPC1-C was then concentrated and purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 PG column (GE Healthcare).
