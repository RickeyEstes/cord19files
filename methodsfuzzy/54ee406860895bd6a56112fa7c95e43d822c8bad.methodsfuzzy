In one study comparing xTAG TM RVP assay with DFA and cell culture, the RVP assay was far more sensitive (98% vs 69%) in a set of 294 NP specimens where 183 were considered positive (Mahony et al., 2007) . The increased detection rate was attributable to increased sensitivity of the RVP test relative to DFA/cell culture and the fact that the assay can detect a broader range of viral targets. Real time PCR is currently the most widely used nucleic acid test in the infectious disease laboratory. While this method can be very sensitive, less labor intensive and relatively fast, it suffers from one critical setback. The multiplexing capability of this technology is limited by the number of fluors available (at most 6 dyes). This requires labs to run multiple assays on multiple instruments to obtain similar results to that obtained with RVP. In addition, data from the multiple runs have to be collated, compiled and analyzed in order to issue a clinical report. In order to evaluate performance against real-time detection, xTAG TM RVP analysis was carried out on sample extracts at the same time real-time analysis was performed. By carrying out parallel analysis, we were able to control for possible variation in sample integrity as well as copy number. Table 3 shows sample data. As can be seen, xTag RVP is comparable to real-time PCR. For samples with Ct values of 35 or less, xTAG TM RVP gave strong signals as well as high signal to noise ratios ( 50:1). Between Ct values of 36 and 40, xTAG TM RVP was able to detect most targets. Beyond Ct values of 40, in a few cases xTAG TM RVP gave low but clear signals above background. However the clinical relevance of such samples is unknown.
