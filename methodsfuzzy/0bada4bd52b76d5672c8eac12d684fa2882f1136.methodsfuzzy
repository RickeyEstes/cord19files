This study was conducted in November 2015 in a 268-bed community hospital medical ward with common hallway bathrooms shared by up to 8 patients. All samples were collected by a trained graduate student in a shared BR without a UVC device and in a shared BR with a permanently installed, wall-mounted automated UVC (254-nm) device (ASEPT.1X; Sanuvox, Saint-Laurent, QC, Canada). The decontamination cycle initiates only after there has been 30 seconds of no motion detected by infrared sensors, after which a UVC cycle will run for 5 minutes. The device is located directly above the door and has an automatic shutoff safety feature that terminates the cycle if the BR door is opened midrun. Both the UVC-treated BR and control BR contain a 6.0 L per flush, wash down toilet (TOTO, Morrow, GA) and have similar room volumes (12.7 and 11.7 m 3 , respectively). Air and surface samples were collected in each BR 5 minutes and 30 seconds after each patient use-a time that accounts for the decontamination cycle and permits comparison of the samples between each BR. A dual-headed SAS 360 bioaerosol sampler (Bioscience International, Rockville, MD) set to collect 150 L of air over 50 seconds was used to permit simultaneous collection of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. The anaerobic Brucella plates (Oxoid, Nepean, ON, Canada) were immediately placed in a candle jar postsampling and subsequently incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 48 hours prior to counting bacterial colonies. The aerobic 5% sheep blood agar plates (Oxoid) were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hours prior to counting. Surface bacteria on the toilet seat and handwashing sink counter were sampled using 65-mm Replicate Organism Detection and Counting (RODAC) Contact Plates (American Precision Plastics, NorthGlenn, CO) containing trypticase soy agar (BD, Mississauga, ON, Canada), with a contact time of 10-12 seconds, and were incubated aerobically at 37°C overnight. Surface sample locations were matched between the 2 bathrooms, with samples taken at random locations on the counter, approximately 1.5 m away from the toilet, and on the top of the toilet seat. We collected a total of 66 air samples (32 aerobic and 34 anaerobic) and 64 surface samples (32 counter and 32 toilet seat). Mean bacterial concentrations were compared between the 2 bathrooms for each of the different sample types using Welch t tests.
