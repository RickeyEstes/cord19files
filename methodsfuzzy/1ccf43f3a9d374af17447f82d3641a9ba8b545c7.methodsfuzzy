Faeces from clinical cases of crv enteritis were obtained from the samples submitted to the diagnostic service of the Canine Infectious Disease Research Unit of Glasgow University Veterinary School. The faecal specimens were diluted 1:10 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7' 2 and the suspensions screened for crv haemagglutinins as previously described (Macartney et al 1984b) . Samples with titres in excess of 1:2048 by the haemagglutination test were then used in the purification experiments.
