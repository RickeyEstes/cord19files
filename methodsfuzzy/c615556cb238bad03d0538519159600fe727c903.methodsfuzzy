Adenylate kinase bactericidal reporter assay. An 853-member FDA-approved drug library was screened against SCV using an AK HTS. AK assays were carried out as previously described with modifications to account for the slower growth of UAMS-1112 (35, 36) . Briefly, 36-h cultures of the stable S. aureus SCV strain, UAMS-1112 (ΔhemB), were grown in MH medium at 37°C at 225 rpm, used to inoculate (1:100 dilution) 500 ml of MH medium, and grown to an optical density (OD 600 ) of 0.2 corresponding to ϳ1 ϫ 10 6 CFU/ml. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm; 10 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of MH medium (ϳ1 ϫ 10 9 CFU/ml). Fifty microliters of this cell solution was added to 48 l of MH medium, and 2 l of each drug from the drug library was added to wells of a white-walled 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC), achieving a concentration of 100 M. A higher screening concentration was used in comparison to previous studies to ensure hit identification against the resilient nature of SCV (35, 36) . Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Afterward 100 l of ToxiLight AK reagent (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. Luminescence was measured using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader. The assay was performed in duplicate. Hits were identified by thresholding luminescent values normalized to the mock-treated growth control with values greater than or equal to the overall mean plus two times the standard deviation. To compensate for increased noise on certain plates, thresholding was applied independently to select plates. Additional hits were selected by removing select plates that had increased noise relative to the overall data. Secondary cell viability assays, in which ϳ1 ϫ 10 5 CFU/ml UAMS-1112 cells were treated with each of the identified hits at 100 M for 48 h and enumerated by plating, distinguished primary assay screening artifacts from validated hits. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. MIC testing was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines (66) . In short, wells of a 96-well plate (Falcon; Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC) were inoculated with ϳ1 ϫ 10 5 CFU/ml of either UAMS-1112, UAMS-1, or USA300 containing serial dilutions of the indicated antimicrobial ranging from 0 to 128 g/ml in MH media. This assay was also performed in the presence of human serum instead of MH media. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial where there was no visible bacterial growth in the wells. For UAMS-1112 and human serum, judging the MIC was difficult due to minimal growth and opaque media, respectively. Because of this, the MIC was defined as compounds that demonstrated a Ն2-log CFU/ml decrease in cell growth inhibition relative to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mock-treated cells. All MICs were confirmed by repeat testing in duplicate. The spontaneous resistance frequencies were determined for daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, rifampin, and gentamicin. Exponential-phase cultures of S. aureus UAMS-1, OD 600 of 0.2, were concentrated to ϳ1 ϫ 10 9 CFU/ml by centrifuging (13.3 ϫ g; 2 min) 1 ml of culture and resuspending in 100 l. The concentrated cell suspensions were then plated on MH agar to determine the starting inoculum, and the plates were supplemented with 2ϫ and 4ϫ the MIC of daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, sitafloxacin, and rifampin. The resistance frequency was determined as the number of resistant colonies divided by the total CFU of the inoculum. Testing was performed in duplicate. Biofilm susceptibility assay. Established biofilms were tested for susceptibility against validated HTS hits and gentamicin as a clinically relevant control, using minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) physiology and genetics (P&G) plates (Innovotech, Edmonton, Canada), which have previously been established with some minor modifications (67) . Briefly, overnight cultures of UAMS-1 were adjusted to ϳ1 ϫ 10 6 CFU/ml in TSB supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) pooled human plasma (Innovative Research, Novi, MI) and added to individual wells of MBEC plates at a volume of 150 l. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with shaking at 110 rpm. After incubation, peg lids were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate containing 200 l of PBS and washed for 1 min with shaking at 110 rpm. Then washed peg lids were transferred to an antimicrobial challenge plate containing 2-fold serial dilutions of 200 l of gentamicin and validated HTS drugs in TSB. The challenged biofilm was incubated for an additional 24 h at 37°C with shaking at 110 rpm. The following day, pegs were washed, transferred to a bacterial recovery plate containing 200 l of TSB, and then sonicated at 50/60 Hz using a Bransonic 220 Ultrasonic Cleaner. Bacterial viability was immediately assessed using 100 l from the recovery plate for enumeration and plating serial dilutions on TSB agar. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also implemented to qualitatively assess the growth of the biofilm at 24 and 48 h. Growth control pegs were broken off, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and gold sputter coated prior to imaging. Gentamicin was compared against each of the validated hits at each tested concentration in a two-way ANOVA with Sidak's test for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant for P Ͻ 0.05. Testing was performed in triplicate. Cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic effects of the validated HTS hits and gentamicin were characterized on HEK 293T cells using the XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2Htetrazolium hydroxide) cell proliferation assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). In short, HEK 293T cells maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PEN-STR), and 1% GlutaMAX were seeded into a 96-well microtiter plate at 1 ϫ 10 4 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight for 18 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Cells were then treated with the HTS validated hits and gentamicin diluted in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PEN-STR, and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, and medium was replaced with DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PEN-STR, and 50 l of XTT/PMS (1:1 ratio with cell media). Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a BioTek Synergy Mx plate reader. Toxicity was represented as percent cell viability relative to mock-treated growth control. Assays were performed in triplicate. Gentamicin was compared against each of the validated hits at each tested concentration in a two-way ANOVA with Sidak's test for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant for P Ͻ 0.05.
