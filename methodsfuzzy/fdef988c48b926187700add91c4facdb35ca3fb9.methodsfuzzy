Virus stock and micro-neutralization assay. Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. The Urbani strain of SARS-CoV was plaque-purified, grown to stock titers in Vero E6 cells, purified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation as described previously [15] , and frozen at À70°C until use. A micro-neutralization assay was performed as previously described [16] . The micro-neutralization titer of test antibody was the highest dilution that showed inhibition in all triplicate wells. Controls were included for each assay performed and included back titration, inclusion of positive control antibody (i.e., serum from a convalescent SARS patient) and an isotype monoclonal antibody control. Data obtained from at least three independent experiments were analyzed. Peptide synthesis. All peptides were synthesized by the Core Laboratory of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Model 433A Peptide Synthesizer by using standard FastMoc chemistry [17] . ELISA. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates were used for ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Briefly, biotinylated peptides (200 ng/well) were added to streptavidin-coated wells and blocked with Blocking Buffer for 1 h at 37°C. After washings with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), primary antibody was added to the wells and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. After removal of unbound antibodies by washing with PBS-T, a goat anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) at 1:5000 dilution was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After washings, tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Pierce) was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 N sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured (Optimax; Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Phage display. Selection of peptides from random peptide phage display libraries (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was described previously [18] . Briefly, 10 10 phages were incubated with individual antibody/protein G mixtures for 20 min at room temperature. After eight washings with 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, the phages were eluted from the complex with 0.1 M HCl for 8 min at room temperature and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The eluted phages were then amplified in the host strain ER2738. After three additional rounds of selection of amplified phages, DNA from each single-phage plaque was sequenced, and the corresponding peptide sequence was then deduced from the DNA sequence. Structural analysis. The structural analysis was performed by using the coordinates of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domains (RBD), i.e., PDB IDs 2DD8, 2AJF, 2GHW and 2GHV [19] [20] [21] [22] . Among these structures, PDB ID 2DD8 has a complete assignment for the C-terminal region of RBD encompassing residues 491-510 for the antibody binding. The structure was visualized and manipulated by using the program PyMOL 0.99rc6 [23] . Statistical analysis. JMP v.5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for analyzing data. Pair-wise comparisons of the means between peptide mutations were performed by using the Student's t-test where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For an overall comparison of means, the Tukey-Kramer HSD test was used. Statistical significance was set at a = 0.05. A positive test value generated between two means is indicative of a significant difference.
