The first question that confronts the investigator faced with a disease of unknown etiology is whether or not it has an infectious etiology? Evidence that suggests an infectious etiology is an acute onset and short duration, clinical similarity to known infectious diseases, a grouping of similar illnesses in time and place, and a history of transmission between individuals presenting with the same clinical picture. For chronic illnesses, the infectious etiology may be much less apparent and a subject for debate. Faced with a disease that appears to be infectious, the next question is whether it is caused by a virus. A classical example that predates modern virology is the etiology of yellow fever. In a set of experiments that would now be prohibited as unethical, the Yellow Fever Commission, working with the US soldiers and other volunteers in Cuba in 1900, found that the blood of a patient with acute disease could transmit the infection to another person by intravenous injection. Furthermore, it was shown that the infectious agent could pass through a bacteria-retaining filter and therefore could be considered a "filterable virus." Virus isolation in cell culture and animals. The first step in identification of a putative virus is to establish a system in which the agent can be propagated. Before the days of cell culture, experimental animals were used for this purpose. Many viruses could be isolated by intracerebral injection of suckling mice, and some viruses that did not infect mice could be transmitted to other experimental animals. Human polioviruses-because of their cellular receptor requirements-were restricted to old world monkeys and great apes; the virus was first isolated in 1908 by intracerebral injection of monkeys and was maintained by monkey-to-monkey passage until 1949 when it was shown to replicate in primary cultures of human fibroblasts. The modern era of virology (beginning about 1950) can be dated to the introduction of cultured cells as the standard method for the isolation, propagation, and quantification of viruses. There are now a vast range of cell culture lines that can be used for the isolation of viruses, and currently this is the first recourse in attempting to isolate a suspected novel virus. Some viruses will replicate in a wide variety of cells but others are more fastidious and it can be hard to predict which cells will support their replication. It is also important to recognize that some viruses will replicate in cell culture without exhibiting a cytopathic effect. An important example is the identification of simian virus 40 (SV40). Poliovirus was usually grown in primary cell cultures obtained from the kidneys of rhesus monkeys, but SV40 had escaped detection because it replicated without causing a cytopathic effect. When poliovirus harvests were tested in similar cultures prepared from African green monkeys, a cytopathic effect (vacuolation) was observed, leading to the discovery of SV40 virus in 1960. Because inactivated poliovirus vaccine produced from 1955 to 1960 had been prepared from virus grown in rhesus monkey cultures, many lots were contaminated with this previously unknown virus, which inadvertently had been administered to humans. Since that time, viral stocks and cell cultures have been screened to exclude SV40 and other potential virus contaminants. A number of methods are available to detect a noncytopathic virus that is growing in cell culture. These include visualization of the virus by electron microscopy, detection of viral antigens by immunological methods such as immunofluorescence or immunocytochemistry, the agglutination of erythrocytes of various animal species by virus bound on the cell surface (hemagglutination), the production of interferon or viral interference, and the detection of viral nucleic acids. Detection of nonreplicating viruses. During the period from 1950 to 1980, there was a concerted effort to identify the causes of acute infections of infants and children. In seeking the etiology of diarrheal diseases of infants, it was hypothesized that-in addition to bacteria, which accounted for less than half of the cases-one or more viruses might be responsible for some cases of infantile diarrhea. Numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to grow viruses from stools of patients with acute diarrhea. It was conjectured that it might be possible to visualize a putative fastidious virus by electron microscopy of concentrated fecal specimens. When patients' convalescent serum was added to filtered and concentrated stool specimens, aggregates of 70 nm virions were observed in stools from some infants with acute gastroenteritis. The ability of convalescent but not acute illness serum to mediate virion aggregation provided a temporal association of the immune response with an acute diarrheal illness. Within 5 years, rotavirus was recognized as the most common cause of diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, accounting for approximately onethird of cases of severe diarrhea requiring hospitalization. Once an emergent virus has been identified, it is necessary to classify it, in order to determine whether it is a known virus, a new member of a recognized virus group, or represents a novel virus taxon. This information provides clues relevant to diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and prevention. In 1967, an outbreak of acute hemorrhagic fever occurred in laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany, who were harvesting kidneys from African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops, formerly Cercopithecus aethiops). In addition, the disease spread to hospital contacts of the index cases, with a total of over 30 cases and 25% mortality. Clinical and epidemiological observations immediately suggested a transmissible agent, but attempts to culture bacteria were unsuccessful. However, the agent was readily passed to guinea pigs which died with an acute illness that resembled hemorrhagic fever. After considerable effort, the agent was adapted to tissue culture and shown to be an RNA virus. When concentrated tissue culture harvests were examined by electron microscopy, it was immediately recognized that this agent differed from known families of RNA viruses, since the virions consisted of very long cylindrical filaments about 70 nm in diameter. This was the discovery of Marburg virus, the first recognized member of the filoviruses, which now include Marburg and Ebola viruses. Some very important human diseases-such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C-are caused by viruses that cannot readily be grown in cell culture. Experiences with these viruses have given credibility to the view that an infectious etiology can be inferred by clinical and epidemiological observations in the absence of a method for growing the causal agent. Also, they have stimulated researchers to devise novel techniques that bypass the requirement for replication in cell culture. Furthermore, the application of molecular biology, beginning about 1970, has led to an array of new methods-such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), deep sequencing, and genomic databases-that can be applied to the search for unknown viruses. Several case histories illustrate the inferences that lead to the hypothesis of a viral etiology, the strategy used to identify the putative causal agent, and the methods exploited by ingenious and tenacious researchers. Sin Nombre virus. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was described above, as an example of an emerging virus disease. The disease was first reported in mid-May, 1993,
