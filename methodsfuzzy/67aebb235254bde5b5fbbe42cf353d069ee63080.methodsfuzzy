Dairy calves fed milk substitutes may be more susceptible to acute undifferentiated diarrhea, some of which may be a result of enteric colibacillosis, compared with those fed cows' whole milk. Extreme heat treatment of the liquid skim milk in the processing of dried skim milk for use as milk substitutes for calves results in denaturation of the whey protein, which interferes with digestibility of the nutrients and causes destruction of any lactoglobulins that are present and may have a protective effect in the young calf. Irregular feeding practices resulting in dietetic diarrhea may contribute to a higher incidence of enteric colibacillosis in calves. The person feeding and caring for the calves is an important factor influencing calf mortality a result of diarrhea. Although it is generally thought that general or specific nutritional deficiencies, such as a lack of energy, protein, or vitamin A, in the maternal diet predispose to colibacillosis, particularly in calves and piglets, there is no direct evidence that specific nutritional deficiencies are risk factors. However, they probably are, at least in indirect ways, for example, by having an effect on the amount of colostrum available at the first milking after parturition in first-calf heifers underfed during pregnancy.
