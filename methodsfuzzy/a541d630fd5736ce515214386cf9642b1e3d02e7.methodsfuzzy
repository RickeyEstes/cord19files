Two electronic databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS), were searched for the 50 most cited articles using the keyword "brucell * ." For the search in Scopus, we selected the "title, abstract, keyword" choice. For the search in WOS, we selected the "topic" and "all database" choices. The search in both databases was performed on January 30, 2017, for papers published in all times. Textbooks were excluded. The most fifty cited papers were identified in both databases. The articles' abstracts were read by the two study investigators (FGB and MHA) to determine whether the articles were specific to brucellosis [20] . We recorded the citation count from the two databases for each selected article. For articles that were among the top fifty articles in one database but not in the other, the citation count in the other database for that article was looked up and recorded. We then ranked the articles according to the highest citation count obtained from any of the two databases. We analyzed the papers according to number of citations, publication year, authors, journal impact factor, country of origin, and article type (basic science, observational study, interventional clinical trial, and review) [21] . Basic science articles included genetic studies [22] , in vitro studies, animal studies, or in vivo studies that focused on physiology [23] . Observational studies included case-control studies, case series, and cohort studies. To classify the article type, two study investigators (FGB and MHA) reviewed all articles independently and in cases of disagreement, they discussed the article until consensus was achieved [21] . The most recent impact factor, year 2015, from Journal Citation report was used for analysis. In cases where the journal has continued as a new title, the impact factor of the new title was used in the analysis [21] .
