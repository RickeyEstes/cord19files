Case history. Outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea occurred in the spring of 1991 on 2 separate but adjacent beef cow-calf ranches in western Nebraska. Clinical aspects of these outbreaks including data on the vaccination schedule with commercially-available vaccines containing BRV strain NCDV-Lincoln have been described elsewhere (Grotelueschen et al., 1992) . The age of the calves at the onset of diarrhea ranged from 3 days to 15 days on ranch 1, and morbidity associated with diarrhea was approximately 80% in calves from heifers and 25% in calves from cows. Mortality records were not available from ranch 1. On ranch 2, 11.6% of the calf crop developed diarrhea at approximately 21 days of age and 25 % of the affected calves died as a result. Fecal samples obtained from calves with diarrhea on each ranch were submitted to the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System for routine laboratory examinations. Rotavirus was the only significant pathogen identified. Reference virus strains. Strain NCDV-Lincoln was obtained from American Type Tissue . After adsorption for 1 h at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and the cell monolayers were washed twice with MEM before adding serum free MEM containing 1 /xg/ml of trypsin, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 /xg/ml of streptomycin. The inoculated cultures were maintained at 37°C and examined daily for cytopathic effect. After 6 days, the cells were frozen and thawed 3 times, and the lysate was passaged onto fresh monolayers 2 more times. The presence of rotavirus was confirmed by staining infected monolayers with fluorescein-conjugated calf anti-BRV antibodies (FITC-Calf anti BRV; National Veterinary Service Laboratory, Ames, IA). Cytopathic BRV isolates, designated Nebraska Scottsbluff 1 (NS-1 ) and NS-2 from ranch 1 and ranch 2 respectively, were plaque purified after the third passage, as previously described (Hoshino et al., 1984) . Virus stock was kept at -20°C until needed. The RNA from each field BRV strain was extracted with phenol-chloroform and their RNA electrophoretic patterns were compared with reference BRV strains after separation on a discontinuous, vertical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (10% resolving, 5% stacking) run in Tris buffer (0.025 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine, 0.1% SDS [pH 8.3] ) at 4°C using a constant current of 30 mA (Biorad Protean II electrophoresis unit, Biorad, Richmond, CA). The electropherotype of each virus individually and after co-electrophoresis with reference BRV strains B641 and B223 was visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Eight-to 10-week old BALB/c ANn mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 106 fluorescent focus units of BRV strain NCDV-Lincoln in equal volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant. Identical booster injections were given 5 weeks later. Three weeks after the last booster injection and 2 days prior to harvest of splenocytes, the mice were immunized intravenously with NCDV-Lincoln diluted in PBS. Mouse splenocytes were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells, and the culture supernatants from hybridomas were screened for the presence of neutralizing antibody against the homologous BRV (Coulson et al., 1985) . After subcloning twice by limiting dilution, ascites tumors were produced as previously described (Galfre et al., 1977) . The VP7 specificity of mAb 142 / 36 was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation (Harlow and Lane, 1988) . mAb B 223-N7, specific for VP7 of BRV strain B223 was provided by Dr. Gerald N. Woode (Zheng et al., 1989) . Guinea pig hyperimmune sera (GPHS) were produced against BRV strains B641 and B223 by repeated immunization of rotavirus-seronegative guinea pigs with gradient purified virus mixed in equal volumes of Freund's complete (first immunization) or incomplete (subsequent boosters) adjuvant. Serological characterization of field BRV. The serological relationship between the BRV field strain NS-1, and reference strains B641, NCDV-Lincoln and B223 was determined using fluorescent focus neutralization assays (FFN; Knowlton et al. 1991 ) with modifications. Briefly, 100/xl of 2-fold dilutions of mAb or heat-inactivated (30 min at 56°C) GPHS was mixed with 100/zl of virus ( 200 TCIDso ) in 96-well culture plates ( 6 wells per dilution) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The virus-antibody mixture then was transferred to fresh MA-104 cell monolayers grown in 96-well culture plates. The plates were centrifuged at 1000 g for 1 h at room temperature. After 20 h of incubation at 37°C in a CO2 atmosphere, the cell monolayers were fixed with 80% acetone in water and stained with FITC-Calf anti BRV (NVSL). The neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of antibody which completely inhibited fluorescence. Northern blot with whole genomic RNA probes. Whole genomic RNA probes of field and reference BRV strains were synthesized and labelled with a-~2P-GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Co., Arlington Heights, IL) by in vitro transcription from purified single-shelled viral cores (Flores et al., 1982) . RNA from each virus was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nylon membranes (Amersham), and fixed by irradiation with ultraviolet light (312 nm) for 10 rain. Northern blot hybridizations were performed as previously described (Hesse et al., 1993) , except that the membranes were prehybridized for 4 h and hybridized for 18h. G-type classification offield BRV. Two primers, complementary to nucleotides 51 to 71 of the minus strand and nucleotides 376 to 391 of the plus strand of the VP7 gene of group A rotavirus (Flores et al., 1991) were synthesized (National Sciences, Plymouth, MN). After denaturation at 80°C for 5 min, purified viral RNA from strains NS-1, B641, NCDV-Lincoln and B223 was used as RNA template and reverse transcribed (RT) into single stranded cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described by the manufacturer (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) using a thermal cycler (GeneAmp TM 9600, Perkin Elmer Cetus). The final volume of the RT mixture was 20/xl [2.5 U//xl reverse transcriptase, 5 mM MgC12, 1 × PCR buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, 1 U//zl RNase inhibitor and 50 pmol of each primer]. Incubation time and temperature for RT were 25 min at 42°C, 5 min at 99°C and 5 min at 4°C. The resulting cDNA was amplified by adding Taq polymerase and the volume of the PCR reaction was adjusted to 100/zl (final concentration: 2 mM MgC12, 1 × PCR buffer and 2.5 U/100/zl Tag polymerase). Amplification consisted of 30 cycles with 40 sec at 94°C for denaturing; 1 min at 42°C for annealing and 2 min at 72°C for extension in each cycle. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (Seaplaque GTG, FMC Rockland, ME) and transferred to nylon membranes by Southern blotting. The PCR amplified cDNA fragments from strains NS-1 and B223 were purified from agarose gel (BIO 101, LA Jolla, CA), and labelled with a-32p-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) using an oligo-labelling kit (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ). Each radioisotope labelled cDNA probe was hybridized with a Southem blot membrane using the same conditions as for Northem blot hybridizations described above.
