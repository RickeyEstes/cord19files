Bacterial based transfection has also been employed by cloning sequences belonging to the pathogenic bacteria E.coli. The modified genes from pathogenic bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes have also been used where the bacteria with its intracytoplasmic capabilities propagate into the host. Likewise, E.coli was modified so that selflysis genes become activated as soon as the bacteria enter the host cell to release the vector into host cytoplasm [70] . Other bacterial methods involve T4SS, a Bartonella sp., for the introduction of single strand DNA into the host cell. Thus, after entry the bacteria releases ssDNA into cytosol and along with the enzyme relaxase or integrase, which is bound to target DNA, starts to replicate to finally produce plasmid DNA as a whole by joining the loose ends present [70] . This mode of transfer is considered to be hazard free and is employed for a variety of cell lines. Further methods of nonviral based gene transfer have been developed for higher efficiency and less toxicity to the cells. As mentioned earlier for efficient transfection the gene has to be integrated into the genome (constitutively) or is continuously expressed in the presence of a specific inducer reagent for the chosen promoter (inducible). Owing to variable results the need remains to develop efficient methods as has been attempted in the form of a dual plasmid approach using the mice myogenic C2C12 cell line. According to this method T-Rex plasmid system is first transfected into the cell line using a lipid based method with an efficiency of 70% and is activated by tetracycline. Thereafter, a modified T-Rex plasmid became available. After 18 days of initial transfection a second plasmid can be introduced with 40% efficiency that permits the study of complex biochemical reactions involving different factors [71] . In Table 4 the various transfection efficiencies of different methods are summarized. Bactofection seems to be an effective mode of transfection in cells without the risk of cytotoxicity as compared to some viral methods but much improvement has to be made for application of bactofection for a wide variety of cell lines.
