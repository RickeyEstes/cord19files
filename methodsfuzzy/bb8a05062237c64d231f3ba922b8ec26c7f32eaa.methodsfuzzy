We included all adults treated with vvECMO for ARDS between January 2012 and April 2017 in a university teaching hospital in Marseille, France. Patients were either cannulated in our ICU or in a referring hospital then transported by the ECMO mobile team. Before considering patients for ECMO, a PP session was systematically performed in our center if feasible, and strongly encouraged for patients from referral centers. Criteria for vvECMO have been previously published. During ECMO, patients were considered for prone position in case of 1 persistent hypoxemia defined by SpO2 < 88% or PaO2 < 55 mmHg despite a 100% FdO2 and FiO2 with a maximal ECMO blood flow, 2 failure of attempt to wean ECMO after at least 10 days of ECMO and the presence of lung consolidations on chest X-ray or ultrasounds echography, 3 according to the physician in charge. Technical issues have been previously described. We compared the prone ECMO group to the ECMO alone group. We performed Kaplan-Meier 90-day survival curves and Coxmodel for 90-day mortality. Results: 169 patients were included in the analysis, 92 in the prone group and 77 in the ECMO alone group. The prone group has a 57.6% 90-day survival rate as compared with a 37.7% 90-day survival rate of the ECMO alone group, p = 0.01. SAPS2 [HR = 1.040 Introduction: Emphasis regarding the importance of early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation led to an improvement in outcome after cardiac arrest (CA). Meanwhile, recent data raised some concerns regarding the benefit of targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 °C for comatose cardiac arrest survivors. This may have resulted in a loss of interest in TTM in these patients, with uncertain consequences on outcome. We use data from the Sudden Death Expertise Center (SDEC) of the Great Paris area to assess the relationship between changes over time in the use of TTM and patients' outcome after adjustment for potential confounders. Patients and methods: We used data prospectively collected in SDEC registry between May 2011 and December 2016. Variables were collected according to Utstein style. All non-traumatic OHCA patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were included in the analysis. We compared patients' characteristics and outcome according to TTM use. We performed a multivariable logistic regression using survival at ICU discharge as the main endpoint. Results: During study period, 3667 patients were retained in the analysis, of whom 1794 received TTM. As compared with controls, patients with TTM were significantly more frequently male and younger + CA occurred more frequently in a public place + a shockable rhythm was more frequent and the proportion of patients with a short noflow (< 3 min) was greater (all P < 0.001). Regarding time trends, gender, age and location of CA did not change according to the year of inclusion in the registry. Bystander CPR increased from 56% in 2011 to 82% of patients in 2016 (P < 0.001), the rate of shockable rhythms increased from 40% to 51% (P = 0.005). The rate of patients with a noflow > 3 min decreased from 58% to 43% (P < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). TTM use decreased over time, from 55% in 2011 to 48% in 2016 (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, survival rate at ICU discharge increased significantly from 20% to 28% of patients (P = 0.018) (Figure) . In multivariate analysis, year of CA occurrence was associated with outcome at ICU discharge. The TTM use decrease over years was not driven by any particular Utstein criteria. Conclusion: We report an improvement over time in ICU survival of post-CA patients, which appears mostly associated with an increase in bystander CPR and higher rate of shockable rhythms. TTM use declined over years in all subgroups of CA patients with no evident consequences regarding outcome. We performed a retrospective monocentric study aiming to describe characteristics and outcome of MI after CA. All consecutive patients admitted in a tertiary CA center between 2007 and 2017 with a confirmed MI during their ICU stay were studied. MI was confirmed by endoscopy, abdominal CT-scan or surgical laparotomy. Results: Among 1503 CA post-CA patients, MI was clinically suspected in 59 patients (4%) and confirmed in 28 59 patients. Median age was 62 years, median time from CA to cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was 3 min (0-5), and time from CPR to return of spontaneous circulation was 22 min (18. 3-29.5) . Patients had an initial shockable rhythm in 57%, they received epinephrine during CPR in 82% and 93% of patients developed a post-resuscitation shock. Median initial blood lactate was 8.5 mmol/L. Delay between CA and the diagnosis of MI was 2 days (2-4), mostly because of clinical abdominal symptoms (79%) including hemorrhage and feeding intolerance, confirmed with CT scan abnormalities (54%) and lower digestive endoscopy (39%). Despite surgical intestinal resection performed in 7 28 patients, ICU mortality was 96%, as only 1 patient survived with good neurologic outcome. Cause of death was the MOF itself (41%) or post-anoxic brain injury for 37% despite a recovery after the initial shock. We conducted an observational study over a 9-year period (2007-2015) in a French cardiac arrest (CA) center. All non-traumatic OHCA patients admitted alive in the ICU were studied. Major injuries identified were ranked using a functional two-level scale of severity (life-threatening or consequential) and were classified as CPR-related injuries or collapse-related injuries, depending of the predominant mechanism. Factors associated with occurrence of a CPR-related injury and ICU survival were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Introduction: The objective of our study was to observe practices of procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in emergency departments (EDs) and to evaluate its effectiveness. Patients and methods: From January to July 2018, we conducted a prospective and multicentric study, in both EDs and prehospital setting. We enrolled adult patients needing painful procedures that would require PSA. Procedures were divided into 3 groups (A-dislocations + B-displaced fractures + C-other procedures such as abscess drainage or foreign body removal…). PSA drugs were divided into 3 groups (1-sedative drugs such as Propofol, Ketamine, or Midazolam + 2-Morphine + 3-absence of drugs or 50% Oxygen Nitrous-Oxyd Premix). We used a composite primary outcome to define the success of the PSA-successful procedure, EP feeling of sufficient sedation, and the patient's absence of painful memories from the procedure. Results: 108 patients were enrolled. 61 PSA (56.5%) were successful according to our primary outcome criteria (3 points out of 3) and 35 (32.4%) reached only 2 points. Pain decrease was measured by numeric rating scale (NRS) and its median was 4.5 (IQR 3-7). Number of patient in each procedure groups were as follow-Group A-n = 48 (44.44%), Group B n = 32 (29.63%), group C n = 28 (25.93%). Drug's group 1 was predominant (n = 59, 54.6%) and its success rate was higher (76.3%) compared to group 2 and group 3 (22.7% and 40.7% respectively, p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, PSA success was independently associated with only 2 factors: Ramsay sedation scale > 2 (OR = 4.584 {1.927-11.501}, p = 0.0008), as a protective factor, while morphine group was against PSA success (OR = 0.181 {0.051-0.555} p = 0.0044). Adverse event rate in our study (15.7%) was comparable with the rate in other international studies. All adverse events were easily treated and had no serious consequences. Conclusion: This prospective and multicentric study of 108 patients showed that efficiency was perfect in only 56.5% of the cases, and had a satisfactory result in 88.9%. Global efficiency was positively linked to the use of sedative drugs and negatively to cutaneous procedures such as abscess drainage. Results: During the study period's, 66 patients with positive diagnosis of PE, were included. According to our analysis, 45% (30 cases) of the patients presented with PE within 72 h of trauma events.The patients in early PE group were older than those in the late PE group (p = 0.038), had a body-mass-index (BMI) above thirty (p = 0.021) and high sequantial organ failure score (SOFA) on admission (p = .001). Eight-year, bicentric, retrospective cohort study. All consecutive patients with HGG, admitted to the ICUs were included. Functional status was assessed with the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 was also collected. The anti-cancer therapy course after ICU discharge was classified in 1) continued without change, 2) changed (modified or stopped after ICU discharge), and 3) initiated after ICU discharge for a HGG diagnosed during the ICU stay). Introduction: Thrombocytopenia is a common disorder in intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. This was a single-center retrospective observational study over a 9-year period (2009-2017). Patients with malignancies and hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia who had received at least one platelet transfusion in the ICU were included. For each transfusion episode, a poor platelet yield was defined as a body surface area-adjusted corrected count increment (CCI) < 7, or alternatively as a weight-adjusted platelet transfusion yield (RTP) < 0.2. Patients were considered refractory to platelet transfusions when they experienced poor platelet increments (CCI < 7 or RTP < 0.2) following two consecutive ABO-compatible transfusions containing at least 0.5x1011 platelets per 10 kg bodyweight. Results: 326 patients who received a total of 1470 platelet transfusions were analyzed. Indications for platelet transfusions were distributed into prophylactic (44.5%), securing an invasive procedure (18.1%) and therapeutic for active bleeding (37.4%). Transfusion thresholds were lower for prophylactic indications than for securing an invasive procedure or for therapeutic indications (13 [8- Introduction: trauma to the spine is a common pathology that is constantly increasing in Algeria, mainly to road accidents, they are potentially serious, and associated with a spinal cord injury, they are life-threatening. We treated 75 traumatized cervical and thoracolumbar spine patients in our spine unit at CHU Oran. Patients and methods: -Department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery-spine unit of CHU Oran. -Period-24 months especially during the summer season. -Secondary support after the UAS. -Middle age-38 years (14-81 years). Results: 75 quadriplegic patients (58 men and 17 women) aged between 14 and 81 years, 60% of patients were between 14 and 60 years old, 27% between 40 and 60 years old and 13% over 60 years old, the main The causes of these traumatic quadriplegia are mainly due to AVP (67%), falls (27%) and sports accidents (judo, gymnastics) represent 6%. Histopathological lesions are at C1-C2 level in 6 patients (8%) and C3-C7 in 69 patients (92%). clinically 36 patients (48%) already had complete quadriplegia at admission and 39 patients (52%) had incomplete tetraplegia. The neurological involvement was classified according to the FRANKEL classification. Our practical conduct was a decompression, arthrodesis, graft with a screwed plate. 30% of the patients benefited from a conservative treatment in a reduction by cranial traction. the course was marked by recovery in 8 patients (10.6%) who had incomplete tetraplegia and 13 patients (17.3%) died as a result of their complications. Discussion: Traumatic quadriplegia is a major public health problem, few injuries are as devastating as those affecting the spinal cord; adult, youthful and adolescent men have the highest prevalence and suffer most of the time from a permanent deficit; quickly, the quadriplegic or paraplegic becomes aware of its deficit and its consequences. Hospitalization and rehabilitation, through their costs, represent a huge investment. The emotional damage the patient and his family are not measurable. After several weeks of treatment (surgery, resuscitation, rehabilitation ...) we found adverse results and treatment failure, which further complicated their insertion and care for their families. Conclusion: Traumatic quadriplegia is especially aggravated during transport, the goal of surgery is to decompress the marrow and stabilize the spine. Introduction: Despite daily interruption of sedative infusions, delayed awakening is frequently observed in critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. We aimed to identify the prognostic significance of standard electroencephalography findings in adult patients with delayed awakening in the intensive care unit. Patients and methods: Our retrospective study included consecutive patients under invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit who underwent standard EEG because of delayed awakening. Delayed awakening was classified in 3 groups-coma, hypo-active delirium or hyperactive delirium according to RASS at inclusion. The primary endpoint was a good neurological outcome, defined as the proportion of patients alive and awake (i.e. responding to simple commands on 2 consecutive days) 7 days after EEG. Secondary endpoints included the prevalence of the different etiologies of delayed awakening, defined in 6 categories (hypoxic + metabolic + septic + antibiotic + sedation + acute brain injury) and the proportion of patients alive and awake at ICU discharge and at 90 days. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) or numbers (percentages). Cause-specific prevalence models were used to identify independent parameters associated with awakening and death, respectively. (Table) . By contrast, background frequency > 4 Hz associated with a preserved reactivity were protective. The etiologies of delayed awakening were-65 (54%) sepsis, 49 (41%) hypoxia, 32 (27%) sedations, 25 (21%) neurotoxic antibiotics, 14 (12%) metabolic causes, with for some patients a multifactorial origin. Hypoxic encephalopathy was associated with short-term mortality. At the end of ICU stay, 60 (50%) patients were awake, 7 (6%) were alive but not awake and 53 (44%) were dead. At 90 days, 55 (45%) were awake, 6 (5%) were not awake and 60 (50%) were dead. Conclusion: Delayed awakening in ICU is likely of multifactorial origin and characterized by a favorable outcome in about 50% of cases. Background EEG abnormalities (frequency, continuity) and reactivity provide major prognostic information on short-term mortality in this population. have assessed its characteristics and long-term survival and functional outcomes. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify early factors associated with CA in adults managed for CSE and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU Introduction: Post-cardiac arrest coma is a common cause of brain injury in the ICU. Predicting neurological outcome is of crucial importance to provide the most objective information to loved ones and opt for the best therapeutic options (including withholding or withdrawal of treatments deemed hopeless). Among the prognostic tools available, somatosensory evoked potentials have proven efficiency-under certain conditions, the absence of N20 cortical wave is associated with an unfavorable neurological prognosis with a specificity closed to 100% (1). Traditionally, this test requires the expertise and availability of a neurophysiologist. We assume that this technique can also be performed by trained intensivists. Patients and methods: Two physicians from our ICU received two days of specific training in a university neurophysiology laboratory by a specialist in the interpretation of evoked potentials. Patients concerned had prolonged post-cardiac arrest coma after cessation of sedation. The records were interpreted and sent to the neurophysiology referral center for review by a specialist within 24 h. The feasibility and reliability of tests were evaluated retrospectively. Introduction: Sodium disturbances are the most common and probably the most poorly understood electrolyte disorders in neurological diseases. Complications can be minimized by better recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of sodium disorders. In this study, we aim to analyze the incidence, etiologies and impact of dysnatremia on brain damaged population, and we hypothesize that changes in sodium levels could be indicative of recent neurological deterioration. Patients and methods: We conducted a six month long prospective cohort, including all brain damaged patients, who were admitted to our ICU between March 1st, 2018 and August 31st, 2018 and with a minimum length of stay (LOS) of 14 days. All patients, included, were screened for sodium disorders in the first 2 weeks of ICU stay. Outcome was measured by incidence of death, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) on discharge and LOS. Patients were also monitored for neurological deterioration, including cognitive decline, convulsive seizures, increase in cerebral edema and brain herniation that were contemporary to sodium disorders. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine level of significance. Results: During the study period, one hundred patients were admitted to our ICU for neuro-intensive care, among which 77 were included in this study. Patients were admitted for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 75.3% of cases. According to our analysis, 35 (45.45%) patients presented with hyponatremia, 26 (74.3%) among them, were diagnosed with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), 8 (22.9%) with corticosteroid deficiency and in one case with cerebral salt wasting syndrome. SIADH was attributed to convulsive seizures in 7(26.9%) cases, meningitis in 3(11.5%) cases and TBI in 11 (42.3%) cases. Hyponatremia was found to be a predictive factor of mortality in ICU (p = 0.022), of LOS (p = 0.032) and a sign of neurological deterioration (p = 0.03) on the day of diagnosis. Our study results' showed an incidence of hypernatremia of 26% (20 cases), among which 55% (11 cases) were attributed to central diabetes insipidus. Hypernatremia was found to be a predictive factor of mortality in ICU (p < 0.00), of GOS (p < 0.00) and a sign of neurological deterioration (p < 0.00) on the day of diagnosis. Conclusion: In summary, this study demonstrates that sodium disturbances are common in neuro-intensive care units and associated with increased ICU mortality. Besides it indicates that changes in sodium levels could be revealing of serious neurological complications. This was a prospective observational study conducted in the medical intensive care unit of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of ROUEN.The inclusion period extended from April 2017 to October 2017.The main objective was to evaluate the relationship between the variability of muscle thickness measured by ultrasound at d1-d4 and mortality at d28.The secondary objective was to assess the difference in variability in mean quadriceps thickness between living and deceased patients at D28. Results: 34 patients admitted to septic shock were included.The median of the quadriceps thickness variability between J1 and J4 was -6.77% and was defined as a threshold value.We observed higher mortality in the group whose quadriceps thickness decreased by more than 6.77% (p = 0. Finally, 20 parents could be interviewed, of whom 15 were recalled, and four parents accepted the interview. One mother described changes in skin colour and bleeding, and was shocked. Both parents of an infant described weird movements but said it helped them to recognize death, and one mother did not notice any sign, but was grateful for having been informed about possible symptoms. We did not call three fathers because their wives refused the interview, and a couple because it was bad timing. Discussion: The difficulties encountered are not those expected, such as parents' refusal at inclusion. The lack of parental involvement in the interviews is the main problem. It is partially due to a strong apprehension to recall them, with a feeling of guilt that overtakes the benefit expected from the study. For the parents who participated, there was always a motivation-a counter-gift for caregivers, a suffering and the desire to avoid that to other bereaved parents. IFiReaPed main hypothesis is that a better information of parents about those perceptible end-of-life signs could help them to live better this situation. In the literature, there is no study on this topic in PICU, therefore our first step is to observe dying children to determine which signs are worsening or appearing during end-of-life period. The study is ongoing in a French PICU. All patients, likely to die at short term in PICU are included, after informing the parents of the study. After obtaining their non-opposition, caregivers observe the dying child until his death. The child is excluded if the death doesn't occur in the five next days. A non-exhaustive list of perceptible signs is proposed to the caregivers, and they have to fulfill the presence, absence, or worsening of the signs during the dying process. Results: Between April 2017 and August 2018, 18 patients have been included (44 have been excluded because of unpredictable death, non-french speakers parents, oversight or brain death). The median age is 0.9 year, 78% had chronic disease, the main causes of death are respiratory or neurological failure and the death followed limitation or withdrawal of the treatments in 17 patients. The most frequent perceptible signs appearing or worsening during the dying process concern the child's appearance (cyanosis, pallor, marbling, petechiae, edema…), sometimes respiratory signs are perceptible, but 7 patients were still under invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of death (details in the table) . Unsurprisingly, some physiological parameters are presents during the dying process (bradycardia, hypotension, desaturation), and they could be noticed by the parents only because of the monitor. Gasps have been noted in 8 patients. Few patients presented digestive or neurological signs, but all the patient except one received an sedoanalgesia. Conclusion: IFiReaPed is the first prospective study trying to determine what are the perceptible signs during the end-of -life in PICU. The most frequent signs are gasp or concern changes in skin color or in appearance. This signs could hurt the parents and could be easier to support if they received information before their onset. The next steps of the study are to determine the signs noticed by the parents, their need of explanation and the impact of these informations on their experience. Introduction: Sedation-analgesia is part of the management of ventilated pediatric patients and must be adjusted to each patient. The objective was to evaluate the implementation of nursing-driven protocol sedation-analgesia on duration of mechanical ventilation. Patients and methods: This was a before-and-after prospective, observational study in a pediatric intensive care unit that included children aged 28 days to 17 years, receiving mechanical ventilation longer than 24 h. During the observational period, sedation-analgesia was administred according to medical prescription. During the intervention period, sedation-analgesia was adjusted by nurses according to protocol-based sedation-analgesia guideline, including an evaluation by Comfort-B scale. This was a descriptive retrospective study of all cases of acute intoxication by pesticides admitted to ICU resuscitation care in 2017. Results: One hundred seventy-nine cases of pesticide intoxication were admitted during the study period which represents 23.5% of all acute intoxication cases admitted to intensive care. The average age of the addicts was 30 ± 13 years with a sex ratio of 0.47. The poisoning were occurring at home in 138 of the cases (77%) or in a public space in 41 of them (23%). The poisoning were voluntary in 174 of the cases (97%) and accidental in 5 of them. Patients came directly from emergencies in 40% of the cases and were transferred from other hospitals in 60% of the cases. Rodenticides were the most implicated type of pesticide (n = 140 + 79%) with chloralose as leader (n = 137, 76%) followed by organophosphorus (n = 29 + 16%) and carbamates (n = 8 + 4%). Neurological signs of tremor and loss of consciousness were predominant (n = 144 + 80%) followed by tachycardia (n = 45 + 25%) and digestive signs (n = 27 + 15%). Respiratory distress was present in 11 patients (6%) and hemodynamic failure in three. Inhalation pneumonia complicated poisoning in 51 cases. The use of mechanical ventilation was necessary in 80% of the cases, the use of vasoactive drugs in 5.6% and the use of antibiotic therapy in 28.5%. Gastric lavage was performed in 9 patients (5%). Atropine was administered in 30 patients (16%). The median length of stay was 2.5 days and the overall mortality was 1.1% (n = 2). Conclusion: Pesticide poisoning is a reality in Tunisia. They are characterized by the variability of the toxic substances available in our country with neurological signs in the foreground. This can be at the origin of major and fatal complications if they are not taken care of in due time and in the appropriate place. We screened all patients with colonization infection with CPE-producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KP) within a range of 6 months around identification of the first case. We included the patients with confirmed NDM-KP (by genotyping). We described patient's profile, previous antibiotic use, infection type, treatment and outcome. Results: Five patients had at least one sample positive with NDM-KP in our ICU between November 2017 and March 2018. Strains were susceptible to fosfomycin, some also to colistin and chloramphenicol. We didn't perform genotyping. Detailed features are listed in table 1. Patients were young (mean age-55 years), but suffered from severe medical conditions. 4 out of the 5 patients had stayed in the same ICU subunit. 4 out of the 5 patients presented an infection related to the NDM-KP. Median-time between colonization and infection was 9 days (4-63). All patients had received previous broad-spectrum antibiotherapy. Infections were treated with rarely used antibiotics, highly toxic. We observed microbiological success in 3 patients, relapse in 2. The 4 infected patients died. Cause of death was untracktable infection in 3, comorbidities in 1. The colonized patient survived (mortality rate-80%). Conclusion: NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae is emerging in Europe.3 To our knowledge, our series is the first describing locallyacquired cases in Belgium. 4 It is worrying for few reasons. First, the colonization infection ratio was high, attesting the high pathogenic power of these pathogens (and or host frailty). Second, 100% of infected patients died, despite early targeted antimicrobial therapy. It is well known that genes encoding CPE are usually plasmid-transmitted. The fact that all patients had previous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy supports this statement. However, the only species found was K.P, all the patients had been staying in the same unit and time proximity was clear. This pleads for a "contact" component of transmission. Hygiene rules, in addition to antibiotic stewardship, are therefore crucial. The PCT levels of all patients at time of inclusion (H0), 6 h after and at day 1 were measured using a sensitive immunoassay. Results: Regarding all the cohort (n = 302), at any time, the PCT levels were higher in patients with bacterial infection (n = 66) and viral infection (n = 69) than in patients without documented infection (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, whether the PCT levels tended to be higher in patients with bacterial infection (n = 33) than in patients with viral infection (n = 37) in the pneumonic group patients, PCT failed to distinguish between bacterial infection (n = 33) and viral infection (n = 32) in non pneumonic group patients. Conclusion: These results underline the interest of PCT as biomarker to distinguish between infectious and non infectious causes of severe AECOPD. However, PCT could fail to distinguish between bacterial and viral infection in this setting. We conducted a retrospective single-center study over a 1 year-period. Adult patients admitted in the ED with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5 G L) were analyzed. Patients with hematological or oncological diseases, HIV infection, hepato-cellular deficiency, immunosuppression and over 85 years old were excluded. Diagnosis of infection was confirmed by an independent adjudication committee. Correlation between lymphopenia and infection was assessed using a univariate analysis and a multivariate logistic regression. Results: From January to December 2017, 953 patients were admitted in ED with severe lymphopenia and 245 were eligible (148 men + mean age 63 ± 19 years). Infection was confirmed in 159 patients (65%) (bacterial-60%, viral-30%, other-10%). Initially, only 61 patients (25%) were referred to ED for suspected infection. Among biological markers, only CRP was different between infected and uninfected groups (109 ± 133 vs 46 ± 62, p < 0.01). The depth of lymphopenia was associated with a higher prevalence of infection, bacteremia, and microbiological identification (Figure) . In multivariate analysis, only clinical criteria were independently associated with infection (SIRS criteria-OR = 2.4, p < 0.01 + fever-OR = 3.35, p = 0.02). On the contrary, classical biological biomarkers did not appear associated with infection (WBC count-OR = 0.93, p = 0.07 + CRP-OR = 1.01, p = 0.07). This was a retrospective follow-up study of 92 cases with the diagnosis of decompensated cirrhosis from January to December 2016. Results: A total of 92 cases of decompensated cirrhosis were enrolled in our study. The mean age was 62 ± 13.4 years. The gender was 0.95. The diagnosis of sepsis was identified in 46% of cases. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that there is a significant positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.00), Procalcitonin (p = 0.004), PLR (p = 0.006) and NLR (p = 0.02) with infection. To evaluate the ability of NLR, CRP, Procalcitonin and PLR to predict infection, ROC curves were obtained. Of all the evaluated parameters, NLR showed a strong, statistically significant correlation, a high concordance correlation coefficient. Conclusion: Infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalization of patients with decompensated cirrhosis and is associated with considerable mortality, for which clinicians are seeking useful and easily obtained biomarkers. Our study had shown that Both PLR and NLR were good markers to predict infection in AoCLF. Results: Among 120 patients studied, 48.33% (CI 95% (39.12 -57.63)) had anxiety, 36.67% (CI 95% (28.06 -45.95)) had depressive symptoms and 8.33% (95% CI (4.07 -14.79)) had PTSD. Anxiety, depression and PTSD was defined by HADS score ≥ 8 and PTSS-10 > 35. The only predictive factor was age for anxiety (p = 0.001). Any other risk factors of psychiatric comorbidity were no significant. Memory disorder seemed to favor PTSD, as well as sepsis' presence favors anxiety and non-invasive ventilation favors anxiety and depression. There was no significant change in prevalence due to professional practices' evolution. Conclusion: Anxiety, depression and PTSD after critical illness are common. The detection of predictors allows an early multidisciplinary management of the patient in order to reduce their prevalence. A self-questionnaire in French has been sent to young doctors of any specialty through mailing lists to the interns. People are surveyed about their characteristics, their attendance at a conference, the funding of staff and the total of these and the contribution. The relative data was anonymous. The questionnaire was registered at the CNIL. Results: During the period study, 141 patients were admitted in the burn ICU. 34 patients were included. The mean age was 38 ± 15 years with a ratio sex of 4.7. The average TBSA (total body surface area) was 44 ± 20%. Early ICU mortality was 26.5% (n = 9). Patients were assigned into 2 groups-G1-survivors (n = 25) and G2-non survivors (n = 9). Comparative study of 2 groups was as follows (Table 1)-Table 1 -Comparative study of 2 groups. Conclusion: Optimal initial fluid resuscitation in burn patients is associated with lower fluids overload during the first 48 h and improves early outcome with a lower early mortality. Introduction: As a static marker of cardiac preload, the central venous pressure (CVP) remains a helpful variable at the bedside to guide the hemodynamic management of critically-ill patients. Since transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is currently the first-line tool for evaluating the hemodynamic conditions in critically-ill patients, we aimed at assessing the ability of TTE to estimate and to track changes in CVP. In 31 patients (25 mechanically ventilated and four with atrial fibrillation), concomitant CVP measurement (internal jugular catheter) and TTE examination were performed before and after a passive leg raising test or the infusion of 500-mL of saline. We calculated the tricuspid E A waves ratio, the tricuspid E e' waves ratio, the right ventricular isovolumic time (IVRT), the E IVRT ratio, the S D waves ratio of the supra-hepatic vein flow, the VTI-systolic filling fraction and the peak velocities-systolic filling fraction of the supra-hepatic vein flow, the end-expiratory diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the respiratory variations of the IVC diameter. For the statistical analysis, we considered that a CVP threshold value of 10 mmHg was clinically relevant. Results: Changes in CVP were induced by a passive leg raising test in 10 patients and by fluid administration in 21 patients. After pooling all values, only the end-expiratory IVC diameter and the respiratory variations of the IVC diameter were correlated to CVP (r = 0.40 and r = -0.26, respectively, p < 0.05 for both). At baseline, an end-expiratory IVC diameter = <14 mm predicted a CVP = or < 10 mmHg with a specificity of 100% (95%CI-81-100%) but with a sensitivity of 29% (95%CI-8-58%). An end-expiratory IVC diameter > 26 mm predicted a CVP > 10 mmHg with a specificity of 100% (95%CI-77-100%) but with a sensitivity of 0% (95%CI-0-20%). At baseline, the respiratory variations of the IVC diameter could predict neither a CVP = or < 10 mmHg nor a CVP > 10 mmHg (AUC = 0.683, p = 0.08). Only relative changes in the S D ratio and in VTI-systolic filling fraction correlated with relative changes in CVP (r = 0.44 and r = 0.43, respectively, p < 0.05). The concordance rate between changes in S D ratio and CVP was 48% and the concordance rate between changes in VTI-systolic filling fraction and CVP was 55%. Conclusion: In critically-ill patients, TTE cannot reliably estimate CVP or track changes in CVP induced by changes in cardiac preload. Nevertheless, an end-expiratory IVC diameter = ou < 14 mm or > 26 mm can detect a CVP = ou < 10 mmHg or > 10 mmHg respectively with a specificity of 100%. This study is a retrospective, multicenter, epidemiologic data analysis. All adult patients admitted for septic shock, caused by peritonitis or pneumonia and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled in the study. Delta SOFA score was defined as the SOFA score measured on admission minus SOFA score measured on day 5. Bivariate analysis was performed with parametric tests or non-parametric tests. A multivariate analysis was performed to study the association between FO and Delta SOFA score. Results: 129 patients met the inclusion criteria of the study. Cumulative fluid balance at day 5 was greater in the FO group, with a betweengroup difference of 5.977 ml (p-value < 0.001). Delta SOFA score was more than two-fold higher in the no FO group than in the FO group with a difference of 2.37 between the two groups (p-value = 0.001). Patients without FO were more rapidly discharge from ICU compared to patients with FO and had one week less of mechanical ventilation compare to FO patients (p-value < 0.05). There was a stepwise decrease of delta SOFA score when duration of fluid overload was greater (p-value = 0.001). In linear modelling, the association between fluid overload status and delta SOFA score was confirmed with an adjusted relative-risk of 0.15 (p-value = 0.009). Our study consisted on investigating the modalities of administration of AED's with NGT by residents in intensive care during four months. We prepared 10 questions including demographic informations. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnary was distributed in seven intensive care departments after authorization of each head of the departement. So 40 residents were included. Results: Residents sex-ratio was 0.37 and mean age was 28 ± 2 years. For the period after which the NGT replacement is performed, the average of the responses was 6 ± 3 days. Residents who thought that AED were administered at the same time as food accounted for 42% of the total population. According to 90% of residents, the dosage form administered by NGT the most used in the intensive care unit was the tablets of which 95% think that it should be crushed before administration. Before introducing the drug into the NGT, 58% of residents thought it was mixed with tap water. No resident responded that treatment is introduced dry in NGT. According to residents, the most used AED in resuscitation services were phenobarbital (75%). All residents responded that to detect a possible under or overdose, the therapeutic drug monitoring is the best way in AED adjustment in this particular population. Among the residents, 62% expressed the need for a training on the modalities of administration of the treatment by NGT to improve their knowledge. This was a monocentric observational ancillary study of the REXECOR study (NCT02965079). All patients presenting with severe exacerbation of COPD and implanted by ECCO2R [Hemolung (Alung Technologies, Pittsburgh, USA)] were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at baseline and one hour after starting ECCO2R. IMV ventilation parameters were kept unmodified two hours before and one hour after the beginning of ECCO2R. TTE data, IMV parameters and arterial blood gas were simultaneous collected. Results: Seven patients [(5 women, median age 63 years (56-73), median body mass index 39.5 kg m2 (24.1-47.0)] were included from November 2017 to February 2018. Median SAPS2 at admission was 32(29-40) and respiratory SOFA was 3(2-3). Regarding TTE findings, the 7 patients had RV hypertrophy with RV free wall superior to 5 mm (6.9 mm ± 0.9) and no RV dysfunction was reported (Mean St = 20.1 ± 5.1 cm s and mean TAPSE = 21.8 ± 5.7 mm). The ECCO2R induced a significant variation of PaCO2 from 68 mmHg (67-75) to 57 mmHg (52-59), P < 0.009 and of pH from 7.24 (7.23-7.28) to 7.37 (7.27-7.37), P = 0.025. Figure 1 shows evolution of echo parameters and PaCO2 after ECCO2Rimplantation. There was no difference between S' wave value after significant reduction of PaCO2 by ECCO2R (p = 0.16) whereas systolic pulmonary arterial pressures (sPAP) decreased significantly from 45.2 mmHg (± 5.4) to 38.0 mmHg (± 7.6), P = 0.01. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was also not significantly decreased [2.24UW (± 0.41) vs. 1.80UW (± 0.39), P = 0.07]. Of note, parameters assessing the LV function did not change during the ECCO2R flow variations. Conclusion: In the physiological study, the decreased of PaCO2 induced by the ECCO2r flow variations lead to a decreased of sPAP without modifying the systolic RV function parameters. Introduction: "Comorbidomes" correspond to comorbidities that are frequently associated in COPD (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, oetoporosis, sarcopenia) carrying a significant impact on mortality. The distribution and the type of comorbidities vary between studies but agreement exists on five phenotypes of comorbidities-The current study was conducted to determine the association between specific comorbidities and ICU survival of acute exacerbation of COPD. Patients and methods: In Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU for hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD were classified according to associated comorbidities in five clusters-cluster 1 included cardiac profile + cluster 2 included less comorbidities + cluster 3 included metabolic syndrome, apnea and anxiety-depression + cluster 4 included denutrition and sarcopenia, and cluster 5 included bronchiectasis. Patients had standard ventilatory (NIV or standard MV), and pharmacologic (nebulized ß2 agonists, steroids, and anticholinergics) management. The discharge status (dead or alive) was compared between the 5 identified comorbid clusters. Results: During the study period, 81 patients (mean age = 67 ± 9 years, 72% male) were consecutively admitted to the ICU for a definitive diagnosis of AECOPD. NIV was used as the primary ventilator modality in 83% while the remaining had conventional invasive ventilation. ICU mortality occurred in 25% following a mean ICU and ventilatory support duration of 17 ± 10 days and 10 ± 7 days, respectively. The figure depicts relative mortality in each comorbidities cluster. The difference in observed mortality rates between clusters was statistically significant. We conducted a retrospective single-centre observational study including all MDMA-poisoned patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and who developed fever (body temperature > 38.5 °C) and symptoms signs of serotoninergic syndrome (according to Sternbach's criteria). Plasma MDMA and MDA concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results: Sixteen MDMA-poisoned patients (out of 58 MDMA-exposed patients admitted to the ICU over a 10-year period) who presented serotoninergic syndrome with fever (> 38.5 °C) attributed to MDMA exposure and treated with supportive care, external cooling and cyproheptadine (a non-specific serotonin receptor antagonist) were included in this study. The patients were 6 females et 10 males, of 22-year old [20 -26] (median [percentiles 25 -75] and had used recreational MDMA and found in a night-club (75%), in the street (19%) or at home (6%). The body temperature reached 39.7 °C [38. 8 -40 .9] and the presentation was complicated by cardiac arrest (19%), cardiovascular failure (44%), aspiration pneumonia (56%), hospital-acquired infections (25%) and fatality (6%). In four patients (25%), worsening in the clinical (heart rate, pyramidal syndrome, EEG encephalopathy) and biological parameters (transaminases, prothrombin index, creatinine phosphokinase) included in the serotoninergic syndrome was surprisingly observed in parallel to the increase in body temperature (due to a concomitant infectious or inflammatory non-toxic event). The observed worsening occurred in the absence of any increase in the plasma MDMA and MDA concentrations (N = 2) and even in the presence of undetectable concentrations (N = 2). Conclusion: MDMA use results in serotonin syndrome possibly leading to the onset of hyperthermia, organ failure and death, despite optimal care. Worsening in the serotonin syndrome during the ICU stay of severely MDMA-poisoned patients, without increase in plasma MDMA concentration is observed in 25% of the patients. The exact molecular mechanisms involved in this "serotoninergic memory" remain to be clarified. prognostic factors related to CO induced coma. The primary objective of our study was to determine prognostic factors for ICU-mortality following CO induced coma. Our secondary objective was to determine prognostic factors of CO related cognitive sequelae, at the time of intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Patients and methods: Retrospective observational study from January 2000 to December 2012. All comatose patients (Glasgow coma score < 8) due to carbon monoxide poisoning, treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a tertiary hospital in the greater Paris area were included in the current study. Clinical, biological, iconographic and electrophysiological data were collected from medical files. Results: 184 patients were included, median [IQR] age was 42 [30 -56] years, 105 patients (57.4%) were male. Causes of poisoning were mainly CO exposure n = 55 (30%) and smoke inhalation n = 107 (58.5%). 30 patients (17%) died during their ICU stay while 26 (14.7%) presented cognitive sequelae at ICU discharge. Multivariate analysis found that cardiac arrest (OR 1.28; IC95% [1.14 -1.44] + p < 0.001), EEG anomalies (OR 1.34 + IC95% [1.21-1.49] p < 0.001), and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) (OR 1.04 + IC95% [1.01-1.07) + p = 0.02) were associated with ICU-mortality. Neuroimaging anomalies (OR 1.53 + IC95% [1.36-1.72] + p < 0.001) were associated with cognitive sequelae at ICU discharge. Neither lactate nor carboxyhemoglobin levels were associated with cognitive sequelae or mortality in our cohort. Conclusion: In our study, predictive factors of ICU-mortality in CO induced comatose patients were a cardiac arrest, EEG anomalies and the SAPS II score. Neuroimaging anomalies were predictive of cognitive sequelae at ICU discharge. Introduction: The recreational use of poppers has been increasing in France since the last judgment of the National Council in June 2013 re-authorizing their marketing. Poppers contain various alkyle nitrites which are highly oxidant compounds able to induce methemoglobinemia (MetHb) with deleterious and even life-threatening consequences in humans. Our objective was 1)-to describe the circumstances, complications and outcome of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for MetHb onset attributed to the exposure to poppers and 2)-to investigate the relationship between the serum lactate concentration and the MetHb before treatment. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective monocentre observational study including all patients admitted to the ICU with increased blood MetHb (> 0.7%) following the exposure to poppers. We investigated the relationships between SpO2, serum lactate concentration and MetHb on ICU admission by calculating the Pearson's coefficients and using the Bartlett's test of sphericity. Results: Twenty-six patients (24 males and 2 females aged of 42 years (35 -48) [median (percentiles 25 and 75)]) were included. The poppers had been snorted (77%), ingested (19%) or snorted + ingested (4%), in a recreational multi-drug exposure (65% + mostly accompanied by gamma-hydroxybutyrate use). On admission, MetHb was 20.0% (1.5 -44.0). The patients received methylene blue infusion (62%), mechanical ventilation (35%), catecholamine infusion (12%) and exsanguino-transfusion (4%). On admission, the SpO2 was 91% (83 -94) and weakly correlated to the MetHb (R2 = 0.3, p = 0.01) while the serum lactate concentration was 2.2 mmol/L (1.3 -3.9) and highly correlated to the MeHb (R2 = 0.7, p < 0.0001). Plasma lactate concentration of > 2 mmol/L was highly predictive of MetHb > 20%, with 91.7% sensitivity, 90.9%, specificity, 91.7% positive predictive value and 90.9% negative predictive value. Conclusion: The use of poppers is responsible for life-threatening consequences attributed to MetHb. Our data clearly supported the recommendation by the international and French guidelines to administer methylene blue in patients developing MetHb > 20% by evidencing that tissue hypoxia is almost consistently present above this threshold. Introduction: Cardio-circulatory failure is one of the leading causes of death in acute poisoning. The aim of our work was to analyze the hemodynamic profile of intoxications to non-cardiotropic products, and to identify the prognostic factors. Patients and methods: This was a prospective, 1-year study, including any patient over the age of 15 years, in primary admission to the vital emergency room, for non-cardiotropic drug intoxication but also nondrug. The analyzed parameters were-clinical examination, electrical abnormalities, echocardiographic data and troponin level, this evaluation performed with H24 intake. The statistical analysis was univariate with a p < 0.05. Results: 251 patients were included, with an average age of 29, with a _ sex ratio. The toxic products found were organophosphorus (39.1%), benzodiazepines (16.4%), aluminum phosphide (14.7%), cocaine (12.3%), carbon monoxide (8.9%),, 8%) and tricyclic antidepressants (5.2%). Cardiocirculatory insufficiency was observed in 62 patients (24.6%), electrical abnormalities in 45 patients (17.9%), elevation of troponin in 22 patients (8.7%) and echocardiographic abnormalities in 20 patients (7.9%).The incidence was particularly high for aluminum phosphide and tricyclic antidepressants.The overall mortality rate was 9% (36 deaths), depending on the offending product-45.9% for aluminum phosphide, 30.7% for tricyclic antidepressants, 12.9% for cocaine, 8, 1% for organophosphorus compounds and 4.9% for benzodiazepines. (Figure 1 ) The correlation between clinical and paraclinical abnormalities and the occurrence of death is shown in Table 1 . Discussion: In toxicology, the range of cardio-toxic products is much wider than the class of cardiotropic drugs. Indeed, very many products are at the origin of a cardiovascular toxicity. The mechanism of this failure is variable-membrane stabilizing effect (antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, organophosphorus), diastolic dysfunction, rhythm disorders, toxic myocarditis, myocardial necrosis (Phostoxin, cocaine, CO) or vasodilatation (antihypertensives). Conclusion: The difficulty of accurately assessing the incidence and prevalence of cardio-circulatory failure due to toxic causes is due, among other things, to the lack of validated studies to propose better diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. In our study, the 2 main factors of poor prognosis were cardiocirculatory insufficiency and echocardiographic abnormalities. Retrospective observational single-center study in the medical ICU of a referral university hospital conducting on patients admitted for SM over a 14-year period (2004-2017). Demographic variables, severity scores, WHOs severity criteria on admission, ICU and hospital lengths of stay were collected. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were compared between two periods, namely 2004-2012 and 2013-2017 when artesunate has become first-choice treatment. A poor outcome was defined as the composite endpoint of death, or ICU length of stay > 2 days, or requirement for vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation and or renal replacement therapy started after the first day in ICU. Univariate analysis and stepwise multivariate logistic regression stratified by period were performed to identify factors associated with a poor outcome. Results: 189 patients were included, 98 before and 91 after 2013. Main epidemiological and clinical characteristics are on Table. Even if the number of WHO criteria for SM was comparable in both groups, SAPS II, SOFA and ICU length of stay were significantly higher before 2013. Patients visiting friends or relatives (VFR) in their home country or living in endemic areas seemed more frequent after 2013 (p = 0.07). Poor outcome occurred in 63 cases before 2013 and 32 cases after 2013 (p < .01). Risk factors of poor outcome were impaired consciousness (adjOR = 3.25, 95%CI (1.50-7.07), p = 0.003), shock (adjOR = 3.46, 95%CI (1.36-8.85), p = 0.01) and creatinine > 265 µmol L (adjOR = 14.16, 95%CI (4.95-40.48), p < .001). Patients VFR or living in endemic areas were associated with a better outcome (adjOR = 0.34, 95%CI (0.15-0.77), p = 0.01). In the final model, artesunate therapy did not significantly improve the outcome as compared to quinine-based therapy (adjOR = 0.53, 95%CI (0.16-1.71), p = 0.28). Conclusion: Patients with SM admitted in our ICU after 2013 were less severe than those before 2013. These trends could be partially explained by the increasing proportion of immune patients VFR or living in endemic areas. After adjustment on severity and stratification by period, artesunate was not significantly associated with a better outcome than IV quinine. Introduction: Clostridium species are important agents of anaerobic infections that may be associated with a wide range of severe clinical diseases requiring ICU admission. Data focusing on non difficile Clostridium species bacteriemia in ICU are scarce and rely mainly on case reports. We sought to define the clinical and biological characteristics, risk factors for acquisition, Clostridium ecology and outcomes of non difficile Clostridium species bacteriemia in critically ill patients. Patients and methods: This is a multi-centric retrospective cohort study (from 6 ICUs) including all patients diagnosed with non-difficile clostridium bacteriemia between January 2002 and June 2018. Results: Fifty patients were included. Median age was 65 (53-80) years old. For 70% of patients, Clostridium bacteriemia occurred the day of ICU admission. Median Charlson score was 5 (3-7). Underlying conditions included-onco-haematological malignancy (38%), chronic alcohol abuse (28%), diabetes (28%), chronic cardiac failure (24%), obesity (24%), cirrhosis (18%), and chronic kidney injury (12%). First symptoms started the day of ICU admission (median 0 (0-1) day between symptoms and ICU admission). Patients presented with fever in only 25% of the cases, hypothermia in 16%, shock in 83%, coma in 40%, acute respiratory failure in 21%, and cardiac arrest in 26%. Digestive symptoms were presents in 52% cases. At ICU admission, median SAPS II score was 69 (49-91), median SOFA score was 11 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Overall, 85% patients required vasopressors, 81% invasive mechanical ventilation, and 44% renal replacement therapy. Twenty-four percent of patients experienced massive hemolysis. Median serum lactate level was 6 mM (3-10). Most of infections (44%) were due to C. perfringens, followed by C. ramosum (10%), C. septicum (10%) and C. tertium (8%). Digestive infection was diagnosed in 62% of the cases, and skin infection in 4% of the cases. Gas gangrene was present in 12% of the patients, and surgery was necessary in 28%. Most of species were sensitive to Penicillin (93%). Two third (66%) of patients died in ICU, and hospital mortality was 80%. In non survivors, median time between ICU admission and hospital death was 1 (0-9) days. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption, diabetes and underlying malignancies are the main risk factors of Clostridium bacteriemia. CLinical manifestations are non specific, but digestive symptoms and hemolysis should alert the physicians. Considering the risk of fulminant course and the high lethality of these infections, adequate antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Calmette, a cancer referral centre, from January-1-2010 to December-31-2016. We compared 30-days and 1-year mortality rate, change in the respiratory item of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (delta SOFA-resp), change in the global SOFA score (SOFAaggravation) and use of intubation between day-1 and day-5 of antipneumocystis therapy, and occurrence of coinfections between early adjunctive corticosteroid recipients within 48 h (landmark analysis) and late or no corticosteroid recipients, using a naïve and Inverse Probability Weighted in survival analysis (IPW). Results: 133 HIV-negative patients with PCP were included (early corticosteroid n = 88, late or no corticosteroid n = 45). The main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies (n = 107, 80.5%), solid tumor (n = 27, 20.3%) and stem cell transplantation (n = 17, 12.8%). Overall 30-days and 1-year mortality was respectively 24.1% and 58.2%. IPW analysis found no differences on 30-days (HR = 1.45, 95% CI [0.7-3.04], p = 0.321) and 1-year (HR = 1.25, CI 95% [0.75-2.09], p = 0.39) mortality rate between the both groups. In the same way, no differences in delta-SOFA-resp, SOFA-aggravation, use of intubation and occurrence of coinfections were found between the both groups. Conclusion: The addition of early adjunctive corticosteroid to antipneumocystis therapy in non-HIV patients with PCP was not associated with improved outcomes concerning 30-days and 1-year mortality and respiratory evolution. Further studies are needed to evaluated this therapeutic strategy. Introduction: Accuracy of a test depends on its intrinsic characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) and of disease prevalence. These parameters are uncommonly taken into account when assessing diagnostic accuracy (1.2). To illustrate this relationship in non-HIV patients with pneumocystis pneumonia, whose prevalence is low and where available diagnostic tests have high intrinsic performance. This study aims to assess post-test probability of pneumocystis pneumonia, according to results of PCR and BDG tests in non-HIV patients with ARF. Patients and methods: A systematic review was performed to assess diagnostic performance of PCR and Beta-D-Glucan (BDG). Prevalence of Pneumocystis pneumonia was assessed in a dataset of 2243 immunocompromised patients with ARF using supervised classification tree. Prevalence of pneumocystis pneumonia was simulated using r software and assuming a normal distribution in 5000 subjects on the basis of previously observed prevalence. Post-test probability was assessed using Bayes theorem. Analyses were performed using R software. Results: Prevalence of pneumocystis pneumonia in ARF patients was 4.1% (95% CI 3.3-5). Supervised classification identified 4 subgroups -Patients without ground glass opacities (prevalence 2.0% + 95% CI 1.4-2.8), those with ground glass opacities but a) with prophylaxis (Prevalence 4.9% + 95% CI 1.6-11), b) without prophylaxis (Prevalence 10.0% + 95% CI 6.4-14.7), and c) without prophylaxis and with lymphoid malignancy or stem cell transplantation (Prevalence 20.2% + 95% CI 14.1-27.7). In the overall population, positive predictive value (PPV) was 32.9% (95%CI 31.1-34.8) and 22.8% (95%CI 21.5-24.3) for PCR and BDG respectively. Negative predictive value was low (0.10% (95% CI 0.09-0.11) and 0.23% (95%CI 0.21-0.25)) for PCR and BDG respectively. In the highest risk subgroup, PPV was 74.5% (95%CI 72.0-76.7) and 63.8% (95%CI 60.8-65.8) for PCR and BDG respectively. Conclusion: Although both PCR and BDG yield a high intrinsic performance, the low incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia translates into limited PPV, even in the highest risk group. Our results underline the need for adequate pre-test probability assessment. They suggest a method to illustrate pre and post-test probability relationship that may improve perception of diagnostic test performance in patients with predefined clinical vignette. the first hours of hospitalization. As emerging evidences recently suggested that artificial intelligence-derived methods could efficiently assisted medical decision process, we wondered if mathematical model of diagnostic prediction could be more efficient than evaluation made by experimented physicians. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of a panel of experts and a mathematical model to predict the microbial etiology of sCAP. Patients and methods: We conducted a prospective non-interventional study. First, we included patients hospitalized for sCAP in ICU and recorded clinical paraclinical data available in the three first hours of care. Final microbial diagnosis was established from microbiological examinations including bacterial cultures and multiplex PCR on respiratory fluids. sCAP with mixed etiology or without microbiological documentation were excluded. Second, we built a mathematical model of prediction (Random Forest method with LOOCV) using all data initially collected. Finally, an independent sample of the study population was used to test the performance of the pathogen prediction by-(i) a panel of 3 experts, (ii) the mathematical algorithm. Both were blind regarding the microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR +) > 10 and negative LR < 0.1 were considered clinically relevant. Results: We included 153 patients with sCAP (70.6% men, mean age, 62 [51-73] years + mean SAPSII, 37 [27-47]). Responsible pathogens were-37% viral, 24% bacterial, 20% mixed etiology and 19% unidentified. The data-driven approach defined five items to create the final mathematical model-BMI, systolic blood pressure, symptom-tohospitalization time and procalcitonin. Neither the experts nor the algorithm were able to predict the responsible pathogens of the pneumonia. Discriminant abilities of the algorithm were moderate to low (LR + = 2.12 for viral and 6.29 for bacterial pneumonia) and discriminant abilities of experts were low to very low (LR + = 3.81 for viral and 1.89 for bacterial pneumonia). Conclusion: Our study shows that neither experts nor mathematical algorithm can predict the microbial etiology of sCAP within the first hours of hospitalization while there is an urge to define anti-infective therapeutic strategy. Our results highlight the need of developing point-of-care tests for rapid microbial diagnosis. It is a retrospective work, carried out over a year. Consecutive patients with approved SBP admitted in our department are included. All clinical and biological data were collected from the medical records. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the associated factors of death. Results: A total of 64 patients diagnosed with SBP and cirrhosis were enrolled in this study. Mean of age was 62.05 (18-88). Sex ratio = 1. HCV (39%) was the main etiology of cirrhosis. at least one complication occurred during the evolution in 32.8%. The septic shock was found in12.5%. six patients died of SBP (9.4%). There were no significant differences in the sex, aetiology of cirrhosis, ascites abundance, receiving prophylactic antibiotics between the surviving group and the patients who died. However there was a statistically significant association between mortality and onset of complication (P = 0.00), low systolic (P = 0.003) and diastolic blood (P = 0.000) pressure and tachycardia ((P = 0.005) at admission. empiric antibiotic therapy was statically a preventive factor (P = 0.039). Conclusion: SBP is a serious event in the history of cirrhotic disease. Particular caution must be exercised with regard to any state of hemodynamic instability present at admission. adequate empirical treatment would improve prognosis.  We perform a prospective epidemiological multi-center study and included all consecutively hospitalized adult patients with IAI requiring a hospitalization in ICU. Cultures were performed on blood simple and intra-operative samples of peritoneal fluid or purulent exudate discrete abscesses. We evaluate the epidemiology and the factors associated with the isolation of a MDRO in enrolled patients. Results: Among 48 patients included in the study, a total of 62 microorganisms were isolated from intra-peritoneal fluid and blood samples in 56.3% of cultures, two or more pathogens were identified and in 5% candida spp. were identified. The MDROs represented 9.9% of the total of isolated microorganisms. Among this patients, 75% of MDROs colonization was found before or just after surgery and 25% were acquired during hospitalization. The MDROs were more frequently isolated in patients with health-care-associated IAIs (25.4%). Uninominal logistic regression analysis of risk factors demonstrated that statistically significant risk factors independently associated with the occurrence of MDROs IAI were previous know carrying at MDROs and antimicrobial therapy administered within 3 month before operation. We retrospectively included all patients aged 75 or older, admitted in 4 intensive care units (1 university-and 3 non university hospitals) after OHCA between January 2009 and December 2016. Cardiac arrest and patients characteristics have been collected and the Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis (CAHP) score has been calculated. The primary outcome was the neurocognitive function assessed by the cerebral performance category on hospital discharge. Results: During the study period, 176 patients were included (median age 81 [79-84], 72% male). Most of the patients presented significant comorbid condition (median Charlson index 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] ). Sixty-eight patients had initial shockable rhythm (38.6%). Hundred sixty-six patients presented without obvious extra-cardiac cause. PCI was performed in 63 (35.8%) patients. The number of non-neurologic organ failure on admission was lower in patients with favorable outcome. All patients who received renal replacement therapy had an unfavourable outcome. The rate of favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was 9% (16 patients) including 14 patients with initial first shockable rhythm. At 6 months, this rate decreases to 6% (11 patients), including 9 patients with initial first shockable rhythm. According to the CAHP score, 21 patients had a low risk of poor neurological outcome, 44 had an intermediate risk and 70 had a high risk. Based on this CAHP score stratification, 14 patients (66.7%) in the low risk group, 21 patients (44.7) in the intermediate risk group and 18 patients (25.7%) in the high-risk group underwent early PCI. Conclusion: Survival of elderly patients is low after OHCA, especially for patients with first non shockable rhythm. However, patients with first shockable rhythm and low risk of death may have favorable long term outcome. The level of organ failure seems to be strongly associated with prognosis. Stratification by CAHP score suggest that the use of PCI coud be improved with a better selection of patients likely to benefit from it. We performed an analysis on a merged database of the Toronto Regional RescuNet Epistry database (prehospital data) and administrative population-based databases in Ontario. All non-traumatic OHCA patients over 18 years of age treated by the EMS between January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2014, were included in this study. The primary outcome was per patient longitudinal cumulative healthcare costs, from time of collapse to a maximum fol-low&#8208 + up until death or 30 days after the event. We included all available cost sectors, from the perspective of the health system payer. We used multivariable generalized linear models with a logarithmic link and a gamma distribution to determine predictors of healthcare costs. In-hospital costs accounted for 93% of total costs. After adjustment for age and gender, rate of patient survival was the main driver of total costs-the rate ratio was 3.88 (95% confidence interval 3.80, 3.95), 49.46 and 148.89 for patients who died in the ED, patients who died after the ED but within 30 days, and patients who were still alive at day-30 compared to patients who were pronounced dead on scene, respectively. Factors independently associated with costs were the number of prehospital teams, the need for hospital transfer, coronary angiography and targeted temperature management. Conclusion: Clinical outcome is the main driver of total costs of treating OHCA patients in a large Canadian health system. Potentially modifiable factors include the number of prehospital teams that arrive to the scene of the arrest and the need for between-hospital transfers after successful resuscitation. We conducted a monocentric retrospective, observational, cohort study between November 1996 and September 2018. We included all patients with SLE (defined using the American College of Rheumatology 1997 criterion) and AIP (defined as acute respiratory manifestation with diffuse pulmonary opacities on chest radiography or lung tomography and exclusion of alternate diagnosis including acute respiratory infection). Results: Fourteen patients (male female sex ratio, 0.3 + mean ± SD age, 23.7 ± 10.6 years) presenting 16 episodes were included. AIP was present at disease onset or during the first year after SLE diagnosis in respectively 9 14 (64%) and 5 14 (36%) patients. Eleven (68.8%) episodes required ICU admission because of respiratory failure with 7 11 (63.6%) episodes requiring mechanical ventilation and 2 11 (18.2%) VV-ECMO. Median Introduction: Severe pneumonia is frequently associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lung is a key factor in the transition from pneumonia to ARDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. To assess this, a heterogeneous population of T lymphocytes called "unconventional T cells" (UTC) deserves greater attention. These cells comprise Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) and Gamma Delta T cells. Pre-clinical studies have shown their versatile properties and their key role in immune responses against invading pathogens. Thus, we hypothesize that a tight regulation of their functions is mandatory to fine-tune the host inflammatory response in the infected lungs, and, subsequently to prevent emergence of an aberrant response leading to tissue damages. Despite this strong rationale, human data are however lacking. Patients and methods: Single-center prospective study on patients hospitalized in intensive care for severe pneumonia. From blood and respiratory samples, we performed a flow cytometry-based analysis of these cells in order to determine-(1) their frequency at different time-points during hospitalization, (2) the presence of activating regulating markers (CD69 and PD-1), (3) their ability to produce cytokines involved in ARDS pathogenesis and (4) their cytotoxic capacity. Results: 26 patients have been included to date, that were compared to healthy controls. Half of the patients presented ARDS, and median SAPSII was 35.5 (30-51). In patients with severe pneumonia, we observed a striking decrease in circulating MAIT cells, compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1A) , but not for NKT or Gamma Delta T cells. This observation may suggest a recruitment of these cells to inflammatory site since a high proportion of MAIT cells can be detected in respiratory fluids of some patients with ARDS. In addition, circulating MAIT cells of patients expressed high levels of CD69 and PD-1 (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, the proportion of CD69 + MAIT cells decreased with clinical improvement, while proportion of PD-1 + remained stable. Upon ex vivo stimulation, proportion of IFN-gamma-producing MAIT cells was significantly decreased in patients, compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1C) , while proportions of IL-17 and TNF-alpha-producing MAIT cells were similar. Conclusion: MAIT cells are recruited, activated and have an altered cytokine profile secretion during severe pneumonia. These preliminary data justify pursuing in-depth analysis of MAIT cell functions in patients, in correlation with clinical condition. Introduction: Venoarterial ECMO-treated patients present many risk factors of breathing failure associated to heart failure. It seems essential to optimize the ventilatory parameters in order to limit lung injuries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of electrical impedance tomography to set the optimal level of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). We performed an alveolar recruitment maneuver followed by a decremental PEEP trial (from 20 to 5 cmH2O) with 5cmH2O decrements. Thanks to clinical and ultrasonographic parameters (heart and lung), we define an optimal PEP according to respiratory criteria (PEEPlung), then an adjustment according to hemodynamic and cardiac tolerances defines the PEPheart + lung. EIT datas (regional distribution of ventilation, z-compliance, overdistension collapsus ODCL and global inhomogeneity index GI) were recorded during the procedure and analyzed retrospectively to define the optimal PEEPs-PEEPCOMP, PEEPODCL, PEEPGI. A Friedman test compares the different optimal PEEPs between them, as well as the regional ventilation distribution at the 4 PEP levels. Agreement between PEEPlung and other measured PEEPs was analyzed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: 23 patients were included and analyzed during a 9 months period. PEEP decreasing increments ventilation in the ventral region from 12 to 22% (corresponding to overdistension), and a decrease in the dorsal region from 11 to 5% reflecting collapse. The collapse (CL) is maximum at PEEP5 29% [21-45.8], and the distension is maximum at PEEP20cmH20 34% [24. . There is no significant difference between the different optimal PEEPs. The agreement is average between PEEPlung and optimal PEEP calculated from the EIT parameters (kappas 0.41 and 0.47). Our choice of PEEPlung is questionable because based on the global static respiratory compliance parameter that is measured on a single respiratory cycle. Measuring transpulmonary pressures could precise our measurements. PEPlung is statistically higher than the PEPheart + lung (p < 0.05), reflecting a bad hemodynamic tolerance of high levels of PEEP due to a complex phenomenon of heart-lung interactions. Conclusion: EIT helps find the best compromise between overdistension and lung collapse, and detect regional distributions of the mechanical ventilation effects. However, evaluation of the chosen PEEP hemodynamic tolerance is necessary. The association EIT-echocardiography seems to be an efficient tool to provide monitoring of the PEEP effects. 1) . Conclusion: Changes in CVP during PLR are not useful at the bedside to predict preload unresponsiveness in critically ill patients. We performed a retrospective analysis all of the deaths following a withdrawal of life sustaining support treatment (WLST) in intensive care unit (ICU) in 2015, using data from medical record. Primary endpoint was to identify how many patients could be NHBD M3. Eligibly criteria were-death in ICU after WLST, age between 18 and 65 years, major brain damage with no hope for recovery. Were excluded patients who present a contraindication of organ donation. Results: In 2015, 68 patients died after WLST and 29 were 65 year old or less. We excluded 13 patients-7 patients with cancer, 4 patients with multiple organ failures, 1 patient died before WLST, 1 patient was not brain injured. 16 patients could be NHBD M3 with a median age of 49[39-58], 80% were men. The cause of brain damage was for 11 patients a post anoxic encephalopathy, 3 subarachnoid hemorrhage, and for 2 patients brain trauma. The examination of medical record suggests that 15 patients could donate their kidneys and 11 patients could donate their liver (based on data few days before death). 50% patients died in the 3 h after WLST, and 1 patient has an uncontrolled infection which left 7 potential kidney donors and 5 potential liver donors. Conclusion: In 2015, 16 patients were identified to be potentially a NHBD M3 in CHU Besancon in addition to 28 DBD. The data shows that patients were young and in good health which suggest a great quality of graft despite potential warm ischemic injuries due to the NHBD. Positive experience of the other hospitals since 2014 encourages us to initiate our program. Introduction: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive examination that allows velocimetric study of intracranial vessels via an ultrasound beam. The authors propose to study the statistical and therapeutic impact of TCD and trauma coma databank (TCDB) data coupling in moderate cranial trauma in ED. This was a 12-month prospective study, including all patients > 15 years old, who had moderate head injury (GCS 9 to 13), initially admitted to the vital emergency room, and having immediately benefited from a cranio-cerebral CT and a DTC within 12 h post-admission, without respiratory and or hemodynamic distress and without gasometric anomalies (normal PaCO2 and absence of anemia). TDM allowed to distinguish 6 classes of trauma coma databank. The measurement of DTP was considered from a stable pattern over ten cardiac cycles. The parameters measured were-systolic velocimetry (SV), mean velocimetry (MV), and diastolic velocimetry (DV) as well as the pulsatility index (PI). The cerebral perfusion pressure was deduced by the equation-MAP x (DV MV) + 14. The data collection was concerned with demographic data, vital parameters and neurological deterioration at H48. The statistical analysis was univariate, (p < 0.05). Results: 32 patients were included in this study, divided into two groups-group 1 (n = 22 69%) without neurological deterioration, and group 2 (n = 10 21%) with neurological deterioration. The mean age of the two groups was 36.56 ± 20.09 years, with a sex ratio of 16H 6 for group 1 and 7H 3F for group 2. The average initial GCS was 12 15 for the group 1 and 10 15 for group 2. 20 patients in group 1 had a TCDB of 1 to 2, while only 2 had a TCDB of 3 to 5. In group 2, 6 patients had a TCDB of 1 to 2, and 4 patients had a TCDB of 3 to 5. The PI of group 1 was 1.26 ± 0.60, while the PI of group 2 was 1.74 ± 0.26. The statistical performance of DTC, CTDB, and DTC CTDB coupling for the occurrence of neurological worsening is illustrated in the following table 1. We have analyzed all the records of cancer patients admitted for an infection from 01 01 2013 to 31 12 2016 in our oncological ICU. For all them, we have calculated the SOFA, qSOFA and SIRS scores. We have tried to determine the most accurate score to predict hospital mortality. We also have compared the new and the old definitions of septic shock. Finally, we have analyzed the prognostic factors for hospital mortality. Results: Our study includes 353 patients-241 with a solid tumor (of whom 177 have metastasis) and 112 with a hematological malignancy (of whom 30 allografts). The hospital mortality rate is 37% (68% in patients with septic shock according to the new definition and 60% according to the old definition). 92% of patients have a SOFA score increased by more than 2 points since the admission in the ICU, 63% have a qSOFA > or = 2 and 99% a SIRS score > or = 2. The SOFA score reaches the best diagnostic performance to predict hospital mortality + Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.74 compared to AUC 0.65 for qSOFA and 0.58 for the SIRS score. In multivariate analysis, a higher SOFA score or a higher qSOFA score predicts poor prognosis-odds ratio (OR) per one-point increase 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.39) and 1.48 (95% CI, 1.04 to 2.11), respectively, while complete remission of cancer is a good prognostic factor for hospital mortality-OR 0.39 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.67). We conducted an observational retrospective study in Institut Paoli-Calmettes, a cancer-referral center. Between 2008 and 2015, 124 critically ill cancer patients with mixed ARF were analyzed. Factors associated with ICU mortality, using univariate, multivariate and matched propensity score analysis, were evaluated. Results: ICU and hospital mortality were 29% and 57%. Initial ventilation strategy at ICU admission consisted of mechanical ventilation (MV) in 21%. Others patients received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in 50%, associated with oxygen in 21% and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in 29%, HFNO alone in 6% and standard oxygen in 23%. During ICU stay, 48% of patients required intubation. Multivariate analysis identified 3 independent factors associated with ICU mortality-SAPSII at admission (OR = 1.07 point, 95%CI = 1.03-1.11, p < 0.001), invasive fungal infection (OR = 7.65, 95%CI = 1.7-34.6, p = 0.008) and initial ventilation strategy (p = 0.015). Compared to NIV, HFNO alone and standard oxygen alone were associated with an increased ICU mortality, with respective OR of 19.56 (p = 0.01) and 10.72 (p = 0.01). We subsequently realized a propensity score analysis including 40 matched patients, 20 in the NIV arm and 20 receiving other ventilation strategies, excluding initial MV patients. ICU mortality rate was significantly lower in patients treated with NIV (10%), versus 50% in patients receiving other ventilation strategies (p = 0.037). Conclusion: For onco-hematology patients presenting with mixed ARF, severity at ICU admission, invasive fungal infections and initial ventilation strategy were independently associated with ICU mortality. NIV was a protective factor on ICU mortality. NIV should be evaluated for mixed ARF in cancer patients. Results: One hundred and two patients were included, among them 58 and 44 in medical intensive care and surgical intensive care units, respectively. The overall mortality was 29%. All the deceased patients had pancreatitis classified as severe. SOFA score at admission was significantly lower for survivors than for non-survivors, respectively 8 (IQ -5-11) and 12 (9-16) p < 0.0001. IGS II score was also significantly lower among survivors than among non-survivors. The mortality rates were similar in patients with or without necrosis infection. In univariate analysis, sofa score at admission, multiple organ failure, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia and haemoconcentration were associated with death, as well as the need for renal replacement therapy and mesenteric ischemia during ICU stay. In different models of multivariate analysis, the SOFA score at ICU 17.5 ± 11.22 and 6.35 ± 4.11. Acquired liver dysfunction occurred with a median delay of one day [1 + 6] . Thirty-eight patients (81%) had hepatic cytolysis, 22 (46, 8%) had GGT elevation, 18 (38, 3%) had bilirubin elevation and nine (19, 1%) had ALP elevation. Twelve patients (25, 53%) had hepato-biliary imaging and the diagnosis of cholecystitis was retained only in one case. All patients had serology of hepatic viruses, they were all-negative except one. Fifty-nine episodes have been collected. Median number of hepatic dysfunction episodes per patient was one [1 + 2], ten patients had two episodes. Retained etiologies were-multifactorial in forty cases (sepsis, hypoxia, drug toxicity), sepsis in seven cases and drug toxicity in two cases. Compared to group control (25 patients), mortality was higher (34% vs 16%, p = 0.09) and length of stay was more prolonged (15 vs 13 days, p = 0.7) but the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Liver abnormalities are common in intensive care. Multifactorial liver dysfunction were the most frequent in our population. Drug toxicity was commonly suspected but it was difficult to retain it as the only incriminated factor. Introduction: Encephalopathy is a common complication of liver disease and/or portosystemic shunts. Its pathophysiology is not completely understood; mechanisms include the role of elevated ammonia levels in association with systemic inflammation. An impairment of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is also hypothetised. Metabolomics enables to detect a wide range of metabolites without any a priori. In a recent metabolomic study including patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, our group outlined that xenobiotics/drugs that usually don't cross BBB were retrieved in the CSF, suggesting a potential neurological toxicity of drugs. CSF collection is invasive. Hence, we aimed to describe the xenobiotics present in the plasma of cirrhotic patients, using the same metabolomic approach. We conducted a retrospective study of plasma samples in the Hepatological ICU. Plasma samples from cirrhotic patients displaying encephalopathy were compared to plasma from cirrhotic patients without neurological symptoms, and to plasma from healthy controls. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed and then after the metabolic fingerprints were compared to database and between the different groups. , alcohol 38%) and 9 healthy controls. Among 495 identified metabolites, 25 corresponded to xenobiotics or its derivatives. Fluoxetine was detected with a more than 200 fold increase, aminosalicylic acid with a more than 10 fold increase and benzyl alcohol (present in cough pills and antiseptics) with a 3 fold increase in cirrhotic patients with encephalopathy as compared to cirrhotic patients. In cirrhotic patients with or without encephalopathy, propranolol was detected with a more than 8500 fold increase, acetaminophen with a 40 fold increase, penicillamine and ampicillin both with a 2 fold increase as compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, several substances which were not expected to have systemic diffusion were detected in cirrhotic patients and in healthy controls-eugenol, isoeugenol (used in mouth bathing solution), triethanolamine (trolamin, used in cutaneous creams) and resorcinol monoacetate (used in mouth bathing solution and in cutaneous creams). Conclusion: Cirrhotic patients, especially those with neurological symptoms, display dramatically increased levels of several xenobiotics in plasma. These results confirm that PK PD parameters of commonly used drugs are highly modified in those patients. This suggests a potential role of xenobiotics in the pathophysiology of encephalopathy in patients with liver diseases.
