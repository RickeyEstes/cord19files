A total of 769 samples were submitted to the Livestock Animal Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University in Nakhon Pathom province between May 2011 and August 2016. These represent archived and convenient samples from 123 commercial pig farms located throughout Thailand (Fig. S1 ). Most of the samples were primarily submitted from the central part of Thailand where the majority of swine farms are located. Samples were from western provinces (Kanchanaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Phetchaburi, and Ratchaburi; n ¼ 316), central provinces (Lop Buri, Samut Songkhram, Suphan Buri, Saraburi, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, and Nakhon Pathom; n ¼ 173), eastern provinces (Chon Buri and Chachoengsao, n ¼ 109), northeastern provinces (Ubon Ratchathani, Udon Thani, and Nakhon Ratchasima, n ¼ 80), southern provinces (Trang and Nakhon Si Thammarat, n ¼ 26), and from unspecified locations (n ¼ 65). Feces (n ¼ 509) and small intestinal content (intestinal mucosa of the duodenum and upper part of jejunum from tissues scraping, n ¼ 260) from diarrheic pigs were prepared as 10% (w/v) suspension in sterile phosphate buffered saline. Clarified filtrates were collected after centrifugation at 3,000Âg for 20 min. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC number 1731020) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC number 1731008) of Chulalongkorn University approved this study.
