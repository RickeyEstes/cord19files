All the calves used in these experiments were delivered and reared according to gnotobiological techniques. Seven gnotobiotic calves were delivered either by aseptic c~esarian section [13] , or by septic caesarian section and transfer to an isolator through an antiseptic liquid chamber [4] , or per vaginam with decontamination by antibiotics [5] (table I) . Three of the calves were not inoculated and served as control. The wild rotavirus was supplied by Dr Scherrer and inoculated as previously described [6] . Using general anaesthesia, samples for histological examination were obtained at different times after inoculation from the following location of the gastro-intestinat tract: the antral area o[ the abomasum, duodenum (distal to the pancreatic duct), middle jejunum, ileum (50 cm before the ileo-caecal valve), caecum (opposite the ileal-c~ecal valve) and spiral colon. [16] . For scanning electron microscopy (SEN), samples were prepared as previously reported [3] . For light microscopy (LM), samples were fixed in Baker's formol mixture, cut into 7 ~m sections and stained either with Giemsa or Aleian blue-PAS with a general eosin staining. Histological analysis of the quantity of mucus present in the tissues was carried out on the sections stained with Alcian blue-PAS. This analysis was performed with a (( Wild )) microscope connected to a surface analyser (prototype apparatus) which converts the optical image to an electronic signal by a television camera (I.T.C.). A synthetiser linked to a television screen allows the comparison of the reconstructed image with the real one, after regulation of the selection thresholds of analyser. When both images are superposed, the analyser converts the surface of each selected shade into arbitrary proportional values. It is then possible to determine the ratio (R) between the surface area of the secretory granules of the goblet cells (stained purple by the Aleian blue-PAS) and the total surface area of tile intestinal tissue (stained pink by the eosin). In this manner, measurements are not made by image intensity, but only by surface area. Surfaces areas of the goblet cells and therefore their volume, are related to their mucus content. Bacteriological tests were performed on the faeces of the animals. Samples were examined microscopically, stained by the Gram stain and inoculated on the following media: tryptiease soja broth (B. D. Merieux) and agar slant, thioglycollate broth (Difco) inoculated before and after heating the faeces at 75 ~ C for 10 rain. The incubation was made at 37 ~ C and results checked after 24, 48, 72 h and after 1 week.
