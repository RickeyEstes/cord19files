We studied 69 patients who met the clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of definite MS.20-23 All had exacerbating/ remitting disease (stable or progressive) and high prestudy exacerbation rates (at least 0-6 per year). The prestudy duration of illness was at least 1 year in all but 2 patients (5 months, 10 months), who were included because they clearly had MS (recently revised criteria23) with high exacerbation rates. Each patient underwent a complete neurological examination at the beginning of the study, and the severity of symptoms and signs was scored according to a modified Kurtzke method."-24 The prestudy exacerbation rate was determined by dividing the total number of exacerbations (standard definitionz&deg;-z3) recorded before the study by the duration of disease up to the time of randomisation. In the 2 patients who had had MS for less than a year, the number of exacerbations recorded before the study was considered as the number that would have occurred in a full year (ie, we did not adjust their rates upward to compensate for their shorter disease durations). Patients were then randomly assigned (biased coin) to the recipient or control group by means of stratification based on prestudy exacerbation rate (ie, less than two exacerbations/year; two or more exacerbations/year). The randomisation yielded recipient and control populations with similar mean prestudy exacerbation rates (recipients 1 79, controls 1-98 per year). There were no meaningful differences in other clinical parameters between the two groups (eg, age, sex, prestudy disease duration, disability status, and functional group scores). Patients were re-examined regularly or whenever they felt they might be having an exacerbation, exacerbations, clinical disability status, functional group scores, and an overall assessment of the patient's clinical condition (improved, unchanged, worsened) were recorded. Exacerbations were treated by intramuscular or intravenous corticotropin daily for 10 days. Such treatment may limit the severity of symptoms and signs of exacerbations but does not prevent their recurrence. 21 Exacerbation rates during the study were calculated from the number of exacerbations occurring during the study and the time on the study. A one-tailed t statistic was used to test the effect of treatment on changes in exacerbation rate. The statistical plan, based on data from our preliminary study was designed to detect a true difference in exacerbation-rate reductions between recipients and controls of 0-65 exacerbations per year at a type I error level of 0-05 with a power of 0,80.19 The IFN-B used was produced by superinduction of human fibroblast cells at Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo.l The preparation had a specific activity of 1 x 107 interferon reference units of IFN-B per mg protein. It was the same type as that used in the preliminary study and had passed the toxicity and safety tests required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA IND no 1325). IFN-B was given to the recipients by serial lumbar punctures carried out weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once a month for the next 5 months of the study (ie, nine lumbar punctures during the first 6 months of the study). The dose to each recipient was 1 x 106 ' interferon reference units at each treatment, except that at one centre patients received two half-dose treatments in the first week and then 1 x 106 interferon reference units at all the other treatments (ie, ten lumbar punctures during the first 6 months of the study). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was withdrawn for analysis before the injection of IFN-B at each lumbar puncture. Recipients also underwent a lumbar puncture after 2 years on the study so that CSF could be obtained for analysis. Control patients underwent placebo treatments according to the same schedule as the recipients. However, true lumbar punctures were carried out only at the beginning, after 6 months, and after 2 years on the study to obtain CSF for analysis; the remainder were false lumbar punctures in which the routine procedure (eg, positioning, draping, skin cleansing, local anaesthetic) was followed but the needle was advanced only into the subcutaneous tissues, where 5 ml sterile water was injected. Recipients took indomethacin 25-50 mg every 6 h for 24 h after each treatment; controls took indomethacin (same dose) or placebo capsules according to the same schedule. Indomethacin, so administered, is known to reduce the side-effects of intrathecal interferon, which helped blinding of the patients .21 Treatments were carried out by a "treating" physician in an outpatient treatment room at each centre; afterwards the patient's vital signs were monitored. The initial and subsequent examinations, assessing exacerbations and clinical status, were carried out by a separate "examining" physician at each centre who was not aware what treatment the patient had received. Patients did not discuss side-effects of treatments with the examining physician. Questionnaires completed by the patients and examining physicians during the study confirmed that both groups were blinded. A chi-square statistic based on a 3 x 2 table, testing the independence of each individual's impression (IFN-B, placebo, unknown) from actual therapy received yielded an examining physician p = 0-66 and a patient's p=0'07. The questionnaires also revealed that most patients who had an opinion believed they were receiving IFN-B (79-3% of recipients, 63-6% of controls).
