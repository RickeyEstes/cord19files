Delivery of GF rats can be accomplished by a twostage hysterectomy technique or by a single-stage hysterotomy procedure (Foster et al., 1967b; Wostmann, 1970; Pollard, 1971a) . In the latter procedure a plastic Mylar membrane in the floor of the isolator is sealed to the shaved and surgically prepared abdominal wall of the pregnant rat. The surgical technician performs the hysterotomy through the Mylar membrane window in the isolator floor. This method is more tedious than the preferred and more rapidly performed hysterectomy. In addition to speed, the hysterectomy method permits an almost mass production routine, since the two stages can be performed simultaneously by separate surgical teams. One team is responsible for the extra isolator phase, which consists of preparation, euthanasia, hysterectomy, and introduction of the uterus into the sterile surgical isolator. Another team of usually two technicians performs the actual cesarean, removing the fetuses from the uterus and its membranes. With proper planning and coordination, the two surgical teams can perform six to eight cesareans in one hour.
