A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the clinical data of all pilgrims who attended the emergency department of Al-Ansar general hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia during the Hajj days (15th Dhul Qaida to 15th Moharram) of the years 1425 to 1435 H (December 2004-November 2013 AD) with a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia. The analyzed data included age, gender, nationality, co-morbid diseases, the length of stay in the hospital (ward and ICU), the result of the sputum cultures, the mode of management, and the outcome of treatment. The collected data were recorded on a digital database file, and statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software program (Release 22). Patients were assessed according to the CURB-65 scoring system; the score is an acronym for each of the risk factors measured. Each risk factor scores one point, for a maximum score of 5: -Confusion of new onset (defined as an AMTS of 8 or less). -Blood Urea nitrogen greater than 7 mmol/l (19 mg/dL). -Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute or greater. -Blood pressure less than 90 mmHg systolic or diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg or less. -age 65 or older. A chest X-ray was performed on all of the patients in the emergency department to collect baseline study. Follow-up X-ray images were performed in the ICU or the radiology department to evaluate the treatment outcome daily. Sputum and blood samples were collected from all patients for culture prior to administration of antibiotics. Samples were tested for bacteria for the possible presence of typical or atypical causative agents. The treatment protocol consisted of the use of empirical antibiotics after sputum and blood samples, then the antibiotics were replaced according to the specific causative pathogens depending on the culture result.
