FSS-RNA and DNA were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and assessed for purity and structure using thermal melting protocols. Yeast tRNA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Amino acids were purchased from P3Bio and used as received. Fluorescence Titration. Fluorescence titrations were carried out in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 , using a Horiba FluoroMax 4 fluorometer. All titrations started at a volume of 500 μL with the compound at 20−500 nM. The concentration was chosen based on a preliminary titration using 1 μM compound to get a first approximation of the binding affinity and then lowered to more accurately measure the affinity. RNA was then titrated in from a high concentration stock (0.5−10 μM for HIV-1 FSS RNA; 10 μM for HIV-1 FSS DNA and tRNA) in 1−10 μL increments. After RNA was added, the solution was thoroughly mixed in the cuvette via pipetting and allowed to stand for 10 min to reach equilibrium. Each measurement was taken three times with a 1 min waiting period between scans to confirm equilibrium was reached. Intensities were corrected for dilution. All titrations were completed twice. Surface Plasmon Resonance. SPR was conducted using a Biacore X (Biacore, Inc.). Compounds were injected at a flow rate of 30 μL/min in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl for 2 min. Flow was then maintained for at least 1 h to allow for dissociation. Each injection was repeated twice for consistency. Each trace was fit individually to a mass transfer model. Cell Toxicity. HEK293T cells were plated at 1 × 10 4 cells/well in a 96 well plate in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% anti−anti (penicillin-streptomycin + fungizone) at 37°C. After cells were allowed to adhere for 6 h, they were then incubated with the compound for 24 h in triplicate. A total of 10 μL of WST-1 premix (Clontech) was added and incubated for 1 h followed by measurement using a PerkinElmer EnSpire plate reader. Flow Cytometry. HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C to 80% confluency in a 12-well plate and treated with the compound for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed twice with DPBS (Gibco). Cells were then resuspended in 300 μL ice cold DPBS and incubated with 5 μL of propidium iodide to stain dead cells. A total of 10 000 events were collected using a BD LSR-II flow cytometer. HIV-1 Infectivity. The antiviral activity of all RNA-targeted compounds was measured by single-round infectivity assay with pseudotyped HIV-1 using HEK293T producer cells. The HIV-1 proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) includes all HIV-1 NL4−3 genes except nef (replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein. A single-round infectivity assay was conducted by transient transfection of the viral vector with VSV-G coat protein vector at a ratio of 1:0.5 using Fugene HD (Promega). The virus producer cells were dosed with compounds 4 h after transfection, and viral particles were harvested from the media 24 h after transfecting by filtering through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Viral load was normalized with a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). The infections were performed using TZM-bl reporter cells containing stably integrated firefly luciferase, the expression of which is driven by the HIV-LTR promoter. Therefore, luciferase is expressed upon successful HIV infection. Triplicate infections in 96well plates at 10 000 cells/well with 500 pg p24/well proceeded for 48 h before the addition of SteadyGlo reagent (Promega) to each well for 30 min. Luminescence was measured as a quantitative metric for changes in viral infectivity in the presence of a compound. Protease Inhibition. The protease inhibition kit was purchased from Protein One and used as instructed. HIV-1 Protease was incubated at RT with no compound, a protease inhibitor, or compound for 90 min in the presence of the peptide FRET substrate. Each condition was made in triplicate in a 96 well plate, and the fluorescence was measured using 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a PerkinElmer EnSPire plate reader.
