Products Eight commercial products were tested, all manufactured by and obtained from Bode Chemie GmbH & Co., Hamburg, Germany. Four were alcohol-based hand disinfectants: Sterillium, based on 45% iso-propanol, 30% n-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate; Sterillium Rub, based on 80% ethanol; Sterillium Gel, based on 85% ethanol; and Sterillium Virugard, based on 95% ethanol. All alcohol-based hand rubs were tested without dilution. Three products were surface disinfectants: Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Korsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; and Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate. The surface disinfectants were tested at the recommended concentration for the recommended application time at which they have been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions. 15 The instrument disinfectant Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy) dimethanol, was included due to the possible transmission of SARS-CoV by flexible bronchoscopes. The product was tested at the recommended concentration and application time that has been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions. 15 Test procedure Viruses and cells SARS-CoV isolate FFM-1 16 was obtained from the sputum of a patient hospitalized with a diagnosis of probable SARS in the Isolation Unit of Frankfurt University Hospital, Germany. SARS-CoV were grown in Vero cell cultures (African green monkey kidney, ATCC no. CCL-81). The maintenance medium consisted of minimum essential medium (MEM) without fetal calf serum (FCS) and containing 100 IU/mL of penicillin and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin. Virus stock was stored at K80 8C. Infectious virus titres were calculated as described by KÃ¤rber 17 and Spearman, 18 and determined as 50% tissue culture infective doses. Different virus stocks were used for the experiments. The initial log 10 virus titres were between 8.93G0.25 and 9.30G0.38. In accordance with WHO recommendations, all work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed under biosafety level (BSL)-3 conditions in a BSL-3 facility.
