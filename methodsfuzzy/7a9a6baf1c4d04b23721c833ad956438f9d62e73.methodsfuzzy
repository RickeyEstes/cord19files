Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stable Selection SK-HEP-1, Huh7 (Huh7.5.1), Hep3B, and HA22T HCC cancer cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin, and 1% L-glutamine at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 and 95% air. For primary cell culture, HCC 71T and 89T cells were isolated by Dr. Hung-Wei Pan from surgically resected HCC patients, which was approved by Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (IRB protocol: VGHKS13-CT3-009). The primary HCC cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (15 ng/mL), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), L-glutamine (2 mM/L), insulin growth factor (4 U/L), and B27 supplement (1:50). For spheroid cell culture, HCC cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 10 4 cells/well in 24-well NanoCulture plates (1.9 cm 2 , SCIVAX Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan). The cells were cultured for 7 days until spheroid formation (diameter > 0.1 mm). For gene knockdown with siRNA, the cells were transfected with 5 nM scramble siRNA or siRNA against Src kinase (6714, Dhamacon, Lafayette, CO) for 72 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (13778-150, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For lentivirus infection, HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 2 µg scramble short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or shRNA against MAP3K7 (TRCN0000195383), AURKA (TRCN0000010533), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (TRCN0000121325), or phosphoinositide-3kinase-catalytic-alpha (PIK3CA) (TRCN0000196795) using 1 µL Lipofectamine 2000 (11668027, Invitrogen) for 16 h. The transfected cells were washed with medium and incubated for 48 h. The cell debris was removed with 0.45 µm filter and the supernatant was used to infect HCC cells with 10 µg/mL polybrene (TR-1003-G, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 24 h. The cells were then maintained in culture medium with 1 µg puromycin and the medium was refreshed every 3 days to obtain stable cell lines. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR.
