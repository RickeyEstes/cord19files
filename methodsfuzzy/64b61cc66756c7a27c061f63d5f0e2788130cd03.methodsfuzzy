All drugs and reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. All oligoribonucleotides and oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesizer and purified by gel electrophoresis. Biotin-linked oligomers were synthesized by incorporating the biotin synthon at the 5â€²-end; the oligomers were then immobilized to streptavidincoated biosensor chips for the SPR experiments.
