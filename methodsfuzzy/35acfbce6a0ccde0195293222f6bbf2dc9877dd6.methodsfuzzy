To further validate the EBC-LAMP protocol, both EBC and throat swab samples were tested with a commercial LAMP detection unit (RTisochipTM-A, CapitalBio Tech CO., Ltd, Beijing) as shown in Table S1 . The unit is able to simultaneously screen thirteen kinds of pathogens for a given sample. A total of 69 throat swabs and 15 EBC specimens (The detail medical information of the corresponding patients was shown in Table S1 ) were screened using the device. As shown in Table S1 , Table 4 and Fig. 2 , for the exhaled breath condensate samples, four were detected positive with E. coli (66.7%), one for P. aeruginosa (16.7%) and one for MRSA (16.7%) respectively, while for one subject both MRSA and E. coli were detected in EBC. In addition, 25 (36.2%) out of 69 throat swabs specimens were tested positive for at least one type bacterial pathogen, including 5 (19.0%) specimens had two or three types of pathogens. Among them, H. influenzae showed obviously higher positive rates than other pathogens, which suggests that H. influenzae was the dominant bacteria responsible for upper respiratory tract infections. In addition to H. influenza, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia, S. aureus and MRSA were also detected both in the EBC and throat swab samples. For the same patients for whom both EBC and throat samples collected, there was a 53.3% agreement using the commercial LAMP method. As shown in Fig. 2 , the screening of pathogens using the commercial LAMP device showed different results from EBC specimens and throat swabs as listed in Table S1 . Similar to the results from the EBC-LAMP protocol developed in this work, the H. influenzae was again detected as the dominant pathogen with a positive rate 50.0% by the commercial unit, but none of the EBC samples (IDs: a single pathogen, only one type of pathogen was detected in one sample. b Multiple pathogens, more than one type of pathogen was detected in one sample. Fig. 2 . Bacterial pathogens detected in both 6 EBC and 30 throat swab samples using a commercialized LAMP device. The symbol on each bar was shown as positive rate for the respective pathogen type shown at the x-axis, which was calculated as the ratio of positive number of this type of pathogen over the number of total positive rate for all bacteria. The percentages and also #/# on the figure indicates the frequencies of the selected six pathogens that were detected in 25 throat swabs and 5 EBC samples shown in Table S1 . [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] 9) was found positive result with H. influenzae. As discussed above, H. influenzae was detected in EBC samples using the EBC-LAMP protocol developed in our work. One possible reason is that pathogen levels appeared to be lower in EBC samples than those in the throat swabs, thus the commercial device used here might not be able to detect them due to its detection limit. Besides, the commercial LAMP device (without disclosing their primer information) might have used different primers sets than what we have used as listed in Table 1 in our EBC-LAMP protocol. It is noted that we have also detected MRSA both in the EBC and the throat swab samples using the commercial device. At the same time, MRSA was also detected using the EBC-LAMP assay developed here. S. aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is now one of the most studied pathogens in community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections associated with high mortality, causing great concerns (Misawa et al., 2007) . Previous study has evaluated the airborne culturable MRSA in the Chinese public building, which demonstrated that MRSA could transmit in the ambient air (Li et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, the results from the commercial device further showed that different types of bacterial pathogens such as Pae, E. coli, and MRSA can be exhaled out. In this study, we further analyzed the white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil levels of patients who were found to be infected by bacterial pathogens using the EBC-LAMP and also the commercial LAMP device. Results are shown in Fig. 3 , and patients were grouped together if they were either infected by the same single bacterial pathogen or a group of pathogens, such as H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, S. maltophilia and MRSA. Clinical doctors often rely on the empirical diagnosis, with the normal reference ranges of white blood cells (WBC) and percentage of neutrophils are 3.5-9.5*10 9 cells/L and 40-75%, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3 , for all patients infected by bacterial pathogens except one patient infected by E. coli all their average WBC levels appeared to be in the normal reference range. Even for the leading pathogen H. influenza, all the patients (N=10) had normal WBC levels. However, in clinical settings, e.g., in a respiratory clinic, these patients were generally treated as viral infections because of the normal WBC level. This means that a lot of flu patients could have been mis-treated in the hospitals where the WBC-infection-type rule as discussed are used. On the other hand, it seems that average neutrophils values appeared to be slightly higher than normally expected, e.g., for those infected by the leading pathogen H. influenza, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. maltophilia and also the combination of E. coli and H. influenza. The results from Fig. 3 indicate that empirical experiences, e.g., use of WBC for diagnosis of infection type (i.e., higher for bacterial infections), could be leading to wrong decisions with respect to the diagnosis and treatments. Nonetheless, this work was intended to evaluate which protocols are more efficient in terms with rapidly screening respiratory pathogens, but not on the pathogen infection mechanisms.
