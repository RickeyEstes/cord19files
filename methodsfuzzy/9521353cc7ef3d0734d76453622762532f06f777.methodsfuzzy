Nucleic acid extraction Several nucleic acid extraction methods were employed depending on the sample matrix. All extractions included known positive and negative samples as well as a water negative control. For intestinal swab specimens taken at postmortem and placed in virus transport medium, 500-ll samples were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy â Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, ON, Canada) following the manufacturer's instructions. This extraction method was used on the initial confirmatory submission received from the Animal Health Laboratory, Guelph. For rectal swab specimens taken from bioassay pigs and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 50-ll samples were extracted using the Mag-MAX TM -96 Viral Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) and a MagMAX TM Express-96 instrument. This high-throughput extraction method was used to deal with the large number of samples that were generated during the bioassay experiment. For pelleted feed and SDPP samples, 10% (wt/vol) emulsions were first prepared in sterile PBS and then vortexed thoroughly until fully suspended/dissolved. Three different methods were then evaluated for RNA extraction: (i) MagMAX TM -96 Viral Isolation Kit, (ii) Qiagen RNeasy â Mini Kit and (iii) Tri-Pure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA) . For the MagMAX TM -96 method, total RNA was extracted from 50 ll of the unclarified 10% emulsion and eluted in 20 ll of nuclease-free elution buffer. For the Qiagen RNeasy â Mini Kit method, the 10% emulsion was clarified by brief centrifugation and total RNA was extracted from 500 ll of the clarified supernatant and eluted in 50 ll of nuclease-free water. For the Tripure method, 100 ll of unclarified emulsion was added to 900 ll of Tripure Isolation Reagent and vortexed thoroughly. Two-hundred microlitres of chloroform was then added, the mixture vortexed thoroughly for~30 s and incubated for 10 min. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation and the aqueous phase added to an equal volume of isopropanol. The RNA precipitate was then pelleted, and the pellet dried and dissolved in 20 ll of nuclease-free water. In an attempt to better determine the state of PEDV in SDPP, a protocol using detergent treatment and differential centrifugation prior to MagMAX TM extraction was used. Ten grams of SDPP was prepared as a 10% (wt/vol) suspension in PBS with or without 0.25% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40 (Roche), a non-ionic, non-denaturing detergent. The suspension was first centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C and the resulting supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatants and pellets collected following both the 10 000 and 100 000 g centrifugation steps were then used for MagMax extraction.
