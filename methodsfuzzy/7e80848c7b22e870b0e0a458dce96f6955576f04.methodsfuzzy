Infomap), which calculates network partitioning based on the movement of a random walker on the network (see for details). In any given partition of the network, the random walker moves across nodes in proportion to the direction and weight of the edges. Hence, it will tend to stay longer in dense areas representing groups of, for example, viruses and hosts with high interaction density. These areas can be defined as 'modules'. The time spent in each module can be converted to an information-theoretic currency using an objective function called the Map equation and the 'best' network partition corresponds is the one that minimizes the Map Equation [62, 63] . For convenience we use the term 'modules', as it is commonly used to refer partitions of networks across different disciplines, but Infomap does not calculate a modularity function (sensu [64] ). We chose the map equation over the more commonly used modularity objective function because of the computational efficiency of its implementation (Infomap) [65] , given that we needed to analyze hundreds of thousands of networks. Our networks were bipartite and the modules we detect contain both sets of nodes. The input to Infomap was an edge list of the original bipartite network (as was done in other bipartite implementations of Infomap; [66] ). Specifically, we ran Infomap using: Infomap filename -N 20 --tree -2 --seed 123 -i link-list. Note that a unipartite representation of the same bipartite network obtained by using a block matrix-for example, using S 0 0 S T for the host-spacer network-would generate the same results.
