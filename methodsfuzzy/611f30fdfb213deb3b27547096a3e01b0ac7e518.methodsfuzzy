Pre-processing steps were performed and the raw reads quality of the extracted sequences was checked (using FastQC v0.11.2). Reads were trimmed with Phred scale quality threshold of 19 (representing the probability of an incorrect base call) allowing the reads to be truncated after base quality dropped below 18 (Phred scale). Reads IDs were edited (multiple_split_libraries_fastq.py, Qiime script) in order to be compatible for the following QIIME pipeline scripts. The 97% clustered Qiime formatted Greengenes v.13.8 reference database was used. Before the statistical analysis, alpha rarefaction and beta diversity were evaluated. Alpha rarefaction was an evaluation of within-sample diversity by species richness. A graphical alpha-rarefaction plot was created using Qiime pipeline. Beta diversity is an estimation of between-sample diversity by microbial profile. A graphical representation was calculated using Bray Curtis Qiime beta-diversity pipeline. Finally, statistical analyses were performed with "R" statistical software (software R v3.2; packages edgeR v3.10.5, Robinson M.D., 2010 and Phyloseq v1.14.0, McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Samples were assigned to groups relying on samples' metadata and the Taxonomy table (genus level) was normalized. For each group of samples, a statistical analysis was performed using the edgeR ExactTest function, to generate a list of statistically relevant taxonomies that are differentially present among the conditions. Exact test specifications for differential expression between two groups of taxonomy tables was performed. It implements the exact test proposed by Robinson and Smyth (2008) for a difference in mean between two groups of random variables following a negative binomial distribution. Finally, comparison of different phyla, classes and orders relative abundance among groups was performed using Analyse-it for Microsoft Excel. Specifically, a Kruskall-Wallis test was performed, followed, when statistically relevant results were found, by a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test, for the comparison between two groups. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
