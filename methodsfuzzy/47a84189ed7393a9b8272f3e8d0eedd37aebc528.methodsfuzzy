All patients in whom SARS was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization case definition 11 at either PWH or UCH during the period from March 10, 2003 , to April 28, 2003 , and who experienced a spontaneous pneumothorax to one or both pleural spaces during their hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the study. The World Health Organization case definition is as follows: history of high fever (ie, temperature, Ͼ 38°C); one or more respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing; and close contact within 10 days before the onset of symptoms with a person in whom SARS was diagnosed, history of travel within 10 days before the onset of symptoms to an area with reported foci of SARS transmission, or both. 11 Patients whose pneumothorax could be attributed to a preexisting pulmonary disease or to an iatrogenic cause (eg, barotrauma or invasive procedures to the chest or neck) were excluded from the study. At PWH, we were aware of four patients who developed pneumothorax secondary to mechanical ventilation (two patients) or central venous cannulation (two patients). As the causes of pneumothorax in these cases were clearly iatrogenic and not spontaneous, these patients were not included in our series. Six patients met the inclusion criteria for our study. Patients in cases 1 to 3 were admitted to PWH. Patients in cases 4 to 6 were all residents of Amoy Gardens and were admitted to UCH. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for these patients are summarized in Table 1 . The medical treatment protocol for SARS patients at both of our institutes is the same and has been previously reported. [7] [8] [9] All patients in this study received therapy with IV ribavirin (Rebetol; Schering-Plough; Kenilworth, NJ) and steroids (typically, methylprednisolone) according to this protocol.
