Ewens [41] and Etienne [42] sampling formula were used as the sampling models in this paper. Several studies have adopted these models to test the assembly and diversity maintenance mechanism of human microbial community. [38] [39] [40] Ewens sampling formula was put forward by Warren Ewens in 1972 for describing the differences in alleles. [41] In 2001, it was introduced into ecology area by Stephen Hubbell for calculating the likelihood of the presence of an ecological community consisting of S species with abundance of n 1 , n 2 , n 3 .. . n s and measuring its consistency with the prediction of neutral theory. The equation is given as follows: where, J represents the number of individuals in the community, f a expresses the number of species with abundance a, and n i is the abundance of the species I, and u denotes the biodiversity parameter with the following definition: where J M represents the number of individuals in the metacommunity and v is the per capita speciation rate. u could be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. If a community satisfies the neutral prediction, species in this community must have dispersal limitation. However, the effect of dispersal limitation is not taken into consideration in the Ewens sampling formula. Etienne introduced a new sampling model that considers the limited dispersal factor, which is defined as: where m is the immigration rate and defined as: and K(D, A) is defined as: and other parameters have the same definitions in the Ewens sampling formula. In fact, Ewens sampling formula can be viewed as a specific state of Etienne model with unlimited dispersal of individuals (m = 1). We adopted an exact neutrality test method [44] to test the statistical fitness of the neutral theory model to the dataset (for short, neutrality) in both Ewens and Etienne formula. In brief, we used the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for estimating the parameters based on the observed samples firstly with the R package untb (available at: https://cran.rproject.org/web/pack ages/untb/index.html). Secondly, for each sample, 100 artificial datasets were simulated with the parameters (u, I, J) which are estimated via observed samples. Then we used Etienne formula to calculate the likelihood for each artificial dataset (L 0 ) and corresponding observed sample (L 1 ). Finally, we compared L 0 and L 1 using a x 2 test in the following equation: The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the likelihood of the artificial dataset (L 0 ) and corresponding observed sample (L 1 ). If no significant difference was found (P value > .5), the microbial community is considered to satisfy the prediction of neutral theory.
