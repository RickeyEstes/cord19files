The following eight proteins with numerous mutations are used in this study. The copper-transporting ATPase 2 (ATP7B, Accession numbers for protein and DNA are P35670 and U11700 [19] ) with 125 point mutations [11] , the Bruton√ïs tyrosine kinase (BTK, Accession Nos. Q06187 and U10087) with 112 point mutations [12] , the haemoglobin a-chain (HBA, Accession Nos. P01922 and J00153) with 130 point mutations [13] , the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR, Accession Nos. P01130 and L00352) with 134 point mutations [14] , the human p53 protein (p53, Accession Nos. P04637 and M14695) with 192 point mutations [15] , the phenylalanine hydroxylase protein (PH4H, Accession Nos. P00439 and K03020) with 187 point mutations [16] , the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor (VHL, Accession Nos. P40337 and AF010238) with 108 point mutations [17] , and the human coronavirus OC43 (OC43, Accession Nos. P36334 and L14643) with 65 point mutations [18] . Translation probability of amino acid from RNA codon. The translation probability is calculated in the same way as shown in Table 2 for all RNA (Table 3) . Theoretical distribution of mutated amino acids. With the help of probability in Table 3 , we can construct a theoretical distribution of mutated amino acids. For example, we imagine that we would have a protein containing equal numbers of 20 types of amino acids. According to the probability in Table 3 , we would expect that the mutations would occur in a distribution pattern somewhat similar to that in Fig. 1 , say, the mutated amino acids have 5.8% chances of being alanine, and there are 5.5% chances for mutations to result in this imaging protein to be truncated because of the STOP codon. Similarly, with the composition of a protein, we can obtain the theoretical distribution of mutated amino acids such as eight highly mutated proteins in this study. Actual distribution of mutated amino acids. We can construct the actual distribution of mutated amino acids in proteins with numerous mutations. For instance, the recorded mutations in human p53 protein include the following mutated amino acids, 9 alanines, 9 arginines, 4 asparagines, 9 aspartic acids, 13 cysteines, 10 glutamines, 6 glutamic acids, 11 glycines, 10 histidines, 9 isoleucines, 14 leucines, 7 lysines, 5 methionines, 9 phenylalanines, 14 prolines, 18 serines, 13 threonines, 4 tryptophans, 5 tyrosines, and 9 valines. With these data, we can construct the actual distribution of mutated amino acids and compare it with the theoretical one. Determination of translation probability of single mutated amino acid at a position. The determination of distribution of translation probability of mutated amino acids from RNA codon is conducted as follows. Taking human p53 protein as an example, the amino acid at position 125 is threonine and its related RNA codon is ACG. A mutation at this position changes threonine to methionine, which has the least probability in Table  2 . Thus, this mutation goes along the minimal probability pathway rather than the maximal probability one. Determination of translation probability of multiple mutated amino acids at a position. There are five mutations occurred at position 245 of human p53 protein, that is, the amino acid glycine is changed into alanine, cys- teine, aspartic acid, serine, and valine with the corresponding translation probabilities of 4/24, 2/24, 2/24, 2/24, and 4/24, respectively (the last row in Table 3 ). In these manners, we can get the distribution of translation probability of mutated amino acids from RNA codons for 192 point mutations in human p53 protein. Determination of mutated amino acid that cannot be explained by a single change in RNA codon. At the beginning of this study, we could not imagine that there are cases of mutations that cannot be explained from the explicit corresponding relationship between RNA codons and translated amino acids, but we do meet with such cases. For example, the mutation at position 140 in human p53 protein changes threonine to tyrosine, however, we cannot find such a possibility in Table 2 . Thus, this is the case, which cannot be explained from the explicit corresponding relationship between RNA codon and translated amino acid. Statistics. The difference between theoretical and actual translation probabilities are compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with SigmaStat for Windows (SPSS, 1992 (SPSS, -2003 , and the p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
