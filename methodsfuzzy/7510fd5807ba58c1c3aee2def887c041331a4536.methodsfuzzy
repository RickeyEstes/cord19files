As noted in the past (Newman 2006) , dehydration can be a bit of a confusing term. Here we consider crystal dehydration as any process able to remove available water molecules from the crystals lattice. Dehydration is achieved by either altering the vapour (Sect. 6.2.1) or the chemical (Sect. 6.2.2) equilibrium of the crystal. These two methods of dehydration are different but also interrelated as the chemical alterations can be used to induce a change in the vapour environment and, the changes in the vapour surrounding the sample can induce alterations the chemistry. The relative amount of water present in a volume of air, Relative Humidity (RH), is directly linked to the temperature and chemical nature of a solution in equilibrium with the air. For this reason, salt solutions are universal calibrating standards for any equipment designed to measure air RH (Greenspan 1977) . When dehydrating crystals, it is advisable to try methods based on both approaches. In some cases, both methods can lead to very similar results but in others (particularly membrane protein crystals with detergents) the outcome of the process can be dependent on the particular technique used. Crystallographers working in closed systems, like crystallisation plates or capillaries, can guide their dehydration experiments based on the wellestablished number of standard salts. Furthermore, the empirical equilibrium relative humidity when using the humidity control device (HC1) (Bowler et al. 2015; Russi et al. 2011; Sanchez-Weatherby et al. 2009) or the free mounting system (FMS) (Kiefersauer et al. 2002; Kiefersauer et al. 2000a, b) can be tabulated and tools exist that allow the researcher to try to estimate the theoretical alterations caused by chemical modification or the formulation of solutions required to induce a particular change in RH (Bowler et al. 2015; Wheeler et al. 2012 ).
