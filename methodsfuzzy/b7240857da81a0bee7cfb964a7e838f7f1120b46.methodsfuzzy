An ethics board or IRB approval from Mayo Clinic is not needed since we have not conducted direct research involving human participants. We have used cloned plasmid derived from deceased patients obtained at autopsy. None of these deceased patients were from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed consent that was freely given. The sequences encoded in the aforementioned plasmids have already been published and they are referenced throughout the manuscript.
