We calculated the DALYs of communicable diseases using an incidence-based approach. The detailed method of DALY estimation is described elsewhere (13) . Each communicable disease was defined using the Korea burden of disease (KBoD) classification based on the 2010 GBD study, which was based on the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases-6 (KCD-6). The DALY was the sum of YLL and YLD; the method used for this calculation is defined elsewhere (13, 14) . The parameters used for measuring YLL were cause of death and mortality, and we primarily used cause-of-death statistical data from the Statistic Korea (8). Furthermore, the KBoD research team developed the Korean garbage code algorithm, which we applied to cause-of-death data (14) . The major parameters for measuring YLD were incidence, age at onset, duration, and disability weight (DW) of each disease. First, to calculate the incidence rate, we used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). We defined cases by the number of medical utilizations. Second, to estimate duration and age at onset of disease, we used the Dismod-II program, which computed the duration and age at onset automatically when inputting the epidemiology index, such as incidence rate, prevalence rate, mortality rate, or fatality rate into the program. However, for some communicable diseases considered of short duration (< 60 days), we instead applied a duration calculated by a national health insurance statistical yearbook as per the expert opinions (7) . For example, in the case of influenza, we applied 7.3 days as the duration period based on the national health insurance statistical yearbook. Finally, we applied the DW developed by Ock et al. (15) .
