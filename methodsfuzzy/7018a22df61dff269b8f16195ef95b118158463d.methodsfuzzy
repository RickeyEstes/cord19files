Cells and virus. The epithelial swine testicle cell line ST developed by McClurkin and Norman (1966) was used to grow the Purdue strain of TGEV (PUR46) (Bullido et al ., 1988 ; Sanchez et al., 1990) , which was plaque purified (Jimenez et al., 1986) . Virus neutralization and purification . Two procedures were followed in the plaque reduction assay . In one, a fixed amount of TGEV PFU were incubated with the antibody, and dilutions of the virus-antibody mixture were plaqued . In the second, 10-fold dilutions of the virus were incubated with a fixed amount of antibody, and the mixtures were applied to the cells without further dilution . Both plaque reduction assays were performed by incubating, at 37° for 30 min (unless otherwise indicated), the TGEV in 50 pl of phosphate-SUWE ET AL. buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 vol of the MAb or antiserum dilution . Portions containing 50 µl of each mixture were applied to cell monolayers grown in 24-well microplates . After 1 hr of virus adsorption, the inoculum was replaced with medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, 40 µg of DEAEdextran/ml, and 0 .1 % agarose, and the cells were incubated at 37° for 2 days in a humidified CO 2 incubator . Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0 .1 % crystal violet, and the plaques were counted . The extent of neutralization was expressed by the neutralization index (NI), which is the log of the ratio of the number of PFU of virus to that of control medium or antibody . [3 H]Leucine-or [35 S]methionine-labeled TGEV was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle (DME) medium completely or partially depleted of leucine or methionine, respectively, in the presence of fetal calf serum dialyzed against PBS, and 20 µCi of [ 3 H]leucine (177 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) or 20 µCi of [35 S]methionine (800 Ci/mmol, SJ204, Amersham), respectively, per milliliter . TGEV was purified through two sucrose gradients in 1 M NaCl, the first one containing 0 .2% Tween 20, as previously described . Radioimmunoassay. Binding of the antibody to the virus was determined in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) in which TGEV (0 .25 µg of protein per well in 50 µl of PBS) was adsorbed to polyvinyl disposable flat-bottom plates (Titertek, Flow Laboratories) by overnight incubation at 37°. The subsequent steps of the assay were performed as described by Sanz et al . (1985) , using a rabbit antiserum to mouse immunoglobulins to amplify the reaction and 125 1-labeled protein A to develop the assay . The titer in the RIA was defined as the maximum antibody dilution that bound threefold the background radioactivity . Polyclonal antiserum. TGEV-specific swine antiserum was induced by immunizing 6-week-old minipigs (haplotype cc) (Sachs et al., 1976) with three doses of 35µg of purified TGEV, in complete Freund's adjuvant, incomplete adjuvant, and saline solution . The serum had a titer by RIA of 78,125 and its NI was >7 .1 . Monoclonal antibodies and "mar" mutants . MAbs and MAb-resistant (mar) mutants were produced and characterized as described previously (Jimenez et al ., 1986 ; Correa et al., 1988) . The properties of the MAbs used in this study are summarized in Table 1 . The mar mutants isolated were neutralized less than 10°' S -fold bythe homologous MAb, which neutralized the original virus more than 10 4°-fold . Kinetics of the neutralization . Hybridoma culture supernatants were titrated in the RIA and diluted to the same titer (2000) . Samples (200 µl) of each hybridoma   TABLE 1   CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TGEU-SPECIFIC MAbs USED IN THIS STUDY   a The first and second capital letters indicate the virus protein and the antigenic site, respectively, and the small letter indicates the subsite (Correa et S., 1988) .° Not determined . were equilibrated at 37° and a volume of the virus (5 x 10' PFU) was added to each MAb . At the indicated times, 20-µ1 samples were diluted 100-fold in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum at 4° and immediately titrated on ST cells . Binding of TGE virus to ST c ells. S T cells were grown to confluence in flat-bottom 96-well microplates (Falcon Plastics) . All remaining steps were performed at 4°. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating each well for 15 min in the presence of 200 µ1 of PBS containing 5 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) per milliliter . The blocking solution was removed, and 100 µI of 3 H-labeled purified TGEV (1 x 10 4 to 2 x 10 4 cpm, 1 .9 x 10 4 cpm/µg of protein, 1 X 10 1 PFU/µg) was added per well in DME medium (with no bicarbonate), supplemented with 2 TIM glutamine, 50 µg of gentami- cin/ml, 50 mM Hepes, and 10% fetal calf serum, pH 7 (binding medium) . The microplates were incubated for 120 min or the indicated times . Unbound virus was collected and the wells were washed three times with 200 Al of 2% fetal calf serum in PBS . Cell-bound radioactivity was solubilized with 100 pl of 1 % Nonidet P-40 in PBS per well, samples of this material and of the supernatants were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity was evaluated by liquid scintillation techniques . To determine the inhibition of binding of virus to ST cells induced by MAbs, the assay was performed as described, except that samples of 50 pl with the indicated amounts of each antibody were incubated at 4°f or 15 min with 1 vol of the labeled virus . Then, the mixture was incorporated into the wells . The percentage of specific binding, that is, the binding of labeled virus to the cells that was inhibited by unlabeled virus, obtained in the presence of an inhibitor MAb was calculated with the formula % binding = cpm°cpm°X 100 cpm, -cpm°c pm 0 and cpm, are the radioactivity associated with the cells in the presence and the absence of inhibitor MAb, respectively ; and cpm°is the radioactivity associated with the cells in the presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled virus . The radioactivity bound, within the different batches of virus, ranged from 10 to 40% of the total labeled virus added to the cells . This amount was taken as the reference against which to calculate the binding inhibition by different antibodies or competitor virus . Internalization of TGEV in ST cells . Internalization of TGEV (or its binding to ST cells, when it was correlated with internalization) was studied on ST cell monolayers grown on 24-well microtest plates (Costar) . Mixtures of 35 S-labeled purified virus (1 .5 x 10 4 cpm, 1 .2 x 10 4 cpm/µg, 1 .4 x 10 8 PFU/µg) and antibody dilutions in 100 gl of binding medium were incubated at 4° for 15 min, added to each well, and incubated at 37° for 60 min (unless otherwise indicated), on a rocking platform, in a CO 2 incubator . The plates were cooled on ice, the supernatants were collected, the cells were washed once with binding medium, and the supernatants were combined . To determine the amount of cell-associated virus, the monolayers were rinsed twice more with binding medium . Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by solubilizing the monolayers with 1 % Nonidet P-40 in PBS . TCA-insoluble radioactivity was determined in samples from the supernatants as well as from the cell monolayers . To determine the internalized virus, after it was bound to the cells, the monolayers were washed once TGE CORONAVIRUS NEUTRALIZATION MECHANISMS 5 6 1 with 40 mM citric acid, 10 mM KCI, 135 mM NaCl, pH 3, at 4° for 1 min and immediately washed a second time with binding medium (Highlander etal., 1987) , and the radioactivity was determined as indicated above .
