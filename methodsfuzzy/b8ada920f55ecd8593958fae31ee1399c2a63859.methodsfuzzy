Three Norwegian Red calves were examined (calves 1.2 and 3). two males and one female, aged 25, 20 and 30 days, respectively, on the day of killing. The calves had been raised conventionally, with colostrum immediately after birth and thereafter whole cow's milk, and later a milk replacer. Spontaneous diarrhoea occurred in all three calves. They were kept in neighbouring pens. Calf I was killed at the start of the diarrhoea. calf 2 in the late phase of the diarrhoea (II days after the start of diarrhoea) and calf 3 eight days after the cessation of diarrhoea. which. for this calf, lasted for 10 days. Faeces in calves 2 and 3 were mucinous, whitish yellow and sometimes contained small amounts of blood. In the acute stage of the disease cryptosporidia were found in faecal smears stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain (Henriksen and Pohlenz 1981) or the streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique (see below). Examination of faeces for other pathogenic parasities, bacteria and viruses was negative. The methods used in the bacteriological examinations have been described (Landsverk et al 1983) , Direct electron microscopy of faeces was done on" faecal suspensions prepared as described by Flewett (1978) , placed on carbon-Formvar coated grids, dried and negatively stained in potassium phosphotungstate. Frozen sections examined for rotavirus and coronavirus were likewise negative; the methods for immunofluorescence have been described (Landsverk et al 1983) , Three healthy calves, 18, 20 and 26 days old, two females and one male, from the same farm, were used as controls, Intestinal specimens were obtained through a right flank laparotomy during anaesthesia with pentobarbital (20 mg kg I bodyweight). Before sampling. endocytic ability of the FAE over the 11'1' was tested by injecting a solution of 5 to 10" per cent colloidal carbon (Pelican Cll/1431 A) in saline or phosphate buffered saline into a 10 cm tied loop at the ileal insertion of the ileocaecal fold. Various sites in the small and large intestine were sampled, including proximal and distal portions of the (PP. After 30 minutes the loops were removed and immersed in a fixative containing O' 7 per cent paraformaldehyde, 0'9 per cent glutaraldehyde, and 140 mmol litre-) sodium cacodylate, pH 7· 2. Specimens for morphometry were fixed in Carnoy's solution. An adjacent portion of the IPP was frozen in monochloroditluoromethane (Prestogas) chilled with liquid nitrogen. Tissue was stored at -70°C until tested. Cryostat sections about 8 /Am were fixed in acetone for 10 minutes. Alternatively, sections were fixed in 4 per cent formaldehyde, 67 mmollitre-) calcium chloride, pH 7·2 for five minutes and then treated with 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes to block the endogenous peroxidase. Immunoperoxidase staining for cryptosporidia included human con- valescent serum as a source of primary antibody. Normal human serum was used as a control. The sera were obtained from Dr W. L. Current, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis and Dr R. Bergquist, Ulleval Hospital, Oslo. Biotinylated sheep anti-human Ig (Amersham, RPN 1003) was used as a secondary antibody. Streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (SHe) (Amersham, RPN 1051) was then added. Finally the sections were treated with a diaminobenzidine (DAH) hydrochloric acid solution (Sigma) containing 6 mg 10 ml-) DAB, 45 /AI 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide 10 ml-) of a 50 mmol litre -I imidazole solution (Boehringer Mannheim), pH 7'4. Dilution of sera and washing between each of the steps in the procedure was made with phosphate buffered saline. Pieces of fixed tissue for light microscopy (LM) were 1981) . Morphometric examination of follicle size was performed as described elsewhere (Landsverk 1981 b) . Before processing of specimens for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) digital pressure fracturing (Miyai 1978) was performed on fixed tissue. The procedure frequently exposed the surface of the domes, otherwise often inaccessible with the conventional sectioning of tissue, The specimens were then washed in distilled water, dehydrated in acetone, critical-point dried, and sputter-coated with gold. The coated samples were examined in a Jeol 50 A scanning electron microscope (Jeol, Akishama, Tokyo), with an accelerating voltage of 10 to 15 kV. Photographs were recorded on a Polaroid type 52 film. Specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were post fixed in 2 per cent cacodylate buffered osmium tetroxide for two hours, dehydrated in acetone and embedded in Epon. The ultrathin sections were cut with diamond knives and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. calf I (early infection), affecting mainly the distal small intestine. Over the 11'1' cryptosporidia were more numerous in the FAE than in the adjacent absorbing epithelium. Villi showed partial atrophy and had a low irregular epithelium infiltrated with leucocytes. The crypts were elongated. Fusion of the FAE with absorbing epithelium was sometimes seen (Figs I and 2). Calf 2 (late infection) had only a few cryptosporidia in the brush border, whereas no cryptosporidia were seen in calf 3 (convalescent). Fusion of the FAE and absorbing epithelium was only rarely seen in calves 2 and 3.
