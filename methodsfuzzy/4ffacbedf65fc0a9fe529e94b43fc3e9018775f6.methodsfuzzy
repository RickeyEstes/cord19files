General. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. SCD buffer was prepared from 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) with the pH adjusted to 6.0 using HCl. All synthetic DNA oligomers (desalted) were purchased from Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). The two abasic PNA probes (Abasic PNA 1 and PNA 2 ) were synthesized by DestiNA Genomica SL (Spain) using standard solid-phase synthesis techniques on an Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments MultiPrep CF Synthesizer (Intavis AG GmH, Germany). Aqueous solutions of abasic PNA probes were prepared and concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer version 3.3.1. (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using as extinction coefficient values (Ɛ 260 ) either 6.6, 8.8, 13.7 and 11.7 (mM −1 cm −1 ) for C, T, A, G, respectively. SMART-C-Biotin was prepared by DestiNA Genomica SL (Spain) as reported elsewhere 28 . Buffers and dilution reagents were provided by Master Diagnostica SL (Spain). The composition of reagents I to VI is property of Vitro SA (Spain). Genomic DNA samples. Parasitic protozoa genomic DNAs (gDNAs) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Respectively, gDNA from T. cruzi strain Tulahuen with ATCC ID 30266D and gDNA from L. major with ATCC ID 30012D. Human gDNA was extracted from MUM-2B cell line provided by J.C. Rodríguez-Manzaneque's laboratory. target nucleic acid selection. Multiple sequence alignment of the 28S rRNA delta genes of L. major vs. T. cruzi was carried out using the Clustal Omega, a free on-line available multiple sequence alignment tool offered by EMBL-EBI. BLAST studies were carried out with the NCBI primer BLAST tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/ primer-blast/primertool.cgi?ctg_time=1534265329&job_key=NT_qawTpCUEufxN6Hho3SGQBJnpJEj1nSA). PCR Amplification. Alignment results were used to design a single pair of primers able to amplify the target region of both parasites. Primers (5'-3') sequences were: Forward: GATTGTGAAGGGATCTCGCAG and Reverse: TCTGGCTTAGAGGCGTTCA. PCR amplification was performed on a Veriti 96-well Thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cycling conditions for PCR were as follows: (1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 3 min; RNA fragmentation. RNA was extracted from parasites as described elsewhere 45 . RNA quality assessment and quantitation were determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Fig. S7 in SI) . NEBNext Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module Protocol was used to fragment RNA. The following reagents were mixed in a sterile PCR tube: 1-18 µL of purified RNA containing 2-50 µg of total RNA, 2 µL of RNA fragmentation buffer and complete with nuclease-free water up to 20 µL. The mixture was incubated at 94 °C for 5 minutes (to get fragments of around 200-mer length). Then the tube was transferred to ice and 2 µL of RNA Fragmentation stop solution were added. The fragmented RNA was cleaned up using ethanol precipitation: 22 µL of fragmented RNA, 2 µL of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 60 µL of 100% ethanol. The mixture was incubated at -80 °C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 25 minutes at 4 °C and ethanol was removed carefully. The pellet was washed with 300 µL of 70% ethanol, centrifuged and removed the ethanol. Finally, the pellet was air-dry for up to 10 minutes at room temperature and re-suspended in 13.5 µL of nuclease-free water. To assess the yield and size distribution of the fragmented RNA, 1 µL of a 10-fold dilution was analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 Pico Kit analysis (Fig. S8 in SI) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Abasic pNA probes spotting. An automatic immobilization of the probes on the membranes was done using Personal Arrayer 16 (CapitalBio Corporation, China). Immunodyne ABC Membrane was purchased from Pall Corporation (US). Abasic PNA probe spotting solutions were prepared to have the following final reagents concentrations 0.2025 mg/mL amaranth dye, 0.125 M sodium bicarbonate, 30% of DMSO and 15 µM abasic PNA probe. spin-tube: sMARt-C-Biotin dynamic incorporation reaction on membranes and colorimetric readout. Reaction mixtures with a final volume of 300 µL were prepared by mixing: 45 µL of PCR products, 15 µL of SMART-C-Biotin (200 µM), 20 µL of sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH 3 CN) -15 mM in water, and 220 µL of SCD buffer. Protocol: All steps were performed using 300 µL and Spin-Tube devices were centrifuged to discard the solutions between each step. Membranes were incubated for 2 minutes at 45 °C with 300 µL of SCD buffer. The reaction mixture was added and incubated at 45 °C for 60 minutes. Upon completion of the incubation, three post-reaction washing steps were carried out using reagent I (pre-heated at 45 °C). This was followed by a blocking step in which membranes were incubated with reagent II for 5 minutes at RT. The enzymatic reaction was carried out by incubating the membranes with reagent III at RT for 5 minutes. Four post-enzymatic reaction washing steps with reagent IV were carried out. The chromogen solution (reagent V) was added to the membranes and left at 41 °C for 5 minutes. Finally, three post-chromogen washing steps with reagent VI were carried out. Membranes were able to be analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay. To assess the specificity of the assay, four tests were carried out: (1) one in which the PCR contained water instead of gDNAs and (2) another one in which 20 ng of human gDNA was used as template; and two more tests in which 20 ng of human gDNA were mixed with other 20 ng of each parasite (Fig. 5) . On the other hand, for the sensitivity study, a range of PCR amplification reactions were performed using decreasing amounts of starting T. cruzi gDNA. Six different concentration points (10-fold dilutions) plus a negative control (water) were used in triplicate. All PCR amplification products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to determine the amount, if any, of amplicon had been generated (Fig. 5 for specificity and Fig. 6 and Table S1 for sensitivity). Expected size of amplicons were detected when the PCR was performed using the four highest amount of parasitic gDNAs while no bands were detected neither when using just human gDNA nor when using 0.1 and 0.01 pg/µL (Fig. 6B ). Negative control (water) has not shown any signal, being truly a negative and so being effectively called as parasite free. L. major gDNA spike-in experiments on blood. DNA was extracted from 200 µL of human whole blood samples using QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) following manufacturer's guidelines. After proteinase K treatment, two samples were spiked with 10 and 0.1 ng of L. major gDNA. Then, the next steps of the DNA extraction protocol were followed as recommended. Samples were eluted in 30 µL of elution buffer AE. DNA was quantified with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer version 3.3.1. (Thermo Fisher Scientific). PCR reactions were performed with a fix amount of DNA, 450 ng. After that, PCR were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and DNA 1000 Kit) and by the Spin-Tube.
