The appropriate proteins and their sequences were carefully searched and checked upon retrieval from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) or NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/). After downloading the sequences and respective protein data bank (PDB) files, the necessary information was imported into the database using tools implemented in JAVA [40] . The corresponding protein sequences in FASTA format were fed into the PONDR VLXT neural network (http://www.pondr.com). The results were given as scores from 0 to 1. Residues with scores of 0.5 and over represent disordered residues [41, 42] . An important ratio used in this and previous studies is the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID), which is defined as the number of residues predicted to be disordered in a protein chain divided by the total number of residues in the chain. The PID can range from 0% (perfectly ordered) to 100% (totally disordered). The predicted intrinsic disorder-related information was retrieved and fed into a MYSQL database that has been mentioned in previous papers [40] . Another JAVA-DBI program then automatically created codes that were readable in Jmol (www.jmol.com), which generated a 3D representation of protein crystal structures with disorder annotations that could be visualized from the colors provided by the codes. The Jmol software also required the respective PDB (protein data bank) files, which could be obtained from NCBI, as mentioned above. A PONDR VLXT predictor was used in this study, since it is one of the most informative tools for structural proteins, namely for viral shells, where protein-protein interactions play vital roles in order-disorder transitions [41] [42] [43] [44] . It has successfully been utilized to study the shell disorder of a large variety of viruses, including HIV, smallpox, and polio viruses [2, 14, 25, 30, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . PONDR represents a suite of computational tools for sequence-only predictions of the intrinsic disorder predisposition of query in proteins. PONDR VLXT was the earliest predictor created at the end of the last century [41, 42] . It involves the use of neural networks that are trained to recognize protein sequences that are ordered and those that are not [53] . Statistical methods, including regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to analyze the PONDR VLXT results along with data on virulence and morbidity. The statistical package R version 3.6.0. [54] was used to obtain the results. Before obtaining the necessary results, the respective codes had to be written in R.
