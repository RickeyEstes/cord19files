Reagents for mucin detection include histochemical stains, lectins and antibodies. These can be used in direct liquid assays, in blotting assays and in ELISA. Histochemical methods have been adapted to detect mucins during purification. PAS, Alcian Blue and high iron diamine detect glycol or cationic groups. Standard liquid assays based on these and other carbohydrate reactions are greatly hampered by salts, but the reagents are valuable for probing mucin fractions immobilized on polyvinylidine difluoride or other transfer membranes (Thornton et al., 1989) . Blotting concentrates the sample, ensures that salts are removed before probing and provides a stable archive. Lectins are sensitive probes for carbohydrate moieties. Many lectins have specificities for glycosyl subgroups that are widely expressed in glycoconjugates. They do not detect mucins specifically but may be used as general reagents. We routinely use wheat-germ agglutinin in this way (Figs 8 and 9 ). Lectins with a specificity for sialic acids (Sambucus nigra and Maakia amurensis) may have more value in mucin detection. Other useful lectins may be identified by their differential or specific binding to goblet cell granules or cell membranes in tissue. Monoclonal antibodies to carbohydrate epitopes can be selected in the same way. Antibodies to sialyl-Tn and Tn (Kjeldsen et al., 1988; Takahashi et al., 1988) were found to be valuable in ocular mucin preparations [ Fig. 7(b) ]. Antibodies against mucin-specific epitopes are also useful during mucin purification. Many anti-mucin antibodies recognize peptide epitopes lithium perchlorate concentration 641 CPM 220 kD only after deglycosylation (Durrant et al., 1994) , a procedure that can destroy the peptide. The newly described arLti-MUC2 and anti-MUC5AC antibodies (Carlstedt et al., 1995) are valuable as they react with fully glycosylated native or subunit mucins. Antibodies to human gastric mucin peptide (anti-M1; Bara et al., 1986) react with native and subunit canine ocular mucins, but only native human ocular mucins. Other useful reagents are listed in Table 1 .
