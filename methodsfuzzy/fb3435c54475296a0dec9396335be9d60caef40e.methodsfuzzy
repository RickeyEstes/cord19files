A nursing unit manager needs two types of data to apply our approach for evaluating strategies for improving nurse scheduling. The first type of data consists of the number of beds in the test unit, the number of staff assigned to this unit and each staff member's weekday and weekend work patterns, work rules, and common management practices. The second type of data consists of patient movement timestamps, which are used to calculate hourly unit-level bed occupancy and activity levels. Most hospitals have some type of bed management system in place that keeps track of patient movement time stamps. Still, some effort may be required in aggregating this information into hourly census and ADT counts. We describe our methodology in two steps. First, we mention general features of our methodology that any nursing unit manager would need to know in order to implement our approach. Then, we describe how this approach was applied to the example unit for evaluating scheduling staggering approach. As explained in the previous section, our methodology has two parts-nursing needs' forecasting and nurse scheduling according to this forecast. Thus, these two steps are described for each part separately, beginning with forecasting. The timing of nursing needs' forecasting decisions precludes the use of real-time data. Furthermore, as explained next, it may be difficult to include historical patient-specific data in forecasts of nursing needs. Typical nursing units have a variable staffing plan that converts each census level (by time of day) into a minimum number of registered nurses (RNs) needed to care for that many patients. The variable staffing plan is approximately based on nurse to patient ratios corresponding to an aggregate mix of patient acuity. We found that such practices are common at large hospitals, although not all hospitals use the terminology variable staffing plan. Our test unit did not have electronic records of patients' nursing care requirements. Patients' needs varied such that some required a dedicated nurse, whereas up to four patients could be assigned to a single nurse in other cases. Because of lack of reliable data, we did not include patients' acuity levels in our method for determining nursing needs. Until such data becomes available in electronic form, our approach is reasonable because of the following reasons. Each unit's aggregate patient composition is stable (so long as patient placement rules do not change) and the variable staffing plan takes into account aggregate patient acuity when deciding the appropriate nurse-topatient ratios. It is for this reason that different units use different nurse-to-patient ratios. These ratios also vary by shift to account for shift-to-shift differences in workload due to doctors' orders, distribution of medications and meals, and various call-button requests. In addition, patient acuity is not constant over time and to our knowledge there is no database that updates patients' acuity information over time. Therefore, estimating patient acuity from available electronic records is not currently feasible. However, if such data were available, an acuity-based adjustment could be applied to our nursing needs' forecast in a manner similar to the ADT adjustment described below. We asked several experienced charge nurses 1 to predict how they would staff the test unit, assuming a typical mix of patients in terms of their acuity, if they knew the census profile and the count of hourly ADT. We did this to determine what features of the census profile these experts considered important for the purpose of ascertaining nursing needs. Our experiment revealed that nurses used beginning-of-shift census to determine a base staffing level (from the variable staffing plan) and adjusted it upwards to account for the ADT activity and for additional nurses required for periods when census is higher than the starting census. Based on this evidence, our nursing needs' forecast model predicts for each shift, by day of week, the beginning census of a shift and the additional workload due to the change in patient numbers and ADT. This information is then converted into nursing needs according to the variable staffing plan. The technical details of this model can be found in Appendix A. Next, we describe how we applied our method to the example unit. We obtained time-stamp data for calendar years 2005, 2006, and the first four months of 2007. All data were deidentified by the collaborating hospital. We took a variety of steps to ensure data accuracy (e.g. comparing midnight bed census levels obtained from different databases) and to infer certain missing data based on rules provided by the unit manager (e.g. all patient movements from ED to the telemetry unit were treated as new admissions per hospital protocol). These steps are important but not described in detail here in the interest of brevity. From the time-stamp data we obtained beginning census for each shift of each day of operation for the unit under investigation. We also aggregated this data into hourly, daily and weekly census levels to study seasonality by the time of the day, by the day of the week, and by the week of the year. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows that there is no identifiable seasonal pattern by week; however, there are significant day of week and shift-based seasonal effects. Our approach compares the performance of a variety of forecasting techniques that utilize these seasonal patterns and picks the best among them. The goodness of each approach may be measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD), i.e. the average of the absolute difference between the forecast and the actual staff requirements. It is also possible in our approach to weight shortages and overages differently when calculat- ing MAD or to use a different measure of the goodness of the forecast. We compared simple and weighted moving average and smoothing procedures to identify the best protocol for the test unit. For each method, the first twelve months' data were used to estimate any parameters needed to implement the method. The performance of the forecast was measured by calculating MAD for the second 12-month period. Upon comparing different forecasting methods, we found that in our example unit, the simple moving average procedure performed the best. Therefore, our forecasting model estimates the beginning census (by day of week) of each shift by the simple moving average of censuses of the most recent 52 weeks. The forecast of the workload adjustment due to ADT and increase in patient numbers during a shift is calculated by the long-term (1 year) average of extra nursing hours required, also by day of week and shift. We did not use moving average for the second component because this number is relatively stable for the unit we investigated. For a nursing unit with more variable ADT workload throughout the year, it may be more appropriate to use a different method to calculate the workload due to ADT. The forecast of the number of RNs required to meet the staffing needs are then calculated by applying the unit's nurse-to-patient ratio to the estimates of the beginning census and the additional workload from activities. We turn next to the second part of our approach that uses the forecast of staffing needs for each shift during the review period to develop a work schedule for In the example unit, there were 45 nurses. Most worked part time. Each nurse worked a particular pattern of Day-Evening, or Day-Night shifts and the majority worked alternate weekends. There were some exceptions who worked every third weekend or alternated between every other and every third weekend. Therefore the unit needed approximately twice as many nurses as there were weekend shifts. Our calculations revealed that 22 nurses were needed to staff each weekend's shifts at full capacity. This suggests that the unit employed a sufficient number of nurses (because 45 is approximately twice of 22) to meet weekend staffing need. The basic features of the scheduling problems in our example unit are as follows. The hospital develops 4-week staffing plans for three standard 8-h shifts. Every staffing plan starts on a Saturday. Day shifts are from 7 AM to 3 PM; Evening shifts are from 3 PM to 11 PM; Night shifts are from 11 PM to 7 AM. A majority of the nurses work either 8-h shifts or 12-h shifts, although some do work a combination of 8-and 12-h shifts. A 12-h shift can be either from 7 AM to 7 PM or from 7 PM to 7 AM. In this section, we use i = 1, . . . , 5 to index Day, Evening, Night, 7 AM-7 PM, and 7 PM-7 AM shifts, respectively. These shifts are also denoted by acronyms D, E, N, D12, and N12, respectively. We used the forecast requirements developed in the first part of our approach as input to the scheduling model and obtained the average weekly costs associated with imple-menting either a single-cohort or a two-cohort strategy. The key schedule-performance metric of cost associated with single-and two-cohort strategies was obtained by adding the cost of the optimal schedule for that strategy (produced by our scheduling model with nursing needs' forecast as input) and the cost of staffing the realized uncovered shifts. The cost of staffing each uncovered shift is set equal to the overtime cost for that type of shift because lastminute staff additions were usually paid the overtime rate.
