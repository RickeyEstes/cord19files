PCR (or RT-PCR) is still the most common nucleic acid target amplification method used in the diagnostic laboratory. This is partly because the procedure was widely publicised before the alternative isothermal means of amplifying targets. There have been many complex reactions and diagnostic algorithms reported to try and represent the wide-spectrum of potential pathogens causing respiratory symptoms. Despite the well-recognised problems, there are reports of large studies using "in house" procedures where multiplexed primer combinations have proved successful for PCR amplification (Coiras et al., 2004; Pehler-Harrington et al., 2004; Syrmis et al., 2004; Gunson et al., 2005; Weigl et al., 2007) . One interesting adaptation of the PCR amplification is to use a "touchdown" approach which allows more flexibility in design of primer sets. The idea is that assays are run concurrently with simultaneous amplification and subsequent detection of 12 respiratory virus targets (Coyle et al., 2004) . This approach avoids the need for complex multiplexing but increases the number of reactions necessary/sample. Nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) is an isothermal target amplification procedure which utilizes three enzyme activities (RT, RNaseH and T7 RNA polymerase) in order to amplify sense or anti-sense target RNA. The method has been applied successfully to respiratory virus detection and diagnosis of associated infection and disease Hibbitts and Fox, 2002; Moore et al., 2004; Landry et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006; Loens et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006; Dare et al., 2007) . Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was originally developed for rapid amplification of DNA targets but can be combined successfully with a reverse transcription step for RNA respiratory viruses (e.g., Nagamine et al., 2002; Hong et al., 2004) . The method utilises 4âˆ’6 target specific regions in a strand displacement synthesis resulting in a very rapid isothermal amplification of target.
