Library construction. A combinatorial library of heptapeptides flanked by a pair of cysteine residues displayed on T7Select415-1 phage (Novagen, WI) was constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, degenerate NNK-oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 1 [95] , 0.9 mg/mL lactoferrin human [95] , 5 mg/mL sodium chloride, and 2.2 mg/mL potassium chloride to give the concentration of ions found in CF sputum [95] . The solution was adjusted with 0.5 M hydrogen chloride to pH 6.5, which is the estimated pH of CF airway mucus [96] . The reagents were transferred to a sterile tube, mixed minutes, 10 ÂµL aliquots of the eluates were taken for further quantification. After 1 h, the entire eluate was collected from the basolateral side and titered using standard double-layer plaque assay to quantify phage concentration. The eluted phage library was amplified in BL21 E. coli (Novagen, WI) to make more copies, which was quantified by plaque assay prior to the next round of selection. Two additional rounds of selection were performed with initial amounts of 5.2 x 10 6 pfu and 4.2 x 10 9 pfu, respectively.
