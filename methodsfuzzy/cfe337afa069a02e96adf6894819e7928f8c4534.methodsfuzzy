The medical records of all cats diagnosed with AMG, between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion into the present study. Criteria used for inclusion consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase (CK), and a CBC. The diagnosis of AMG was based on clinical signs compatible with the disease and an abnormal serum anti-AChR antibody concentration. Serum anti-AChR antibody concentration was measured by immunoprecipitation radioimmunoassay using a feline-specific antigen with a diagnostic value of 0.3 nmol/L. 9 All imaging studies of the thorax were interpreted by a board-certified veterinary radiologist. Criteria used for exclusion were the presence of an identifiable CMM on thoracic imaging or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. The wheelbarrow exercise stress test (WEST) was employed during the neurological examination of some cats in an attempt to evaluate their degree of skeletal muscle strength and tolerance to exercise. This test involved elevating and supporting the caudal half of the body while moving the cat forward thereby promoting ambulation through the thoracic limbs (Video S1). The medical records were reviewed for signalment, history, reasons for referral, general and neurological examination findings, diagnostic tests performed, treatment, short-term follow-up, long-term outcome, and repeated measurement of serum anti-AChR antibody concentration if performed. When undertaken, electromyography (EMG) was conducted under general anesthesia in normothermic cats by a boardcertified veterinary neurologist, at least 7 days after the onset of clinical signs, using a disposable bipolar concentric needle electrode. Skeletal muscles evaluated as part of EMG studies consisted of the appendicular and epaxial muscles, as well as those of the head. Nerve conduction and repetitive nerve stimulation studies were not routinely performed as part of a neuromuscular workup in these 2 veterinary referral hospitals during the inclusion period. Throughout this study, the term immune remission was used to define the absence of clinical signs of AMG along a with a normal serum anti-AChR antibody concentration after discontinuation of treatment, whereas spontane-
