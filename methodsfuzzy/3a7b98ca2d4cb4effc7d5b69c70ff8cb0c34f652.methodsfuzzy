Peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and clinical data were obtained according to the guidelines of the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam. Flow cytometric analysis was performed, as previously described. 8, 11, 12 RAG analysis and in vitro V(D)J recombination assay The RAG1 and RAG2 genes were amplified by means of PCR and sequenced, as previously described. 13 The level of recombination activity of the RAG1 expression constructs was determined by using the recombination plasmid pDVG93, as described previously. 10, 13 A TaqMan-based realtime quantitative (RQ)-PCR was used to measure RAG1 and RAG2 transcription levels in BM mononuclear cells, as described previously. 14 T-cell receptor b analysis T-cell receptor b (TRB) gene rearrangements were studied, as described previously. 15
