Cells and viruses. HEK-293, A549, MDCK-NBL2, MDCK type I, and MDCK type II cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum and 50 g/ml gentamicin. HEK-293, A549, and MDCK-NBL2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MDCK type I and type II cells were gifts from William Young (University of Kentucky) (35, 37, 54, 55) . Immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Cells were stained using probes derived from viral hemagglutinin-esterase proteins fused to human IgG1 Fc (HE-Fc). The porcine torovirus strain 4 HE-Fc (PToV HE-Fc) primarily recognizes 9-O-Ac, and the bovine coronavirus Mebus strain HE-Fc (BCoV HE-Fc) recognizes 7,9-O-Ac and shows low levels of binding to 9-O-Ac (10, 11) . For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. Coverslips were incubated with Carbo-Free blocking solution (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, with optional permeabilization with 0.001% Tween 20. For staining, HE-Fc probes were precomplexed with Alexa 488-labeled antihuman IgG antibody for 1 h at 4°C and then diluted in Carbo-Free blocking solution to a final concentration of 5 g/ml HE-Fc and a 1:500 dilution of secondary antibody. Cells were stained with HE-Fc/anti-IgG complex for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Antifade-Gold with DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen). Cell were imaged using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope. For flow cytometry, cells were seeded onto nonadherent cell culture dishes and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were collected using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; HEK-293 and A549 cells) or Accutase (Sigma, MDCK cells) to retain surface glycans and then fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min. The cells were blocked as described above. HE-Fc probes were prepared as described above with final concentrations of 5 g/ml HE-Fc probe and 1:1,200 of anti-IgG. A Guava EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used to collect data, followed by analysis using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v8). Cell line mutations and characterization. Two methods for utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 were used. For A549 and MDCK cells, paired Cas9 plasmids (PX459; Addgene plasmid 62988) targeted adjacent sites in early exons of CasD1, as diagrammed in Fig. 4A . Plasmids were transfected using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio LLC) (8) . For HEK-293 cells, nickase Cas9 plasmids (PX462; Addgene plasmid 62987) were used instead. Transfected cells were selected with puromycin, and single cell clones were screened with PToV-P4 HE-Fc to identify nonstaining variants. Edited sequences were confirmed by PCR amplification of the targeted regions and sequencing the PCR product for each allele. Knockout cell lines were used to prepare overexpression cell lines by transfection of a pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid expressing the complete human CasD1 cDNA open reading frame synthesized by Bio Basic (Markham, Ontario, Canada). Transfected cells were selected with G418, and single-cell clones were screened by staining with PToV-P4 HE-Fc to identify 9-O-Ac positive cell lines. Editing of the SIAE gene followed a protocol for CRISPR-Cas9 similar to that described above, and the gene regions targeted are shown in Fig. 5A . After transfection and selection, cells were cloned, and single-cell clones were screened by direct PCR amplification of the target gene region and analysis of the PCR product size for the edited form of both alleles. Full sequencing of each allele and qPCR were performed to confirm deletion of the gene. Quantification of Sia variants. The Sia composition of cells were determined by incubating with 2 M acetic acid at 80°C for 3 h, filtration through a Microcon 10-kDa centrifugal filter (Millipore), and drying in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator. Released Sia were derivatized with DMB (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2.5 h at 50°C (39) . HPLC analysis was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 system with an Acclaim C 18 column (Thermo Fisher) under isocratic elution in 7% methanol, 7% acetonitrile, and 86% water. Sia standards included bovine submaxillary mucin and commercial standards for Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc (Sigma-Aldrich). Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software (v8). Characterization of A549 conditioned media. Conditioned medium from A549 cells was prepared by washing a fully confluent flask of cells to remove any serum and allowing the cells to grow in serum-free medium for 5 to 7 days. The conditioned medium was collected, dialyzed with 3 volumes of PBS, and concentrated using a 30-kDa centrifugal filter (Pall Corporation). The protein concentration was determined by using a Qubit 4 fluorometer (Invitrogen). To determine Muc5B presence, 2-fold dilutions of conditioned media were compared to purified human Muc5B using a 8% SDS-PAGE gel and probed with an anti-human Muc5B antibody (both purified protein and antibody were gifts from Stefan Ruhl, University of Buffalo). Conditioned medium was analyzed for total Sia using the HPLC methods listed above. qPCR of SIAE and CasD1 expression. RNA from cells was extracted by using EZNA total RNA kit I (Omega Bio-Tek), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) standard protocol with oligo(dT) 12-18 primers (Invitrogen). CasD1-and SIAE-specific primers were designed using Geneious (Biomatters, Ltd.). For CasD1, adequate primers could not be targeted around the CRISPR-Cas9 edit site due to the high G/C content. qPCR was performed on a Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus real-time PCR system using Fast SYBR green (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using StepOne software (Applied Biosystems, v2.1) and GraphPad Prism statistical analysis software. Virus infection assays. For infection in HEK-293 cells with IAV, the cells were seeded on coverslips and inoculated with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Coverslips of inoculated cells were fixed at 24 h, stained for virus using an anti-NP antibody, and costained with DAPI. The percentages of infected cells were determined by imaging coverslips and counting the infected cells per field. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software. For infection in MDCK cells with the influenza A, B, C, and D viruses, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and inoculated for 48 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with a mouse anti-influenza A NP antibody, a mouse anti-influenza B NP antibody (Abcam), a polyclonal mouse anti-influenza C antibody (a gift from Peter Palese, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), or a polyclonal rabbit anti-influenza D antibody (a gift from Feng Li, South Dakota State University). The cells were imaged using a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope. Images were analyzed for relative infected cell counts using ImageJ (NIH and LOCI, University of Wisconsin). Mouse erythrocyte hemagglutination and lectin staining. Mouse erythrocytes were collected from C57B/6 mice by euthanizing the mice and immediately collecting blood by heart puncture into Alsever's solution. Erythrocytes were washed in PBS three times and diluted to 5% (vol/vol) in PBS. Then, 5% of the mouse erythrocytes were left untreated or treated with 30 g/ml BCoV HE-Fc for 18 h at 37°C, followed by dilution to 0.75% (vol/vol) in PBS for the HA assays. Briefly, HA assays were performed by 2-fold serially diluting virus in duplicate per treatment in a V-bottom 96-well plate. Treated or untreated mouse erythrocytes were added to virus and allowed to hemagglutinate at 4°C to prevent NA cleavage. To determine Sia linkage type, 5% washed erythrocytes were blocked for 1 h using 1ϫ Carbo Free blocking buffer (Vector Laboratories) and then stained for 1 h with fluoroscein-labeled plant lectins SNA, which binds ␣2,6-linked Sia, and MAA I, which binds ␣2,3-linked Sia (Vector Laboratories). Stained erythrocytes were then analyzed using flow cytometry as described above. Generation of NA VLPs and NA cleavage assay. NA sequences were obtained from GenBank (N1, ACP44181; N2, AGC70842). Sequences were tagged, codon optimized, and ordered through Biomatik in the PcDNA3.1(ϩ) vector. To produce VLPs, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 15-cm plates and transfected when 80% confluent. The cells were transfected with 4 l of polyethylenimine (Polysciences, catalog no. 23966-2) at 1 mg/ml for every 1 g of plasmid DNA stock of in 9 ml of Opti-MEM. At 8 h posttransfection, 6 ml of prewarmed Opti-MEM was added. The supernatant was collected at 72 h posttransfection and purified using ultracentrifugation (110,000 ϫ g, 1.5 h, 4°C) through a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and stored at 4°C. To determine NA cleavage on mouse erythrocytes, 5% (vol/vol) mouse erythrocytes in PBS were treated with 1:100 NA VLPs for 4 h at 37°C. Free Sia were collected and prepared for HPLC analysis as described above.
