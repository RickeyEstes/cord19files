Animal, grouping and treatment Thirty male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits with body weight of 4-5 kg were housed at the Experimental Animal Center of Prince of Wales Hospital, and received a standard laboratory diet and water ad lititum. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref No. 04/038/MIS). Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON [9] , all the rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 μg/kg body weight of Lippolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. USA) on day 0 (week 0). 24 h later, three injections of 20 mg/kg body weight of Methylprednisolone (MPS; Pharmacia and Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 h. They were then divided into control group (CON; n = 14) with oral vehicle and PE group (PE; n = 16, 5 mg/kg body weight/day) with oral PE for 6 weeks, beginning on day 0 before LPS injection. A specifically custom-made tube was used for oral administration [23] . Six weeks after LPS injection, all the rabbits were then euthanized for evaluations. Both control vehicle and PE (10 mg flavonoids preparation containing 5000 μg Icariin, 250 μg Genistein, 1250 μg Daidzein and 3500 μg vehicle) ( Fig. 1 ) was commercially available (Tong Ji Tang Pharmacal Company, Gui Zhou, China). The time-point of 6 weeks for euthanasia was experimentally confirmed to present ON lesions accompanied by repair process in our most recent study which is equivalent to Stage II ON (Ficart and Arlet classification system) [9] . The body weight of the animals was recorded weekly for adjusting administration of PE. The final body weight before sacrifice was documented. Accident mortality in both groups was recorded throughout the experiment period.
