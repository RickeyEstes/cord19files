Patients A total of 124 consecutive HCV-infected patients for whom IFN therapy was planned had checkups for oral mucosal diseases, based on our hospital's clinical pathway in the Digestive Diseases Center at Kurume University Hospital Japan from July 30, 2008 to October 28, 2009 . In this Digestive Diseases Center, physicians, surgeons, radiologists and an oral surgeon examine each patient in their own specialized area. Seventeen of 124 patients agreed to the simultaneous consultation of the hepatologist and oral surgeon in our Digestive Diseases Center in order to receive administration of Peg-IFN and an oral examination once per week. The other 107 patients did not consult a doctor every week. Fourteen patients completed therapy. Three patients discontinued IFN treatment because of null-response. Systemic autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune hepatitis, and Sjögren's syndrome were considered as exclusion criteria for IFN therapy. The 14 patients, 3 men and 11 women, who completed IFN therapy were examined. They ranged in age from 25 to 70 years, with an average age of 56.00 ± 12.94 years. Eleven patients with HCV genotype 1 received administration of Peg-IFN/RBV for 48-72 weeks. Two patients with HCV genotype 2 received administration of Peg-IFN/RBV for 24 weeks, and one patient with liver cirrhosis (HCV genotype 2) received administration of IFN beta for 24 weeks.
