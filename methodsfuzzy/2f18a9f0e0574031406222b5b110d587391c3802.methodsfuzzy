Hospital efficiency analysis is an important issue within the field of health economics. There are two contemporary approaches to measure cost efficiency of hospitals: the parametric approach and the non-parametric approach. The most used parametric method is SFA, while the popular non-parametric approach is DEA (Barros, de Menezes, Peypoch, Solonandrasana, & Vieira, 2008; Wei, Ni, & Sheng, 2011; Yu, Choi, & Zhang, 2013; Zhu, Wang, & Wu, 2014) . However, Tsionas (2002) and Assaf (2011) argue that these traditional methods have inherent limitations that assume that all hospitals operate under the same production or cost technology in the estimation of efficiency, while in practice this is not true and might lead to incorrect efficiency estimates. Battese and Rao (2002) have begun to use the metafrontier approach to take account of the different production technology when estimating the efficiency and productivity. And it has brought out a large strand of literature. However, this metafrontier approach has inherent deficiency that requires prior knowledge of different groups of the DMUs (Kumbhakar, Wang, & Horncastle, 2015) . Therefore, we adopt the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients that was introduced by Tsionas (2002). It assumes that each hospital is allowed different intercepts as well as slope coefficients. The main purpose of the model is to improve the accuracy in the efficiency estimation by separating the cost-efficiency estimates from heterogeneity among hospitals. This model is different from the Bayesian fixed frontier model, introduced by Koop et al. (1997) , which assumes that all hospitals share exactly the same production possibilities (i.e. no heterogeneity between hospitals). The Bayesian SF model with random coefficients is estimate through Bayesian method, which has an additional key advantage, in that the technique incorporates informative priors, so that prior knowledge, or results of a previous model, can be used to inform the current model (Greene, 2005; Orea & Kumbhakar, 2004) . In other words, it obeys the likelihood principle. And small sample inference is carried out in the same way as if one had access to a large sample, and all inferences follow logically from Bayes' theorem. Therefore, any sample size can be accommodated, no matter how small. The estimation is unbiased with respect to sample size. Moreover, Bayesian inference is consistent with much of the philosophy of science regarding epistemology, where knowledge cannot be built entirely through experimentation, but requires prior knowledge (Griffin & Steel, 2007; Koop et al., 1997) . To illustrate the general setup of cost function in SFA and the model of Tsionas (2002) with random coefficients, we consider the following cost equation: where C it is a vector of the dependent variable for the ith observation of year t (typically logs of production or cost), X it is vector of explanatory variables (typically logs of inputs), v it is a random error identically and independently distributed as N(0, 2 n ), it is a non-negative random error which captures the level of cost inefficiency and ensures that each hospital's cost-efficiency lies on or below the frontier model, ˇi is a vector of random coefficients and is a non-random intercept. In the Bayesian context, it is common to assume that the inefficiency term it is exponentially distributed (Other distributions such as truncated and gamma are also possible, but the exponential distribution is generally the most common in the Bayesian framework. More details can be referred to Koop (2003) ) with a parameter Â, and which can be expressed as follows: To complete the model assumptions, the parameters ˇi follows a multivariate normal distribution, where¯ is a vector of parameter means, ˝ is a positive-definite covariance matrix. This makes the model hierarchical with two levels of latent variables, ˇi and it . Specifically, each hospital under consideration has its own cost function with parameterš i which account for heterogeneity or technological differences between hospitals. The restriction of ˝ = 0 will make the model in Eq. (1) converge to the traditional or fixed stochastic frontier model, which is commonly used in the literature. Some additional assumptions of the model are that ˇi is independently distributed, and e it as well as it are independent of X it , where e it = C it − ˛ − X itˇi . For details about the likelihood and the conditional posteriors of the model refer to Appendix A.
