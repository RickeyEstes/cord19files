2.1. Expression of CTB, growth conditions, cell fractionation, and IB isolation BL-21(DE3) was transformed with the vector pAE-ctxB containing a DNA sequence coding for CTB (Areas et al., 2002) . For the expression of CTB, a colony was randomly picked from transformants that were grown on LB plates (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl) containing 100 g/ml ampicilin and inoculated in 2-HKSII rich medium (Jensen and Carlsen, 1990) . Cells were grown at 37 • C, and the expression of CTB was induced by addition of isopropyl-␤-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM) when the O.D. at A 600 nm reached approximately 3. The culture was separated into flasks that were then incubated at different temperatures (20 • C, 30 • C or 37 • C). After incubation with constant orbital agitation (150 rpm) for a 16 h period, bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 • C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mM EDTA. Lysozyme, at a final concentration of 50 g/ml, was added to the suspension, followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The suspension was sonicated in the presence of 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. The pellet was washed twice in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, suspended in 40 ml of the same buffer and stored at −20 • C.
