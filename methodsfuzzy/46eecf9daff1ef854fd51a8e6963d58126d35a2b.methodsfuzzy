Study Population. 12 HLA-A2-positive healthy individuals and 10 HLA-A2-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C were studied. Samples of patients with chronic HCV infection were obtained at least 6 mo after diagnosis of HCV infection. All patients repeatedly tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies, and with one exception HCV RNA was detected by PCR. Most (8 out of 10) of the patients had not been treated with IFN-␣ before sample collection, and the other two patients finished an ineffective IFN-␣ treatment before sample collection. None of the HCV patients tested positive for autoimmune hepatitis serum markers. Patients and healthy blood donors were negative for antibodies to HIV and HBV and healthy donors were also negative for anti-HCV antibodies. Cell Lines. The EBV-transformed B cell line JY (HLA-A * 0201, -B7, -Cw7, -DR4, -Drw6, and -Dpw2) and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l -glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 g/ml), and Hepes (5 mM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FCS (FCSmedium). The human B lymphoblastoid cell line AHH-1 TK ϩրϪ derived from the RPMI 1788 cell line (HLA type: A2, Aw33, B7, B14) was maintained in FCS-medium. H2A3 and h2D6 cells (AHH-1 TK ϩրϪ cells transfected with vectors coding for human CYP2A6 and CYP2D6, respectively; reference 25) were cultured in selective RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM l -histidinol without l -histidine (Gentest Corp.) supplemented with l -glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 g/ml), and Hepes (5 mM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FCS (h2-medium). AHH-1 T/K ϩրϪ , h2A3, and h2D6 cells were a gift from Charles L. Crespi (Gentest Corp., Woburn, MA). Induction of Primary CTLs. PBMCs from HLA-A2-positive healthy donors and HCV patients were isolated on Ficoll-Paque density gradients and washed three times in PBS containing 10% FCS-medium. 4 ϫ 10 6 PBMCs were incubated with synthetic peptide (10 g/ml; Chiron Mimotopes) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l -glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 g/ml), and Hepes (5 mM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated human AB serum (AB-medium) for 1 h, washed once in PBS containing 10% FCS-medium, and then plated in 24-well plates at 4 ϫ 10 6 cells/well in AB-medium. On day 3 and weekly thereafter, 1 ml of complete medium supplemented with rIL-2 (20 U/ml; EuroCetus B.V.) was added to each well. On day 7 and weekly thereafter, the cultures were restimulated with 10 6 peptide-pulsed, irradiated (7,400 rads) autologous feeder cells in 1 ml of AB-medium containing rIL-2 (20 U/ml). The cultured PBMCs were tested for CTL activity against different peptides on day 35 . Generation of Peptide-specific Cell Lines. Peptide-specific induction cultures were depleted of CD4 ϩ cells using negative selection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynabeads ® ; DYNAL A.S.) and plated at 100 cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were plated in FCS-medium in the presence of PHA (1 g/ml), rIL-2 (30 U/ml), irradiated (10,400 rads) allogeneic PBMCs (10 6 cells/ ml), and irradiated (22,000 rads), peptide-pulsed (10 g/ml; 1 h) JY EBV-B cells (10 5 cells/ml). Peptide-specific wells were expanded by restimulation in a 24-well plate as described above. Cytotoxicity Assay. JY target cells were incubated with synthetic peptides (10 g/ml) in FCS-medium overnight. Target cells (peptide-pulsed JY cells or AHH-1 TK ϩրϪ -derived cells) were labeled with 100 Ci of Na 2 [ 51 Cr]O 4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h and washed four times with PBS containing 10% FCS-medium. Cytolytic activity was determined in a standard 4-h 51 Cr-release assay using U-bottomed 96-well plates containing 2,500 targets per well. Where indicated in the figure legends, 2,500 K562 cells per well were added to reduce unspecific lysis. Percentage of cytotoxicity was determined from the formula: 100 ϫ [(experimental release Ϫ spontaneous release)/ (maximum release Ϫ spontaneous release)]. Maximum release was determined by lysis of targets with HCl. Spontaneous release was Ͻ 25% of maximal release in all assays. Specific lysis was calculated as difference between lysis of targets with peptide (or plasmid) and targets without peptide (or plasmid). In peptide titration experiments, JY target cells were incubated with various peptide concentrations for 90 min after 51 Cr labeling, washed once with PBS, and used as described above. In functional MHC binding assays, JY target cells were pulsed with synthetic peptide for 90 min at indicated times before the assay, then washed twice with PBS containing 10% FCS-medium, incubated in FCS-medium until 51 Cr labeling, and used as described above. CD8 dependency of target recognition was tested by addition of 10 g/ml anti-CD8 antibody OKT8 (Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc.) during the cytotoxicity assay. Peptide "Stripping" by Mild Acid Treatment. JY cells were washed twice with PBS and then put on ice for 5 min. 10 7 cells were then treated for 90 s with 2 ml ice-cold citric acid-Na 2 HPO 4 buffer (a mixture of an equal volume of 0.263 M citric acid and 0.123 M Na 2 HPO 4 ), pH 3.2. Immediately thereafter, the eluted cells were buffered with cold IMDM, washed with IMDM, and resuspended at 5 ϫ 10 5 cells in IMDM with 1 g/ml ␤ 2 -microglobulin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Competition-based MHC Class I Peptide Binding Assay. Peptides were tested for their binding affinity using the previously described peptide binding assay (26) . In brief, cells were stripped (see above) and resuspended at 7 ϫ 10 5 cells/ml in IMDM plus 1.5 g/ml ␤ 2 -microglobulin. A fluorescein (FL)-labeled reference peptide (FLPSDC(FL) FPSV), 25 l (end concentration, 150 nM), was incubated with 25 l of competitor peptide (different end concentrations) in a 96-well V-bottomed plate. 100 l of mild acid-treated JY cells was added to these wells. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 4 Њ C, washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBA1%), resuspended in PBA1% containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by FACScan ® (Becton Dickinson). The mean fluorescence (MF) value obtained in the wells without competitor peptide was regarded as maximal binding and equated to 0% inhibition; the MF obtained from the wells without reference peptide was equated to 100% inhibition. Percentage of inhibition of binding was calculated using the formula: [1 Ϫ (MF 150 nM reference and competitor peptide Ϫ MF no reference peptide) / (MF 150 nM reference peptide Ϫ MF no reference peptide)] ϫ 100%. Measurement of MHC-Peptide Complex Stability. JY cells at a concentration of 1-2 ϫ 10 6 cells/ml were incubated with 10 Ϫ 4 M emetine (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 1 h at 37 Њ C to stop protein synthesis and the subsequent emergence of de novo synthesized class I molecules at the cell surface. Cells were washed twice with PBS and peptide stripped (see above). 10 6 cells were added to 200 g of peptide in 1 ml and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold IMDM and resuspended in 1 ml IMDM. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h at 37 Њ C and thereafter stained with BB7.2, an HLA-A2 confirmation-specific mAb (27) , and goat anti-mouse FITC. Thereafter, the cells were fixed by resuspension in PBA1% containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACScan ® . The fluorescence index (FI) was calculated as FI ϭ (mean fluorescence sample Ϫ mean fluorescence background) / mean fluorescence background without peptide. Samples were tested in duplicate and the variation between both samples was always Ͻ 10%.
