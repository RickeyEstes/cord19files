Most studies using both proteomic and transcriptomic data have analyzed each data type separately and then aggregated the results in a post hoc manner. For example, functional pathway or network analyses of derived gene and protein lists were compared to identify common regulators among the two datasets (Piruzian et al., 2010) , or networks inferred from differentially expressed proteins were scored for enrichment in differentially expressed genes (Imielinski et al., 2012) . Others have tried to analyze correlation between mRNA and protein abundance and found only modest concordance between transcript and protein levels in yeast (Hack, 2004) , mammalian cells (Zhao et al., 2009) , or tissue (Ghazalpour et al., 2011) . Attempting a direct correlation between proteomic and transcriptomic data is extremely challenging because of multiple layers of possible discrepancies. These include distinct sensitivities of cDNA array hybridization and peptide measurement, different biases in the two technologies (Ghazalpour et al., 2011) , timing differences between transcription and translation, or post-transcriptional and translational modifications. It is interesting to note that influenza virus modifies both transcriptional and translational regulation by capsnatching (Plotch et al., 1981) , interaction with the cellular RNA polymerase II (Engelhardt et al., 2005) and spliceosome components (Wolff et al., 1998) , and by ribosomal recruitment (Kash et al., 2002 (Kash et al., , 2006 . Therefore, looking at the correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data could provide additional value into influenza virus-mediated translational control. In Calu-3 cells infected with VN1203, Pearson correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that very early (0-3 hpi) up-regulated proteins and late (12-24 hpi) downregulated proteins changed in abundance without regulation of their transcript (Eisfeld et al., in review) . These anti-correlations could be driven by viral targeting of the mRNA or translation machinery; however, consideration of additional levels of mRNA regulation, such as miRNA and isoform quantification, would be necessary to fully model the system.
