Probable SARS cases were collected from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou and Kaoshiung from August 2003 to February 2004. The inclusion criterion was any case diagnosed to be a probable SARS case according to the WHO definition modified on May 1, 2003 21 . There were 79 cases in total, including 78 effective cases (98.7%). One case could not be retrieved because of incomplete medical records. From retrospective medical records retrieval, objective data about probable SARS cases from emergency departments, hospitalizations, discharges or deaths were gathered. This covered patient basic information, vital signs, disease progression, laboratory and physical examinations, medical treatment, and revisit tracking. To assess the severity of chest X-rays, we quantified chest X-ray graphs into division numbers in terms of "feature" and "invasion extent". One point was given if infiltration was present, 2 points if the feature was consolidation, and 3 points if the feature was fibrosis. Invasion extent was rated by dividing bilateral lungs into four sections: (1) invasion of one-quarter of bilateral lungs rated 1 point, (2) invasion of two-quarters of bilateral lungs 2 points, (3) invasion of three-quarters of bilateral lungs 3 points, and (4) invasion of both lungs 4 points. The scores ranged from 0-7, with a higher score indicating a more severe chest X-ray graph.
