PCR is one of the most powerful tools that allows sequence-based identification of microorganisms and microbial community members. Nested PCR, Multiplex PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR, all variants of conventional PCR, have increased sensitivity and specificity, shortened analysis time, and allowed the distinction between live and dead organisms (Atkins and Clark, 2004; Capote et al. 2012; McCartney et al., 2003) . Conserved genes are the usual targets when using conventional PCR for the identification of CFUs or community members Hervàs et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2010) . Real-time PCR has provided a faster and a quantitative tool to estimate target and community-genome concentrations (Smith et al., 2012) , and species-specific primers have been used to study spore dispersion of pathogen fungi (Carisse et al., 2009; Schweigkofler et al., 2004) . Use of conserved genes together with cloning and sequencing has allowed microbial community composition studies, and although more powerful technologies (microarrays or next-generation sequencing) have been developed, cloning is still a common and affordable technique useful to evaluate communities (Fahlgren et al., 2010; Fierer et al., 2008) . Combination of PCR with other techniques is also common, although some can be time consuming. PCR-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), in situ hybridization (ISH)-PCR, ICC (integrated cell culture)-PCR, PCR-TGGE (temperature gradient gel electrophoresis), or PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) are some examples based on immunology aspects, ISH, tissue culture, and gradient gel electrophoresis. An ICC-PCR protocol that can be used to rapidly detect infectious viruses was developed by Reynolds et al. (1996) . PCR-ELISA and PCR-DGGE have been used to enhance the detection of plant pathogens, like Phytophthora or Pythium, and to determine microbiological composition during dust storms (Bailey et al., 2002; Somai et al., 2002; Rytkönen et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2011) . Fingerprinting (also known as DNA profiling) uses sequences that are highly variable between individuals, to identify organisms at the species and in some cases the strain level, and has been used to assess airborne microbial communities (Maron et al., 2005) . Included in this category, RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) uses restriction enzymes to digest the DNA and electrophoresis to separate fragments, generating unique patterns specific for species and strains. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is a PCR-based assay that uses short generic primers that may bind to different regions of the target genome and ultimately create a unique fingerprint. Different authors have utilized RFLP to study airborne communities (Kuske, 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Polymenakou et al., 2008) and RAPD and to identify single-plant pathogens (McCallum et al., 1999; Zambino et al., 2000) . Microsatellites are short sequences (one to six nucleotides) repeated in eukaryotic genomes, also known as simple sequence repeats or short tandem repeats. Their location and number of repetitions through the genome are random and unique; therefore, the pattern of amplification of these sequences may be used to identify individuals. This application has been used by Szabo and colleagues for the specific identification of the plant pathogen Puccinia graminis (Barnes and Szabo, 2007) . Methods based on DNA hybridization are emerging with the development of microarray-based technologies. They allow the detection of multiple microorganisms in a single reaction, since arrays can harbor thousands of different genetic probes (Wilson et al., 2002) . These chip-based assays can also be utilized to identify strains or to determine the endemicity of isolates (Cho and Tiedje, 2001) . Airborne dust-storm communities have been successfully screened using this methodology (Leski et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013) . Next-generation sequence technologies (454 GS-FLX (Roche), Illumina Hi Seq2000 (Illumina), Ion Torrent PGM (Applied Biosystems)) have provided powerful tools to study microbial communities. One of the primary journal articles on airborne metagenomics was published in 2008 by Tringe et al.; those authors reference the indoor urban environment. Rapid advances and improvements in these assays have resulted in interesting reports regarding airborne microorganisms and how they may be affected by factors such as seasonality or dust storms Franzetti et al., 2011; Rastogi et al., 2012) . These studies have primarily focused on airborne bacterial communities, and some are recently published references to airborne viruses (Bowers et al., 2011a,b; DeLeon-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2013; Whon et al., 2012) .
