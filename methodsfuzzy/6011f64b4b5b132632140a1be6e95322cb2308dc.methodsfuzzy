We model Hawaii tourism activity using a vector error correction framework. In this section we present the econometric framework, and describe the procedures used to identify the system and select a parsimonious model. Consider the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) for an m × 1 vector of I(1) variables, z t , where k is the number of lags in the unrestricted VAR representation of z t , and d is an m vector of deterministic terms. 14 The equilibrium properties of (4) are characterized by the rank of Π . 15 If the elements of z t are I(1) and cointegrated with rank(Π ) = r < m, Π can be decomposed into two m × r full column rank matrices α and β, where Π = αβ . This implies that there exist r < m stationary linear combinations of z t , such that ξ t = β z t ∼ I (0). 16 The matrix of adjustment coefficients, α, measures how strongly deviations from the long-run equilibrium, ξ t , feed back into the system. To select a parsimonious version of the VECM in Eq. (4), at least four types of restrictions are relevant: restrictions on the rank of the long-run matrix, Π ; restrictions on the long-run cointegrating vectors, β; restrictions on the short-run dynamic coefficients, Γ i ; and restrictions on the loading parameters, α. Researchers have proposed various different ways to impose these restrictions (Johansen, 1988 (Johansen, , 1991 (Johansen, , 1995 Pesaran & Shin, 2001; Phillips, 1991 Phillips, , 1995 Saikkonen, 1993a,b) . However, Hall et al. (2002) argue that these approaches are almost impossible to implement in practice when a fairly rich specification encounters a limited sample size. The interaction of dynamic and long-run parameters has an enormous 14 In addition to an intercept, pulse-type dummy variables are included for the 1985 United Airlines strike and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The estimation period ends in 2001Q2, so we do not need to include a dummy for the 9/11 terror attacks. 15 In Eq. (4), . . , k, are m × m matrices of unknown parameters in the unrestricted VAR representation of z t . We assume that the roots of | I n − Φ 1 λ − Φ 2 λ 2 − · · · − Φ k λ k |= 0 lie either on or outside the unit circle, but rule out the possibility that one or more elements of z t are I(2). A review of the econometric analysis of I(2) variables is provided by Haldrup (1998) . 16 If all elements of z t are stationary, Π is a full rank m×m matrix. If the elements of z t are I(1) but not cointegrated, Π is rank zero and a VAR model in first differences is appropriate. effect on the size and power of the statistical tests conventionally adopted. The Monte Carlo results of Hall et al. (2002) reveal that imposing valid weak exogeneity restrictions before testing the cointegrating rank generally improves the power of Johansen rank tests. At the same time, restricting the cointegrating rank has little impact on weak exogeneity tests, at least as long as the rank is not restricted to be less than the true rank. We follow Hall et al. (2002) and apply the following pragmatic strategy in reducing our general VECM to a more parsimonious representation: 1. Test and impose weak exogeneity restrictions; 2. Test the rank of the long-run matrix, Π (cointegrating rank); 3. Use Johansen's reduced rank procedure to estimate the cointegrating vectors; 4. Test and impose theory-based just-and overidentifying restrictions on the cointegrating vector, β; 5. Estimate the complete dynamic model and simplify the dynamics. At this stage, the causality structure of the model is established by eliminating cointegrating vectors with insignificant loading parameters.
