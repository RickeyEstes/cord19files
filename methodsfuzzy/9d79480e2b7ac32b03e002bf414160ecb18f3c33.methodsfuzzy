Time to death or respiratory intervention, proportion of participants alive, proportion of participants achieving WHO motor milestones, proportion of participants developing clinically manifested SMA, and safety analyses were analyzed in all study participants who received â‰¥1 dose of nusinersen (intent-to-treat population). All other efficacy analyses were performed on interim efficacy sets that comprised all dosed participants who attended or had the opportunity to attend the targeted visit of the analysis (efficacy set). All secondary endpoints were assessed at ages 13 and 24 months. Proportion of participants alive and proportion who achieved WHO motor milestones at ages 13 and 24 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. CHOP INTEND total score, HINE-2 total motor milestone score, change in growth parameters, ulnar and peroneal CMAP amplitude, and pNF-H concentrations were summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of participants developing clinically manifested SMA at Day 365 (13-month assessment) or Day 700 (24-month assessment) were reported with a corresponding Wilson score confidence interval (CI) with continuity correction [34] . The age at which a WHO motor milestone was achieved was determined by using the caregiver-reported date if confirmed at the subsequent study visit by the physical therapist. To identify early predictors of motor function, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. Specifically, the relationships between participant characteristics at baseline and at the end of the loading dose period on Day 64 (age at first dose of nusinersen, gestational age, plasma pNF-H levels, weight for age, CHOP INTEND total score, HINE-2 motor milestone total score, and ulnar CMAP amplitude) and future motor function (Day 302 total HINE-2 motor milestone score and age of achievement of walking alone) were evaluated. The statistical software SAS R version 9.4 (Cary, NC) or above was used for all summaries and statistical analyses.
