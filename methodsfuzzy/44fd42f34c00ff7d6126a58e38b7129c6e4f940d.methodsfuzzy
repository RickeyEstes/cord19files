Unfortunately, scientific investigations on the antimicrobial activity of essential oils have been retarded by the lack of appropriate susceptibility testing methods for the essential oils and because no generally approved assay method has been established for the assessment of their antimicrobial activity. Many researchers have employed the disk assay method. However, the results of this method were not always in parallel with those of dilution assay methods. The differences were caused not only by differences in the solubility of the oils but also by interactions of the components in the concentrated solution used in the disk assay. 48 The dilution method could be more reliable than the disk method with regard to reproducibility and clinical relevance. When testing nonwater-soluble and highly volatile essential oils by the dilution method, it is necessary to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of the oils in the medium. Chemical emulsifiers such as Tween 80, Tween 20 and other have been used frequently for this homogenization, but it has been reported that emulsifiers reduced the bioactivity of the oils, probably because of the formation of micelles, which inhibit adequate contact between the oil and the test organism. 48 Evidence also shows that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the essential oils under open conditions of incubation caused a two-to eight-fold rise in the MICs of highly volatile oils, as compared with values obtained under sealed conditions. Sealed conditions are used to examine whether essential oils showed antibacterial activity against major respiratory tract pathogens (this method was authorized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy to adjust for the physico-chemical properties of essential oils). The scientific information concerning the antimicrobial effectiveness of the essential oils in the vapor phase compared with direct contact case show that potential of this form of the essential oils is ambiguous, although some degree of inhibition by volatile components of the essential oils has been demonstrated in the vapor phase. In fact, more investigation into the antibacterial effectiveness of the vapor phase is required. It seems that the composition of the atmosphere generated by the essential oils is also potentially correlated with their antimicrobial behavior. This part mentioned the main antibacterial activity laboratory assay methods, as already noted. These methods do not show coordinated results in some case and this appearance is reasoned to the necessity of simultaneously running two or more methods for antibacterial activity determination of essential oils. Although the modification with liquid broth is mostly practical for fungi, the serial dilution agar method is also common for bacteria and fungi. The difference is that agar broth cultures are grown in Petri dishes or tubes, but liquid broth cultures are cultivated in conical flasks filled with 100 mL medium or test tubes with 2.5-5 mL medium (bacteria and moulds). The inhibitory growth index is determined for the liquid broth in conical flasks (percent changes in mould's biomass comparing to the control culture). There is an inhibitory effect of essential oil which appears in the test tube cultures and is measured turbidimetrically or with the plate count method. The estimation of essential oil activity both in agar and liquid broth would be simplified through counting the tested microorganisms that can remain in the membrane. The lowest essential oil concentration in the broth that results in the lack of visible microorganism growth changes is known as the MIC. The microorganisms are then transferred from the lowest essential oil concentration medium (with no visible microorganism growth) into a new broth medium and incubation to determine the lethal activity of essential oil. 78
