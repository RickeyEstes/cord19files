Viruses, plasmids, and cells. Poliovirus Mahoney type 1 was isolated following transfection with an infectious cDNA [89] and propagated as previously described [34] . ''Tet-off'' MCF7 cells were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, California, United States) and propagated in DMEM þ 10% FBS; MCF7 cells are highly inducible for autophagosome formation in response to tamoxifen [9] . Poliovirus stocks were titered on both HeLa H1 and MCF7 cells. The multiplicities of infections indicated refer to titers on the appropriate cell lines. H1-HeLa cells were used due to their permissiveness for rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus stocks were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, United States). Virus stocks were prepared in H1-HeLa cells (ATCC) grown in EMEM supplemented with 0.2 M HEPES and 0.1 M MgCl 2 , and viral titers were measured by TCID 50 as described previously [90] . To construct the GFP-LC3 fusion protein-expressing plasmid, LC3B sequences were amplified by PCR from a Human Lung Library (ResGen, Carlsbad, California, United States) using targeted primers containing EcoRI sites (ACTGAATTCCCATGCCGTCGGAGAAG and TTTGAATTCTTACACTGACAATTTCA). The LC3A coding region was then inserted into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) to create an EGFP-LC3 fusion protein under the control of the CMV immediate-early promoter. Expression of poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A was performed as described previously [35] . The 293T cells, which express SV40 T antigen, were used to facilitate expression from the SV40 promoter in these plasmids. Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed using freshly made 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Poliovirus protein 3A and cellular protein LAMP1 were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. For visualization of poliovirus 3A protein in the presence of GFP-LC3, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in a PBS solution that also contained 0.5% saponin, 10 mM sodium azide, 0.125% BSA, 3A monoclonal tissue culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:30, and rhodamine-linked antimouse secondary antibody (SC-2084, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, Califor-nia, United States) at a dilution of 1:200. Cells were incubated at 4 8C for 45 min, washed twice with PBS, and placed under Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States). Visualization of LAMP1 was performed using a monoclonal LAMP1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Kentucky, United States) at a dilution of 1:200. MDC staining and costaining. MDC (Sigma, St. Louis, United States) was stored at À20 8C under desiccant. A fresh stock solution of 5 mM MDC was made in 1:1 DMSO/EtOH immediately prior to adding to cultures. At 1 h before fixation, fresh medium that contained either 10 lM MDC in DMSO/EtOH or an equivalent volume of DMSO/EtOH was added to the cells. The cells were then fixed using a freshly made 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and imaging was performed immediately. To ensure that membrane vesiculation induced by methods other than the induction of autophagy did not show similar MDC staining patterns, Golgi vesiculation was induced with 5 lM ilimaquinone [91] or 5 lM nocodazole [92] ; the disappearance of intact Golgi was confirmed using BODIPY-C 5 ceramide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States). Under these conditions, punctate MDC staining was not observed (data not shown). Microscopy and deconvolution analysis. Microscopic analysis was carried out on an Olympus IX70 at 100X magnification. Images were captured and deconvolved using SoftWorx 2.50 on an SGI Octane workstation. MDC staining was detected at 360 nm excitation/457 nm emission. GFP-LC3 expression was detected at 490 nm excitation/ 528nm emission. Rhodamine was detected at 555 nm excitation/617 nm emission. Individual images from each stack were saved as TIFF files and processed in Adobe Photoshop 7.0. RNA interference to reduce intracellular concentrations of LC3 and ATG12. siRNA SMARTpools, consisting of four RNA duplexes targeting the gene of interest, and a control siRNA targeting firefly luciferase, were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colorado, United States). For LC3, both LC3A and LC3B RNAs [93] were targeted, bringing the total number of transfected duplexes to eight. Pools consisted of an equal amount of each duplex. The siRNA sequences are given as sense/antisense pairs. The siRNA sequences for ATG12 were: GGGAAGGACUUACGGAUGUUU/59P-ACAUCC-GUAAGUCCUUCCCUU; GAACACCAAGUUUCACUGUUU/59P-ACAGUGAAACUUGGUGUUCUU; GCAGUAGAGCGAACAC-GAAUU/59P-UUCGUGUUCGCUCUACUGCUU; and UGUUGCAG-CUUCCUACUUCUU/59P-GAAGUAGGAAGCUGCAACAUU. The siRNA sequences for LC3A were: GGACGGCUUCCUCUAUAUGUU/ 59P-CAUAUAGAGGAAGCCGUCCUU; CGGUGAUCAUCGAGCG-CUAUU/59P-UAGCGCUCGAUGAUCACCGUU; ACAUGAGCGA-GUUGGUCAAUU/59P-UUGACCAACUCGCUCAUGUUU; and CGCCCAUCGCGGACAUCUAUU/59P-UAGAUGUCCGCGAUGGGC-GUU. The siRNA sequences for LC3B were: CAAAGUUCCUUGUAC-CUGAUU/59P-UCAGGUACAAGGAACUUUGUU; GAUAAUAGAAC-GAUACAAGUU/59P-CUUGUAUCGUUCUAUUAUCUU; GUAGAA-GAUGUCCGACUUAUU/59P-UAAGUCGGACAUCUUCUACUU; and AGGAGACGUUCGGGAUGAAUU/ 59P-UUCAUCCCGAACGUCUC-CUUU. Cells were grown to densities of 1-5 3 10 5 per 6-cm dish in 2.5 ml EMEM without antibiotics, and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to manufacturer's instructions. For each 6-cm dish, 100 total pmol of pooled siRNA was diluted in 250 ll of serum-free OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) and, separately, 5 ll of Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted in 250 ll of OptiMEM. After an incubation of 5 min at room temperature, the diluted RNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The 500-ll mixture was then added to each dish and gently rocked to spread the lipid-RNA complexes. Growth curves and immunoblots were performed 48 h after transfection. Total cell extracts were made using RSB-NP40 extraction buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Extract was separated on a 15% Laemmli gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane for Western blotting. Anti-LC3 immunoblotting was performed using rabbit antibody raised commercially (AnaSpec, San Jose, California, United States) against a peptide comprising the first 16 amino acids of murine LC3 (MPSEKTFKQRRSFEQR). Anti-Atg12p and anti-GAPDH immunoblotting was performed using antibodies from Zymed (South San Francisco, California, United States) and Research Diagnostics (Flanders, New Jersey, United States), respectively. Antibodies were diluted 1:3,000 in a PBS solution that also contained 0.1% Tween-20 and 2% BSA, and detected with alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat antirabbit antibody, at a dilution of 1:10,000 using the ECF reagent from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, New Jersey, United States). High-pressure freezing, freeze-substitution, and electron microscopy (EM). For cryofixation and EM analysis, H1-HeLa cells were grown in EMEM supplemented with 0.2 M HEPES and 0.1 M MgCl 2 in flasks. Cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for poliovirus or 50 TCID 50 /cell for rhinovirus, then washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.15 M mannitol in PBS and collected by centrifugation. Aliquots of the resulting pellet were frozen in a Balzers HPM 10 high-pressure freezing apparatus as described previously [2] and stored in liquid nitrogen. To observe cellular ultrastructure, samples were freeze-substituted in 0.1% tannic acid in acetone at À80 8C, rinsed in acetone, then warmed at À20 8C in the presence of 2% osmium tetroxide in acetone for 16 h, followed by incubation at 4 8C for 4 h. After rinsing in acetone at 4 8C, samples were embedded in Epon-Araldite resin. Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged at 80 kV in a JEOL 100C or Philips CM10 EM. For immunostaining, high-pressure frozen samples were freeze-substituted in 0.1% glutaraldehyde-0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone, embedded, stained, and visualized as described previously [35] .
