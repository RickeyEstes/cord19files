We have developed an R package called DiseaseCellTypes that contains implementations of the gene set compactness (GSC) and gene set overexpression (GSO) methods and the method used to create the cell-typespecific interactomes. DiseaseCellTypes is available to download from [22] . This package also includes the data and a vignette containing the code required to reproduce the results detailed in this study. The 73 cell-type-specific interactomes are available to download from [23] . The RWR method measures distances between vertex pairs in a graph. Unlike simpler methods, such as the shortest paths method, the RWR method incorporates the entire structure of the graph when measuring distances. It has been shown to be more effective than the shortest paths method in tasks such as disease gene prioritization [13] . To measure the distance from vertex i to vertex j, a random walker is started from vertex i. At each time step, the walker can either move to a vertex directly connected to its current vertex, or move back to its starting vertex with restart probability r. In an unweighted graph, the probability that the walker moves to each connected vertex is uniform. In a weighted graph, the probability distribution is based upon the weights of the edges, so that the walker is more likely to travel along an edge of high weight. As the number of time steps increases, the probability that the random walker will be located at each vertex converges to a steady state [31] . We used a method based on the iterative approach described by Köhler et al. [13] to compute the RWR distances. Let A be the column-normalized adjacency matrix of graph G, using edge weights w. p is a probability matrix with dimensions equal to n, the number of vertices in G. The element p t i,j is the probability that a walker starting from vertex i is located at vertex j at time t. The initial probability matrix p 0 is an identity matrix. Probabilities can be computed iteratively using: Iterations are conducted until the change in the probability matrix across time steps (p t and p t+1 , measured using the Manhattan distance) falls below a cutoff. To save computational time, we computed only the distances between the vertices in the vertex set S and all of the vertices in the graph. A restart probability r of 0.7 was used (see 'Parameter selection' below for justification), along with an iteration cutoff of |S|×10 −5 . For each vertex i, vertices are ranked by their probability, so that the vertex that the random walker is most likely to be located on is ranked first. These ranks are used as the distances between the vertices in Eq. 2. Alongside the GSC and text-mining methods, we used the overexpression of sets of disease-associated genes to identify associated cell types (Fig. 2C , Additional file 15: Table  S10 and Additional file 16: Table S11 , see 'Methods'), an approach previously found to be successful [11] . This is the GSO method. Although the GSC and text-mining methods identify different associations (Additional file 17: Figure S6 and Additional file 18: Figure S7 ), the overlap is significant at FDRs of 5, 10 and 20 % (Table 1 and Additional file 19: Table 1 Number of disease-cell-type associations identified by the GSC and GSO methods supported by text-mining at a 10 % FDR. Text-mining overlap significance was computed using Fisher's exact test Method GSC GSO Supported by text-mining 320 269 Not supported by text-mining 340 294 Text-mining overlap significance 5.80 × 10 −183 1.57 × 10 −149 Table S12 ), demonstrating that a significant proportion of the associations identified by the method are supported by published literature, providing validation for the method. At these FDRs, the overlap between the GSO and text-mining results is also significant. While a similar proportion of GSC-and GSO-identified associations are supported by text-mining (Additional file 20: Figure S8 ), the advantage of using cell-type-specific interactomes to explore the molecular mechanisms that drive disease is their ability to identify previously unidentified disease-associated genes and pathways. These results demonstrate that disease-associated genes interact more strongly in the interactomes of the disease-manifesting cell types. These interactomes are therefore more likely to be informative when identifying previously unidentified disease-associated genes. The GSC and GSO methods identify different sets of associated cell types, indicating that they represent complementary approaches. However, there is still a large amount of support between the GSC and GSO methods (Additional file 21: Figure S9 ). For 64.0 % of diseases, at least 50 % of the associations identified by the GSC method are supported by the GSO method. Using the MeSH term mapped to each disease and the cell ontology term mapped to each cell type [1] , it is possible to identify classes of diseases and cell types. The GSC, GSO and text-mining methods identify different numbers of associations between diseases and cell types of different classes (Table 2) . A greater proportion of the cell types identified by the GSC and GSO methods as being associated with immune system diseases are cell types of the immune system. Conversely, a greater proportion of the cell types identified by textmining as being associated with cardiovascular diseases and mental disorders are cell types of the cardiovascular system and neural cell types, respectively. The GSC and GSO methods identify low numbers of cardiovascular cell types as being associated with cardiovascular diseases, compared to text-mining. This may indicate that these methods are less effective when applied to this disease class. Many of the cell types identified as associated with cardiovascular diseases by the GSC and GSO methods are cell types of the immune system, possibly reflecting an important role for the immune system in cardiovascular disease development [42] . As previously mentioned, the text-mining method used in this study does not take into account the context in which a cell type or disease is mentioned and therefore cannot distinguish between the cell types directly affected by the disease-associated genes and indirectly affected cell types. This may contribute to the differences seen between the methods. To test this, textmining methods that are able to incorporate the contexts in which cell types and diseases are mentioned in articles will need to be developed and applied. The MeSH database and cell ontology were used to identify diseases and cell types belonging to each class. A disease and cell type were said to belong to a class if they were descendants of the following terms: cardiovascular diseases (C14), cardiovascular cells (CL:0002139 and CL:0002494), immune system diseases (C20), immune system cells (CL:0000738), mental disorders (F03) and neural cells (CL:0002319). An FDR cutoff of 10 % was applied to the results of each method to produce sets of disease-cell-type associations
