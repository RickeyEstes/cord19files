Organism specific assays using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent assay methods are available for some parasites, viruses, and bacterial enterotoxins. ELISA tests for Giardia and Cryptosporidium antigen are available at most reference laboratories and can be performed as an in-house assay. 3 They are a reasonable alternative to special flotation techniques and achieve a similar level of diagnostic sensitivity. 14 Effective fecal antigen screens for Parvovirus are available as bench top kits. Antigen assays for enterotoxins of C perfringens and Clostridium difficile are also available. 3 All antigen detection methods require fresh feces. Samples may be placed in a sterile container and refrigerated at 2°to 8°C for up to 48 hours, or frozen for longer storage. Samples should be shipped on ice. Some antigen tests may be performed on feces preserved in formalin. The improper handling of feces can lead to false-negative results. 3, 4 Fecal Occult Blood Fecal occult blood tests are used to detect bleeding that is not grossly apparent. Multiple assays are available, and sensitivity varies markedly between assays. To avoid false-positives, the patient must be on a meat-free diet for at least 3 days before the feces are obtained. Diets containing hemoglobin from meat or peroxidases from uncooked vegetables can cause false-positive results. Tests performed on 3 or more bowel movements may help to avoid false-negative results. Avoid manual stool collection to prevent iatrogenic blood contamination. Fecal occult blood screening should be performed on fresh, voided feces. Samples submitted to laboratories should be stored at 2°to 8°C and shipped on ice within 4 days. 3, 4 ␣-1 Protease Inhibitor (␣-1 PI) Fecal ␣-1 PI levels are useful for the assessment of hypoproteinemia of uncertain cause. It is a qualitative and quantitative measure of GI protein loss. As gastrointestinal protein loss can vary, the assessment of multiple fecal samples is necessary. Three, 1-g fecal samples from 3 different bowel movements should be obtained from freshly voided stools. Avoid manual stool collection to prevent iatrogenic blood contamination. Samples are placed in tubes provided by the laboratory, frozen, and shipped on a cold pack. Proper sample handling is essential to avoid false-positive or false-negative results. 15
