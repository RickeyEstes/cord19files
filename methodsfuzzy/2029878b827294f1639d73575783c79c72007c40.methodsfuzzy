Because data sources used in an OH research approach are likely to be collected and obtained through multiple sources and mixed methodologies, researchers may need to choose analytical methods that accommodate complex data structures and relationships in order to adequately interpret study data. Depending on the research question and the data sources available, a variety of analytical methods and models are useful for the One Health research. We describe two examples here, log-linear models and principal component analysis, but other methods may be more appropriate, such as structural equation modeling, multi-level modeling, and multivariate regression depending on the data context [12] , as well as dose-response curves and the derivation of lethal dose (LD) or lethal concentration (LC) values used in health and ecological risk assessments. Chemical release, fate and transport, exposure, and risk models were developed to estimate the risks to human, environmental, and animal health associated with traditional biosolid management practices. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate distributions of non-cancer and cancer effects. Results from the analysis were compared to the human and environmental hazard management thresholds at the 95th percentile of the probability distribution of risk. To enhance model input processing, GIS technology was used to develop data layers and overlays, capture environmental variability, and facilitate subsequent geospatial analyses. By applying the OH approach to this body of research, investigators were able to assess risk from individual exposure pathways as well as total risk from all pathways (i.e. cumulative exposures). This study was able to determine cumulative ingestion exposure from consumption of pollutants in drinking water, as well as through ingesting exposed fish, crops, and livestock. In addition, risks associated with other exposure pathways, i.e. via air or contact with soil, could be evaluated in conjunction with ingestion-related risk to estimate total risk. This case study illustrates that consideration of connections among environmental, animal and human health facilitates a more comprehensive health risk assessment which has the ability to reflect cumulative exposures.
