The ability to detect viruses was significantly enhanced by the development of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against specific viral proteins for the viruses HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, CMV, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1-3, and adenovirus, and linked to the fluorescent molecule FITC. These staining procedures are rapid: samples are batch run and results are usually available within 1-3 h depending on the number of specimens tested. Rapid immunofluorescent (IF) staining methods for the direct detection of viral antigens in respiratory specimens have excellent specificity and very good sensitivity. Most respiratory viruses produce CPE in conventional cell cultures but often this is slow or very minimal in extent. The rapid detection of the respiratory viruses influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1-3 and adenovirus by IF is available in many laboratories and is extremely useful for the detection of these viruses, especially in paediatric patients who shed relatively large amounts of virus and for a longer period than do adults. The performance characteristics of the test depend on the type of specimen, age of the patient, duration of illness, MAb reagent and level of expertise of the laboratory staff. Generally, IF methods for respiratory viruses are a little less sensitive than culture with the exception of RSV. However, the greater sensitivity of RSV IF compared with RSV culture is due to the lability of RSV which is rapidly inactivated in samples that are not kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory quickly for inoculation into cell cultures within a short period after collection of the specimen. The reported sensitivities of IF detection of respiratory viruses varies but are broadly 90% for RSV, 80% for influenza A and B, 70% for parainfluenza 1-3 and 50% for adenoviruses. 6 MAbs directed against hMPV have been developed and are currently under investigation to establish their clinical utility. Membrane-based (cassette-based) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), optical immunoassays and immunochromographic or lateral-flow systems have been introduced for less technically demanding detection of respiratory viruses. 7 Some can now differentiate viruses, e.g. influenza A from influenza B, RSV from influenza A, and include a positive control to monitor performance of both the assay and the user. A significant aim of the manufacturers of these tests is to allow for testing to occur in the consulting physician's office. These techniques have the advantage of decreasing turn-around time for test results and have considerably simplified the technical component, but these tests are not as sensitive or specific as viral culture or direct IF (DIF) for detection of respiratory viruses. The positive predictive value of these assays is usually higher when there is a greater prevalence of disease in the respiratory virus season and the virus in question has been shown to be circulating in the community by viral culture or IF. During periods of relatively high prevalence positive results can usually be accepted as correct; however, negative results should be confirmed by a second method, e.g. DIF or culture. 8
