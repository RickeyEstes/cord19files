In this study, the CFD software FLUENT [15] is utilized to simulate room airflow distribution, and the numerical model is based upon the finite-volume method [16] . The governing equations, including continuity, momentum, energy, contaminant, and turbulence equations obey the principle of conservation and can be expressed in the following general form: where r is the density, f the dependent variable,Ṽ the velocity vector, G f;eff the effective diffusion coefficient, and S f the source term. The parameters f, G f;eff , and S f employed in continuity, momentum, energy, contaminant, and turbulence equations are listed in Table 1 . The diffusion-convection term of Eq. (1) is discretized by the QUICK scheme and the implicit method is used to discretize the transient term. After Eq. (1) is discretized, the general discretized equation can be written as where a p and a nb are discretized coefficients, and b is the discretized source term. In Eq. (2), subscript p represents the grid point under consideration and nb indicates the neighbors of grid point p. By employing the iterative scheme of a point implicit (Gauss-Seidel) linear equation solver in conjunction with an algebraic multigrid (AMG) method, the pressure, (2). During the iterative procedure, the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equationsconsistent (SIMPLEC) algorithm is employed to solve the pressure-velocity coupling equations. Regarding the boundary conditions, no-slip condition is used at the wall, and the standard wall functions for the k À turbulence model are adopted to link the solution variables at the near-wall cells and the corresponding quantities near the wall. To resolve reliable turbulence phenomena near the wall, the grid nearest to the wall falls into the logarithmic layer (that is, y þ 430260). Moreover, the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate e employed in air supply and air outlet are calculated by the following equations: where u avg is the mean flow velocity, I the turbulence intensity, D h the hydraulic diameter and C m ¼ 0:09. To simulate room air distribution affected by the moving person and the opening and closing of the sliding door, dynamic meshes are employed in the numerical simulation. Basic conservation equations of dynamic meshes are described as follows: within an arbitrary control volume V, as its boundary moves, the integral form of governing equation is given by where qV is the boundary of control volume V andṼ g is the grid velocity of the moving mesh. The transient term of Eq. (6) can be discretized by the following formula d dt where the superscripts n and n þ 1 represent the current and next time level, respectively. The volume of the control volume at n þ 1 level is calculated by where dV/dt is the volume derivative with respect to time, which needs to obey the grid conservation law. It can be found by where n f is the number of faces surrounding the control volume,Ã j the area vector of the j face, and dV j is the volume swept by the face j over the time step Dt.
