Study population and sampling procedures. Naso-oro-pharyngeal samples were collected using nasal and oropharyngeal (NPOP) swabs (Copan Diagnostics, USA) and were eluted in 3 ml of Universal Transport Media (UTM, Copan Diagnostics, USA) that had been supplemented with 500ul of a protein/DNA/RNA preservative, Allprotect (Qiagen, Germany). Upon collection, samples were stored at −80 °C. The study population consisted a total of 93 infants and young children admitted to Kilifi County hospital, in coastal Kenya, with respiratory infections and control infants who were sampled from home and did not exhibit any respiratory symptoms (Protocol A: n = 6, Protocol B: n = 4, Protocol C: n = 83). Diagnosis of respiratory infections was done using a multiplex PCR that was designed to detect 15 respiratory pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV -A & B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3 & 4) adenovirus, influenza (A, B & C), coronavirus (OC43 & e229), human metapneumovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Written informed consent was sought from the parents or legal guardians of the recruits prior to sampling while ethical clearance for the conduct of this study was provided by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Scientific and Ethical Review Committee (SERU). All methods were performed in accordance with good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) guidelines. Overview of protocol development for analysis of the upper-airway proteome. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified. Protocols were developed and tested in a stepwise sequence, with observations and lessons drawn from one protocol, feeding into the design and implementation of the next. The first protocol that was tested (A) was based on six randomly selected patient samples which were lysed with urea, peptides generated using a standard workflow and analysed by label free quantification. In the second protocol (B) nasal samples from four randomly selected children were selected and cells were obtained by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed, total protein extracted from the lysate using a commercial kit (Allprep, Qiagen), peptides generated and analysed by label free quantification. In the third and fourth protocols (Ci and Cii) samples were selected from 83 children. In protocol C, proteins and peptides were prepared in the same manner as protocol B, after which peptides were labelled with isobaric mass tags (TMT10plex). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. A schematic outline of all the protocols is shown in Fig. 1 while a detailed description of the individual protocols is outlined in supplementary methods. Mass spectrometry analysis. Peptides (8 μl) were loaded using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-flow ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, USA) on to a 75 µm × 2 cm C18 trap column (Thermo Scientific, USA) and separated on a 75 µm × 50 cm C18 reverse-phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific) at heated at 40 °C. For LFQ protein quantification; elution was carried out with mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) gradient (4 to 30%) over 180 min at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. For TMT protein quantification, two gradients were employed: in Protocol C i, the gradient was similar to that used for LFQ protein quantification, while the gradient employed in protocol C ii was modified to elute peptides for 310 min. Each LC run was finished by washout with 98% B for 10 min and re-equilibration in 2% B for 30 min. Five blanks of 40 min each were run on the column between each injection comprising of two wash cycles with 90% B and an equilibration phase of 15 min to avoid sample carryover. Peptides were measured using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to the chromatography system via a nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Scientific). On the Q Exactive, the ms^1 settings for peptides were: Resolution, 70000; AGC target, 3e6; maximum IT, 120 ms; scan range, 400-1800 m/z; while the ms^2 settings for fragmentation spectra of peptides were: Resolution, 17000 (35000 for labelled peptides); AGC target, 5e4; maximum IT, 120 ms; isolation SCIENTIfIC RepoRTS | (2018) 8:13814 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32072-3 window, 1.6 m/z. MS data were acquired by data dependent acquisition where the top 12 (15 for labelled peptides) most intense precursor ions in positive mode were selected for ms^2 Higher-energy C-trap dissociation fragmentation which were subsequently excluded for the next 45 s following fragmentation event. Charge exclusion was set to ignore peptide spectrum matches that were unassigned, singly charged, and those with ≥+8 charges. For LFQ protein quantification. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidations as variable modifications. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for both proteins and peptide-spectrum matches and was determined by searching a FASTA protein database comprising target and reversed target sequeces (decoy) derived from the organism being studied, by switching the amino-carboxyl orientation of a protein's amino acids to generate sequences that do not exist in nature 33 . Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine with trypsin as the protease. A maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed in the database search. Peptide identification was performed with an allowed initial precursor mass deviation of up to 7 ppm and an allowed fragment mass deviation of up to 20 ppm. A minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids and a maximum peptide mass of 4600 Da was allowed for the searches. The label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm in MaxQuant was used to obtain quantification intensity values. For labelled protein quantification. The 10plex TMT was specified under isobaric labels for reporter ion MS^2 and reporter mass tolerance was set at 0.01 Da. Carbamidomethylation(C) and TMT-10plex labeled N-terminus and lysine were set as a fixed modification while Oxidation (M) and Acetylation (Protein N-term) as variable Figure 1 . A schematic overview of the naso-oro-pharyngeal proteomics experiments: Naso-and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from infants and eluted in universal transport media supplemented with a protein/DNA/RNA preservative. In one set of samples (protocol A) cells in UTM were lysed with urea, reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. Peptides were then separated by HPLC and eluted in a 3 h gradient prior to MS analysis. In another set of samples (protocols B & C) cells in UTM were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed and proteins extracted using a commercial extraction kit. Proteins were then reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. In protocol B, peptides were separated by HPLC and eluted on a 3 h gradient. In protocol C peptides were labelled using TMT isobaric mass tags and pooled together prior to HPLC separation. In protocol Ci, proteins were eluted on a 3 h gradient, while in protocol Cii, proteins were eluted on a 6 h gradient prior to MS analysis.

The 10plex reporter ion intensity matrix for the study participants was extracted from the Maxquant proteingroup matrix file and batch corrected using an in house platform.
