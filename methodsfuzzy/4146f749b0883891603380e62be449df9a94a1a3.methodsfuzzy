Purification with high performance liquid chromatography was performed with an Agilent 1260 Infinity Binary LC System equipped with a Nucleodur C18 HTec, 5 µm by Macherey Nagel (Düren, Germany). A gradient from water and acetonitrile (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid respectively) was utilized to separate the compounds. Flash chromatography was performed with an Isolera One System from Biotage (Upsala, Sweden) using pre-packed KP-Sil SNAP-cartridges.
