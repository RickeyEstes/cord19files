With a list of known effectors at hand, homology searches can be applied to detect effector candidates. On the one hand, this approach has the drawback of being restricted to known families of effector proteins. This issue becomes especially evident when effectors are evolutionary ''invented'' by genome re-arrangements, as it has been shown for Type III secreted effector proteins in gram(Ã€) bacteria [45] . On the other hand, effectors from closely related species or effectors that are transmitted by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are detectable by homology searches. A good example for this method has been the Shigella toxin, which renders EHEC strains of E. coli especially harmful [46] . In this manuscript, 300 known and predicted effectors were used to detect homologous candidates in the proteome of an E. coli EHEC strain. This strategy identified 65 candidates of which 60% could be shown to be secreted. The sensitivity of homology searches in identifying effectors can be roughly estimated by the number of orthologous effectors known to date. The T3DB database [29] provides an upto-date set of effectors with their respective orthologous relationships between different species. Where 90 effectors do not have well defined orthologs, 138 could potentially be detected by their evolutionary relationships to other effectors (resulting in a sensitivity of 60%). Since in this analysis genes from different strains are unified into one entry, the amount of successfully identified effectors between different strains might be higher. Where text-mining as well as Interolog based approaches rely on known interactions, approaches to predict physically or at least functionally interacting proteins might uncover completely novel relationships. While genomic-context methods have been very successful to predict physical and functional interactions for species specific interactomes [78] [79] [80] , direct application of genomic context methods on HP-PPIs lacks their underlying rationale (as genes should be neighbors on the chromosome to detect operons and conserved neighborhoods, or are under the same evolutionary constraints detectable by similar phylogenetic profiles, named the co-occurrence method). Nonetheless, interactions predicted using genomic context methods can be reliably mapped by orthology to other species, even if the genomes of said species did not contribute to the detection of the functional or physical interaction [79] . An application to a host-pathogen system would be an analogous procedure to the Interolog approach and is as such subjected to the same restrictions. In addition, the fraction of only functionally or indirectly interacting proteins in the predicted sets might be relatively big: in an early study of Huynen et al. [81] , the fraction of predicted direct interactions has been reported to be between maximal $50% (for tracking of gene fusion events) and minimal 34% for the co-occurrence method. In general, the usefulness of a genomic context based approach for HP-PPI prediction has not been determined but might provide an interesting source of information complementary to known physical interactions. A promising way is the utilization of prediction methods that work on general properties of the amino-acid sequence. For example, machine learning techniques on representations of short stretches of amino-acids and their chemical-physical properties can be employed for a very general PPI prediction. Dyer and coworkers integrated such an approach for the prediction of human-HIV interactions [82, 83] . In this work, the authors extended the sequence derived feature set with information on domains and information on the local network properties of the human interaction partner. In contrast to the studies done on bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens, the high amount of experimental data for HIV allows the creation of a rigid test-set of reliable interactions. Dyer et al. evaluated several combinations of their features used for prediction and a combination of all (sequence, domain, and network information) achieved the best performance. Depending on the chosen cut-off, high precision and recall can be achieved, e.g. 80% precision at 50% recall.
