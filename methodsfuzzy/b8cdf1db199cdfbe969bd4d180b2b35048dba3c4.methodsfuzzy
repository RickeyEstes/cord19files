Conventional methods were used to assess the accuracy of the AB PCR technique. For HAdV, a direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA, Imagen TM , Oxoid, France) and cell culture isolation using MRC5 and HuH7 cells were used to detect respiratory viruses, including HAdV, as previously described (Freymuth et al., 2005) . The PCR Adenovirus Consensus Â® assay (Argene, France) was used to determine HAdV species and to confirm all adenovirus-positive samples detected by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), cell culture, or the AB PCR. The qualitative PCR method previously described by Allander et al. (2005) was used routinely to detect HBoV.
