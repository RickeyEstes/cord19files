Bootstrapping analysis is a statistical method for generating replicated data sets from observed data and evaluating the variability of the quantiles of interest without analytical calculation [35, 36] . An intentionally biased bootstrapping (IBB) technique is the resampling of explanatory variables with the response variables while increasing or decreasing the mean of the explanatory variable by a certain level. From this IBB, the effect of the response variable can be assessed by changing the mean [36, 37] . The mathematical description of the IBB method applied in this study is as follows. Suppose that, among n observations , where = 1, 2, 3, … , ,we resample the observations with bootstrapping by increasing the mean of the simulated data up to ∆ . This IBB can be done by assigning different weights , regarding the order of the observations as follows (Equation 1 ): The assigned weight , is the selected probability for the observations after scaling and adjustment. The average of the resampled data is shown in Equation (2):  Bootstrapping analysis is a statistical method for generating replicated data sets from observed data and evaluating the variability of the quantiles of interest without analytical calculation [35, 36] .

From this IBB, the effect of the response variable can be assessed by changing the mean [36, 37] . The mathematical description of the IBB method applied in this study is as follows. Suppose that, among n observations x i , where i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, we resample the observations with bootstrapping by increasing the mean of the simulated data up to ∆µ. This IBB can be done by assigning different weights S i,n regarding the order of the observations as follows (Equation 1): The assigned weight S i,n is the selected probability for the observations after scaling and adjustment. The average of the resampled data is shown in Equation (2): where x (i) represents the i-th ordered value and ψ = ∑ n i=1 S i,n . The amount of the average increase in ∆µ is: In order to obtain another value ∆ µ(r), the weights can be generalized as: where ψ r = ∑ n i=1 s r i,n and µ(r) = 1 ψ r ∑ n i=1 s r i,n x (i) . If the value of the average increase (or decrease) is given as ∆µ, the weight order "r" is calculated accordingly. The selection of the weight order (r) can be performed using an optimization technique with the objective function of minimize [∆µ − ∆ µ(r)] 2 . In this study, the IBB technique was employed to generate resampled data sets for PHEP and response to environmental disasters.
