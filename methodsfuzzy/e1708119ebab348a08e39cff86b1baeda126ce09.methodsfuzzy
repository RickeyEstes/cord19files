Cell culture. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from ATCC (CCL-185). HLE hepatocellular carcinoma cells were a kind gift of Dr. Britta Skawran (Hannover Medical School). Cells were cultivated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM + 10% FBS, 0.2 mM Glutamine and antibiotics. A549 and HLE MALAT1 KO cells were generated as previously published. 41 RNA isolation and DNase I digest. RNA from cancer cell lines was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were treated with DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C followed by a phenol:chloroform extraction and an ethanol precipitation at -80°C. For mouse tissue RNA isolation from snap frozen samples, the AllPrep RNA/DNA kit (Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR. RNA (1-2 μg) was reverse transcribed with RevertAid™ reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Complete removal of genomic DNA was controlled in minus-RT samples in which the reverse transcriptase was replaced by water. For qRT-PCR, the ABI PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix was used, and the analysis was performed with an ABI StepOne Plus cycler (Life Technologies). Primer sequences can be found in Table 1 . Proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed with the Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 5 x 10 3 were seeded into black 96-well plates with a clear bottom (Greiner Bio-One). After 48 h, the BrdU solution (10 μM f.c.) was added and the cells were incubated for 6 h. The chemiluminescence was measured with a luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL; Thermo Scientific). Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells was analyzed according to standard protocols using Propidiumiodide (PI) staining for DNA content. Briefly, 3 x 10 5 cells were seeded 48 h prior to analysis in 10 cm dishes in normal growth medium. Cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), scraped off the plates using a rubber policeman, fixed in ethanol, and RNA was digested with RNase A. Cell pellets were resuspended in PI staining solution (40 μg/mL f.c. PI in PBS). Cell cycle profiles were acquired using a BD FACS Calibur and analyzed using the Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence microscopy analysis of nuclear structures. Immunofluorescence, RNA staining via labeling of incorporated ethynyl uridine and staining of the DNA with 4',6-diamidin-2'-phenylindol-dihydrochlorid (DAPI) were conducted after para-Formaldheyde (PFA) fixation as described previously. 43 The antibodies used detected active RNA polymerase II (H5, GeneTex), lamin A (provided by Harald Herrmann-Lerdon, DKFZ), UBF (provided by Ingrid Grummt, DKFZ), SC35 for the Malat1-deleted locus. PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec 95°C, 30 sec 56°C, 30 sec 72°C, and a final elongation for 10 min at 72°C. Histomorphological analysis. Mice were sacrificed at the age of 6 weeks. Tissues were resected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for subsequent staining. Five micrometer sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to standard procedures. Histopathologic review of the H&E slides for histopathologic abnormalities was performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope and pictures were taken using a ProgRes ® CMOS camera (Jenoptik). All animal experiments were done in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and according to the regulations issued by the Committee for Animal Rights Protection of the States of Hessen (Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt). Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel 2007. Significance was assessed using T-Tests after determination of the variance equality using an F-Test.
