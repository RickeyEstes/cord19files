This study evaluates the overall performance of a gas desiccant cooling system as compared to a conventional air-conditioning for application in a case study wet market. The influence of ventilation requirements on the energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO 2 emission reduction of desiccant cooling system will also be evaluated. Evaluations were based on in-situ measurements, site surveys and energy simulations. In-situ measurements results were retrieved from the remote monitoring system. The retrieved results include the space air conditions and the year round energy use derived from fans (process and regeneration), chilled water circulating pumps, chillers and burners of the gas-fired dehumidifiers. Given key parameters like occupancy, and installed lighting and small power densities are not available; site surveys have been conducted to ascertain these parameters. The in-situ measurements and site surveys results were used for simulation validation to facilitate further simulations. A simulation program, EnergyPlus was adopted to simulate the energy use of the major equipments of the desiccant cooling system for energy analysis. A hypothetical wet market (not the studied wet market) was designed to represent typical modernized wet markets in Hong Kong to facilitate the evaluations. It was formulated after an
