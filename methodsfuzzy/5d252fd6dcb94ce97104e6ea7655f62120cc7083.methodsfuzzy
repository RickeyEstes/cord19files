Histochemistry is a most important area of glycobiology research, enabling insight into the chemical architecture of a cell, and especially its surface, the glycocalyx. For this purpose, the cell or tissue remains intact and can be investigated mostly in sliced form by different forms of microscopy. Nowadays, histological experiments are also possible with viable cells. This means that cell biological studies, during which the function of a cell varies, can now be visualized. Histochemistry has a long history, and the methods applied are manifold. In a short note from 1946 in Nature, McManus from the University Museum in Oxford, UK, described the staining of mucins by Schiff's reagent following the action of 0.5% periodic acid. 381 Originally, Schiff's reagent was defined as "a solution of fuchsine decolorized by treatment with sulfur dioxide that gives a useful test for aldehydes because they restore the dye's color." Examples of the staining comprised mucins of goblet cells of the human intestine and bronchus, and also various other tissues from rat and man. A few years later, in 1950 and 1952, Leblond and coworkers used the technology in combination with light microscopy. 382, 383 After periodate oxidation, tissues of different animals were stained with fuchsine-sulfurous acid, a technique developed by Hotchkiss. 384 At these times, the nature of the molecules in tissues, oxidized by periodic acid, was not yet known. Interestingly, in 1957, in a report by Leblond and coworkers 385 describing the staining of glycogen by the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) technique, sialic acid also came into play as the probable molecule responsible for periodate staining (sialic acid was found in various tissues along with galactose, fucose, and hexosamine). In subsequent years, the PAS technique developed into a powerful technique of sialic acid staining, because of the sensitivity of its glycerol side chain to mild periodate oxidation, thereby generating aldehyde functions. Typical examples are the detection of vicinal hydroxy groups (mostly of sialic acids) in plasma membranes by electron microscopy. 386, 387 In an early review, 388 the periodate acid-Schiff technique, together with other methods for the detection of acidic groups/acidic glycoproteins of plasma membranes, e.g., using cationic compounds such as colloidal iron, thorium hydroxide, Alcian blue, and ruthenium red, used earlier for light or electron microscopy, is summarized. The studies confirmed that all cell surfaces seem to be covered by a carbohydrate-rich coat. In a thorough investigation on complex carbohydrates (glycoproteins) in the Golgi apparatus of rat cells, two electron microscopy visualization methods, based on (1) successive treatment of sections with periodic acid, chromic acid, and silver methenamine, and (2) brief treatment of sections with a mixture of chromic acid and phosphotungstic acid, were compared with the PAS technique using light microscopy, and the staining results obtained were shown to be identical/similar. 389 Soon after the beginning of the use of periodate for histological sialic acid determinations, it was noticed that pretreatment with alkali (0.5% KOH) increased the periodic acid-Schiff (1% PAS) reactivity of, e.g., certain mucins, 390 and the authors confirmed the hypothesis that this KOH-PAS effect was due to the presence of O-acetylated sialic acids. 391, 392 It should be noted that ester groups, which prevent aldehyde formation by periodate, were assumed to be located at C8 of the glycerol side chain of sialic acid. Until the mid-1970s, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids were believed to be cleavable between C7 and C8 (see fig. 1 of ref. 391) . However, as discussed in Section 5, in the same period (1974), this assumption turned out to be incorrect. 276 So, PAS-resistant sialic acids can be substituted at C9 and not necessarily at C8. Neu4,5Ac 2 is fully PAS positive (but sialidase resistant). The specificity of this sialic acid-staining technique can be increased by previous sialidase or acid treatment of tissue slices. The difference of staining intensity with and without alkali treatment enables a rough estimation of the degree of O-acetylation in the glycerol side chain. In the following years, staining of sialic acid by periodic acid and Schiff or thionine reagents, respectively, was carried out in numerous studies. For an early review by Culling and Reid that describes many details of the histochemical methodologies available for the location and identification of members of the sialic acid family in tissue sections, see ref. 393 . It should be mentioned that the Hungarian G. Romhány developed in the 1970s a polarization optical electron microscopic analysis of the spatial arrangement of sialylated cell membrane components by periodate oxidation with the aldehyde bisulfite toluidine blue reaction ("anisotropic ABT reaction"), summarized by Makovitzky and Richter. 394 Also new reagents for staining, making use of periodate oxidation as a first step, were developed, as illustrated by the two following examples. First, a light microscopic histochemical localization of sialic acids (sialoglycoconjugates) in tissue sections of eccrine glands of porcine snout skin could be carried out by employing a method that includes a selective periodate oxidation-phenylhydrazine blockade and a thiocarbohydrazide-silver protein sequence, followed by a physical development procedure. 395, 396 Second, for the in situ imaging by confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometric quantification of sialylated glycoproteins on living human gastric normal and cancer cells, the cell lines were treated by mild periodate oxidation (1 mM, 4°C, up to 20 min), and the aldehyde functions generated on the glycoproteins were ligated with the fluorescence tag, fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide. 397 Note that the chosen periodate oxidation conditions only introduce aldehyde groups into the sialic acid glycerol side chains of the glycoproteins on the living cell surface. In the 1990s, staining of sialic acids in tissues or cells also became possible with lectins and antibodies. The specificities of the methods, developed for sialic acid linkage analysis, were higher than those developed using the periodate reaction. 398 Especially, the sialyl(α2!3)-specific Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) and the sialyl(α2!6)-specific Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) found wide application [and more rarely Limax flavus agglutinin (LFA)] in the lectin histochemical localization of glycoconjugates containing Neu5Ac in (α2!3) and (α2!6) linkage, respectively, to Gal and GalNAc. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) also interacts with Neu5Ac (not Neu5Gc), but according to a discussion with J€ urgen Roth (University of Zurich, Switzerland), the lectin is not suited for sialic acid analysis. For the detection of sialic acid with these lectins, for example, a peroxidaseantibody-peroxidase complex (PAPS), which can be visualized, is in use. In the same period, the labeling of lectins and immunoglobulins with ferritin, and especially colloidal gold particles, used in both light and electron microscopy, got wide attention. J€ urgen Roth ("Immunogold Master," "Mr. Compartment" 399 ) and collaborators developed, most elegantly and frequently applied, the lectin-gold technique for human and animal tissues, including the Golgi complex. [400] [401] [402] Typical examples of staining of normal human colonic mucosa and colon carcinoma with MAA and SNA are shown in Fig. 24 . Before these studies, the same research group had developed cationic (poly-L-lysine-coated) colloidal gold particles, which allow the detection of anionic, sialidase-sensitive, sites on erythrocytes. 403 In more recent years, virolectins have shown to be also powerful reagents for histochemical detection of sialic acids. For example, influenza C viruses bind to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in tissue slices from rat liver or human colon and are immunologically detected by incubation with rabbit antiserum, followed by treatment with fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG antibody for visualization. 404 Staining is also possible by the esterase activity of the bound viruses. In a similar way, such staining has also been done with a soluble form of influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase, wherein the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are replaced by the Fc portion of human IgG. This complex (CHE-Fc) retains both its recognition and enzymatic function. It is detected on the cryosections with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antihuman IgG. 405 Great progress in the identification of 4-mono-, 9-mono, and 7,9-di-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) in tissue slices or cells of man and mouse was recently achieved with hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) envelope proteins of nidoviruses (toro-and coronaviruses) and influenza C virus (HEF). 406 For this purpose, HE and HEF ectodomains were fused with the C-terminal domain of human IgG1 or of mouse or bovine IgG2a. The authors showed that O-acetylated sialoglycans occur in a species-, organ-, tissue-, and celltype-specific way, and that their expression is regulated at the level of the individual cell. They also observed that in several key tissues, especially in the brain, mice and humans share similar 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid expression profiles, which suggests an evolutionary and functional conservation. In a similar way, this method with the recombinant soluble virolectins was applied to various tissues of many kinds of animals, including humans, and demonstrated an astonishing variability of the occurrence of the three O-acetylated sialic acids in the tissues studied. While Neu4,5Ac 2 , for example, was prevalent in horse and guinea pig respiratory tissue, Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu5,7,9Ac 3 were found especially in the same tissue of man and mouse. 407 In an early study using a monoclonal antibody bound to gold particles against the Meningococci group B capsular polysaccharide, [!8)Neu5Ac(α2 !] n , this polymer was detected in a human Wilms tumor (Fig. 25) . [408] [409] [410] Treatment with endo-neuraminidase N as control abolished staining. Furthermore, in an immunocytochemical study on ganglioside expression in human breast cancer cells, specific monoclonal antibodies and antimouse IgM or antimouse IgG labeled with Alexa 488 showed the accumulation of gangliosides on the tumor cell surfaces in confocal microscopy. 411 Finally, at the end of this short overview of the history of histological methods in sialobiology, attention will be paid to some new fluorescence microscopy investigations that allow the manipulation of glycans within their native environment, i.e., to study living cells and the localization, mobility, and lifetime of glycans. Since some sialyltransferases tolerate such large groups as fluorescein at C5 or C9, it was possible to incorporate fluorescent probes via suitably modified CMP-sialic acid donors into cell-surface glycoconjugates 412 (for a general review, see ref. 413) or even enabled the kinetic analyses of the rates of different sialyltransferases within cells. 414 So, it was possible to localize sialyltransferases in the Golgi compartments in rat liver with the CMP-9-fluoresceinyl-Neu5Ac donor substrate. 415 Furthermore, Bertozzi and coworkers introduced the Staudinger ligation for covalent tagging of azido sugars, incorporated biosynthetically into cell-surface glycans. In case of sialic acid, cells are treated with per-Oacetylated N-azidoacetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAz). After entering the cells, the product is O-deacetylated, transformed into the corresponding N-azidoacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Az), subsequently converted into the activated CMP sugar, and finally incorporated into cell-surface glycans on human or other cells. 416 Interestingly, the various biosynthetic enzymes, normally involved in the conversion of ManNAc into bound Neu5Ac (see Section 11.1), tolerate the unnatural substrates. The bound Neu5Az can be visualized using a copper-free click chemistry reaction with, for instance, a difluorinated cyclooctyne (DIFO) reagent, conjugated to an imaging probe, e.g., Alexa Fluor 488. This staining procedure is not toxic and can be carried out in cultured cells and in live mice. Here, a typical example is the study of the sialome during zebrafish development, which showed that the biosynthesis of cell-surface sialosides starts as early as 8.5 h postfertilization. 417 In another example, Neu5Az(α2!3)Lac or Neu5Az(α2!3)Gal was incubated with live trypomastigotes, resulting in Neu5Az(α2!3)Gal-glycoconjugates by means of the parasite trans-sialidase (see Section 11.7). For visualization use was made of, for instance, the phosphine-FLAG conjugate, identified by anti-FLAG antibodies. It was learned from this approach that the transfer of sialic acid is mainly to the mucins of the parasites. 418
