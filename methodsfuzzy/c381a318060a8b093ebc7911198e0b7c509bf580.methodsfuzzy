The methods for the systematic review followed the Guidelines developed by the Cochrane Collaboration [11] . We searched for English language articles published from 2000 to April 2015. The following databases were searched: Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Global Health and LILACS bibliographic databases. The literature after April 2015 was also monitored using a daily email alert tool provided by Google Scholar (searching for "water borne disease" and "water related disease") to identify potential papers adopting newlydeveloped methods not covered by the initial search. We used search terms related to water-associated diseases (e.g. "water transmission" OR "contaminated fresh water" OR "unsafe water supply" etc.) and quantitative methodologies (e.g. "mathematical epidemiology" OR "simulation") and weather and climate. The full list of Table 1 . Organisms causing diseases related to water (excluding vector borne diseases). The symbol Challenges with methods for water-associated disease search terms is in the Supporting Information, S2 Text. Papers were reviewed by two people (GL and GN). As the pool of returned papers was quite large, we decided to not use additional specific search terms for pathogens (e.g. 'cholera', 'rotavirus') or diagnosis/symptoms (e.g. 'diarrhoea', 'gastroenteritis'), as this would require a subjective list of potential pathogens and introduce unnecessary bias in the selection of the papers. We included articles that: i) were published in peer reviewed journals; ii) included an infectious disease in human beings; and iii) developed new methods and/or applied established methods to investigate the effects of weather and/or climate on infectious diseases (including papers for which weather and climate variables were among other equally important factors driving disease transmission). The final set of papers was archived in EndNote (see Supporting Information, S1 Table) . We identified specific questions related to the nature of the methods, their range, applicability and limitations ( Table 2 ) that we wanted the Review to address. We then created a spreadsheet consisting of records (rows) corresponding to each paper in our final database, and columns to address the specific questions. Analysis was done in R open source analytic software [12] . Papers were clustered according to the methodology used. More precisely, for each paper we identified the list of technical keywords associated with the methods, including both general concepts (e.g. "time series analysis") and sub-analysis terms (e.g. "partial autocorrelation function"); the full list of technical keywords is presented in the Supporting Information, S1 Table. Papers that share the same keyword are often connected. Consequently, analytical 2) What methods have been used? Ascertain the key epidemiological methods developed and used so far. Classify the methods in terms of general approaches: such as descriptive phenomenology, process based models (e.g. mechanistic compartmental models or agent based models), statistical analysis of empirical data (e.g. time series analysis) etc. 3) Is the method applied to investigate the effect of climate change or weather or both? Assess if the method is actually or potentially applied to climate change and/or weather 4) Does the type of method depend on the disease/pathogen under investigation? 1. Ascertain if there is a preferential use of the methods towards particular disease/pathogen and identify possible explanations Approximately 50% of papers investigating Vibrio cholerae employed methods based on compartmental models, followed by time-series/regression analysis and spatial/GIS analysis using cholera case observations. Similar patterns were observed for unspecified water-associated pathogens. As expected, for generic diarrheal pathogens (for which there is much more uncertainty about the causes), spatial/GIS and time-series/regression analysis were the most commonly used methods (but see discussion in [1] and [21] ). 5) Some key feature in the methods: e.g. What are the independent variables in the models? Does the model take into account seasonality? More than 70% of studies included observed or modelled temperature and/or rainfall/precipitation data in their analysis. A smaller proportion of studies included (the inclusion is not mutually exclusive) other environmental factors (e.g., relative humidity, vapor air pressure, evaporation) and socio-economic indicators (e.g. access to water, index of poverty, age, education, human mobility) in the analysis (Fig 7) . Around 40% of the methods explicitly included the effects of seasonality (intra-annual climate variability). A small proportion of papers (7%) included the effects of El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO). Almost 40% of the methods took into account spatial variation. Only a small proportion of the methods explicitly modelled the pathogen dynamics in the wider environment or the specific water reservoir; a proportion of these studies (typically, theoretical works for a proof of concept) developed general methods without focusing on specific environmental variables, but the method could be potentially applied to investigate their effects. The lack of inclusion of relevant factors in the methods was the most common limitation acknowledged by the authors. These included: spatial and socio-economic heterogeneity, seasonality, changing immunity, and other environmental drivers. In almost 20% of papers, the authors identified reporting bias as a key limitation. Examples of reporting bias were: sample collections not properly designed (e.g. not stratified by age); voluntary internetbased survey reflecting survey respondents' idiosyncrasies; and health-seeking behaviours and socio-economic factors affecting access to health facilities. The poor quality of the data was another important source of limitation according to the authors, and this was explicitly mentioned in around 30% of reviewed papers. Typical examples of poor data quality were: low spatio-temporal resolution of the exposure data (e.g. environmental exposure covered a wide geographic area or linked to a single weather stations); lack of longitudinal data (only cross-sectional surveys were undertaken); and low accuracy of the data (e.g. reliance on proxy data, missing data due to asymptomatic or unobserved infections). In 10% of cases, the methods were not able to explain the observed patterns in the disease outcome. The authors identified the absence of underlying mechanistic explanation as a problem in about 10% of the studies. In 10% of papers, the authors highlighted that the methods were calibrated only for a specific situation (e.g. a limited region), and the findings were not generalizable. Synthesis: Seven challenges in developing methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases 1) Disentangling multiple transmission pathways and identifying the bio-physical mechanism of how weather affects disease and seasonality. In general, the spread of many pathogens is subjected to concurrent modes of transmissions, as exemplified in Fig 1. For instance, cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoir with long pathogen persistence [22, 23] . Identifying a potential signature for the particular pathways in the patterns of diseases is perhaps the ideal goal. In particular, to separate person-to-person transmission from other modes of disease transmissions a range of methods have been proposed, including nonlinear time series approaches linked with wavelet analysis [24] and mechanistic compartmental approaches [22, 23] . Despite such efforts, isolating the contributions of person-to-person transmission on the burden of these diseases is a compelling problem not only for water-associated diseases but all infectious diseases [25, 26] . Different transmission pathways can be strongly affected by weather and/or climate. For example, temperature may have direct effects on Salmonella bacterial proliferation at various stages in the food chain (including bacterial loads on raw food production, transport and inappropriate storage), and indirect effects on eating behaviours during hot days [27] . Rainfall might increase person-to-environment transmission of cholera, by facilitating the contamination of fresh water from the sewage system. Rainfall might also dilute the concentrations of the pathogens, reducing environment-to-person transmission [28] . Compartmental models have also been used to investigate the effects of pathogen dilution due to the seasonal variation of water volume (e.g. with monsoons) and the potential interactions with other environmental drivers (e.g. temperature [29, 30] and the effects of human mobility) [31] . The key challenge ahead are increasing the awareness of the drivers of disease and a deeper integration with fields such as microbiology (e.g. identifying dose-response curves to use as input for modelling, potential coexistence of human-to-human transmission), social science (e.g. to identify and include in the methods social contacts, patterns of mobility, adaptation, etc.), and ecology (e.g. to understand and incorporate the dynamics of free living organisms in water). 2) Reducing uncertainty in reporting. Measuring the 'true' incidence of disease, and therefore morbidity and mortality rates, is a common problem in epidemiology. This includes: the under-ascertainment arising when not all cases seek healthcare; under-reporting due to failure in the surveillance system; and reporting bias [32, 33] . Community-based studies have been employed to reduce the uncertainty in reporting a range of diseases, including waterassociated diseases [34] . These methods usually involve the acquisition of data, e.g. by questionnaire possibly accompanied by biological sampling (e.g. serological surveys), in a representative population such as a retrospective cohorts or a population cross-sections. These methods can be integrated with statistical and mathematical approaches to estimate incidence. For a review of these methods, see [34] and references therein. A common problem with these methods is that they are sensitive to the particular situation under investigation, such as country, age and social group. In addition, the climate and/or weather can have a direct impact on reporting. For example, impassable roads reducing the ability to seek medical care, and therefore detection, during the rainy season might explain the apparent seasonality of incidence of Lassa fever in humans in Sierra Leone [35] . This last example underscores the importance of integrating a variety of approaches including not only serology, lab-based sampling and statistical/mathematical models, but also participatory modelling and ethnographic research [36] to assess perceptions of risk, approaches to hygiene, health-seeking behaviour and accessibility; and how economic and social factors affect the reliability of data collection by, or reporting to, the surveillance system [35] [36] [37] .
