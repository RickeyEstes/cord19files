Peripheral blood was collected from the participants and genomic DNA was extracted using the standard phenol/ chloroform method. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was genotyped using the assay described in Chan et al. [12] . The genotype was determined by separating the PCR products in 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. To validate the genotyping results, 10% of the samples were re-genotyped by either duplicated genotyping experiments or direct sequencing. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test for VNTR in the peri-centenarian and control groups was performed by GENEPOP software http://wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/gene pop/index.html. Homozygote proportions, genotype distribution and allele frequencies were compared by twotailed chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (SPSS 11.5, SPSS Inc) (df = number of genotypes being analysed minus 1). When P value < 0.05, it was considered to be statistically significant and further subjected to Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
