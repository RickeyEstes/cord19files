2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditions M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv and M. bovis BCG were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with oleic acid/albumin/ dextrose/catalase (OADC), grown to mid-logarithmic phase, and stored at Ã€70 C until needed. Bacterial titers for each batch of frozen stocks were determined in triplicate by colony-forming units (CFU) counting on Middlebrook 7H10 agar. Before infection experiments, aliquots of bacterial stocks were thawed at 37 C, mixed vigorously by vortexing, and diluted in tissue-culture medium to provide inocula to achieve the Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) indicated. MOI was confirmed from these preparations by CFU counting on Middlebrook 7H10 agar for each experiment.
