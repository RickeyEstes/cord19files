Another major area of productive research has been in combining DNA vaccines with physical delivery methods. By physically forcing more plasmid DNA into cells, as well as increasing the number of transfected cells, expression levels should improve. Improvements in immune responses have been reported with physical delivery devices such as the gene gun elevated in cervical samples examined from women who cleared their disease. 168 It will be important to study optimized DNA vaccines delivered by EP in additional settings to extend these findings to additional targets, expanding the applications of the DNA platform. As with the report of the first efficacy data, it is clear from the preceding discussion that improvements in technologies are driving the field (see Table 67 .2). The progress of clinical trials will have to be closely watched, as they will present an exciting picture over the next few years as various DNA approaches come to fruition.
