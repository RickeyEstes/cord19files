(See Supporting Information Text S1 for experimental details) CTV isolates and genomic sequences CTV isolate FS2-2 was collected from a citrus grove in Florida in 2004 and maintained on Madam Vinous sweet orange in an insect-proof greenhouse. Full-length genomic sequences of CTV isolates NUagA, Qaha, SY568, T30, T36, T385, and VT were retrieved from GenBank. In addition, full-length unpublished sequences of CTV isolates T3 (M.E. Hilf, unpublished) and H33 (T.E. Mirkov, personal communication) and a partial sequence (13,585 nt) of the CTV T68-1 isolate (M.E. Hilf, unpublished) were included.
