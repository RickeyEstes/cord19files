NPA specimens were tested for influenza virus A, B and C, RSV A and B and adenoviruses by using a multiplex RT-nested PCR (Coiras et al., 2003) , and also for parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses by using a second multiplex RT-nested PCR (Coiras et al., 2004) . hMPV was investigated in all samples using a RT-nested PCR designed in the matrix gene (Lopez-Huertas et al., 2005) . For sensitive and specific HBoV detection a nested PCR assay was developed. Primers were designed in highly conserved regions of the (NP-1) and VP1/VP2 genes based on a multiple alignment constructed with all genome sequences of bocaviruses available at the GenBank database. A whole of 5 l of total nucleic acid extracted were added to 45 l of reaction mixture containing 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 200 M of each dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amplitaq, Perkin-Elmer Cetus) and 10 pmol of primers HBOV1f (5 -CACAGGAGCMGGAGYCGCAG) and HBOV1r (5 -CCAAGATATYTRTATCCAGG) for HBoV amplification and 10 pmol of primers RTS (5 -GCTTGGGCGTGTCTCAAAATCT) and RTA (5 -GTCGCCACGGTTGATGAGAGCT) for the internal control amplification. Amplifications were carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Research). Temperature and time profiles were 94 • C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 • C for 30 s, 55 • C for 1 min, and 72 • C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 • C for 5 min. After the first amplification round, 1 l of the reaction product was added to 49 l of the nested reaction mixture containing the same reagents used for the first reaction mixture with exception of primers, HBOV2f (5 -GTGGTGTGGGTTCTACTGGC) and HBOV2r (5 -CTACGGTACACATCATCCCAG) for specific HBoV amplification, and NS3 (5 -CGTAATGGCTGGCCTGT) and NA2 (5 -GTAATGCTCTGCCAGTGT) for the internal control amplification. Cycling conditions were the same that those used for the first round, but only 30 cycles were necessary. A total of 10 l of each second round amplification product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose in 0.5× TBE gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/ml), and visualized under UV light. The specific band for HBoV corresponded to 243 bp and the internal control to 350 pb (Fig. 1) . Usual precautions were implemented to avoid false positive results by carryover contamination. Positive results were confirmed by testing a new aliquot of sample. Sensitivity of the HBoV nested-PCR method was estimated by testing serial dilutions of a plasmid DNA containing the first round amplified product (609 bp). This product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO plasmid using the TOPO-TA Cloning Kit with One Shot TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli (Invitrogen). Plasmids were extracted and purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The copy number of the HBoV genome equivalents was estimated spectrophotometrically at OD 260 . To verify specificity, the amplified products with the expected size (243 bp) obtained after the second round of PCR were directly sequenced in both directions. PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocol with the primers HBOV2f and HBOV2r by using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The sensitivity of the nested-PCR method for HBoV DNA detection was estimated in 10 genomic equivalents by testing serial 10-fold dilutions of the specific plasmid (Fig. 1) . Specific HBoV DNA was demonstrated by sequencing all the amplification products with the expected size. Specificity of the nested-PCR assay was also assessed by testing 10 human parvovirus B19 positive serum samples.
