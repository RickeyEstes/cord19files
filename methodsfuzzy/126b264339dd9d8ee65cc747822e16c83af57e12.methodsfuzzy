Cells and viruses. 5 and Vero (ATCC CCL-81) cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). CRL-2843 (porcine macrophages, ATCC) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Primary PAM cells were prepared from 4-8-week-old piglets and cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS 22 . PRRSV strain A2MC2, VR-2385 and Ingelvac PRRS ® MLV were propagated and titrated in MARC-145 cells. Virus yields were titrated by 10-fold serial dilutions and presented as the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) 23 . Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain LaSota carrying the gene of green fluorescence protein (NDV-GFP) was propagated and titrated in Vero cells 24 . Interferon bioassay. Detection of presence of IFNs in culture supernatant from PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells was done as previously described 15 . Briefly, the supernatant was diluted in DMEM and used to treat Vero cells in 96-well plates overnight, followed by inoculation with NDV-GFP. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted 24 h after NDV inoculation to observe GFP-positive cells. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA). PRRSV propagation in MARC-145 cells was detected with IFA using an N-specific monoclonal antibody EF11 25 . The infected cells in 96-well plate were fixed and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH7.2 before addition of the EF11 antibody. DyLight ™ 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., Limerick, PA) was used to detect the EF11 binding to the N protein in the infected cells. Observation of N-positive cells was conducted under fluorescence microscopy. Western blotting. Total proteins in cell lysate samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane 26 . Blotting of the membrane with antibodies against RIG-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX) and tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, MO) was conducted. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.) and chemiluminescence substrate were used to reveal specific reactions by the primary antibodies. Chemi-Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to capture the luminescence signal. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR were conducted to amplify target PRRSV sequences or to determine PRRSV RNA level 22, 27 . Detection of ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32) expression in the same sample was conducted to normalize the total input RNA. Primers of real-time PCR in this study were previously described 28 and analysis of relative transcript levels was performed by normalization of RPL32 in comparison with controls. For RT-PCR to determine possible deletions in the nsp2 region of the A2MC2 genome during high passages, primers 85nspF3 (5′ CTCGACGAACTCAAAGACC3′ ) and 32nsp2R2 (5′ CTGCGGACGGAGCTGATGTGC3′ ) were used to amplify the target fragment with Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Plaque assay. A plaque assay in MARC-145 cells was done to compare the growth property of A2MC2 high passage with the wild type virus 15 . Briefly, PRRSV A2MC2 was diluted to 10 and 100 TCID 50 per ml and added to the monolayer cells in 6-well plates at 1 ml per well. After 2 h incubation at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and 3 ml 0.5% agarose overlay containing the complete growth medium was added. The cells were stained at 72 h after incubation by addition of 2 ml neutral red mixture with agarose and observed for plaques after further overnight incubation. Virus neutralization assay. Virus neutralization assay was performed on MARC-145 cells to determine PRRSV-neutralizing antibodies in pig serum samples 16 . VR-2332, the prototype of type 2 PRRSV with nucleic acid identity of 99.8% to A2MC2 15 , was used as target virus in the assay at 100 TCID 50 for each reaction. The starting dilution of serum samples was 1:8, followed by 2-fold serial dilutions. IFA with N-specific monoclonal antibody EF11 was conducted 24 h after inoculation of the cells. Compared to serum samples from mock-infected pigs, the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that reduced 50% PRRSV replication was counted as the VN titer. Sequencing. RNA isolation from A2MC2 virions was done for reverse transcription, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing by chain-termination method using ABI Genetic Analyzer 3130 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) 15 . Sequence assembly and analysis was done with LaserGene Core Suite (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The cDNA sequence of the full-length A2MC2-P90 genome has been deposited in to GenBank (accession number: KU318406).
