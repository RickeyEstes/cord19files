Clinical tissues. A total of 12 (male/female, 6/6) BCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected at the Department of Dermatology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China) between May 2008 and June 2016. The pathological diagnosis of the BCC patients (mean age, 48.6 years; range, 42.2-54.5) was performed according to the World Health Organization criteria (27) . Patients with a history of cancer history were excluded from the present study. The BCC tissues were stored at -80˚C and then embedded in paraffin. None of the patients received chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other treatments prior to tumor resection. All patients were required to provide written informed consent. This study also approved by Ethics committee of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Cell culture. BCC and normal cells were obtained from the 12 BCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues, respectively, as described previously (28) . Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine at 37˚C in an atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The BCC and normal tissue sections (4 µm) obtained from patients were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Following blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at room temperature, the samples were analyzed for SOX2 expression using immunostaining, as previously described (29) . Briefly, tumor sections were incubated with specific primary antibodies for anti-SOX2 (1:1,000; ab92494; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 12 h at 4˚C. Tumor tissues were then incubated with a monoclonal horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (PV-6001; OriGene Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China). A Ventana Benchmark automated staining system was used for the examination of protein expression in the tumor tissues (Tucson, AZ, USA). The staining results were semi-quantitatively evaluated based on the percentage of positive staining cells (magnification, x400). RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Total cellular RNA was extracted from the BCC and normal cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then 1 µg total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (product code, 4368814; Applied Biosystems). Next, for mRNA expression determination, 1 µg cDNA was subjected to qPCR using an iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). All the primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and were as follows: SOX-2 forward, 5'-CAG GAG TTG TCA AGG CAG AGA-3', and reverse, 5'-CAG GAG TTG TCA AGG CAG AGA-3'; β-actin forward, 5'-CGG AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TC-3' , and reverse, 5'-AGC CTT CTC CAT GGT CGT GA-3'. The PCR thermocycling conditions included 45 amplification cycles, of denaturation at 95˚C for 15 sec, primer annealing at 66˚C for 20 sec and primer extension at 72˚C for 15 sec. Relative levels of mRNA expression were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCq method (30) . The results were expressed as a fold change relative to the normal controls by comparing the levels of target mRNA expression to that of the β-actin control group. Western blotting. BCC cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and centrifuged at 8,000 x g at 4˚C for 10 min. SDS assays were performed as described previously (31) . Subsequent to blocking in 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at 37˚C, the following primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 were added to membranes: PI3K (ab86714), AKT (ab8805), SOX2 (ab92494), SRPK1 (ab90527), E-cadherin (ab40772), Vimentin (ab92547), Fibronectin (ab2413) and β-actin (ab5694; all purchased from Abcam). Membranes were then incubated with monoclonal HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (PV-6001; OriGene Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h at 4˚C. A Ventana Benchmark automated staining system (Tucson, AZ, USA) was used for analyzing the protein expression. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. BCC cells (4x10 5 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well and incubated for 24 h at 37˚C. Next, the medium was removed and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was added for 24 h at 37˚C. The siRNA sequences corresponding to each gene were designed and synthesized by GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and were as follows: siRNA-SOX2, 5'-CUG CAG UAC AAC UCC AUG ATT-3'; siRNA-SRPK1, 5'-CCA UTG GUU CGG UGG UCA ATT-3'; siRNA-vector (control), 5'-CUC GUC UCA UUG ATG ACA GTT-3'. A total of 100 pmol siRNA was transfected into cultured BCC cells, respectively, using 5 µl Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Following incubation for 48 h at 37˚C, cells were used for further analysis. Lentivirus production and cell transduction. The packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G were purchased from Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). pWPXL-SOX2 (pSOX2), pWPXL-SRPK1 (pSRPK1) or pWPXL-vector (pvector) vector was transfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G into BCC cells or siRNA-SOX2-transfected BCC cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Following incubation for 48 h at 37˚C, the treated cells were used to investigate the effect of gene depletion using proliferation, migration, invasion and western blot assays. Cell proliferation assays. BCC cells transfected with pSOX2, pvector, siRNA-vector or siRNA-SOX2 vector were seeded into 6-well plates (2x10 3 cells/well) and cultured at 37˚C for 14 days. Following incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Cell colonies were counted using Image-Pro Plus version 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA). Cell migration and invasion analysis. BCC cells were transfected with pSOX2, pSRPK1, siRNA-SOX2 or siRNA-SRPK1, and BCC or transfected BCC cells were treated with MK2206 (2 mg, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 12 h at 37˚C. For the migration and invasion assay, BCC cells with 150 µl serum-free DMEM were placed into the upper chamber of 6-well plates at a density of 1x10 4 cells/well, and DMEM in the lower chamber supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Transwell inserts (pore size, 8 µm; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) that were uncoated or coated with Matrigel were used to evaluate the cell migration and invasion, respectively. After 24 h, BCC cells in the lower chamber were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37˚C and stained with 0.1% crystal violet dye (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 20 min at 37˚C. Subsequently, the cells were counted in 3 randomly selected fields of view using a light microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus Corporation). Immunofluorescence assay. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (32) . Brief ly, the siRNA-SOX2-transfected BCC cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h at 37˚C. The BCC cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4˚C for 10 min. The cells were again rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4˚C for 10 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37˚C with the indicated antibodies as follows: E-cadherin (1:1,000; ab40772), Vimentin (1:1,000; ab92547), Fibronectin (1:1,000; ab2413; all purchased from Abcam). Cells were then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 2 h at 37˚C. Finally, the cells were examined using a microscope (Leica DMI4000 B; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of at least three independent replicates. All data were analyzed by SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and Graphpad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison post hoc tests. P<0.05 and P<0.01 values were considered to indicate differences that were statistically significant.
