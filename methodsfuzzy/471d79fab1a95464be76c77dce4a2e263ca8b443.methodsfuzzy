Ethics statement. International standards for animal welfare were used for all animal samples collected, following the regulations for animal sampling of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine (IMV), Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) of the Republic of Cuba. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of the MINAGRI of the Republic of Cuba and all efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals. Birds were euthanized using cervical dislocation to collect the samples. The samples were sent directly from the IMV to the Animal Virology Laboratory at CENSA. The IMV is the official regulatory body of the Republic of Cuba; therefore, additional permits were not required. Collection, selection and processing of samples. Forty-one bursa of Fabricius samples previously confirmed IBDV positive, which had been selected for molecular studies [16] were used in the current study. Additionally, the atIBDV strain used as vaccine was also included in the current work: the commercial vaccine strain "Gumboro" (Labiofam, S.A., Cuba) (http:// www.labiofam.cu/productos/vacuna-gumboro.html) which is currently applied in the vaccination program conducted by Cuban veterinary services (Reviewed in [27] ). The 41 bursal samples and the vaccine strain were printed on FTA cards, suited for the preservation of genetic material and adequate transportation [28] . The FTA cards were sent to Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal, Barcelona, Spain (CReSA) where the laboratory procedures were conducted.
