The study was conducted in a cohort of 711 individuals, including 351 TB patients and 360 healthy controls, living in the Cape Town area. Our study population comes from two suburbs of Cape Town that have been extensively studied because of their uniform ethnicity (South African Coloured) and socioeconomic status as well as a high incidence of TB and a low prevalence of HIV [33] . The annual risk of infection (ARI) in these suburbs was estimated at 2.5% in 1987 and at 2.8 -3.5% in 1999, and it is therefore highly likely that, in such an environment, the vast majority of controls have been exposed to M. tuberculosis [34, 35] . TB patients were bacteriologicallyconfirmed (smear-positive and/or culture-positive) to present pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Their mean age (Ϯstandard deviation) was 36.7 (Ϯ10.9), and 51.8% were male. Controls were unrelated healthy individuals, from the same community, with the same socioeconomic status, access to health facilities, and chance of diagnosis, with neither signs nor previous history of TB (mean age 34.6 [Ϯ12.5], 22% male). All subjects were HIV-negative and older than 18 years. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, South Africa.
