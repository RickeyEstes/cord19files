Endothelial Biomarkers. Biomarkers can be used, and ideally should be used, for quantitative evaluation of the body's response to external effects [171] . Quantitative characteristics include the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, likelihood ratio, and so forth. An ideal biomarker is characterized by a high sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value; it is reproduced in humans of different sexes and ethnic groups, and the procedure for its determination is cost-effective. However, rarely does such a marker stand alone as a single parameter; rather, it is a derivative of several original indicators [212, 213] . At the same time, a complex of physiological and biochemical methods combined with an appropriate analytical platform should be relatively simple (low-invasive and noninvasive methods), universal (modular), and flexible (algorithmic). Ambiguous expression pattern and complexity of determining many biomarkers decrease their predictive value, leading to an overdue diagnosis and bad prognosis. Parallel measurement of multiple "early" biomarkers would certainly increase the diagnostic accuracy. Together with identification studies, validation studies of multimarker assays are urgently needed. A biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosing many chronic diseases, though morphological methods are not a common tool in clinical diagnostics. Due to the invasiveness, these techniques are not suitable for continuous monitoring. Moreover, many diseases may not have a morphological analog of the "gold standard," which necessitates the permanent expansion of functional and point-of-care diagnostics in clinical practice [214, 215] . The search for safe, reliable, and inexpensive methods has resulted, for example, in the development of a large number of biomarkers for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis representing both simple, directly measurable parameters and their derivatives (indices or ratios), which increase the sensitivity and/or specificity of assessment (diagnosis): the ratio of the level of AST to the level of ALT-the so-called De Ritis ratio; the ratio of AST to the number of platelets; PGA index-the ratio of prothrombin time and the level of GGT and apolipoprotein A1 (the PGA index was later modified due to α-2-macroglobulin and became known as the PGAA index); and the FibroTest, known as FibroSure in the US, including α-2macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, GGT, haptoglobin, and total bilirubin [216] . Recently, we reported on new screening indicators (biomarkers) for health assessment of the personnel at a chemical weapon destruction facility (CWDF). Blood plasma of healthy donors and of CWDF personnel occupied in different facility workshops or zones was analysed for 27 cytokines. A significant elevation of eotaxin concentration was revealed in blood plasma of the "dirty zone" personnel. For screening assessment of health state of the personnel, a new complex biomarker was suggested: relation of eotaxin × IFN-γ/TNF-α, capable of differentiating the "dirty zone" personnel from others with a sensitivity of 67.9% and a specificity of 87.5% [213] . The differences between the control group and personnel occupied in "clear" and "conditionally dirty" zones in the CWDF are much greater, as compared with the well-known and popular index IFN-γ/TNF-α characterizing a balance of T-helpers (Th1, Th2) [217] . Importantly, for our subject, IFN-γ can directly influence the level of eotaxin-1 that is produced by ECs, whereas TNF-α can influence the level of eotaxin-1 that is produced by monocytes [218, 219] . Significant increase of the index is a sign of reciprocal and even ontological relations of IFN-γ and eotaxin, which provide a "synergistic effect" for diagnostics. A combination of markers defines a combinatorial biomarker, whose identification usually involves multivariable assays [220] . A combinatorial biomarker provides a specific pattern that bears much more information than just individual markers. The detection of these patterns requires the complex bioinformatics analysis that is necessary for all multidimensional data. However, the expression of these biomarkers, as well as their prognostic and predictive value in a combination, needs to be well-defined. However, even a search process presents great difficulty when it deals with a high-dimensional dataset and a huge number of parameters [221] . An example of this approach is the research in neurology related to the biochemical diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. To diagnose a particular subtype of stroke, assess its severity, and predict possible development and the probability of a lethal or successful outcome by biochemical criteria, various authors have attempted to simultaneously measure up to 50 indicators and search for correlations between them. Ultimately, a set comprising four or five of the most reliable indices (markers) was found, which taken together provided a sensitivity and specificity of over 90% [222] [223] [224] . The strategy of these studies was to combine sensitive but not tissue-specific markers with at least one marker specific to the CNS. The use of nonspecific markers is required in order to increase the sensitivity of the complex test. Biochemical tests have an undeniable and fundamental advantage over other complex instrumental methods of diagnostics; they can be performed as point-of-care testing [224] . One of the fields of the search for new biomarkers is metabolomics. The metabolome is the end product of the genome; in fact, it is the totality of all the metabolites, predominantly of low molecular weight. Metabolites are the final or intermediate products of metabolism of living systems (biological matrices) characterizing their functioning mode. In an epistemological classification, the transcriptome (the totality of all mRNAs) and the proteome (the totality of all proteins) should be placed between the genome and the metabolome. The study of the metabolome, however, is sufficiently rewarding, firstly, because the major metabolic pathways are fairly well studied and the existence of the majority of metabolites is well known and, secondly, because the total number of metabolites is relatively small (3 × 10 3 ) as compared to the total number of modified proteins (over 10 7 ) [225] . It should be noted that metabolomics deals not only with biomarkers (e.g., metabolites of endogenous origin). In toxicological and pharmacological studies, metabolites are divided into endogenous and exogenous [226] . Metabolites of foreign substances (drugs, poisons, etc.) are called xenometabolites, or xenobiotics [227] . For this field of study, there is another term-metabonomics [228] . Alternatively, biomarkers can be divided into three categories: biomarkers of exposure (concentrations of chemicals, their adducts and derivatives in the body fluids or tissues as a result of external or internal exposure); biomarkers of effects (early and delayed biochemical and clinical effects); and biomarkers of susceptibility (individuals with increased sensitivity towards target molecules) [229, 230] . The main methods of metabolomics are nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) on different nuclei ( 1 H, 13 C, 31 P, etc.) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). NMR spectroscopy is used to detect low molecular weight metabolites in blood, urine, serum, and tissues [231] . The advantages of NMR are the simplicity of sample preparation and spectrum interpretation, as well as high performance. The main drawback of NMR is low sensitivity, which is only sufficient to determine those metabolites whose concentrations are relatively high. High-performance liquid chromatography with mass-selective detection (HPLC-MS) is much more sensitive to low molecular weight (3000 Da) metabolites and even peptides. Its precision makes it possible to accurately identify many peptides and nucleosides even in complex matrices [225] . However, HPLC-MS has many limitations in detecting some low molecular weight compounds, for example, fatty acids which are essential components of metabolism. The primary data are processed using hierarchical multivariate curve resolution (multivariate profiling), which includes principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS), and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) [232, 233] . These methods are a part of chemometrics, an independent scientific direction that originated in the 1970s at the intersection of mathematics (informatics) and analytical chemistry. It is important to emphasize that the methods of metabolomics are not intended to replace the methods of classical biochemistry (spectrophotometry, enzyme immunoassay, etc.). Metabolic profiling provides a unique opportunity to perform diagnosing and monitoring at a qualitatively new level only in conjunction with the methods of biochemical analysis [212] . In our recent studies, the influence of chronic exposure to low doses of C 6 -C 10 aliphatic hydrocarbons on metabolic profiles of rats was investigated using GC-MS and highresolution LC-MS, then a chemometrical algorithm, was applied and combinatorial biomarkers were derived. The ratio of concentrations of pyrophosphate (РР i ) and oxalate in the blood plasma was found to be the most sensitive biomarker, called the "pyrophosphate index," whose changes were statistically significant in all groups, even in that exposed to the lowest dose of 5.2 mg/m 3 [234] . Having analysed a broad range of metabolites, we came to the conclusion that increased level of РР i in blood plasma is evidently caused by a decreased level and/or activity of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which is a marker of the BBB endothelial cells [7] . This indicates a risk of hypophosphatasia and neurological disorders, including epilepsy and disruption of myelin synthesis [235] . It can also be coupled with an increase of phosphorylated tau protein [236] and upregulation of FAT/CD36, a phosphorylated fatty acid translocase [237] . In addition, another important index was revealed; an elevation of hypotaurin/taurin indicates abnormality in the mechanisms of utilization of Cys and may lead to deficit of glutathione, since Cys is a source of both hypotaurine and glutathione. Moreover, having analysed a broad range of related metabolites, we suggested a "redox hypothesis" of pathogenesis of toxic polyneuropathy, as an alternative to the long-established "energy hypothesis" [238] . The redox hypothesis covers not only the energy aspects, but also implies a violated interface between energetic, signaling, and metabolic processes. In this sense, it conforms to the principles of "orthogonal regulation" of the signaling and metabolic processes in living cells, including endothelial ones [239] . It seems that the endothelium due to its difuse and strategic position provides an orthogonal control of other states, namely morphofunctional states of organs and/or other tissues (e.g., neural).
