Cloning of the HMPV F, G and M genes from nasopharyngeal washings Nasopharyngeal washing were collected from children admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital for respiratory infection as described previously [19] . The F, G and M genes were amplified from the HMPV A2 positive Nasopharyngeal washings (SIN06-NTU271) using the primers F271pCAGGf F271pCAGGmycr, G271pCAGGf G271pCAGGflagr, M84pCAGGf and M84pCAGGr (Additional file 2: Table S1 ). The PCR products were then inserted into the vector pCAGGS [17] .
