2.1 Homology modelling. 43 M pro complexes with ligands were downloaded from protein data bank 6 (PDB IDs: 1WOF, 2A5I, 2A5K, 2ALV, 2AMD, 2GTB, 2GX4, 2GZ7,   2GZ8, 2OP9, 2QIQ, 2V6N, 2ZU4, 2ZU5, 3SN8, 3SND, 3SZN, 3TIT, 3TIU, 3TNS,   3TNT, 3V3M, 4F49, 4MDS, 4TWW, 4TWY, 4WY3, 4YLU, 4YOG, 4YOI, 4YOJ,   4ZRO, 5C5N, 5C5O, 5EU8, 5N5O, 5N19, 5NH0, 5WKJ, 5WKK, 5WKL, 5WKM, author/funder.

The hydrogens were added to 2019-nCov M pro model by pdb2pqr (--ff=amber --ffout=amber --chain --with-ph=7). 13 Then the model was converted to pdbqt format by prepare_receptor4.py script in MGLToos version 1.5.6. 10 The ligand in 2GTB was used to define the grid and the buffer space was set to 6.0 Å (autobox_add). The random seed was explicitly set to 0 (seed). The exhaustiveness of the global search was set to 32 (exhaustiveness) and at most 1 binding mode was generated for each drug (num_modes). MolShaCS, which utilized Gaussianbased description of molecular shape and charge distribution, was used to calculate the 3D similarities between approved drugs and available M pro inhibitors. 14 2.4 Molecular dynamics simulation. Each simulation system was immersed in a cubic box of TIP3P water that was extended by 9 Å from the solute, with a rational number of counter ions of Na + or Clto neutralize the system. General Amber force field (GAFF) 15 and Amber ff03 force field 16 were used to parameterize the ligand and protein, respectively. 10,000 steps of minimization with constraints (10 kcal/mol/Å 2 ) on heavy atoms of complex, including 5,000 steps of steepest descent minimization and 5,000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, was used to optimize each system. Then each system was heated to 300 K within 0.2 ns followed by 0.1 ns equilibration in NPT ensemble. Finally, 5 ns MD simulation on each system at 300 K was performed. The minimization, heating and equilibrium are performed with sander program in Amber16. The 5 ns production run was performed with pmemd.cuda.
