We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for experimental and clinical studies on the potential associations of microbiota and epigenetic aberrations with the risk of B cell lymphoma in SS patients using a combination of words (Sj√∂gren's syndrome, B cell lymphoma, epigenetics, microbiome, microbiota, virome, dysbiosis, and infections) to select the most pertinent articles. Priority was given to systematic reviews or meta-analyses and recently published original reports. Articles written in languages other than English were excluded.
