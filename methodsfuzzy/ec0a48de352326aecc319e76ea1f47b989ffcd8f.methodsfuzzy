Animals . Lewis, BN, and congenic Lewis .BN rats were obtained from the Central Institute for Experimental Animal Breeding, Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany . Tissue Cultures. Mixed glial cultures containing astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were prepared from brainstem and cerebella of 1-d-old rat pups (specific pathogen-free) as recently described (8) . Cultures were incubated at 37Â°C with 10% C0 2 at maximum humidity, then fed with fresh medium 4 d after plating . Infection of cultures with wild-typeJHM coronavirus began at 5 d after plating. DME with 15% FCS was used as medium . Pure rat astrocyte cultures were prepared from 1 -d-old rat pups as previously described (12) . Pure oligodendrocyte cultures were prepared from whole brains of 4 adult Lewis and BN rats (5-6 weeks old) following the procedure of Kim et al ., 1983 (13) . Virus . Wild type murine coronavirus JHM stock virus was isolated and cloned as previously described (3). Preparation of Conditioned Supernatants. Mixed glial cultures grown for 5 d were infected with wild-type JHM virus at 10 5 PFU/ml, then fed fresh medium . Cultures were incubated thereafter for 5 d when cytopathic effects (CPE) covered 50% of the cell culture area . At this time the virus-containing supernatants were titered and aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen . As a control, supernatants conditioned over the same 5-d period by uninfected glial cultures were similarly handled. Muramyl Dipeptide Treatment. 7-d mixed glial cultures were treated daily with 0 .1 jug/ml muramyl dipeptide (Sigma Chemical Co ., St . Louis, MO) as recently reported (8), then they were stained for Ia antigens at day 5 after treatment . Fluorescence-activated Flow Cytometry . At 5 d after infection, the glial cultures were prepared for flow cytometry (EPICS V ; Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), as previously described (12) . la and class I molecules were stained using the mAbs Ox6 (14) and Ox 18 (15) , respectively . Pure astrocyte cultures were also stained for Ran-2 antigen (16) and oligodendrocytes for galactocerebroside (17) .
