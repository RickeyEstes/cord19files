After a 2-h incubation period, residual virus was removed and the infected cells were further incubated with medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds (in duplicate). After incubation for 7 days at 37 C, virusinduced cytopathogenicity was monitored microscopically after ethanol fixation and staining with Giemsa. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%. EC 50 's were calculated from graphic plots of the percentage of cytopathogenicity as a function of concentration of the compounds. The laboratory wild-type VZV strain Oka and the thymidine kinase-deficient VZV strain 07-1 were used for VZV infections. Confluent HEL cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated with VZV at an input of 20 PFU per well. After a 2-h incubation period, residual virus was removed and varying concentrations of the test compounds were added (in duplicate). Antiviral activity was expressed as EC 50 , or compound concentration required to reduce viral plaque formation by 50% after 5 days as compared with untreated controls. The cytostatic activity measurements were based on the inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 Â 10 3 cells/ well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.
