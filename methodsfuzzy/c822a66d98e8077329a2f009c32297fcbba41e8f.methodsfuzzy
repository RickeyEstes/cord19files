Soluble S protein expression and binding assay. For the construction of a series of truncated S1 proteins, the coding sequences for N-terminal 14-640, 14-502, and 14-440 residues of S protein were amplified from the full length S gene with primers: forward 5 0 -ACTGGATCCAGTGACC TTGACCGGT-3 0 ; reverse for S640 5 0 -CATTCTAGAACTCAGCTCC TATAAGACAGC-3 0 ; reverse for S500 5 0 -CATTCTAGAATTCAAAA GAAAGTACTAC-3 0 ; and reverse for S440 5 0 -CATTCTAGAAATAT TTATAATTATAATTAC-3 0 . The PCR products were digested with BamH I and XbaI and then ligated to a modified pFastBacI vector (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) which contained the signal sequence of Tpa and a 9· His-tag. These proteins were expressed using a Baculovirus System (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). For the binding assay, S1 protein conditioned mediums were mixed with the cells and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with anti-6· His mAb (R&D systems, Minneapolis) or sera from SARS patients. Normal mouse or human sera were used as control. The cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antiserum. Cells were analyzed with a Moflo cytometer (Dako Cytomation, Denmark). For neutralization tests, S500 was mixed with 1:50 diluted SARS patient's sera before used for binding assay. cDNA library construction. The mRNA was isolated from Vero E6 cells using an mRNA isolating kit (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Double strand cDNAs were synthesized by using the SuperScript plasmid system (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). BstxI adaptor (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) was ligated to the cDNA by T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) and then size-fractionated through a 0.8% agarose gel. cDNA ranging from 0.75 to 5 kb was cloned into BstxI site of pMX vector which was provided by T. Kitamura (Tokyo University). The ligated DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-blue by electroporation. Expression cloning. Briefly, 10 lg retroviral cDNA plasmid was transfected into 293GP cells (2 Â 10 6 cells in a 10-cm culture dish) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Two days post-transfection, the culture supernatant was added with 8 mg/ml polybrene to ten 10-cm dishes, each containing 5 Â 10 5 HeLa cells. Two days later FACS sorting screened the library-transduced cells. For FACS sorting, the library-transduced cells were prepared as binding assay and then subjected to FACS sorting. In the first two rounds of sorting, the 0.2-0.5% cells with the highest binding capacity were collected. After the third round, a cell population with high binding capacity emerged and were collected. HIV/SARS pseudovirus infection assays. HIV/SARS pseudovirus was produced as described previously [1, 13] . Briefly, the pHIV-luc (12 lg) and S expressing constructs (6 lg) were co-transfected into 2 Â 10 6 293T cells. Supernatants were harvested 48 h later and used to infect cells in a 24-well plate (2 Â 10 4 cells/well). The cells were lysed at 48 h post infection. Twenty microliters of lysate was tested for luciferase activity by the addition of 100 ll of luciferase substrate and measured for 10 s in a Wallac Multilabel 1450 Counter (Perkin-Elmer, Singapore). Cell fusion assay. HeLa cells were transduced with S genes by retrovirus vector pBabe-puro and selected in culture medium containing 5 lg/ml puromycin for one week. The puromycin resistant cells were checked for S protein expression and named as S-HeLa. F5 cells or HeLa cells were mixed with S-HeLa at the ratio of 1:1 and co-cultured for 8 h, and the syncytium was examined under microscope. Genomic PCR. Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The retrovirus-transduced cDNAs were recovered from F5 genomic DNA by PCR using primers: forward 5 0 -CTGCCGGATCCCAGTGTGCTGGAAA-3 0 ; and reverse 5 0 -ATC GTCGACCACTGTGCTGGAAA-3 0 . The resulting PCR fragment was purified and cloned into the T vector (Promega, Wisconsin) and sequenced. LTR specific and ACE2 specific primers we used are: 5 0 -CC GACTTGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGG-3 0 and 5 0 -TTTGATAG AACAGGTCTTCGGCTTCGTGGT-3 0 . TAIL-PCR. TAIL-PCR was performed as described [14] with the exception that the annealing temperature in the tertiary PCR was 42°C. Long specific primer sets complementary to the LTR sequence were 5 0 -GTTCGCTTCTCGCTTCTGTTCGC-3 0 ; 5 0 -CTCAATAAAA GAGCCCACAACCCCT-3 0 and 5 0 -ACTTGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCC TTG-3 0 . Short arbitrary degenerate (AD) primer was 5 0 -CGTCGAGT GAGATGAA-3 0 . RT-PCR. The total RNA was isolated with a Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). The expression of ACE2 was analyzed with primers: forward 5 0 -GCACTCACGATTGTTGGGACT-3 0 reverse 5 0 -ATTAGCCACTCGCACATCCTC-3 0 . The expression of mouse ACE2 was analyzed with primers: forward 5 0 -GCATTG ACAATTGTTGGAACA-3 0 reverse 5 0 -ATCACTCACTCGTACAT CTTC-3 0 . Inhibition of HIV/SARS pseudovirus entry by anti-ACE2 antibody. F5 cells were pre-incubated with a medium containing 10 lg/ml goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis); or 10 lg/ml normal goat sera for 15 min at 4°C. Cells were challenged with HIV-luc/SARS pseudovirus in the presence of antisera. 48 h later the luciferase activity was tested.
