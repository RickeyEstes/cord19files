Genetic variation is a prime prerequisite for genetic change by selection. As a general rule, genetic variation exists in the ability of livestock to tolerate infectious diseases. And it was this variation that allowed populations of domestic animals and birds to survive under continuous exposure to rapidly evolving disease agents. Before domestication, disease resistance of today's livestock species was influenced by natural selection and the current status of variable resistance to multiple disease agents can be considered to be the result of a response to the selection pressure of multiple pathogens. As a consequence of domestication, a significant new element that entered this evolutionary system was artificial selection for characters that benefit humans as users of livestock. Simultaneously, housing conditions evolved towards increased concentration of animals and birds and thus provided opportunities for spread of pathogens. Improved disease prevention and control measures now provide some compensation for the larger population sizes used in current production systems. Selection for disease resistance plays a relatively minor but increasingly important role in livestock improvement. The choice of selection criteria and the emphasis they receive in the context of total selection pressure available to a practical breeder are decided by market demands and economic considerations. Disease resistance traits receive attention from the breeders mainly when a specific disease is a major cause of economic loss. Although in most instances existing genetic variation provides an adequate basis for resistance selection, selection may not always be practised. Such selection is expensive because the expression of resistance traits requires exposure of selection candidates or their relatives to the disease agent. This is why industries prefer to look for indirect selection techniques that do not require pathogen challenge. Recent developments in gene mapping provide good prospects for progress in this direction. Indirect selection for resistance to the herpesvirus of Marek's disease in chickens, by increasing the frequency of the 'resistant' major histocompatibility haplotypes, is one example of such a technique. It has been practised by most of the world's poultry breeding companies over the past two decades (Gavora, 1990 ). Conventional procedures for direct and indirect selection for disease resistance will in the foreseeable future be the main route for genetic improvement of disease resistance. One disadvantage of their application is the general absence, with rare exceptions mentioned above, of genetic variation in resistance to infection. Thus genetic improvements in disease resistance by conventional means lead mostly to better resistance of livestock to disease developmenta situation where the organism becomes infected but tolerates the pathogen and reduces its ill effects. Hence development of new genetic mechanisms that prevent entry of a pathogen into the host, or otherwise substantially improve the position of the host in the pathogen-host interaction is justified. While conventional selection leads to quantitative improvement of resistance, the new mechanisms would represent a qualitative change that, at least in some instances, will justify the large effort and cost. The expenses will be further justified if the new, engineered mechanism proves to be stable and remains effective despite evolution of the pathogen and functions without harmful effects on the animal's production capacity. Improvement in the welfare of the modified livestock will be an automatic, additional benefit. In crops Despite large differences between animals and plants, sufficient similarities exist in their resistance mechanisms to justify examination of the situation in plants with regards to genetic engineering of viral resistance. For example, normal virus replication requires a subtle balance of virus and host coded proteins, present in critical relative concentrations at specific times and locations. Therefore, Wilson (1993) suggests that any unregulated superimposition of protein or nucleic acid species interacting with the virus can result in plants in an apparently virusresistant phenotype. The results from experimentation with animal cells into which a viral gene was inserted indicate that a similar situation may also exist in animals (Gavora et al, 1994) . The idea that viral components contained in plants might interfere with virus infection was first proposed well before gene transfer techniques became available (Hamilton, 1980) and the concept of pathogen-derived resistance was first put forward in a formal statement by Sanford and Johnston (1985) . There are several approaches to the introduction of disease resistance by gene transfer in plants (Fitchen and Beachy, 1993) . They include transfers of segments of viral genome encoding capsid or coat proteins, viral sequences encoding proteins that may be subunits of viral replicase, sequences incapable of encoding proteins, entire genomes of defective, interfering viruses, and complete genomes of mild virus strains. The transgenes may act on initiation of infection, replication of virus, spread of infection throughout the plant, and symptom development. The level of protection derived from the transgene ranges from low to high and its breadth of host range from broad to narrow. The available data are not sufficient to firmly establish the molecular mechanisms of the protection. In general, although a viral sequence may confer resistance in one virus-host system, an analogous sequence from a different virus in another virus-host system may not be effective.
