Childhood virus identification data was obtained from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory. The children were all under 15 years of age. Each virus identified represents one patient during one hospital attendance. We screened for duplicate samples and these were removed prior to analysis. Adult hospital admissions with COPD (ICD code J44.0 or 496.0) for the same time period were identified from the Mater Hospital, an urban general hospital in Belfast. Patients were admitted to hospital following a decision to admit by a senior Doctor in the emergency department. Those patients who were coded on discharge as having other co morbid conditions contributing to their admission (e.g. left ventricular failure) were excluded from the analysis. This information was collected for each week from January 1, 1996 to September 30, 1999.
