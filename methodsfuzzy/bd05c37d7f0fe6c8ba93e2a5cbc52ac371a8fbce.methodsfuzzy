Viral genomic sequence isolation and identification. Viral genomic sequences were identified as part of a previous study (52) . Briefly, bats were collected with harp traps at an abandoned railroad tunnel near Little Orleans, MD, and fresh guano was collected. Samples were stored on ice until processing. The BtCalV/A10 capsid sequence was isolated from Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) using the sequenceindependent single-primer amplification technique and 454 next-generation sequencing platform. De novo contigs were assembled using three programs: Codon Code Aligner, Geneious, and DNAStar. Viral amino acid sequences were created using Vector NTI. Assembled contigs were analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (87) . BLAST searches were conducted at the amino acid level using the protein-protein BLAST (blastp) function to query nonredundant protein sequences. Phylogenetic analysis. Maximum-likelihood cladograms of 50 known calicivirus VP1 amino acid sequences and 51 known calicivirus S domain amino acid sequences were generated using MEGA7. The cladograms were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model and initially derived with the Neighbor-Join (NJ) and BioNJ algorithms followed by pairwise distance estimation by the use of the JTT amino acid replacement model. Bootstrapping was conducted by generating 500 bootstrapped replicates, and a consensus tree was developed using MEGA7. Consensus radial phylograms were generated in Geneious R11, employing the same sequences used to construct the cladograms, with the Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model, the NJ build method, no outgroup, and 100 bootstrap replicates. Phylograms were rendered for publication in Adobe Illustrator CC 2017. Generation of virus-like particles. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated as previously described (92) . Briefly, the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV VP1 sequences were synthesized and inserted directly into the VEE 3526 replicon. VP1 mRNAs were derived via T7 polymerase in vitro transcription. The VEE-BtCalV/A10 and VEE-BtNoV mRNAs were separately electroporated in C6/36 mosquito larva (Aedes albopictus) cells (ATCC) and BHK cells, respectively. Electroporated C6/36 and BHK cells were incubated at 32°C and 37°C, respectively, with 5% CO 2 for 26 to 28 h before harvesting VLPs. VLPs were purified by velocity sedimentation in sucrose and concentrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using 100-molecularweight-cutoff (MWCO) centrifugal filter units (Millipore). VLP formation and structure were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Protein concentrations were determined by the use of the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce). VLPs for GI. 1.Norwalk.1968 , GII.4.1997 .Lordsdale, and GII.4.Sydney.2012 HuNoVs and MNV were previously synthesized and stored at Ϫ80°C until use. Carbohydrate binding assays. A carbohydrate binding assay to detect VLP binding was conducted as previously described (93, 94) . Briefly, Costar enzyme immunoassay (EIA) plates (Corning) were coated with 2 g/ml of each of the produced VLPs mixed with PBS and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Plates were blocked overnight with blotto (5% instant dry milk-PBS-Tween 20). Synthetic biotinylated carbohydrates (Glycotech) diluted in blotto (10 g/ml) were added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. For the temperature-dependent HBGA binding assay, the plates were incubated at 25°C, 32°C, and 37°C for 1 h. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was diluted in blotto (1:10,000) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The plates were developed with One-Step Ultra-TMB (Thermo Fisher) for 15 min and were stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 prior to being read at 450 nm. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-0.05% Tween between steps. The following 11 carbohydrates were analyzed: H type 1, H type 2, H type 3, A, B, Lewis A, Lewis B, Lexis X, Lewis Y, ␣-2,3-sialic acid, and ␣-2,6-sialic acid. PBS served as a negative control for VLP coating, and blotto served as a negative control for HBGA binding. Each HBGA-VLP interaction was evaluated in duplicate in at least two independent experiments. Data are presented as mean absorbance values Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEM) at 450 nm after removal of PBS negative-control absorbance values. Enzyme immunoassay. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine the antigenic relationships of VLPs was conducted as previously described (53, 95) . Briefly, Costar EIA plates (Corning) were coated with 2 g/ml of VLPs from BtNoV, GI.1.Norwalk.1968, GII.4.Lordsdale.1997, GII.4.Sydney.2012, and MNV mixed with PBS for 4 h at room temperature and blocked overnight with blotto (5% instant dry milk-PBS- Tween 20) . Rabbit hyperimmune serum against GI and GII.4 HuNoVs was diluted 1:2 in blotto, added to each plate, and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were diluted in blotto, added to each plate, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Negative controls included wells with no VLP and no primary antibody. Plates were developed with One-Step Ultra-TMB (Thermo Fisher) and 2 M H 2 SO 4 and read immediately at 450 nm. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-0.05% Tween between steps. Data are presented as mean absorbance Ϯ SEM at 450 nm after removal of negative-Bat Caliciviruses Bind Histo-Blood Group Antigens ® control absorbance. To determine EC 50 , EIA data were log transformed and fitted using sigmoidal dose-response analysis of nonlinear data in GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). EC 50 s were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's posttest.
