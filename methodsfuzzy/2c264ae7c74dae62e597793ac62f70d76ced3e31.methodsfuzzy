A 20 ll aliquot of the E. coli suspension was applied onto the wafer surface of catalyst, and the contacting times (refers to the bacteria contacting time with the wafers of catalyst before sampling) were for 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min at room temperature. The survival cells were washed off from the catalyst wafers with sterile water. 0.5 ml eluate was immediately injected into 4.5 ml 0.9% NaCl aqueous solution to eliminate the effect of Ag + [12] , and then plated on LB agar (Fluka Co.61746) plates. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 24 h before counting. All experiments were repeated three times. The wafers of catalysts were investigated using SEM during the bactericidal process. Before SEM measurement, the E. coli on the wafers were fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, drained with ethanol/water with the concentrations of ethanol increasing. The absolute ethanol was replaced by dimethoxymethane, and the samples underwent critical point drying with CO 2 . The wafers were glued onto stages with conductive silver and metallized with gold. The samples were microscoped and photographed with a scanning electron microscope (Fei QUANTA 200). The bactericidal activity was measured under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, which was achieved by oxygen or nitrogen bubbling to investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, Sigma) was used to investigate the effect of ROS on bactericidal activity. Fifty unit per ml and 100 unit/ml of SOD solution was made, respectively. The solution was added to the E. coli K12 suspension and mixed sufficiently. A 20 ll of the mixture of E. coli suspension and SOD solution was applied onto the wafer surface of catalyst, and the sampling times were for 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min at room temperature. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) method was used to investigate the dynamic changes of IR spectra on Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface during the bactericidal process, and DRIFTS spectra were recorded on a Nexus 670 (Thermo Nicolet) FT-IR, equipped with an in situ diffuse reflection chamber and a high sensitivity MCT detector. After E. coli suspension and catalyst powder were mixed completely, the mixed sample was placed in a ceramic crucible in the in situ chamber. Total carbon (TC) content of mixture of E. coli and catalysts is determined using Apollo 9000 Analyzer (Terkmar Dohmann) during the bactericidal process. It was observed that TC decreased during the catalytic oxidation process, which implied that TC of E. coli had converted to CO 2 and released from the catalysts. The formation of CO 2 during this process can be calculated using the following equation: where TC 0 signifies initial TC and TC i is TC at different times during this process.
