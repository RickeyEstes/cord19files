All repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements as outlined in the OECD Principles of GLP (revised in 1997). These studies were also performed according to ISO 10993 "Biological evaluation of medical devices" and according to current European and OECD guidance for testing pharmaceuticals for human use (see citation for each study). It is emphasized that all animal studies presented in this manuscript were pivotal studies in a nonclinical program for pharmaceutical drug development and were therefore compliant with OECD Principles of GLP and national GLP requirements. For all animal studies, procedures and facilities comply with requirements of commission directive 86/609/ EEC and national legislation defined in animal protection law concerning the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific procedures. All animals were bred for experimental purposes according to Art. 9.2, No. 7 of the German Act on Animal Welfare. The studies were conducted by BSL BIOSERVICE GmbH (Munich, Germany) to comply with OECD principles of GLP and the German Acts on Animal Welfare (Tierschutzgesetz, July 2009). The studies were authorized under the BSL BIOSERVICE licenses to conduct repeated dose toxicity studies granted by the government of Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany. Approval was received before the start of the studies from the competent authority: Regierung von Oberbayern, Abteilung Veterin√§rwesen (80534 Munich, Germany). Animal housing and handling including sacrifice fulfilled standard requirements for pivotal GLP studies to be used in the nonclinical development of pharmaceuticals. Studies followed ICH M3 guidance and are therefore also in accordance with the 3R (replacement, reduction, refinement) principles for more ethical use of animals in testing. In all studies, to alleviate animal suffering on the day of sacrifice
