This review reports the issues arising and lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic and uses some specific cases to detail management and care. The study was conducted from the time the first patient was admitted to the ICU with H1N1 (index case), 23 June 2009 to mid September 2009. The study was conducted in a 22-bed ICU located in a tertiary-referral teaching hospital offering a wide range of services including Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation therapy (ECMO). The ICU operates as a closed unit located in two separate, but adjacent areas. One area has 12 beds, eight of which are in single rooms (six with anterooms) and the other area has 10 beds, three of which are in single rooms. Under normal circumstances an additional equipped, but non-staffed bed is kept for emergency inhospital admissions. Nurse to patient ratios are one-to-one, except for patients who are waiting for ward placement. In addition, for each area there is a nurse shift coordinator and a resource nurse. The ICU is supported by three respiratory technicians who maintain respiratory equipment. However, ventilation requirements are managed by medical and nursing staff. A separate high dependency unit (HDU) of eight beds operates under the direction of the intensive care senior medical and nursing staff. Case details and care processes were documented in accordance with national guidelines (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2007) . The project was approved with the relevant institutional committee. Patient confidentiality and anonymity was maintained throughout the study. Patients admitted to the ICU were eligible for recruitment. They were included if they were confirmed to have H1N1 influenza. Those with influenza A or when the cause of respiratory failure was unknown were excluded. Patient details abstracted from the hospital's 'INFINITE' Registry (ANZIC Influenza Investigators, 2009) was maintained by the ICU research coordinators. Additional patient details were added to the registry as more laboratory data became available. It is unlikely that any patient was missed because the laboratory data was reviewed several times for all patients admitted with respiratory failure. The Clinical Nurse Specialists and ICU Research Coordinators, listed as authors on this paper, collectively contributed a consensus recollection of events and issues encountered during the study period. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the patients with H1N1. Data obtained from the ICU clinical database included age, gender, severity of illness estimated from the worst in first 24 hour Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (Knaus et al., 1985) , comorbidity using APACHE III comorbidity codes (Knaus et al., 1991) and length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital. Organ failure was assessed by the maximum sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) (Vincent et al., 1996) . The duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) was calculated from the time of intubation and commencement of MV (or time of admission to ICU when the patient was intubated before admission) to the time of extubation (or change to spontaneous breathing via a T-piece if patients received a tracheostomy). The SPSS version 17.0 for Windows (SPSS; Chicago, IL) was used to analyse the data.
