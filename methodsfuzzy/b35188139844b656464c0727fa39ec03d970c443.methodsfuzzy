Study population. We performed a cross-sectional study in 219 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients that underwent a liver biopsy between September 2000 and November 2008. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and patients gave their written consent for the study. The Institutional Review Board and the Research Ethic Committee of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III approved the study. Each participating patient signed an informed consent form. Liver biopsies were performed on patients who were potential candidates for anti-HCV therapy and had not received previous IFN therapy (naïve for HCV-treatment). Selection criteria were: no clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, detectable HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), negative hepatitis B surface antigen, availability of DNA sample, CD4 + lymphocyte count higher than 200 cells/μ L, and stable combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for at least 6 months before study entry or no need for cART according to treatment reverse transcriptase inhibitor -based therapy; 3NRTI-based, triple nucleoside regimen; HIV; Human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-RNA, HIV plasma viral load; HCV-RNA, HCV plasma viral load; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST Aspartate Aminotransferase. guidelines used in the study period 26, 27 . Patients with active opportunistic infections, active drug addiction, and other concomitant severe diseases were excluded. All subjects included in our study were European white. Epidemiological and clinical data. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from medical records. The duration of HCV infection for patients with a history of intravenous drug use was estimated starting from the first year they shared needles and other injection paraphernalia, which are the most relevant risk Table 3 . Summary of the differences of genotypic frequencies (Mx1 rs464397, MX1 rs469390, OAS1 rs2285934, OAS2 rs1293762 and OAS3 rs2010604) in relation to severity of liver disease and the adjusted logistic regression analysis for the polymorphisms in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. Statistically significant differences are shown in bold. (a) P-values were calculated by Chi-squared test for trend (linear by linear association); (b) P-values were calculated by multivariate logistic regression adjusted by the most important clinical and epidemiological characteristics (see statistical analysis section). Sometimes, the percentages were not calculated from all patients because some data was missing. Abbreviations: 95%CI, 95% of confidence interval; aOR, adjusted odds ratio; p-value, level of significance; A ≥ 2, moderate activity (Metavir); F ≥ 2, significant fibrosis (Metavir); OAS, 2′ 5′ oligoadenylate synthetase; Mx1, myxovirus resistance proteins.

The duration of HCV infection was not calculated when the date of initiation of their HCV infection could not be determined with certainty. Consumption of more than 50 g of alcohol per day for at least 12 months was considered as a high intake. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Biochemistry panel was measured using an autoanalyzer Hitachi 912 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), while patients were fasting. The degree of insulin resistance was estimated for each patient using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) 29 : fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) times fasting serum insulin (mU/L) divided by 22.5. HCV assays. HCV infection was documented in all patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR test. HCV genotype was determined by hybridization of biotin-labeled PCR products to oligonucleotide probes bound to nitrocellulose membrane strips (INNO-LiPA HCV II, Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium). Plasma HCV-RNA viral load was measured by PCR (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor Test, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and real-time PCR (COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV test); and results were reported in terms of international units per milliliter (IU/mL). The limit of detection varied between 10 IU/mL and 600 IU/mL depending on the HCV diagnostic test used at the time of biopsy. There was no patient with HCV viral loads below the limit of detection. The HCV RNA level of 500,000 UI/ml was chosen as cutoff for low vs. high viral load (circulating HCV RNA) 30,31 . Liver biopsy. Liver biopsies were performed as we described previously 32 . The samples were always evaluated by the same pathologist, who was unaware of the patients' clinical or laboratory data. Liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity were estimated according to Metavir score as follows 33 : F0, no fibrosis; F1, mild fibrosis; F2, significant fibrosis; F3, advanced fibrosis; and F4, definite cirrhosis. The degree of necroinflammation (activity grade) was scored as follows: A0, no activity; A1, mild activity; A2, moderate activity; A3, severe activity. Genotyping of DNA polymorphisms. The most common SNPs in Mx1 gene (chromosome 21) and OAS1-3 genes (chromosome 12) were selected using the databases of HapMap Project (http://snp.cshl.org/ cgi-perl/gbrowse/hapmap_B35/) and NCBI (dbSNP) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/). The selection criteria were: (i) SNPs located in putative regulatory regions, or splicing control elements (SCE), or missense variants; (ii) minor allelic frequency (MAF) greater than 20% in European people in order to have guarantees to obtain significant associations when working with small sample sizes 34 . With this setting, we found three SNPs in Mx1 gene (rs464397 in intron 3, rs458582 in intron 5, and rs469390 in exon 13 (missense)) and other five SNPs at OAS genes (OAS1 rs2285934 in intron 3, OAS2 rs1293762 in intron 2, OAS3 rs739903 in 3′ UTR, OAS3 rs2285933 in exon 6 (missense), and OAS3 rs2010604 in 3′ UTR). Finally, five polymorphisms were selected as tagSNPs according to linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Fig. 2) : two SNPs at Mx1 (rs464397 and rs469390) and three SNPs at OAS (OAS1 rs2285934, OAS2 rs1293762, and OAS3 rs739903). Three SNPs (Mx1 rs458582, OAS3 rs2285933, and OAS3 rs2010604) were discarded for the analysis of individual association because these SNPs were at high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (Fig. 2) . Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood with Qiagen kit (QIAamp DNA Blood Midi/Maxi; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA samples were sent at the Spanish National Genotyping Center (CeGen; http:// www.cegen.org/) for DNA genotyping by using GoldenGate assay with VeraCode Technology (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California, USA). Moreover, for healthy subjects, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes for studied polymorphisms were obtained using the 1000 Genomes Project website (http://www.1000genomes.org/home), which provide a broad representation of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from multiple populations 35 . We select the IBS (Iberian populations in Spain) population that included 107 individuals. Outcome variables. The primary outcome variables were related to severity of liver disease: significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) and moderate activity grade (A ≥ 2). These outcomes were developed after a minimum follow-up time of 10 years with HCV infection.
