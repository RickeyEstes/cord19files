We calculated the percentage agreement between the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay multiplex real-time PCR (Cepheid) and the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics) using the Kappa statistic. Results were interpreted based on the guidelines that negative Cohen's kappa means no agreement between methods, 0-0.20 is slight, 0.21-0.40 is fair, 0.41-0.60 is moderate, 0.61-0.80 is substantial, and 0.81-1 is almost perfect agreement (Altman, 1991; Landis and Koch, 1977) . We measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay multiplex real-time PCR by taking the MOH-approved RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set real-time method as the gold standard. True positives were defined as samples scored positive by the MOH method and also identified as positive by the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay for total FluA ± H1N1 pdm09 as appropriate. Sensitivity (true-positive rate) was calculated as the percentage of infections positively identified by both methods compared to the gold standard method only. Specificity (true-negative rate) was calculated as the percentage of samples identified as negative by both methods compared to the gold standard method only. Chi squared analysis was used to compare distribution of truepositive samples versus samples scored positive by the MOH method (total FluA ± H1N1 pdm09 as appropriate) but negative by the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay according to gender, age group, or location; P ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. Student's t test was used to compare mean ± SD for Ct values for which assays gave discordant versus concordant results; P ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. Taking the MOH-approved RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set as the gold standard, sensitivity (true-positive rate) of H1N1 detection by the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay was 84%, i.e., of the 100 samples scored H1N1+ by the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set, 84 were also scored positive by Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay multiplex real-time PCR ( Table 2 ). The specificity (true-negative rate) for H1N1 detection was 95.8%, i.e., of 649 samples scored negative for H1N1 by the RealTime Ready Influenza A/H1N1 Detection Set (either FluA only or NEG), 622 were also scored H1N1 negative by Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay (either FluA−/H1N1− or FluA+/H1N1−) (Table 2) . Overall, 111 samples were detected as total FluA positive by the MOH gold standard method (FluA or POS), of which 90 were also scored positive by the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay (FluA+/H1N1+ or FluA+H1N1 −), giving an overall sensitivity of 81.1%. Six hundred thirty-eight samples were scored as FluA negative (FluA−) by the gold standard method, of which 602 were also scored negative by the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay (FluA−H1N1−), giving an overall specificity of 94.4%. There was no significant difference in the median H1N1 or total FluA C t values for the H1N1-positive Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay results for samples which were concordant with the MOH gold standard method (median C t : H1N1 = 24.05, FluA = 22.15) and those that were discordant with the MOH gold standard method (median C t : H1N1 = 24.40, FluA = 23.20). There was also no significant difference in the C t values for samples scored POS by the MOH gold standard method which were concordant with the result obtained with the Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay compared to those which were discordant (C t = 28.82 ± 3.44 and 29.89 ± 2.43 respectively; P = 0.250).
