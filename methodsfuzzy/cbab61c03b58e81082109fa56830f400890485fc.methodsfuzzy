This study included 32 laboratory confirmed MERS corona virus patients who were admitted into ICU. Consent was taken from the patients or their relatives. All studied cases were subjected to: (1) Full medical history. (2) Thorough clinical examination. (3) Calculation of body mass index (BMI): a BMI of >30 is considered obese according to WHO [3] . (4) Routine laboratory investigations (complete blood count, kidney and liver functions, and blood sugar testing). (5) Radiological assessment: chest X-ray (posteroanterior and lateral views) and computed tomography (CT). (6) Arterial blood gases, including; PH, PaO 2 , SaO 2 , PaCO 2 and HCO 3 . (7) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) and the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS). (8) Throat swab (Eurotubo, Deltalab, 08191 Rubı´, Barcelona, Spain), sputum, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were taken and stored at 28°C, and transported within 72 h to the reference laboratories, where they were subjected to real-time reverse-tran scriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assays to test for MERS-CoV (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, 22767 Hamburg, Germany). For all patients, the results of rRT-PCR tests were confirmed by measuring cyclethreshold values for viral load [4] .
