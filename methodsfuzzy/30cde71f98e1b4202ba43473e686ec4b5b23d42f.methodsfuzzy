Transfections. HEK 293T cells were plated in a 12-well plate at 150,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to transfection. Cells were then co-transfected with 350 ng of reverse tetracycline transactivator (pBMN-rtTA-i-Lyt2), UAS (pH-5X UAS-eGFP), and HIV protease/Gal4 fusion (pH-TRE-Gal4 PR) using high-potency polyethylenimine (PEI) (linear, MW 25,000; Polysciences, Inc) at 8 μL/μg of DNA diluted according to manufacturer's specification. Cells were then treated with 1 μg/mL Dox and 1 μM of the HIV PR inhibitor DAR when needed, and analyzed 48 hours posttransfection via flow cytometry. Cell maintenance. Phoenix GP cells and human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Human T-cell line SupT1 was maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) 1640 (CellGro) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillinstreptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. Phoenix GP cells were provided by Gary Nolan from Stanford University. HEK 293T cells were provided by Chris Glembotski from San Diego State University. SupT1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Antibodies and reagents. Anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-HA, anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor647, and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 were obtained from Cell Signaling. DCK was obtained from Tocris Bioscience and was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Dox was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and DAR from the National Institutes of Health (Bestesda, MD). Generation of infectious viral particles. For production of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retrovirus, the Phoenix GP cell line at 60%-70% confluence in a 10 cm 2 plate was transfected with 3 μg of the transfer vector (pBMN-HIV Env wt-i-Blasticidin) and 3 μg of a vector expressing the envelope glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (pCI-VSVg). Plasmids were mixed in 500 μL of FCS-free DMEM with 48 μL of PEI (8 μL per μg of DNA). DMEM media was replaced 24 hours posttransfection, and viral supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 hours after transfection. All viral stocks were filtered with 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filters (Olympus Manufacturers) and either used upon collection or frozen at -80°C in 2 mL aliquots. Transductions. SupT1 cells grown in RPMI at 1,000,000 cells/well in a six-well plate were prepared for transduction. Cells were treated with 4 μg/mL Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma-Aldrich) and transduced with viral stocks by hanging bucket rotors centrifuge (Becton Dickinson) at 1500 G, for 80 minutes at 32°C. Cells were then analyzed for expression 72 hours postinfection. Flow cytometry and sorting. The Flow Cytometry Facility at SDSU performed analysis of cells on BD FACSAria at 488 and 633 nm lasers, as well as the BD FACSCanto using only the 488 blue laser and the 633 red laser. Data were collected using FACSDiva 6.1.1 software and analyzed by FlowJo version 6.7.1. draft of the manuscript: DA. Contributed to the writing of the manuscript: DA and RW.
