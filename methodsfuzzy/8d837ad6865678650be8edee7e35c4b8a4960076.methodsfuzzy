DNA extracts from 132 putatively CFPHV positive turtle samples (detailed information of sample location and type of tissue can be found in supplementary Table S1 ), sampled as part of a recent prevalence study (Alfaro-Núñez et al. in review, supplementary data S2) were used to cross-compare the performance of several new PCR-based assays designed to detect CFPHV. These samples represent both active (FP tumour) and latent (non-tumour) CFPHV infections. Non-tumour samples are defined as any other type of tissue with macroscopic absence of tumour and taken from either fibropapillomatosis exhibiting or clinically healthy not exhibiting turtles. A published previously (VanDevanter et al., 1996; Lu et al., 2000) nested approach, hereafter referred to as Lu.et.UL30, that was designed to target the CFPHV polymerase (pol) gene UL30, was used as baseline control against which new approaches were compared as described in Table 1 . It can be challenging to PCR amplify targets within latent viral infections that exhibit potentially sequence variation at primer binding sites, and/or are present at low copy numbers. Two new detection assays, one based around singleplex PCR, the other around nested PCR were designed. Both involve three independent PCR assays that utilize primer sets that bind to highly conserved regions for three different genes in the CFPHV genome (Glycoprotein B gene UL27, Glycoprotein H gene UL22 and Mayor capsid protein gene UL18-UL19) to maximize chance of detection (Table 1 ). Primers were designed using the software Primer3 (v.0.4.0) implemented in Geneious Pro 7.0.6 (Biomatters, New Zealand). The singleplex PCR assays consists of one unique primer set per marker, and target amplicons of 140 bp, 179 bp and 143 bp for the UL27, UL22 and UL18-UL19 marker respectively. The nested PCR assay consists of two primer sets per target region. Initially a primary PCR using 1 l of DNA extract was PCR amplified for 39 cycles. These products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, USA) following the instructions of the manufacturer, of which 2 l was used as template for secondary (nested) PCR. The target sizes and primer sequences of the primary and nested reaction are listed in Table 1 . The products of all amplifications (singleplex, nested-primary and nested-secondary) were visualized on 2% agarose gels. In total therefore, each of the 132 DNA extracts were tested in 11 distinct PCR's for viral detection. All PCR amplifications were performed in 25 l reactions using the enzyme AmpliTaq Gold ® 360 Master Mix (Life Technologies, USA). Each reaction contained 1× PCR buffer, 1× mM MgSO 4 , 0.2 mM each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture and 0.2 l polymerase. Each PCR was cycled under the following conditions: initialization 94 • C for 4 min, 39 cycles of (94 • C for 30 s, 60 • C for 30 s, 72 • C for 30 s), final extension 72 • C for 7 min.
