Mouse strains were selected for known susceptibility (BALB/cByJ) or resistance (SJL/J) to i.c. inoculation with MHV-JHM (Knobler et al., 1981b (Knobler et al., ,c, 1982 Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978) . Pilot studies confirmed this dichotomy in susceptibility following intranasal (in.) inoculation. Resistance of various mouse genotypes to different MHV strains, including MHV-JHM, has been shown to evolve between 1 and 4 wk of age (Bang, 1978; Gallily et al., 1966; Pickel et al., 1981; Taguchi et al., 1977 Taguchi et al., , 1979b . Resistance of SJL mice to i.c. inoculation with MHV-JHM further evolves between 6 and 12 wk of age (Stohlman et al., 1980 (Stohlman et al., , 1982 . Thus, mice were inoculated with MHV-JHM at 1, 3, 6 and 12 wk of age. Sufficient numbers of mice were inoculated to obtain groups of 3-5 mice of each genotype and of each age group at days 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 after inoculation. Additional groups of BALB mice exposed at 6 wk of age were collected at days 60 and 90 after inoculation. Within age groups, mice were selected for necropsy on these days using a table of random numbers. Day 5 was chosen as a peak interval for MHV infection (Barthold and Smith, 1984) , and other intervals were selected to examine the early phase (day 3) and recovery or chronic phases (days 10-90) of infection. Markers of infection included immunohistochemistry on tissues from all major organs, virus quantification in selected target tissues and serum antibody to MHV-JHM. in open cages in the animal room during the course of these studies. They were tested periodically for serum MHV antibody to ensure that proper containment of experimental MHV was effected and that adventitious MHV had not been introduced to the animal room. Mice from both commercial sources were MHV-free. Mice were killed with carbon dioxide gas and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Tissues were frozen at -70 o C until tested for MHV infectivity, or were placed in 10% neutral buffered formahn (pH 7.2) for immunohistochemistry.
