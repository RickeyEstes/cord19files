The subjects of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study were 102 volunteers recruited from the campus of the University of Texas at Austin through posted announcements. A goal of 100 volunteers was planned because a power analysis showed that 49 subjects per group are needed to detect a moderate effect size (ES = 0.5) with 80% power and alpha = 0.05 (one-tailed).21 Subjects were 18 to 54 years of age (mean age, 26.5 years; median age, 22 years) and were healthy except for common cold symptoms. All subjects signed an informed consent form approved by an institutional review board. Patient diaries were completed by 101 subjects; 1 subject was lost to follow-up. The zinc treatment group consisted of 52 subjects (51.5%), and the placebo group consisted of 49 subjects (48.5%). Each subject was given a bottle of 180 lozenges. The lozenges with zinc contained 9 mg of zinc in a 2.7-g dextrose base. Subjects with serious illnesses, organ transplants, or disability (including human immunodeficiency virus infection) were excluded from the study. Subjects were instructed not to use antihistamines, decongestants, aspirin, or vitamin supplements. None of the subjects had a history of alcohol or drug abuse, and none had participated in an investigational drug study within the preceding 30 days. Physical examinations were within acceptable limits, and all women had a negative result on a urine pregnancy test. Because common colds and nasal allergies cause many of the same symptoms, skin tests were performed on each subject to determine whether allergies were present. All subjects were skin tested with 20 different allergy extracts, using a Duotip-Test@ applicator (Lincoln Diagnostics, Inc., Decatur, Illinois) on both lower forearms. The allergy extracts were obtained from Allergy Laboratories of Ohio (Columbus, Ohio). The extracts included ragweed mix, burweed marsh elder, cedar elm, Bermuda grass, Johnson grass, perennial rye grass, mountain cedar (juniper), Virginia live oak, pecan, American elm, Alternaria alternata, Hormodenorum cladosporioides, Helminthosporium sativum, cockroach mix (American and German), cat dander, dog dander, dust mite mix, Western ragweed, a negative control (diluent), and a positive control (histamine). After a 15-to 30minute waiting period, the results of the skin test were measured and recorded. Itching, swelling, or redness at the site of allergy extract appli-cation indicated a positive reaction to the allergen. Forty-six subjects (46%) tested positive for allergies, and 55 (54%) were negative. This study was conducted during July and August 1997, when pollen was at its lowest level. Airborne pollen and spore counts were high for mold spores (726-2676) and scant for grasses (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) during the study. Of the 46 subjects who had positive skin test results, 4 were allergic to molds and 21 were allergic to grasses. From a practical viewpoint, airborne pollen was not a significant factor in the study. To be eligible for this study, subjects had to have two or more common cold symptoms (nasal drainage, nasal congestion, cough, fever, myalgia, headache, sore throat, scratchy throat, hoarseness, sneezing, or malaise) and had to be willing to use lozenges for 14 days or until symptoms stopped. Because this was a randomized, double-masked study, subjects were informed that some individuals would receive zinc lozenges and some would receive placebo. Subjects were also informed that they were required to rate and record their symptoms in a diary at the same time each day. Symptoms were graded as follows: 0 = absent; 1 = mild (symptom is present but not particularly a discomfort); 2 = moderate (symptom is clearly evident and a discomfort); or 3 = severe (symptom is a serious problem and clearly evident and a discomfort). Subjects were instructed to use a lozenge every 1.5 hours while awake during day 0, then one lozenge every 2 hours while awake on following days while symptoms were present. They stopped taking lozenges 6 hours after the symptoms stopped. Subjects recorded their symptoms every day until their symptoms ceased; this was considered the day their involvement in the study ended. Subjects were interviewed regarding the accuracy of their diary entries at their last visit and were compensated $100 for participating in the study.
