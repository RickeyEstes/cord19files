Viruses and cells. Vero cells were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. The chicken fibroblast cell line, UMNSAH/DF1, was purchased from ATCC (CRL-12203). The Beaudette strain of IBV was purchased from ATCC and propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages. The virus was then adapted to grow and passage on Vero cells for 65 passages at 37°C. RT-PCR and sequencing. Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell cultures or purified virions using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the Expand Reverse Transcription and High Fidelity PCR Kits (Roche). Viral RNA extracted from the amniotic fluid of infected embryos was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). PCR products or cDNA clones were sequenced by automated sequencing. Immunofluorescent staining of IBV-infected Vero cells. Confluent cells were infected with viruses and incubated at 37°C for 10-15 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100-PBS. Immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubating cells with rabbit anti-IBV serum and subsequently with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-IBV N antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO), and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham).
