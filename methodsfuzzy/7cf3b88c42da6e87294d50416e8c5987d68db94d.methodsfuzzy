Proteins. Bal gp120-CD4 was provided by Tim Fouts (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) and other recombinant proteins (gp120s and gp140s) were provided by Christopher Broder (USU-HS, Bethesda, MD). Analysis of antibody sequences and design of germline-like antibodies. The heavy and light chain nucleotide sequences were analyzed with JoinSolver Ò [24] . The mAb V(D)J alignments were assigned to the germline gene that yielded the fewest nucleotide mismatches. Values of p < 0.05 were used to compare D segment alignments to that expected from random chance. The minimum requirement for D segment alignment was 9 or 10 (depending on the length of the V to J region) matching nucleotides and at least 2 additional matches for every mismatch. Germline-like sequences were determined by reverting mutations to the germline sequence while retaining the original CDR3 junctions and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) N nucleotides. Gene synthesis and expression plasmid constructions. ScFv DNAs corresponding to mature and germline-like X5, m44, m46, b12, 2G12, and 2F5 were synthesized by Genescript (Genescript, Piscatawy, NJ) and their accuracies were confirmed by sequencing. The VH of each of the antibodies was followed by a (GGGGS) 3 linker and the VL. SfiI restriction site was added to both N and C termini for each scFv during gene synthesis for cloning into pComb3X plasmid (provided by Dennis Burton, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) for expression in bacteria. The pComb3X vector adds a His tag to the C terminus of each inserted scFv. The His tag was used subsequently for scFv purification and detection in ELISA. The DNA fragments encoding selected scFv antibodies were fused with Fc of human IgG1 and cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pSec-Tag2B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression of the fusion proteins. Antibody expression and purification. For scFv expression, Escherichia coli strain HB2151 was transformed by the scFv constructs described above. A single clone was inoculated into 2YT supplemented with 100 U of ampicillin, 0.2% glucose and incubated at 37°C with shaking. When the OD600 reached 0.9, IPTG was added to achieve a final concentration of 1 mM and the culture continued overnight at 30°C with shaking. Cells were then collected, lysed with polymyxin B (Sigma, St. Louis) in PBS, and the supernatant was subjected to the Ni-NTA agarose bead (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) purification for the soluble scFvs. The scFv-Fc constructs were transfected into the 293 freestyle cells with polyfectin transfection agent (Invitrogen). Four days after transfection, the culture medium was collected and the secreted scFv-Fc proteins were purified using a protein-A Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). ELISA. Protein antigens diluted in PBS buffer in concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 lg/ml were added to the 96 well plate and left at 4°C overnight to coat the plate. The plate was then blocked with PBS + 5% dry milk buffer. ScFv and scFv-Fc in different concentrations were diluted in the same blocking buffer and applied to the ELISA plate. The mouse-anti-His-HRP was used to detect the His tag at the C terminus end of each of the scFv clones and the mouse-anti-human Fc-HRP was used to detect the Fc tag of the scFv-Fcs in most of the ELISA unless indicated otherwise. The HRP substrate ABTS (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was then added to each well and OD 405 was taken 5-10 min afterward.
