Continual daily monitoring of temperatures were adopted from the Air Quality Monitoring Network, Environmental Protective Administration, Taiwan (Republic of China) (Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration). 25 To appraise the effects of temperature variation on dengue disease burden, this study first extracted and analyzed daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures and further properly transformed them into monthly temperature timeseries in the period 2001-2014. Here the monthly minimum (T min ), maximum (T max ), and mean (T mean ) temperatures are defined as the lowest, highest, and averaged daily temperatures of a specific month. Kaohsiung, located in southern Taiwan with a typical tropical climate, the second largest metropolitan with dense populations, is a major dengue epidemic area with ~ >50% confirmed dengue cases each year. Officially notifiable data on the monthly dengue cases in Kaohsiung in the period 2001-2014 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan The previously developed dengue-mosquito-human transmission model 16, 27 was adopted to describe the dynamics of vector-host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. The essential features of the mosquito-human transmission model are depicted in Figure 1 . There are four compartments constituting mosquito population dynamics including 1) pre-adult mosquitoes composed of eggs, larvae, and pupae and 2) adult mosquitoes that can be divided into susceptible (S m ), exposed but not yet infectious (E m ), and infectious dengue virus-carrying mosquitoes (I m ) based on infectious status ( Figure 1A ). On the other hand, the susceptible-exposed infectious recovery compartmentalized disease transmission model was implemented to simulate the dengue virus transmission within human populations ( Figure 1B ). To account for the impact of temperature on the epidemics of vector-host interactive dynamics, we selected three temperature-dependent parameters including larvae survival proportion (S L ), extrinsic incubation rate (n m ), and female mosquito death rate (μ m ) for mosquito populations based on the previously published studies to construct temperature-basic reproduction number (R 0 ) profile. 5, 15, 28, 29 A previous study 16 has been validated with observed dengue incidence rates during 2004-2009 in southern Taiwan, this study directly applied the validated compartmentalized mosquito-human transmission dynamic model to estimate the temperature-varied R 0 by incorporating optimally fitted temperature-dependent and derived constant parameter estimates as 16, 27  where b mh and b hm represent transmission probabilities from mosquito to human and from human to mosquito per mosquito bite, n m and n h stand for extrinsic and intrinsic incubation rates, ie, the reciprocals of mean periods in dengue viral shedding for mosquito and human, respectively, B is daily mosquito biting rate, μ m and μ h are death rates for female mosquitoes in adult stage and human, S m (0) represents susceptible female mosquitoes that can be estimated by the product of female mosquitoes surrounding a human (m), S L , as well as total people in Kaohsiung (N h ), and h h is the dengue fever recovery rate for human. Note that R 0 represents transmission potency of dengue virus in the vector-host dynamic model constituted with transmissibility of dengue from mosquito to human (R mh ) and from human to mosquito (R hm ) populations (ie, R 0 2 =R mh ×R hm ). 16, 27 R 0 >1 indicates that dengue fever is epidemically spreading within the human populations with increasing incidences, whereas R 0 <1 means the disease is dying out. An average R 0 of 1 implies that the disease is in endemic equilibrium. In addition, to investigate the contribution of each parameter to the variance of temperature-dependent R 0 , uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation by a commercial software Crystal Ball (Version 2000.2, Decisionerring, Inc., Denver, CO, USA). Specifically, each parameter was defined with an optimally fitted distribution (ie, lognormal distribution) by assigning with either its mean and SD or mean and 95% CI values (ie, define assumption). Temperature-dependent R 0 was then assigned as the integrated forecast of each defined parameter distribution that can be estimated using Eq. (1). A total of 10,000 iterations were performed in the MC simulation through Crystal Ball to ensure the stability of probability distributions. A built-in function, sensitivity analysis, in Crystal Ball was then adopted to examine the contribution of each parameter to the variance of temperature-dependent R 0 . This study estimated DALYs lost by each confirmed dengue case in Kaohsiung in the period 2001-2014 by using Murray's equation as 19
