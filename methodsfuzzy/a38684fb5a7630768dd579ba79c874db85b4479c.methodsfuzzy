Synthesis of 2-diazole-substituted 4-thiazolidinones was achieved via the [2þ3]-cyclocondensation of the pyrazole-based asymmetric thioureas 1.17 as S,N-binucleophiles (see Fig. 6 ). At the same time, the numerous papers represent the data about obtaining of 4-thiazolidinones with diazole moiety in 3 position (compound 2.1, Fig. 11 ), in particular via the reaction of thioureas with ethylchloroacetate [65] . The dithiocarbamate method of 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinones (rhodanines) synthesis is a convenient and often used variant of the synthesis of 4-thiazolidinone derivatives based on the [2þ3]cyclocondensation [5] . R.M. Mohareb et al. had successfully applied the dithiocarbamate method for the synthesis of 3-(pyrazol-5-yl)-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone via two-stage process based on the reaction between 3-phenyl-5-aminopyrazole 2.2 and carbon disulfide in an alkaline medium and subsequent cyclization with Various 4-thiazolidinones were synthesized by reaction of amercaptocarboxylic acids (especially thioglycolic acid) with isothiocyanates (ReN]C]S). Thus, a pyrazoleethiazolidinone 2.8 with phenyl sulfonamide linker group was obtained based on the mentioned approach [67] . There were described the synthesis of 3pyrazole-substituted or polyheterocyclic derivatives of 4thiazolidinones 2.9, 2.10 based on the reaction between thioglycolic acid and corresponding imines and methylidenehydrazydes or three-component reaction involving thioglycolic acid, aromatic aldehydes and heterocyclic amines containing diazole fragment [68e72]. The reaction of isatin with heterocyclic amines led to Schiff's bases which were further reacted with thioglycolic acid to form 3-diazole-substituted indoline-spirothiazolidinones 2.11 [73, 74] (Fig. 13 ). The reaction between trithiocarbonyl diglycolic acid and amines in alcohol or alcoholewater medium (Holmberg synthesis) is a convenient and effective method for synthesis of 3-substituted rhodanines, especially based on the aromatic amines and carboxylic acid hydrazides [5] . The mentioned reaction was used by Augustin M. et al. for synthesis of rhodanine 2.12 with benzopyrazole fragment in position 3 [75] (Fig. 14) . The method for synthesis of pyrazoleethiazolidinone 2.15 ( Fig. 15 ) with acetamide linker group was proposed based on the reaction of 5-arylidenerhodanine-3-acetic acid 2.13 and 5aminopyrazole 2.14 in DMF in the presence of HATU (1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3oxid hexafluorophosphate) [76] . Synthesis of structurally related azolidineepyrazolines 2.16, 2.17 was proposed based on N-alkylation reaction of potassium salts of 2,4-thiazolidinedione, hydantoin and their 5-arylidene derivatives, obtained in situ (Fig. 16 ). 2-Chloro-1-(3,5-diarylpyrazolin-1-yl)ethanones were successfully used as alkylating agents [77] . successfully modified in diazo coupling reaction [91] using pyrazolyl diazonium chloride yielding compound 3.3 (Fig. 17) . The synthesis of pyrazolineeindolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.5, 3.6 was realized by the Knoevenagel reaction of pyrazolineeisatines 3.4 with 2,4-thiazolidinedione, 2-thioxo-4thiazolidinone and 2-amino-4-thiazolidinone in the acetic acid medium and in the presence of sodium acetate [92] (Fig. 18 ). The synthesis of pyrazoloneethiazolidinones 3.7 ( Fig. 19 ) was achieved based on the reaction between isonitrosorhodanines and 5-methyl-2,4-dihydropyrazol-3-one using piperidine as basic catalyst [93] . Magdy allowed to obtain the corresponding pyrazole-thiazolidinones 3.9 [94] . Using hydrazine hydrate the structure of final compounds depended on the reaction medium. Thus, 1N-non-substituted pyrazoles were obtained in alcohol medium and in the presence of sodium ethylate, while 1N-acetylderivatives were formed in acetic acid. The reaction of the compound 3.8 and 1-phenylpyrazolidin- 3,5-dione in the presence of sodium ethylate led to formation of polyheterocyclic system 3.10 (Fig. 20) . Synthesis of 5-pyrazolyl-4-thiazolidinones with ethylene linker group 3.11 was performed via the [2þ3]-cyclocondensation reaction of thiourea with g-pyrazolyl-a-chlorobutanoates [95] (see Pharmacologically attractive 5-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)rhodanines 3.12 ( Fig. 22 ) were synthesized following heterocyclization of 2-thiazolidinyl-3-oxobutanoates with phenylhydrazine or conjugation of 4-bromopyrazolon-5-ones to 3arylrhodanines [96] . The group of pyrazolineethiazolidinones 3.13 was obtained by reaction of 5-bromo-2,4-thiazolidindione with 3,5diarylpyrazolines in alcohol medium (Fig. 23 ). The synthesized compounds were modified in position 3 of thiazolidine cycle by Mannich reaction with secondary cyclic amines and alkylation reactions forming 3.14, 3.15 [97] . The following approach to the synthesis of pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.16 with carbonyl methylidene linker group was based on the acylation reaction of 3,5diarylpyrazolines (Fig. 24) . The further reaction of substances 3.16 with chloroacetamides via N-alkylation reaction led to derivatives 3.17 [97] . To explore the structure-antitrypanosomal activity relationship the pyrazolineethiazolidinone conjugates 3.18 were synthesized through the reaction of the 5-ethoxymethylidenerhodanines with 3,5-diarylpyrazolines (Fig. 25 ). 5-Pyrazoline substituted 4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones 3.19 were obtained under the same conditions [98] . To continue the above mentioned study, 5-pyrazoline derivatives of 4-thiazolidinone 3.21 with oxoethylamino-methylene linker group were synthesized by modification of rhodanine-5carboxylic acid 3.20 in the reaction with pyrazolines and in the presence of DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) [98] (Fig. 26 ).
