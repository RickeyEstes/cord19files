The most common and widely used hybridization-based method is in situ hybridization, which could utilize fluorescent (FISH) or chromogenic (CISH) molecules. The CISH-based assays for the rapid characterization of microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium species and the dimorphic fungi in positive culture samples have been described (Louro et al., 2001; Scarparo et al., 2001) . Recently, a FISH-based assay has been developed for the identification and differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from nontuberculous mycobacteria (Baliga et al., 2018) . Nucleic acid amplification methods are amongst the best in detecting pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity in the clinical samples. Various modifications in nucleic acid amplification methods have provided collectively robust methods to yield better and accurate results. These modifications could be categorized into two amplification methods viz PCR and its variants, and isothermal amplification methods. In isothermal amplification, a number of target DNA copies increase at a constant temperature in just one cycle without the need of a thermocycler. Various techniques have been developed using isothermal amplification methods viz nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), signal-mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART), strand displacement amplification (SDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), isothermal multiple displacement amplification (IMDA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), circular helicasedependent amplification (cHDA), single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA), and strand invasion-based amplification (SIBA). In all these methods, isothermal temperature amplified products can be visualized on gel through the various structures visible on gel or by the incorporation of dyes in the special structures formed on amplification serving in real-time detection. Among all these techniques, LAMP is the most widely used isothermal amplification method which is in fact an autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis, which deploys four primers forming a stem-loop DNA by self-primed DNA synthesis and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Malik et al., 2013; Parida et al., 2008) . Recently, an improved strategy using a double-labeled probe to overcome the problem of false positivity of LAMP together with target gene real-time quantification is devised for detection of avian orthoreovirus (Kumar et al., 2017) and Salmonella spp. (Mashooq et al., 2016) . Other potential isothermal amplification techniques are recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and NASBA. The former has brought a breakthrough in the detection of nucleic acids as it does not require denaturation of the template. RT-RPA is an extension of the above method, in which bacterial RT is used in the amplification of RNA. RT-RPA was developed to study the outbreak of footand-mouth disease (FMD) disease in Egypt (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013) . High degree of fidelity, portability, cost efficiency, simplicity, sensitivity, and tolerance to inhibitors, put this method into the category of resounding techniques, and implementation is quite easy at quarantine stations (Moore and Jaykus, 2017); while the latter one requires initial denaturation of the template followed by temperature labile polymerase dependent isothermal amplification and was designed specially to detect RNA (Compton, 1991) . A multiplex real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (qNASBA) system for the simultaneous detection of rotavirus A, norovirus genogroup II/astrovirus has recently been developed (Mo et al., 2015a) . RT-NASBA proved as more efficient than the conventional RT-PCR and TaqMan RT-PCR assays (Mo et al., 2015b) .
