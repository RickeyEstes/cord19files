2.1. Construction of S1-1/pGEX-6P-3, S1-2/pGEX-6P-1, and S1-3/pGEX-6P-1 expression plasmids Using 2 plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV spike S1 protein-TW1-#18 [nucleotide (nt) (nt 20,704-22,087)] and TW1-#19 (nt 21,826-22,087) as templates, an S1-1 encoding SARS-CoV S protein 1-446 amino acid was produced and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using one pair of primers: SS-F1-2 containing the EcoRI site (5 -GGAATTCCATGTTTATTTTCTTATTATTTCTTACTCTCACTAGTGGTAG-3 ) and SS-R4-3 containing the HindIII site (5 -AAAGGGCCTAAGCTTGCCATGTCTAAGCTACCTATATTTATAATTATAA-3 ). Using 2 plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV spike S1 protein-TW1-#19 (nt 21,826-22,087), the S1 protein and the S2 protein-TW1-#20 (nt 23,077-24,454) as templates, the S1-2 encoding SARS-CoV S protein 447-641 amino acid was produced and amplified by PCR, using one pair of primers: SS-F3-2 containing the HindIII site (5 -GACATGGCAAGCTTAGGCCCTTT-3 ) and SS-R3 containing the SalI site (5 -GAAGTGTCGACATGCTCAGCTC-3 ). The PCR products of S1-1 and S1-2 were subsequently cloned into pGEX-6P-3 and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA) through EcoRI/HindIII and HindIII/SalI digestion and ligation, respectively. The S1-1 fragment was subcloned into S1-2/pGEX-6P-1 through EcoRI/HindIII digestion and ligation to form S1-3/pGEX-6P-1, using standardized molecular cloning technologies (Sambrook et al., 1989) .
