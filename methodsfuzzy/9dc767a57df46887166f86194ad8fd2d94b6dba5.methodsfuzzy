Waiver of informed consent was obtained from the Hospital Ethics Committee due to public health care concern for information of this disease. A cross-sectional retrospective review of CXR and CT of the thorax of 166 patients with influenza symptoms who tested positive for Influenza A(H1N1) at the University of Malaya Medical Centre was done from end July 2009 to early September 2009. The majority of these patients were walk-in patients to the Accident and Emergency Unit who presented with constitutional influenza-like symptoms of fever, myalgia and headache. Laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) was carried out using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primers from the CDC [5] , and virus isolation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The decision to perform chest imaging in these patients was entirely at the discretion of the attending doctors at the Accident and Emergency Unit and, subsequently, doctors from the Respiratory and Infectious Disease Units based on the clinical severity of the patients. Out of the total, 48 patients including pregnant women were deemed not necessary to have any form of imaging. The chest radiographic images obtained from the 118 patients were reviewed by two staff radiologists, who have more than 10 years postgraduate experience, via consensus reading and the patterns recorded. Serial radiographs of patients with progressive clinical signs were also reviewed to assess disease progression and response to treatment by the Infectious Disease Unit team of doctors. Chest CT, which was performed on select cases based on severity and treatment response, were also read and the findings noted. The clinical data of the afflicted patients were obtained from the Hospital Infectious Disease Unit and compiled using Microsoft Office Excel (2003).
