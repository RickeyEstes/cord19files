Statistical methods test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. For examples, the classical t-test has been extensively used for testing differential gene expression in microarray data [35] . However, this kind of procedure relies on reasonable estimates of reproducibility or within-gene error, requiring a large number of replicated arrays. Thus, several methods for improving estimates of variability and statistical tests of differential expression have been proposed. For example, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) aimed to improve the unstable error estimation in the two-sample t-test by adding a variance stabilization factor which minimizes the variance variability across different intensity ranges [36, 37] . ANOVA model approach is widely used in multiple kinds of omic data. For example, it was used to model microarray data with the effects of array, condition, and condition-array interaction and then to fit the residuals with the effects of gene, gene-condition interaction, and gene-array interaction [38, 39] . Also, it was applied to capture the effects of controlled groups, batches, condition, alias of experimental equipment, and condition-metabolite interaction separately on LC-MS data [40] . To improve the accuracy and sensitivity of analytic results, false discovery rate (FDR) [41] and its refinement, q-value, (q-value package, www.bioconductor.org) have been rapidly adopted for genomic, proteomics and metabolic data analysis including the widely-used SAM, DAVID [42] and other approaches [36] . Another statistics method for biomarker discovery is linear discriminant analysis (LDA), one of the classical statistical classification techniques based on the multivariate normal distribution assumption, is quite robust and powerful to discover biomarker or pathways between omics data for many different applications despite the distributional assumption. Compared to LDA, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) requires more observations to estimate each variance-covariance matrix for each class [43] . In addition, logistic regression analysis has been successfully used to evaluate biomarker performance of prostate cancer with mRNA profiling [44] . Logistic regression (LR) model based on the regression fit on probabilistic odds between comparing conditions requires no specific distribution assumption (e.g. Gaussian distribution) but is often found to be less sensitive than other approaches [42, 43] . Bayesian methods allow informative priors so that prior knowledge or results of a previous model can be used to inform the current model. In cancer bioinformatics and systems biology, the primary application of Bayesian methods include Bayesian inference, Bayesian network, Naive Bayes classifier and Bayesian variable selection. Among these methods, Bayesian network is one of the most common modeling tools for pathway and network analysis [19] . Bayesian network is a form of directed statistical modeling designed to capture conditional dependencies between probabilistic events [58] . It consists of a dependency structure and local probability model also named probabilistic graph models which include Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBN), Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Markov Logic Networks (MLN) [59] [60] [61] . The dependency structure specifies how the variables are related to each other by drawing directed edges between the variables without creating directed cycles. Each variable depends on a possibly set of other variables, termed "parents." Compared with other pathway/network centric method, Bayesian network model is capable of integrating heterogeneous data, missing value and dependent relationships between variables [62] . In a Bayesian network model, probabilities define the relationship between the current node and its predecessor or parent in a graph [63] . The power of these methods lies in their ability to facilitate the reverse engineering of multiplex networks based on molecular expression, molecular activity and/or cell behavior data, serving as a precursor to synthetic modifications of existing molecular pathways [64] . Bayesian inference is one of the very important Bayesian methods widely used in cancer biomarker discovery, signaling pathway and network inference [65, 66] . It has previously been applied to gene expression data for inference of gene regulatory networks [67, 68] , infer both protein signaling networks [69, 70] and gene regulatory networks [71] . To incorporate an explicit time element, dynamic Bayesian Inference was proposed to interrogate dynamic signaling responses within a Bayesian framework, with existing signaling biology incorporated through an informative prior distribution on networks [66] . In addition, Bayesian variable selection aims at solving the problems of "large p, small n" existing in omic data set and using prior knowledge such as pathway and protein interaction to estimate the posterior probability by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) also widely used to infer functional interactions in biochemical pathway, model the interactions between different functional modules of a biological network [72] and pathway based cancer biomarker discovery [73, 74] . For example, Yang et al. [21] used a Bayesian network to construct HCC cell networks and identify functional modules and interactions between these modules. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they are hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions cannot be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modeling, bypass this limitation. The difference between Bayesian and frequentist inference lies in the following: 1) Bayesian inference provides answers conditional on the observed data and not based on the distribution of estimators or test statistics over imaginary samples not observed (Rossi et al., 2005, p. 4) ; 2) It includes uncertainty in the probability model, yielding more realistic predictions. 3) It safeguards against overfitting by integrating over model parameters. But the quality of the prior information directly impacts the performance of the Bayesian methods. Also, they are unable to account for feed-back regulation, a hallmark of signaling networks. Integration of data from multiple omic studies not only can help unravel the underlying molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis but also identify the signature of signaling pathway/networks characteristic for specific cancer types that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis and guidance for targeted therapy. The methods described in Sections A-E have proven useful for discovering biomarkers from high-throughput omic data, analyzing protein-protein, protein-DNA, and kinase-substrate interactions, as well as for genetic interactions among genes [102] . These efforts have yielded good results in cancer biomarker discovery, protein interaction and interaction between genotype and diseases [103] . However, current omic technologies provide only limited fragmented reality of the biological functions within cell or cancer mechanism. Separate analysis of the data generated from each of these technologies is limited to revealing only partial aberrant molecular changes, because the interaction of multiple molecules cannot be modeled by isolated analysis of genes, proteins or metabolites. Furthermore, limitations such as intrinsic high noise, incomplete data, small sample-size, bias have motivated the use of integrative omic analysis and use of prior biological knowledge and information bases, rather than as mere collections of single large-scale omic studies [14, 34, 104] . However, integration of multiple disparate data types remains a significant challenge in systems biology research. Most recently, attempts at integration of multiple high-throughput omics data have concentrated on capturing regulatory associations between genes and proteins by comparing expression patterns across multiple conditions [105] [106] [107] , combining functional characterization and quantitative evidence extracted from different data sources of all levels of gene products, mRNA, proteins and metabolites, as well as their interaction [108] [109] [110] . Some previous works [81, [111] [112] [113] in integrative analysis utilize pathways in the form of connected routes through a graph-based representation of the metabolic network [114] . Other approaches focus on the functional module of protein interaction network and analyze experimental data in the context of pathways using multiple source omics data [14, 115, 116] . We and others have developed advanced bioinformatics tools and algorithms to facilitate the integration of diverse data types [34, 110, [117] [118] [119] [120] . Different biological types of data, such as sequences, protein structures and families, proteomics data, ontologies, gene expression and other experimental data sets show a growing complexity produced by numerous heterogeneous application areas. The integration of heterogeneous data is therefore becoming more and more important. In order to gain insights into the complexity and dynamics of biological systems, the information stored in these data repositories needs to be linked and combined in efficient ways.
