This article draws on five years of participant observation of Beijing's creative industry projects including the 798 district by the first two authors in their role as local government planning consultants, and a recent round of surveys and personal interviews carried out in late 2010 and early 2011. More than 20 senior local officials working in bureaus of land management, urban planning, Development and Reform Commission, Zhongguancun Science Park Administrative Committee, and the 798 Art District Construction & Management Office and 40 art-related businesses were interviewed. In October 2013 to May 2014 further surveys and interviews were conducted with art-related businesses and in particular with new post-2011 entrants. This primary research data were supplemented by secondary data. Theoretical background: cultural industries, geographies of decentralization and land-use succession The story of Factory 798 is a story of rent-driven land-use succession that was achieved (industry to art district), non-achieved (an electronics industry project) and achieved through upgrading (arrival of high end galleries and advertising), a story of a transition from industry to services and in particular to a subset of cultural industries and of subsequent art district upgrading into higher revenue-earning activities, a story about the path-dependent nature of development and a story that involves the interaction of processes unfolding at different scales. At least three areas of research have a bearing on the issues examined in this paper: studies of (1) the rise of services and the development of creative and cultural industries, (2) intrametropolitan location, and (3) urban land-use. In a Chinese context, attention must also be paid to the specificities of the Chinese context. These processes of transformation involve changes in industrial structure and land-use that are moreover multi-scalar and evolutionary or path-dependent. At any point in time, multiple projects and proposals may exist, and the struggle between them can significantly shape medium-term trajectories. These evolutions involve general processes of industrial restructuring and ground rent-and planning-driven land use succession but always reflect more specific developments and a series of critical events at a range of scales from the national (reform of Chinese cultural policy), up to the global (the international relations of the Communist era, Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Olympics, the intervention of international organizations), and down to the local (relocation of art schools, local artists choices and local government actions). What happens in a place reflects local factors but also reflects the impact of wider forces.
