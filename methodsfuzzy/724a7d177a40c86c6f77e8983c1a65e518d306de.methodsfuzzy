2.1. PCR amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis and purification of DNA targets Different length DNA products for TVCV (100, 300 and 1000 bp) and CaMV (92 and 307 bp) were amplified from E. coli derived TVCV (Zhang et al., 1999) and CaMV (Armour et al., 1983) plasmids using specific primers (Table 1) . Total reaction mixtures of 25 l comprised of 16 l of nuclease-free water, 2.5 l of 10X Taq polymerase buffer, 2 l of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0.35 l of dNTPs/aa-dUTP The table lists all the probes used in the study and described in the article. a 70-mer probes for Turnip vein clearing virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus are probes described by Wang et al. (2003) ; M-minus-sense probe, P-plus-sense probe, (T)-tailed/spacer probe, (NT)-non-tailed/non-spacer probe. Probes not indicated as P or M are plus-sense probes. (a mixture of 10 mM dGTP, dATP, dCTP each, 5 mM dTTP and 5 mM aminoallyl dUTP), 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 l each of 0.4 mM forward and reverse primers and 2 l of the template plasmid. Cycle parameters for the PCR amplification were as follows: 94 • C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 • C, 40 s at 48 • C and 1 min at 72 • C with a final 10 min extension step at 72 • C. Synthesized PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis in 40 mM Tris-acetate, l mM EDTA. DNA fragments of 307 bp or below were purified using QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) while Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) was used for 1000 bp products. Purified samples were dried and suspended in 8 l of nuclease-free water. All oligonucleotides including primers and probes used in this study were synthesized commercially (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, USA and Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX, USA).
