Transmission of pasteurellas probably occurs by the inhalation of infected droplets coughed up or exhaled by infected animals, which may be clinical cases or recovered carriers in which the infection persists in the upper respiratory tract. M. haemolytica and P. multocida are highly susceptible to environmental influences and it is unlikely that mediate contagion is an important factor in the spread of the disease. When conditions are optimal, particularly when cattle are closely confined in inadequately ventilated barns, when overcrowded in trucks and trains, or held for long periods in holding pens in feedlots, the disease may spread very quickly and affect a high proportion of the herd within 48 hours. In animals at pasture, the rate of spread may be much slower. Transmission occurs from direct and repeated contacts between sick and healthy animals. The principal route of infection is by the inhalation of infective droplets from active or carrier cases of the disease. Mediate infection by contamination of inanimate objects is unlikely under natural conditions, but it has been effected experimentally. Infected hay remained infective for up to 144 hours. Other inanimate objects such as placenta and urine can also remain infective for long periods. It has been suggested that urine may be a mode of transmission, especially in European countries with temperate climates, where cattle are reared intensively in restricted geographic areas and many herds share the same watercourse. Spread of the pathogen may also occur by discharges from local tail lesions resulting from vaccination with virulent culture. A separation of 6 m between animals is usually considered to be sufficient, but transmission over 200 m is suspected to occur. 3 Cattle may be infected for periods of up to 8 months before the disease becomes apparent, underscoring the importance of sufficiently long quarantine period before a herd can be declared to be free of the disease. CBPP is usually transmitted through movements of live animals; trade in animal products is not thought to be a significant risk. Direct transmission of M. bovis from infected to uninfected animals is considered the primary route of disease transmission, an assumption that is corroborated by epidemiologic evidence indicating that the seroprevalence in feedlot cattle increases dramatically in the first weeks in the feedlot. Clinically normal cattle in infected herds harbor M. bovis in the upper respiratory tract with no apparent adverse effect and may shed the organism through the nasal discharge for months to years. 5 M. bovis might be transmitted with respiratory secretions, via aerosols, direct nose-to-nose contact, or fomites. Although mycoplasmas in general do not easily survive in the environment, M. bovis can survive for prolonged periods outside the host, particularly in cool and humid conditions. Nonetheless the role of fomites and environmental contamination deserves further investigation but, with exception of the transmission of mycoplasma mastitis, is currently considered to be of limited epidemiologic relevance. Oral ingestion of M. bovis contaminated milk or colostrum results in colonization of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract with this pathogen and increased occurrence of otitis media. 12 Feeding colostrum or milk of cows shedding M. bovis through the mammary gland must therefore be considered as an effective route of disease transmission. Intrauterine infection of calves appears to occur infrequently. Transmission of mycoplasma mastitis is considered to primarily occur in the milking parlor through contaminated milk. Aerosol infection and direct contact are the methods of transmission and both are accentuated in crowded, inadequately ventilated conditions. Newborn calves raised in individual pens may become infected within 5 to 15 days after an experimentally infected calf is placed in the calf house. The mode of transmission has not been defined, but aerosol infection and direct contact are probable. Infection spreads rapidly among susceptible cattle. The main sources of infection are the nasal exudate and coughed-up droplets, genital secretions, semen, and fetal fluids and tissues. Aerosol infection is the method of spread of the respiratory disease. Experimentally, participate in cattle shows more often than negative farms. The positive farms have more visitors and are situated closer to other cattle farms. The failure to vaccinate regularly and keep reliable records of vaccination dates is commonly associated with inadequate disease control. In countries with BHV-1 eradication programs, the loss of certification is commonly associated with yearly number of cattle purchased, farm density within a 1-km radius, and cattle density within a 1-km radius. Once infection is introduced it is difficult and expensive to eradicate; thus, establishing and maintaining good biosecurity is a cost-effective way of preventing the introduction of maedi-visna and other important infectious diseases, such as foot  EHV-4 is highly infectious, and transmission probably occurs by the inhalation of infected droplets or by the ingestion of material contaminated by nasal discharge. Foals infected with EHV-4 have prolonged and profuse shedding of virus in nasal secretions. Mediate infection may occur, the virus surviving for 14 to 45 days outside the animal. Infections always arise from other horses, both by direct contact and via fomites. Horses and foals are infectious during the active stage of disease and, because horses become latently infected, presumably during subsequent periods of viral reactivation and shedding. The duration of latency is unknown but is assumed to be lifelong. EHV-4 establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion, which is the origin of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal (5th cranial) nerve that provides sensory innervation to the nasal mucosae. It is assumed that reactivation of the virus and subsequent virus shedding poses a risk to in-contact, susceptible animals, but this has not been definitively demonstrated in field situations. If this were the case, then clinically normal animals harbor latent virus that during periods of reactivation can infect susceptible animals. If true, this feature of the disease has obvious importance in the prevention, control, and management of outbreaks of disease. Direct contact and droplet infection are presumed to be the most likely methods of transmission. The reservoir of infection is the infected sow, and litters of piglets become infected at an early age. Colonization of the tonsil by PM in conventionally reared pigs is common. In the Netherlands, it has been recognized that infection is usually by one of four possibilities. These are artificial insemination centers, laborers, neighborhood infection by direct aerosol or indirect local contact, and the presence of carrier animals and birds. The infection is usually introduced into a herd by the purchase of infected pigs. Spread between piglets is probably enhanced after weaning when mixing of litters occurs, and 70% to 80% of a large weaned group may become infected. Infection persists for up to several weeks and months, followed by a gradual reduction in the intensity and rate of infection. In herds where BB is the initiating agent, up to 90% of pigs 4 to 10 weeks of age will have nasal infection, but this infection rate falls to approximately 15% by 12 months of age, and the proportion of carrier pigs within the breeding herd decreases with increasing age of sow. The prevalence of infection is also much higher during the period from October to March than at other times of the year, and the prevalence of serologically positive animals is highest from July to December. This is most probably a result of the winter housing conditions, with few air changes per hour, fluctuating temperatures, and high humidity. The epidemiology of toxigenic strains of PM as a causative agent of atrophic rhinitis is not as well understood. The organism colonizes the tonsils of clinically normal pigs. In contrast to BB, which is ubiquitous in pig herds, the toxigenic isolates of PM appear to be restricted to herds affected with progressive atrophic rhinitis. The organism is invariably present in herds with progressive atrophic rhinitis but may also be present in about 5% of the pigs in a herd with no clinical history of atrophic rhinitis. The main source of toxigenic isolates of PM for young pigs appears to be the pharyngeal tissues of the breeding stock. About 10% to 15% of sows in farrowing houses may be infected with toxigenic isolates, and piglets become infected within a week after birth. In contrast to BB, infection of piglets at 12 to 16 weeks of age with toxigenic PM will still result in varying degrees of severity of lesions. It is possible for growing pigs to develop lesions of atrophic rhinitis well beyond the age of 3 weeks if they are exposed to pigs affected with disease and infected with PM and BB. Transmission is usually by pig to pig contact or more correctly nose-to-nose contact. Aerosol droplets only carry over short distances before they are precipitated. In Denmark it was suggested that the paramount factor in the spread of APP was the aerosol spread from infected neighbors. 7 In this study, the trading of subclinically infected animals, the frequency of stock purchases, the use of multiple sources, and poor biosecurity were factors associated with the spread of APP in the Danish SPF herds. Most of the herds use AI and bring in pigs in sterile containers. The organism can be spread in the air for a distance of 1 m. Aerosol transmission of APP9 was possible over 2.5 m. An experiment with transferring air from a group of pigs with serotype 2 showed that if 10% of the air was transferred, then there was no transmission, but if 70% was transferred, then the APP did spread. Experimental aerosol exposure of pigs to serotype 9 results in infection and induces protection to subsequent challenge from the homologous strain. Only a few organisms need to be carried in the tonsil and nasopharynx for a pig to become infectious during travel. Pigs may carry the APP in the nose, and the carriage occurs for both low-and high-virulence strains. The carrier state can be activated by stress or other pathogens. The subclinically infected carrier pig is the most common source of infection. It has been suggested that shedding only takes place at the time of active infection, not when the organism is just carried. Transmission is by the respiratory route, principally via nose-to-nose contact. Overcrowding and inadequate ventilation may facilitate spread. Peak transmission may occur at around 11 weeks. Experimental intranasal challenge has been followed by death in a period as short as 24 hours. The mixing of infected pigs (seeder pigs) with normal susceptible pigs for 48 hours can mimic field infection, with the development of clinical disease, febrile responses, lung lesions, and mortality. The subclinically infected carrier pig is the most common means by which the infection is transmitted between herds. Severe outbreaks may occur unexpectedly in susceptible breeding herds with no previous history of the disease or in intensive feeder pig operations in which pigs are introduced on a regular basis from a variety of sources. Herds that continuously introduce replacement stock are highly susceptible to an outbreak. Following the initial outbreak, general herd immunity develops, but the infection persists, and sporadic cases may continue to occur. The organism is not readily isolated from normal respiratory tissues, but persists in chronic lesions within the lungs of recovered and apparently clinically healthy pigs. These pigs provide a source of infection, especially in a finishing herd buying from diverse sources. The indirect transmission of infection has been proposed but may be rare. An on-farm study described five cases of being transmitted by aerosol or boots or clothes, but the other three cases could have been any combination of these three or even other indirect sources. The organism is an inhabitant of the respiratory tract of pigs, and transmission occurs by direct nose-to-nose contact, which is the main form of transmission. Airborne transmission and fomites are less important. Mycoplasma can be transmitted over 1, 75, and 150 m, and recently aerosol has been seen to be transmitted over 9.2 km. 12 M. hyopneumoniae was found to travel long distances from an infected experimentally infected group of pigs. 13 Airborne transmission was suggested on 80% of farms where acute respiratory disease was present. No airborne organisms were found on farms without acute respiratory disease. There is no other known host for the organism, although infection and breakdown of closed pneumonia-free herds has occurred without any pig introductions. The number of organisms required for infection is very small, and the possibility of wind-borne infection has been suggested. Transmission is by the respiratory route and in infected herds occurs primarily from the sow to the suckling piglets. In a study of shedding of MH in different parities: gilts were 73% positive, parity 2 to 4 sows were 42% positive, parity 6 to 7 sows 50% positive, and parity 8 to 11 sows were 6% positive. Generally, the nursery is considered the area where transmission occurs and infection spreads slowly. Within pen transmission measured by PCR is very slow. Animals can be PCR positive and not infectious for long periods of time and then can become very infectious up to 119 days, as has been recorded. 11 There is therefore a nonlinear excretion of MH. It is thought that one infected nursery pig will infect on average one littermate. Boars can also infect sows when they are kept together in service areas, but in these areas the disease spreads slowly. The disease is also transmitted and exacerbated during the grouping and stress of pigs that occurs at weaning. Transmission can occur as early as 1 week of age, but usually it is not observed under 6 weeks of age. 14 The highest clinical and pathologic incidence occurs in the postweaning and growing period, and in most herds this is maintained through the growing period to market age. The start of finishing is the critical point. Direct exposure (nose-to-nose contact) of pigs at 9 to 11 weeks of age to seropositive gilts results in seroconversion to the organism by 21 days and is most frequent by about 11weeks after exposure. The presence of gross lesions of pneumonia correlated with the seroconversion. Frequent coughing by infected, intensively reared pigs suggests that repeated aerosol exposure occurs and is an important natural mode of transmission of respiratory pathogens. There is general agreement that management and environmental conditions considerably influence the severity of the disease. The reinfection of enzootic pneumoniafree herds, recurrences or so-called breakdowns, occurs at a rate of about 3% of herds every 6 months. In a study of swine herds that had participated in the Pig Health Control Association Scheme in the United Kingdom, the close proximity of the uninfected herds to infected herds appeared to be the most important risk factor that could explain the introduction of the infection. The size of the herd, the density of the pig population in the area, the distance to the next road regularly used for transportation of pigs, and differences in topography were risk factors associated with reinfection. There was little evidence to indicate that unexplained breakdowns occurred in association with long-term latent infection in other herds from which animals had been imported. Clinical signs of enzootic pneumonia in these herds commonly did not occur for several months after the introduction of infected pigs. MH was not transmitted during a 20-week period when personnel weekly contacted susceptible pigs in a naïve herd after they had been in contact with pigs in an infected herd. A comprehensive herd specific prevention program is necessary to reduce transmission of disease caused by MH. 15  Of most importance is that in birds, influenza viruses mainly affect the intestinal tract (without clinical effects), but in mammals, replication occurs mainly in the respiratory tract (with illness). The right combination of NA and M genes is necessary for the replication and transmissibility of influenza virus infections in pigs. 109 The natural reservoir of influenza A virus is aquatic birds. Various subtypes have been established in other species, such as influenza A H1N1 viruses, which infect human and different animal species. The influenza viruses may be transmissible between humans and pigs. Swine are the sole animals known to be susceptible to influenza A viruses of human, swine, and avian origin. Swine may become infected with related type A human influenza strains during epidemics of human influenza, but they show no clinical signs of infection. The human strains have been isolated from pigs in Hong Kong, and pigs may serve as a reservoir for pandemics in humans and a source of genetic information for recombination between human and porcine strains. In Japan, pigs may be seropositive to the H1N1 human viruses relative to human H1N1 influenza epidemics and seropositive to human H3N2 viruses unassociated with human epidemics of disease. In Czechoslovakia, influenza A viruses are brought into pig herds by carrier people. Pigs can be naturally infected with a range of avian influenza viruses. There have been at least three independent introductions of distinct wholly avian viruses into pigs. The virus in the late 1970s spread throughout Europe and the United Kingdom and became a major cause of SI. These viruses also undergo drift. Elsewhere in the world antibodies against H4, H5, and H9 viruses have been isolated from Asian pigs and avian H4N6, H3N3, and Soon after the occurrence of the H3N2 viruses, new H1N2 viruses arose in the United States, where the human H3 had been replaced by a porcine H1 and then spread. They had been known elsewhere in the world for some time: Japan, France, Germany, and Taiwan. They were described in the United Kingdom, where they were found to be the most severe cause of pathology associated with the SIV viruses. These were all reassortants between human H3N2 and classical H1N1. Human H3N2 and avian H1N1 were isolated in the United Kingdom and were then found to have spread to Europe. They are usually human H and N and the rest avian genes, but one Italian virus has an avian H1. They have shown considerable genetic drift in Europe. Subtype H3N2 has been isolated in Canada from pigs with severe proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP), although this PNP is probably associated with PRRS and PCV2. Serologic surveys indicate the infection is widespread in the swine populations in some countries. The first unusual virus to be found in pigs was an H9N2 introduced to pigs in South East Asia, probably from land-based poultry. Further problems occurred in the autumn of 1999 when an avian H4N6 was found in pigs with pneumonia on a commercial swine farm in Canada. Since then the avian H5N1 has appeared in pigs in China and is being carried west by bird migrations into Russia. The potential of avian viruses to spread to pigs and persist in pigs is unknown. Even if the viruses do not replicate, they can contribute viral genes to other pig viruses. This is the reason for continual surveillance of SIV viruses. These were wholly avian viruses that were of North American lineage. It was the first report of an interspecies transmission of an avian H4 virus to domestic pigs under natural conditions. The disease usually affects young pigs, but all ages may be affected. Typically, sudden-onset epidemics occur with a high morbidity rate but with a low case-fatality rate of less than 5%. Loss of body condition is marked, which is usually the important cause of financial loss, although occasionally death losses may be extensive if the pigs are kept under inadequate conditions or if secondary bacterial infections occur. Abortions and deaths of newborn pigs have also been reported as causes of loss in this disease. A low level of infection was reported in Poland in 2007 in pigs, wild boar, and animal keepers. 96 The 2009 pandemic first affected pigs in Canada 97 and has since been found worldwide: Norway, 98 Italy, 99 Canada, 100, 104 Argentina, 101 South Korea, 102 Thailand, 103 and Europe. 27 H1N1 viruses have been recovered from pigs in Canada. Aerosol transmission is more efficient at low temperatures and low humidity because the virus is more stable under these conditions. 110 Aerosol transmission of a novel swine origin H1n1 virus was shown in China. 111 In water the avian viruses survive better at low temperature and salinity and high pH. 112, 113 The avian virus survives better on nonporous surfaces rather than porous ones 114 and, if there is mucus, much longer. 115 Swine are susceptible to both human and avian viruses because they have receptors on their respiratory epithelial cells for both avian (receptor SA 2, 3 Gal) and human (receptor SA α 2, 6 Gal). Several reassortants have been isolated from pigs in the United States and other parts of the world. Thus swine have an important role in the ecology of influenza A viruses and are regarded as a "mixing vessel" for the introduction of reassorted viruses into the human population. There is a report claiming that outbreaks of influenza in turkeys followed outbreaks of swine influenza in pigs from nearby swine herds. Swine and other influenza viruses have also been isolated from cattle, and experimental inoculation of calves has been successful. The swine influenza virus may cause natural infection in cattle and the virus can be transferred to uninoculated calves. The primary route of infection is through pig-to-pig contact 116, 117 via the nasopharyngeal route. Peak shedding occurs 2 to 5 days postinfection (>10 7 infectious particles/mL at a peak) but also by aerosols and contaminated fomites. 118 The rapid spread of infection from pig to pig occurs by inhalation of infective droplets. The disease may appear almost simultaneously in several herds within an area following the first cold period in late autumn. The virus can persist in infected swine, which can act as convalescent carriers and be the reservoir of the virus between epidemics. However, the experimental inoculation of a swine influenza virus into specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs resulted in a mild disease and the period of viral shedding was shorter than 4 weeks. Water contaminated with bird droppings has been implicated as a source of influenza virus in several swine outbreaks. 68 Fomites and aerosols 92 are probably important in the transmission of influenza. [119] [120] [121] [122] Insects may be important (certainly in avian influenza 123 ) and blowflies have been implicated. 124, 125 Long-distance pig travel via transport may help spread. 126 International trade may also facilitate the intercontinental spread of viruses. 127
