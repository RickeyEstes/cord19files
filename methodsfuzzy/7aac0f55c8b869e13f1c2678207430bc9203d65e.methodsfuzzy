To demonstrate the conserved sequence design method, a simplified example of the procedure is shown in Figure  1A . Assuming that there are six (n) viruses in a viral genus (G), the similarity sequence segments for a given virus v i compared to the other five (n-1) viral genomes (G (i) ) are designated I ji (j = 1,..., 5) (Fig. 1A) . These similarity segments are then ranked by the number of similarity hits with other viral genomes (S i ) and plotted along the v i genome. The highest-ranking (max(S i )) similarity sequences should be the most-conserved sequences (C i ) for virus v i and the other five viral genomes (red segments in Fig. 1B ). The above procedures are repeated until a panel of conserved segments derived from all of the viral genomes in G is obtained. Assuming that nine 70-mer candidate conserved probes (P = {p j | j = 1,..., 9}) are selected by steps 5 and 6 in the probe design algorithm, Table 1 ( Figure 2 ) demonstrates how to search for the minimal number of 70-mer genus probes that give similarity hits with all six viral members (v i | i = 1,..., 6) of G. Each "Ã—" in Table 1 ( Figure 2 ) indicates that p j has a similarity hit with v i . We subsequently used the coronavirus genus to test the procedure for finding similar viral sequence segments. The SARS-CoV genome (v SARS-CoV ) was aligned with the other 10 genomes G (SARS-CoV) of the coronavirus genus using the BLASTN program (Fig. 1C) . In the figure, each viral genome of the coronavirus genus is represented by a color-coded block, where the height of each pile of blocks along the SARS-CoV genome sequence represents the number of similarity hits (S SARS-CoV ) with the other 10 genomes of the same genus for that particular sequence location (i.e., segment). The two viral segments showing the highest number of similarity hits with the other genomes (C SARS-CoV ) were extracted for microarray probe design. To validate the method in silico, the SARS-CoV genome was removed from the coronavirus genus and treated as a test genome. The remaining 10 coronavirus viral genomes were used as the calibration set for computing the conserved sequences by the aforementioned procedures. To obtain high similarity genus probes, we used a high stringency criterion for hybrid formation in the conserved sequence detection method: 38-bp BLASTN sequence identity matches or >15 consecutive base pairing nucleotides [10] . Figure 3A shows the computed conserved sequence segment pool with redundancy (i.e., C'(Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ) in step 5 of the above probe design algorithm). These segments can be further sorted into five nonredundant groups by the BLASTN alignment program. The five longest sequences (underlined sequences in Fig.  3A ) in each of the groups represent the nonredundant conserved sequence set of the coronavirus genus without SARS-CoV. A BLASTN sequence alignment between the SARS-CoV genome and the five nonredundant conserved sequences shows that the longest conserved sequence in group 1 had 80% (79/98) sequence similarity with the SARS-CoV genome at nucleotide positions from 15732 to 15829 ( Fig. 3B ) but no significant similarity with any genome in the other viral genera (data not shown). To provide a more comprehensive in silico validation, we also performed leave-one-out cross-validation to the other viral members of the coronavirus genus and 13 other viral genera. In total, 14 viral genera and 333 nonre- dundant viral genome sequences were included in the large-scale cross-validation to verify the probe design algorithm (Fig. 3C ). Based on a recent report that BLASTN sequence identity matches as short as 25-bp are sufficient to form a DNA hybrid [3] , a lower hybrid formation criterion (25-bp vs. 38-bp BLASTN identity) was used to deter-mine whether a test viral genome can be detected by a set of conserved sequences computed from the calibration genome set for a given genus. In Figure 3C , the column entitled "sequenced genomes" lists the number of viruses included for the computation in each genus, and the column entitled "detection by cross-validation" contains the Algorithm for designing conserved probes number of viruses detected using the in silico method for each genus. The rightmost column is the positive detection rate for the in silico method for each genus. The computation results showed that most of the computed genus probes -especially for those genera having a larger number of sequenced viral genomes -displayed a good capability of detecting novel viruses, except for the genus of lentivirus, which yielded a worse prediction outcome. This result indicates that both the number of sequenced genomes and the extent of sequence conservation of viral members in a genus are useful factors for assessing the predictive power of the computed conserved sequences. Nevertheless, the in silico cross-validation results produced an average successful detection rate of 92%, which demonstrates the feasibility of the probe design method.
