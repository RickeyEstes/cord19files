Some of paragonimiasis patients are asymptomatic, and the presence of lung lesions is detected on a health checkup. Extrapulmonary paragonimiasis such as cutaneous and cerebral paragonimiasis are classically known form of the ectopic infection with Paragonimus spp. In cases of cutaneous paragonimiasis, a slowly moving nodular lesion in the subcutaneous tissue is a characteristic symptom. The worms may migrate through mediastinal soft tissues to the brain, causing eosinophilic meningitis or cerebral paragonimiasis in some cases [397] . Since Paragonimus spp. is widely distributed around the world, Japanese travel to endemic area such as China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines possible to infect with Paragonimus spp. As well as foreign patients from endemic areas, this disease always is considered when a patient has respiratory symptoms and/or lung lesions with eosinophilia [398] . Chest X-ray findings vary: not only pulmonary parenchymal lesions, such as nodular (Â±cavity formation) and infiltrative shadows, but also pleural lesions, such as the retention of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, are sometimes observed [399] . Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or elevated serum total IgE. Immunodiagnosis to detect parasite-specific antibody has been proven as the most useful and reliable tool. Not only patient's serum but also pleural effusion could examine by immunological test. Commercially available anti-parasite antibody screening test is including Paragomimus spp. In Japan, egg-detection rate among paragonimiasis patients nowadays is low; for example 51.2% in sputum and 53.8% in BALF [66] , 66.7% in bronchoscopic aspirate [397, 399] . After a definitive diagnosis is made, oral treatment should be started. The type of treatment to be selected, outpatient or hospital treatment, depends on the patient's general condition. However, usually, outpatient treatment is possible. In patients having pleural effusion, pleural fluid must be extensively drained off before starting chemotherapy [400] (BIII). In patients with chronically encapsulated pleural effusion, surgery is required [401] (CIII). ---Drugs to be recommended---A First choice (same dose for adults and children) -Praziquantel, oral, 25 mg/kg/3 times a day, 2e3 days [402] (AIII) -A. lumbricoides, A. duodenale, N. americanus The larvae of these parasites pass through the lung in the human body, causing asthma-or pneumonia-like symptoms such as transient fever, cough, and dyspnea. On chest X-ray, transient nodular/infiltrative shadows are observed. Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or elevated serum total IgE. Previously, the condition was called Loffler syndrome. Currently, it is classified as simple pulmonary eosinophilia in the category of PIE syndrome [402] . Symptoms appear 1e2 weeks after the oral ingestion of A. lumbricoides embryonated eggs. The latency period of percutaneous infection with N. americanus larvae or percutaneous/oral infection with A. duodenale larvae is approximately 10 days. Larvae appeared in the small intestine penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the portal vein, migrate through liver to heart/lung. Larvae penetrate the human skin transfer to the lung with blood flow. Then these larvae migrate up the bronchi and trachea, over the epiglottis, down the esophagus/stomach, and reach the small intestine. In the intestine the larvae develop into mature adults [403] . Simple pulmonary eosinophilia related to parasites spontaneously resolved in a few weeks. In many cases, a definitive diagnosis is made based on parasite eggs detected on a stool examination, although larvae are sometimes detected in sputum [403] . ---Drugs to be recommended---A First choice (same dose for adults and children) -Pyrantel pamoate, oral, 10 mg/kg/single-dose administration * Dry syrup for children is available. * This drug is effective for adult worms in the intestinal tract, but not for larvae migrating in the human body. Therefore, a stool examination should be performed 2 weeks after oral administration. If parasite eggs are detected, additional administration should be conducted. <> Second choices (same dose for adults and children) -Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/single-dose administration -Mebendazole, oral, 100 mg/twice a day, 3 days, or 500 mg/single-dose administration -Ivermectin, oral, 150e200 mg/kg/single-dose administration (after fasting) -S. stercoralis In Japan, S. stercoralis is distributed in Nansei Islands, chain of islands extending from southwestern Kyushu to northern Taiwan. There are few young persons newly infected with S. stercoralis, but the incidence of infection is high in elderly persons [404] . Internationally, S. stercoralis is widely distributed in tropical/subtropical areas. Not only domestic infection but also Japanese travel to endemic area possible to infect with this parasite. Foreign patients from endemic areas, strongyloidiasis always considered when a patient has respiratory symptoms and/or lung lesions with eosinophilia. S. stercoralis percutaneously infects humans. Larvae penetrate the human skin transfer to the lung with blood flow. Then these larvae migrate up the bronchi and trachea, over the epiglottis, down the esophagus/stomach, and reach the small intestine. In the intestine the larvae develop into mature adults. Parasite eggs delivered by adults are hatched while descending the intestinal tract, and larvae excreted in stools. Some larvae developed to infective form again invade/transfer through the mucosa around the anus, maintaining a life cycle in the human body. Such a mode of infection is termed autoinfection. With the transfer of larvae to the lung, asthma-or pneumonia-like symptoms, such as transient fever, cough, and dyspnea, appear, as indicated for simple pulmonary eosinophilia related to A. lumbricoides, A. duodenale, or N. americanus. On chest X-ray, transient nodular/infiltrative shadows are observed. Many patients show peripheral blood eosinophilia and/or an increase in the total IgE level. In immunocompromised patients, suppressing the cellmediated immunity such as ATL patients, HIV/AIDS patients, those receiving immunosuppressive drugs, the number of S. stercoralis increases through acceleration of autoinfection, and larvae are disseminated in various organs, leading to a severe condition (disseminated strongyloidiasis). In such cases, stridor, bloody sputum, tachypnea, protein-losing gastroenteritis, ileus, and mobile exanthema are observed. Furthermore, severe pneumonia related to enteric bacteria disseminated with larvae, lung abscess, or bacterial meningitis concomitantly occurs [403] . A diagnosis is made based on S. stercoralis larvae detected in stools/sputum. Immunological diagnosis is also useful [403] . ---Drugs to be recommended---A First choice (same dose for adults and children) -Ivermectin, oral, 200 mg/kg/single-dose administration (after fasting), additional administration at the same dose after 2 weeks (AI) * Repeated administration must be considered in cases of disseminated strongyloidiasis [405] . * A study reported that transrectal or percutaneous administration was useful in patients in whom oral administration was difficult due to digestive symptoms [406] . <> Second choice (same dose for adults and children) -Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/twice a day, 7 days (BI) -T. canis, T. cati Infection to humans occurs through the oral ingestion of the embryonated eggs of T. canis or T. cati [407] . It also occurs through the consumption of beef/chicken liver or meat contaminated with larvae as a raw or insufficiently heated food. This is considered to be a dominant route of infection in Japan [407] . As humans are not definitive host for T. canis and T. cati, they do not become adults in the human body [408] . Larvae invading the human body transfer to various organs with blood flow through the intestinal mucosa. Target organs are the lung, liver, eyes, and central nervous system including spinal cord. Toxocariasis is a typical larva migrans. Lesions are often observed in the lung/liver (visceral larva migrans). There are few symptoms, or nonspecific symptoms are present. In many cases, a diagnosis is made based on peripheral blood eosinophilia and multiple nodular shadows of the lung or liver on CT. Ocular or central nervous symptoms appear in some patients. It is impossible to make a diagnosis on a stool examination due to larva migrans. Immunological diagnosis is useful. After a definitive diagnosis is made, treatment should be started. When visceral larva migrans is asymptomatic, follow-up may be continued. ---Drugs to be recommended---A First choice (same dose for adults and children) -Albendazol, oral, 5 mg/kg/2 or 3 times a day, 4e8 weeks [409] (BIII) * This drug should be taken with meals for 28 days. A 14-day period of discontinuation should be established and then restarted drug if required. <> Second choices (same dose for adults and children) -Albendazol, oral, 400 mg/twice a day, 5 days [410] (BIII) -Mebendazole, oral, 100e200 mg/twice a day, 5 days [411] (CIII) -W. bancrofti, B. malayi W. bancrofti and B. malayi are called lymphatic filaria. Infection occurs when these parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The pathogenesis of lymphatic filariasis is relate to structural and functional abnormality of lymphatic channels induced by parasitized adult worms. Infection with W. bancrofti is characterized by febrile attacks, lymphedema/elephantiasis, hydrocele, and chyluria. In patients infected with B. malayi, neither hydrocele nor chyluria is observed, and lymphedema of the lower limbs/ elephantiasis are localized in the lower thighs. Microfilaria produced by adult worms is not pathogenic, but rarely induces allergic reactions in the lung, contributing to tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) [403] . This condition shows a chronic course, differing from simple pulmonary eosinophilia. Cough, dyspnea, and stridor with exacerbation at night are observed. Fever, malaise, and weight loss are noted in some patients. On chest X-ray, bilateral reticular nodular lesions are detected. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and an increase in the anti-filaria antibody titer are observed. In case of TPE, no microfilaria is detected [403] . If treatment is not performed, the condition may gradually exacerbate. It is important to adequately make a diagnosis for the differentiation of this disease. In the world, 130,000,000 persons are infected with lymphatic filaria, but TPE occurs in less than 0.5% of these. The risk of this disease in travelers is unclear, and most patients consist of foreign persons from endemic areas [412] . ---Drugs to be recommended---A First choice (same dose for adults and children) -Diethylcarbamazine, 2 mg/kg/3 times a day, 12 days * In cases of malayan filariasis, marked side effects, such as digestive symptoms, fever, lymphangitis/ lymphadenitis, and orchitis/epididymitis, may appear. Therefore, a half dose (1 mg/kg) should be administered 3 times a day for 12 days [413] . -D. immitis D. immitis parasitize in the dog right ventricle and pulmonary artery, where mature female worms produce microfilaria that circulate in peripheral blood. Infection to humans is mediated by microfilaria-ingesting mosquitoes. D. immitis larvae in human subcutaneous tissue inserted by mosquito bite, some larvae migrate to the heart and die. Dead worms produce infarcts then they lodge in pulmonary vessels. There are few symptoms [402] . In patients with symptoms, thoracic pain, cough, bloody sputum, stridor, and fever have been reported. Typical chest X-ray findings include solitary coin lesions. In many cases, an abnormal shadow of the chest X-ray is indicated on a health checkup, and D. immitis infection is pathologically diagnosed from a tissue specimen extirpated under a tentative diagnosis of lung cancer. At this point, peripheral blood eosinophilia is rarely observed [403] . ---Drugs to be recommended (same dose for adults and children)----As a diagnosis is made using pathological specimens in many patients, oral treatment is not necessary. -If necessary, diethylcarbamazine at 2 mg/kg should be orally administered 3 times a day for 12 days. ---Precautions for each drug---
