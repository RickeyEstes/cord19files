Using any one of the positive motifs from Table 2 , we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database. Þ is the probability of the amino acids or vectors . in the database. Since we have As a consequence of Eq. (2.13), the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible. For example, according to Table 2 , CC is an attractive motif with D ¼ 2, then  Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event, proteins satisfying N s ðCCÞ40:013376N s ðCÞ, as defined in Eq. (2.15), suddenly become interesting. We can therefore consider the number N s ðCCÞ as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database. Using this same reasoning, one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table 2 to develop detection methods for additional proteins. In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two-residue motifs in Table 2 , we can also use any of the ''negative'' two-residue motifs to develop search methods. For example, the CM pair is a ''negative'' two-residue ''word'' with D ¼ 2. That is, pðCMÞo2 mÀ2s pðCÞpðMÞ. Using identical arguments to those described in Section 2.3, we obtain N O ðCMÞo0:013376N O ðMÞ and N O ðCMÞo0:008512N O ðCÞ. Since both N s ðMÞ and N s ðCÞ are small numbers for fixed proteins, the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero. Therefore, we can also use any of the remaining seven ''negative'' motifs in Table 2 to develop additional detection methods. Having developed a formal approach to the search for interesting amino acid pairs in protein sequences, we now discuss its application in the detection of specific diseases. In our first example, we will focus on developing detection methods for the Coronavirus responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [23] .
