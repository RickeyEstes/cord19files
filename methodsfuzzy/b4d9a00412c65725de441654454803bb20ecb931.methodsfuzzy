These sequences are being acquired and annotated and the result of translation of genomic sequence information. All sequences in this study were obtained from NCBI accession: txd2697049, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/?term=txid2697049). Using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo), the protein sequences were combined into a single protein FASTA database (2019-nCOVpFASTA1; Supplemental Information), and added to human proteome sequences (UniProt SwissProt Human database; downloaded 2/15/2020) to produce a database including both human and COVID-19 protein sequences (Human_plus_2019-nCOVpFASTA2; Supplemental Information). For SRM transitions, the 2019-nCOVpFASTA1 (Supplemental Information) was imported into Skyline v20.1.0.28 (University of Washington) along with the PROSIT tryptic peptide spectral library. Peptide settings and transitions were optimized within Skyline to reflect the vendor optimization requirements. For Agilent systems, the 20ms default dwell time was selected for the transition settings. For SCIEX instruments, the same dwell time was utilized as well as automatic optimization of the declustering potential and compensation voltage from the transition settings menu. For Waters, Thermo, and Shimadzu systems, no further settings were required for transition list generation. All transition lists were exported as unscheduled 15min methods. For PRM methods, three peptides were selected for each protein due to the increased time per scan relative to SRM methods. Instrument-specific Skyline files are included in the Supplemental information as described in Table 1. interface can accept a maximum of 5,000 amino acids. In order to analyze YP_009724389.1 the predicted sequence had to be divided into five sequences, using a 100 amino acid overlap to avoid disrupting potential large motifs. The results of ModPred were compiled into a single spreadsheet with all modifications of all confidence levels. A second sheet was created that contained only the high confidence PTMs predicted, as well as a final summary for the counting of predicted high confidence PTM occurrence, provided as Supplemental Material as described in Table 1 . To widen use of our developed methods, we used the Skyline software to create transition lists optimized specifically for each of the Skyline-compatible triple quadrupole instruments. While minor modifications are required for SCIEX, Agilent, and Shimadzu instruments, Waters Xevo and Thermo instruments use identical parameters for transition list design. Most modern triple quadrupole instruments are capable of 500 SRMS/sec and fully permit the use of 2,000 transition lists, as provided here. For older instruments that lack this scan speed or that require higher dwell times, the transition lists included in the supplemental methods may be reduced by the end user accordingly. PRM methods monitor multiple transitions simultaneously but at a time cost. The highest scan speed currently available in Orbitrap instruments is 48 scans per second and is only available on the Exploris 480 system (data not shown). In order to achieve maximum sensitivity, higher fill times are often required for these instruments. We chose to utilize three peptides/protein for these methods. Alternative peptides can be selected from the Skyline files provided (Supplemental Information) or by selecting peptide mass targets from the other transition lists.  The Prosit spectral libraries (Supplemental Material) enable the interrogation of DIA data and may be used for DDA experiments that employ tools such as the MSPepSearch (NIST). 51 DDA data requires only the protein FASTA file and a list of PTMs that may be present in the sample. Our analysis using ModPred predicted 17 possible PTMs (Figure 1) . Amidation was the most frequent predicted PTM, but there is no known biological mechanism that we could derive from a survey of the literature. Palmitoylation, the second most frequent predicted PTM, is a well characterized viral PTM with critical functions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human herpes virus (HHV), and influenza virus infectivity.
