P. Kumar Rai and J.S. Singh Ecological Indicators 111 (2020) 106020 Phragmites australis is observed to remediate the health hazardous organic contaminants (Benzimidazole anthelmintics) from the environment (Podlipn√° et al., 2013) Several IAPS act as sources for bio-energy, animal feed, bio-polymers, and in augmenting the green economy . Spartina alterniflora, an IAPS, has been demonstrated to act as a potent tool for carbon sequestration in bio-energy industry, besides acting as the bio-agent for heavy metals phytoremediation (Liao et al., 2007; Prabakaran et al., 2019) . Aquatic ecosystems also comprise numerous IAPS (Table 1, Table 2 ) with potential phyto-technological implications that need special attention for the biotechnological innovation through phytoremediation technologies (Rai, 2008; Rai, 2009; Rai, 2010; Singh and Rai, 2016; Hussner et al., 2017; Rai, 2018a,b; Rai, 2019; Rai et al., 2020) . Prosopis juliflora, besides acting as multi-purpose IAPS can assist in phytoremediation of fluoride, in conjunction with iron oxide nanoparticles (Kumari and Khan, 2018) . Detailed studies on eco-technological prospects of certain IAPS, may assist in the formulation of suitable rehabilitation and restoration strategies. Melaleuca quinquenervia and Lygodium microphyllum introduced in the environment of southern Florida, were used for investigating the ecosystem attributes in invasion success and conceptualizing an eco-restoration model (Doren et al., 2009 ).
