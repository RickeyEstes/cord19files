The most comprehensive description of effective prophylactic measures against rinderpest was provided by Lancisi (1654-1720) which is still valid for most of the infectious diseases and have been adopted by the OIE. The key prophylactic methods suggested include sanitary measures, quarantine, slaughter and compensation and, destruction of carcasses and infected materials (Blancou, 2006) . Since rinderpest in cattle was somewhat similar to smallpox in humans, it was assumed that like small pox, it could be controlled by variolation. Several such trials were conducted in Europe during 1711-1767, but it was realized that rinderpest inoculation could be dangerous and should not be practiced in disease free herds (Taylor et al., 2006) . However, Layard (1757) made an interesting observation: if distemper was in the neighborhood of a herd, it prevented the animals against rinderpest, probably due to cross protection provided by distemper causing agent against rinderpest [reviewed in reference ]. Methods other than inoculations were also taken into consideration to protect cattle from rinderpest. Peter Camper tried inoculations with lung fragments containing small worm, which he found in dead animals and believed that these worms might harbour the causative agent of the disease (Leclainche, 1955) . While such inoculation trials were continued, experts realized that stamping-out was not possible with free ranging animals. In 1896, Koch tried bile from rinderpest infected animals for inoculation but it increased the spread of the disease rather its prevention. Inoculation of the serum obtained from recovered animals resulted in protection of recipient from rinderpest (Koole and Turner, 1897) . In 1917-18, Dr. William Hutchins developed an early vaccine for rinderpest which was based on organ extracts of treated animals . A major breakthrough was achieved in 1920 when Dr. J. T. Edward, Director at Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory Mukteswar, India, developed an effective vaccine for rinderpest through attenuation of the virus by serial passages (600 times) in goats. The vaccine provided longlasting immunity against rinderpest in cattle and buffaloes without any side effects. The shelf life of live-attenuated PPRV vaccine is 1 year at 4 C (Sen et al., 2010) . Since the PPRV vaccine is mostly required for use in hot and humid climate in South Asia and Africa (Begum et al., 2016) , therefore, maintenance of cold chain is essentially required for transportation of the vaccine in the field which significantly increases the overall cost of vaccine package. To circumvent the problem of cold chain maintenance, a range of improved freeze-drying methods have been developed to enhance the thermostabilty of the PPR vaccine. Mariner et al. developed a lyophilized Vero cell-adapted rinderpest vaccine, stabilized with lactalbumin hydrolysate and sucrose, wherein the moisture content of vaccine was greatly reduced, thereby increasing the thermostability of the TCRV vaccine (Mariner et al., 1990) . Similarly, Worrall et al. developed a rapid method of dehydration and preservation of live attenuated PPRV vaccine (Xerovac) wherein the virus was diluted 1:1 with a sterile 5% w/v aqueous solution of trehalose dehydrate and then subjected to drying by simple dehydration. The resulting vaccine was able to resist 45 C for a period of 14 days without any major loss of potency (Worrall et al., 2000) . Silva tried various strategies to increase the thermostability of PPR vaccines (i) use of Tris/ trehalose to increase the virus half-life in liquid formulation (21 h at 37 C and 1 month at 4 C) (ii) Tris/trehalose also enhanced the thermostability of the lyophilized PPR vaccine wherein viral titers were maintained for relatively longer time [0.6 log loss at 4 C in 21 months, 0.6 log loss at 37 C in 144 h and 1 log loss at 45 C in 120 h] (iii) replacing fructose with glucose enhanced intrinsic PPRV vaccine stability in terms of higher stability and higher virus production (1 log increase) (iv) increasing concentrations of NaCl facilitated the release of the virus from infected cells and reduced the cell-associated fraction of the virus (Silva et al., 2011 (Silva et al., , 2014 . Heavy water has also been reported to increase thermostability of polio (Wu et al., 1995) and yellow fever vaccines (Adebayo et al., 1998) . In order to further increase the thermostability of the PPR vaccines, combinations of stabilizers and heavy water were also explored. Reconstituted PPRV/Jhansi vaccine stabilized at 4-25 C using stabilizer E (trehalose, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride) could maintain the protective titers up to 48 h. When reconstituted with diluents containing NaCl and MgSO 4 , at 37 C, the protective titers were maintained up to 42 h [reviewed in reference (Sen et al., 2010) ]. Vaccine based on deuterated virus has also been developed wherein the virus was grown in cell culture media containing 20% heavy water and the vaccine diluents containing 87% heavy water and 1 M MgCl 2 . On exposure at 37 C and 40 C, deuterated PPRV vaccine maintained titers greater than 10 2.5 TCID 50 /ml until 28 days as compared to conventional PPR vaccine which could maintain titers only for 14 days. Combination of heavy water/ MgCl 2 was found to be better reconstituting diluent than heavy water alone for both the deuterated and conventional PPR vaccines (Sen et al., 2010) . However, such vaccines have only marginal advantages in terms of thermostability (Table 1) . Success of the PPR control program will depends largely on effective delivery of the vaccine in hot and humid climate (Asia/Africa), therefore there is a need for further research on the development of a thermostable PPR vaccine.
