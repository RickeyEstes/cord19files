Computational analyses. The SARS-CoV À1 PRF signal was identified from the complete genome sequence, using a combined approach. First, a pattern matching descriptor of known À1 PRF signals was used in conjunction with RNAMotif [12] to identify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the frameshift signal's slippery site. Second, Pknots [13] was employed to ''fold'' the sequence immediately downstream (39) to the slippery site and to produce a predicted MFE value in kilocalories per mole for the sequence. The statistical significance of the predicted MFE value of the threestemmed RNA pseudoknot was tested by generating 500 randomly shuffled sequences derived from the native sequence, refolding each of these, and calculating their MFE values using Pknots. This resulted in a normal distribution of MFE values, against which the native sequence could be compared and z-scores calculated. FASTA3 v3.4 [40] was used to initially identify sequences homologous to the SARS À1 PRF signal based on primary sequence similarity. The search space included 1,724 viral genome sequences downloaded using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Entrez Taxonomy Browser [41] . The resulting pairwise alignments produced by FASTA3 were used to produce a multiple-sequence alignment using ClustalW v1.82 [42] . An unrooted phylogenetic tree was created from this alignment and visualized using Tree View v1.6.6 [43] . Strains, genetic methods, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting assays. Escherichia coli strain DH5a was used to amplify plasmids, and E. coli transformations were performed using the high-efficiency transformation method of Inoue et al. [44] . YPAD and a synthetic complete medium (HÀ) were used as described previously [45] . Yeast strain JD932 (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 can1-100) and the JD1228/JD1229 isogenic pairs in which the disrupted RPL3/TCM1 allele is complemented with pRPL3 or pmak8-1 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 trp1d leu2 = his3 RPL3::HIS3) [21] were used for in vivo measurements of À1 PRF. Yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method [46] . Dual luciferase assays for programmed ribosomal frameshifting in yeast were performed as previously described [19] . African green monkey Vero cells were cultured in DMEM with L-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Maine, United States) and 10% FBS at 37 8C in 5% CO 2 . Cells cultured without antibiotics were transformed with plasmid DNA, using Amaxa (Cologne, Germany) Nucleofector solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dual luciferase assays were performed the following day, using extracts from cells lysed with the Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual-Luciferase Reporter System, Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, United States). Wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysates from Ambion (Austin, Texas, United States) were used to monitor frameshifting in vitro, using synthetic mRNA transcripts (Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit), generated with T7 polymerase either from plasmids that had been digested with SspI, Proteinase K treated, phenol/chloroform and chloroform extracted, and ammonium acetate precipitated, or from PCR amplicons encompassing the dual luciferase reporter cassettes. All assays were repeated until the data were normally distributed, enabling statistical analyses both within and between experiments [25] . At least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used. Oligonucleotides, plasmid construction, and mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by IDT (Coralville, Iowa, United States). These are listed in Table 1 . The SARS-sense and SARS-antisense oligonucleotides were annealed, gel purified, and ligated into BamHI-and SacI-digested p2luc [18] , generating plasmid pJD435. The Renilla and firefly bicistronic elements were amplified by PCR using previously described primers [19] , SpeI-and XhoIdigested, and cloned into p416ADH [47] . One additional base was introduced after the BamHI restriction site, using the Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States) QuikChange XL kit to correct the reading frame. Sequence analysis revealed an additional point mutation in the firefly luciferase gene that was reverted by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting plasmid, pJD465, constituted the wild-type SARS-CoV À1 PRF yeast assay plasmid. A zero-frame control plasmid, pJD474, was constructed by adding one cytosine residue upstream of the BamHI restriction site of pJD465. Additional constructs with various mutations in the pseudoknot were made; the 59 portion of stem 3 was changed from GCGGCACAG to CGCCGAGAC (pJD467, also known as S3A), and this was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary mutation in the 39 half of stem 3, CUGAUGUCGU to GUCUACGGCG (pJD479, S3B). The control construct with just the changes in the 39 portion of stem 3 was made from pJD465 (pJD567, S3A9). pJD465 was also used as the template for mutagenesis to move the A13456 residue out of stem 3 and into loop 2 (pJD492, S3C) and to make the change A13456C (pJD544, S3C9), while pJD467 was used to eliminate stem 3 entirely (pJD469, DS3). Stem 2 was also subjected to mutagenesis: the 59 portion of stem 2 was changed from GCCCG to CGGGC (pJD466, S2A), and this in turn was the template for mutagenesis to make the complementary sequence in the 39 half of stem 2, CAGGGC to GACCCG (pJD480, S2B). pJD465 was used as the template to create a construct in which the bulged A13467 residue in stem 2 was eliminated by moving it 6 nt downstream (pJD491, S2C) or replaced by cytosine (pJD542, S2C9). An additional set of plasmids was constructed from the parental plasmids described above that lacked the yeast-specific markers but contained the SV40 early promoter, T7 promoter, and SV40 late poly (A) signal. These were used for programmed ribosomal frameshifting analyses in epithelial cells, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The BamHI and EcoRI fragment from pJD465 was purified and ligated into BamHI-and EcoRI-digested p2luc [18] to generate the test plasmid pJD502. A zero-frame control plasmid (pJD464) was constructed by cloning the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pJD465 into p2luci. Similarly, BamHI and EcoRI fragments from the yeast plasmids described above were cloned into p2luc to generate a complete plasmid set for analyses of -1 PRF in epithelial cells (pJD503/S2A, pJD538/S2A9, pJD541/S2B9, pJD504/S2C, pJD537/S2C9, pJD487/S3A, pJD536/S3A9, pJD488/S3B, pJD506/S3C, pJD539/S3C9, and pJD490/DS3). An additional construct (A13465G) was made to control for the change at this position from adenine to guanine that prevents the creation of a termination codon in S2B9 constructs, but is not involved in stem 2 basepairing (pJD540 for Vero cells and pJD545 as the yeast plasmid). Nuclease analysis. The SP6SARS and revSARS oligonucleotides were used to generate a PCR amplicon from which an RNA transcript was made using the Ambion MEGAscript SP6 kit. The RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and 59 end labeled with [c-32 P]ATP, using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled RNA was gel purified and then eluted with 0.5 M NH 4 Ac, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS. Nuclease treatment with RNase A (1.0-0.01 ng), RNase T1 (1.0-0.01 U), and RNase V1 (0.1-0.001 U) from Ambion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for 15 min at room temperature. Digested RNA was electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a Storm PhosphoImager (Sunnyvale, California, United States). Preparation of RNA samples for NMR. A DNA construct (residues 13405-13472 of the SARS-CoV genome) was generated by PCR from pJD465 containing the wild-type SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot sequence. Two oligodeoxynucleotides (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) were designed with a 59 primer, including a T7 promoter sequence. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a pUC18 plasmid. To prepare milligram quantities of the SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot (residues 13405-13472), 7.5-to 20-ml in vitro transcription reactions with phage T7 polymerase from a linearized plasmid template were performed [48] . Unlabeled NTPs were purchased from Sigma Pharmaceuticals (South Croydon, United Kingdom), and labeled NTPs were purified from Methylophilus methylotropus (ATCC 53528, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States) bacteria grown on labeled medium with 15 N-ammonium sulfate and 13 C-methanol [49] . After 4-5 h incubation at 37 8C, the reaction was spun down to remove traces of precipitated pyrophosphate. RNA transcripts were purified by anionexchange FPLC with two HiTrap Q columns (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris (pH 8) at room temperature. The target RNA sample was eluted with an increasing sodium chloride gradient. Pure fractions were concentrated using a CentriPrep YM10 (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) concentrator, passed through a NAP25 column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with NMR buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate [pH 6.5], 200 mM potassium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA [ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt], 0.02% sodium azide, 5% deuterium oxide), and concentrated to 0.2-2 mM, using a CentriPrep YM10 concentrator (Millipore). The identity of the RNA product was verified by mass spectroscopy, as well as agarose and TBE-Urea-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States) gels. NMR spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were recorded at 5 8C, 15 8C, and 25 8C on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer (Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a standard 5-mm triple axis pulsed field gradient 1 H/ 13 C/ 15 N probehead optimized for proton detection. NMR experiments were performed on samples of 500-ll volume containing 0.2-2 mM SARS-CoV frameshift pseudoknot RNA. Data were processed using NMRPipe [50] and analyzed using NMRVIEW [51] . One-dimensional imino proton spectra were acquired using a jump-return echo sequence. The observable iminos in aqueous solution are diagnostic for hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil bases, which are protected from exchange with the solvent. Imino resonances were assigned sequence-specificity from water flip-back, WATERGATE 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) [52] spectra (s mix = 200 ms), and a jump-return [53] 1 H, 15 N-heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) [54] . Elucidation of basepairing and secondary structure was verified from scalar 2h J(N,N) couplings through hydrogen bonds in the quantitative J(N,N) HNN correlation spectroscopy (COSY) data [55, 56] .
