Cells, viruses: BHK-21 cells and MARC-145 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C with 5% CO2. For the maintenance of infected MARC-145 cells, 10% FBS was replaced by 2% horse serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). The PRRSV-1 strain (SD01-08) was used in the following experiments. SD01-08 was isolated in 2001 in the US and subsequently used to construct full-length cDNA infectious clones (Fang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013) . Antibodies: All PRRSV-1 specific antibodies used in this study were targeted to the strain SD01-08. Monoclonal antibodies (α-nsp2 mAbs and polyclonal antibody (pAb) against the PLP2 domain were generated as described in our previous studies Li et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2016) . The pAb specifically recognizes the TF peptide of nsp2TF was generated by GenScript Biotech Corporation (Piscataway, NJ) as we described previously . A panel of six specific anti-phosphorylated serine (pSer) mAbs was from a phosphoserine detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The secondary antibodies, IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) and IRDye 680RD-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), were purchased from Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE), while Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa-594 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). The antitubulin mAb (B-7) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Mass spectrometric analysis: PRRSV nsp2-related proteins were pulled down from PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells by immunoprecipitation (IP) as described previously . Virus-infected or mock-infected cells were harvested in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). To remove non-specifically bound proteins, cell lysates were precleared with protein A Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) and a non-specific mouse mAb at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. After brief centrifugation, cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing mAb #36-19 and fresh Sepharose CL-4B beads. The mAb-protein complex was incubated with constant rotation at 4°C overnight. The sepharose beads were washed six times with wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), followed by six washes with MiliQ water. Bound proteins were eluted and denatured in 2x Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95°C for 10 min. PRRSV nsp2-related proteins were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel, fixed, and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Bands corresponding to PRRSV nsp2 and nsp2TF were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Phosphorylation analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Analysis Facility by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC/ MS/MS) on a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Immuno-detection of phosphorylated nsp2-related proteins and assessment of protein mobility in SDS-PAGE: Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). A manufacturer recommended protocol was applied for phosphorylation immuno-detection using specific anti-pSer mAbs. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% BSA (MP Biochemical, Solon, OH), 1% PVP-10 (polyvinyl-pyrrolidone) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1% PEG 3500 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as blocking buffer and antibody diluent. NC membranes were blocked for 2 h at RT and incubated with diluted primary antibody for 1 h at RT. After three washes with 1x PBST (0.05% Tween-20), membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min at RT. Following three washes with 1x PBST (0.05% Tween-20), protein bands were visualized using an Odyssey Fc imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) . Equivalent incubation and wash procedures were applied to membranes after a second incubation with antibodies against nsp2-related proteins. To assess differential mobilities of phosphatase-treated proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins bound to Sepharose beads in the IP process were dephosphorylated using Lambda Protein Phosphatase (λPP) (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) at 30°C for 2 h. In control samples, λPP was replaced by an equal volume of water. Migration of nsp2-related proteins after treatment was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the methods described previously Shang et al., 2017) . PRRSV reverse genetics for generating recombinant viruses: Site-directed mutations were introduced into the coding region of nsp2related proteins of a PRRSV SD01-08 full-length cDNA infectious clone, pCMV-SD01-08, as described previously (Li et al., 2013) . To recover the cloned virus, BHK-21 cells were transfected with the cDNA infectious clone of the wild type (WT) virus or its mutant. Transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h post transfection, cell culture supernatant was harvested and designated as passage 0 (P0) of the virus. In vitro growth characterization of recombinant viruses: Each recombinant virus was serially passaged on MARC-145 cells 4 times. At each passage, cells were infected by each virus at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01. Virus titers were measured by fluorescent-focus assay on MARC-145 cells and calculated as fluorescent focus units per mL (FFU/mL) using the method described previously . The specific mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the entire nsp2 region. In vitro growth kinetics of WT and mutant viruses (P0) were determined by infecting MARC-145 cells at 0.01 moi. Supernatants of infected cells were collected at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-infection (hpi) and virus titers were measured by fluorescent-focus assay as described previously . Plaque morphologies of the WT and mutant viruses were compared by a plaque assay as described previously . Fluorescent images were taken under a confocal microscope (Nikon A1R HD25, Nikon). In vitro transcription: The plasmid DNA of full-length cDNA infectious clone pSD01-08 (Fang et al., 2006) was linearized by XbaI, and the digested DNA was extracted using phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation method. Linearized DNA (2 μg) was used as template for in vitro RNA transcription. In vitro transcription was performed in 50 μl reaction condition at 37°C for 2 h: 5 μl RNAPol Reaction Buffer (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 5 μl ATP (10 mM), 5 μl UTP (10 mM), 5 μl CTP (10 mM), 2.5 μl GTP (10 mM) (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 7.5 μl m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G RNA Cap Structure Analog (10 mM) (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 μl T7 RNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 μg linearized infectious clone plasmid, 2 μl RNaseOUT™ RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Then, 2 μl TURBO™ DNase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added into the reaction system to digest DNA templates for 30 min at 37°C. Newly transcribed RNAs were purified by NucAway™ Spin Columns (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instruction. Subsequently, in vitro transcribed RNAs (1.5 μg) were transfected into BHK-21 cells using Lipofectamine™ MessengerMAX™ Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 1:4 ratio of genomic RNA to MessengerMAX. Cell lysate and supernatant were collected at 18 post transfection (hpt). Genomic and subgenomic viral RNA quantification: For RNA quantification, cellular total RNAs were extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Equal amounts (1.5 μg) of total RNAs were reverse transcribed using the Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plus-strand genomic RNA, plus-strand subgenomic RNA, and minus-strand genomic/subgenomic RNA were reverse transcribed in three different reactions using three different primers (Table S1 , Fig. S3 ). Real-time PCR was performed in 20 μl reactions containing 10 μl TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), 0.25 μl forward primer (40 μM), 0.25 μl reverse primer (40 μM), 0.4 μl Taqman probe (10 μM), 2 μl cDNA, 7.1 μl H 2 0. Primer/probe sets were synthesized by Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma, CA). PCR reactions were performed on a CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The PCR protocol was selected based on TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix user's instructions: 50°C UNG incubation for 2 min, 95°C polymerase activation for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation cycles at 95°C for 3 s and annealing/extention at 60°C for 30 s. The relative accumulation ratio of RNAs was quantified by the threshold cycle ( ΔΔ CT) method (Pfaffl, 2007; Rao et al., 2013) . To precisely quantify RNA accumulation and to rule out possible background interference from initial transfected RNA, we constructed a replicationdefective mutant, in which the nucleotide sequence from 495 nt to 515 nt was replaced with 7 consecutive stop codons to terminate translation of nonstructural polyproteins. The (+) gRNA detected from BHK-21 cells transfected with the defective mutant (+) gRNA was designated as background. For (+) gRNA quantification, the background signal derived from transfection was first subtracted. Sequence analysis and protein structure prediction: Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the built-in ClustalW program of CLC Main Workbench 8.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Intrinsic disorder prediction was conducted using multiple online programs including Pondr-FIT (Xue et al., 2010) , Pondr VL-XT (Bomma et al., 2012) , DISOPRED3 (Jones and Cozzetto, 2014) , MobiDB 3.0 (Piovesan et al., 2017) , and metaPrDOS (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2008) . Protein secondary structure profiles and tertiary structure predictions were generated by homology modeling using I-TASSER (Yang et al., 2015) . For homology modeling, no template models were provided as input. Each PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 species member sequence was modeled independently, and a consensus secondary structure profile was generated based on these predictions. Models with C-scores better than −3.0 were assessed further and grouped by overall structural similarity. Ab initio models for each sequence were also generated using Quark (Xu and Zhang, 2012) . Predictions were assessed according to I-Tasser/Quark scoring (1-10 scale), with individual residue scores of 4-5 designated as "low-confidence" and 6-10 as "high-confidence". Predicted structural models of similar topology and overall structure were evaluated, aligned and figures were generated using open-source PyMol 1.7 (The PyMol Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7 Schrödinger, LLC). Statistical significance analysis: All data in current study were shown as mean values with standard deviations. Each data represents three replicates. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). P-values were indicated by asterisks in figures. *: P < 0.05, **:P < 0.01, ***:P < 0.001, ****: P < 0.0001, *****: P < 0.00001.
