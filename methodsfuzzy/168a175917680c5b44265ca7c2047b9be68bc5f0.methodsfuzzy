To detect PEDV in wild boar, 287 fecal samples of wild boar were collected at random by hunters in 2010/2011. Those samples were verified as wild boar feces in a previous study (Seo et al., 2012) . The fecal samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to 20% suspensions and centrifuged at 1500g for 20 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, New York, USA). Viral RNA was extracted from filtered fecal suspensions using Viral Gene Spin (Intron Biotechnology, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Korea) as per the manufacturer's manual. For obtaining sequences of partial spike gene, the fecal samples were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing methods. The cDNA was constructed using SuPrimeScript RT Premix (GENETBIO Inc., Daejeon, Korea) with gene-specific reverse primers (5 0 -GGGTGAG-TAATTGTTTACAACG-3 0 ). The PCR amplification of the partial spike gene was conducted by HS Prime Taq premix (GENETBIO Inc., Daejeon, Korea) with the following primers as per the previous publication: [P1: 5 0 -TTCTGAGTCACGAACAGCCA -3 0 , P2: 5 0 -CATA-TGCAGCCTGCTCTGAA-3 0 ] ( Kim et al., 2001) . The thermal cycling program for PCR was as follows: 10 min at 94 C (initial denaturation), 35 cycles with 30 s at 94 C, 30 s at 55 C, and 30 s at 72 C (denaturation, annealing, and extension), 5 min at 72 C (final extension), and a final hold temperature of 4 C. The amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis and target DNA was extracted using a Dokdo-prep gel extraction kit (ELPIS Biotech, Inc., Daejeon, Korea). Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea) sequenced purified DNA fragments using a 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Poster city, CA, USA). Reference sequences of PEDV from domestic boar were obtained from the GenBank database. Sequence alignment of PEDV from wild boar and livestock pigs was performed using MUSCLE, and sequence identities were estimated in BioEdit 7.0 (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A neighbor-joining unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA 6 with the Kimura-2 parameter method with uniform rates variation among sites, and (Tamura et al., 2013) . All positions which contain gaps and missing data were deleted.
