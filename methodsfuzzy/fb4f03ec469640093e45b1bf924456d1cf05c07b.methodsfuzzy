Mice. Most experiments used 5-10-wk-old C57BL/6J (H2 b ) male mice; some experiments used Balb/cByJ (H2 d ) mice or C57BL/6 mice lacking all T cells as a consequence of genetic recombination deleting the TCR-â and ä genes (T cell knockout [KO] mice). All mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Viruses. The Smith strain of MCMV was propagated in vivo in salivary glands of Balb/c mice (14) . Infected salivary gland homogenates were diluted in HBSS (Life Technologies) and, depending on the experiment, mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 3 ϫ 10 3 to 2 ϫ 10 4 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of MCMV, as titrated on mouse embryonic fibroblast monolayers. The Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and its more widely disseminating clone 13 variant were propagated in baby hamster kidney cells, and ‫ف‬ 5 ϫ 10 4 PFUs, as titrated on vero cell monolayers, were used for inoculations (23) . Vaccinia virus (VV), WR strain, was propagated in L929 cells, purified over sucrose gradients, and inoculated at doses of 10 6 PFUs, as titrated on vero cells (24) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A-59, was propagated in L929 cells and, unless otherwise stated, was inoculated into mice at doses of 7 ϫ 10 5 PFUs, as assayed on L929 cell monolayers (25) . Preparation of mAb 1F8 to Ly49H. The amino acid sequences of Ly49 C, I, and H are very similar to each other and differ significantly from other Ly49 molecules (26) . mAb 1F8, a rat IgG2a with high reactivity to Ly49H, was prepared while attempting to generate an Ly49C-specific mAb. F334 rats were inoculated intrasplenically with 100 mg of a KLH-bound Ly49C amino acid sequence (CRPSNETLEYIKREQDRWDSKTKTVLD) that differed from Ly49I by a few amino acids. 1 mo later equal volumes of CFA and 100 mg of the peptide KLH were injected subcutaneously, followed by three additional injections at biweekly intervals. Spleen cells were removed and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells to make mAbs. mAb specificity was screened on Bw5147 cells transfected with Ly49C or Ly49I or on RNK-16 cells transfected with Ly49H. All of the Ly49-specific mAb generated cross-reacted with Ly49 C, I, and H, but mAb 1F8 was the most potent and was useful for depletions in vivo. mAb 1F8 does not recognize Ly49 A, D, or G2. Limitations of this mAb are its cross-reactivity with Ly49 C and I, but it can be used to measure Ly49H by using it in concert with mAb 5E6, which reacts with Ly49 C and I, but not H. Another recently published mAb to Ly49H cross-reacts with Ly49I (27) . To date there is no available mAb that exclusively recognizes Ly49H. Depletion of NK Cells In Vivo. Mice were depleted of NK cells by a single intraperitoneal inoculation of 25-200 g of column-purified mAb 1F8 6-24 h before infection with virus. As controls, mice were inoculated with 100 l PBS containing 200 g of mAb 5E6, which recognizes Ly49 C/I, or with a dose of mAb to NK1.1 (PK136) titrated to eliminate LCMV-induced NK cell but not CTL activity (12) . Some control mice were inoculated with PBS which, as we showed previously, results in MCMV titers indistinguishable from inoculations with mAb to Ly49A, D, G2, or C/I (22) . Isolation of Leukocytes. Spleens were ground between glass microscope slides, and spleen leukocytes were isolated by treatment with 0.84% NH 4 Cl to lyse erythrocytes. Peritoneal cells were isolated by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies). Liver leukocytes were isolated by flushing blood from the liver by injecting media through the portal vein, crushing the liver in a tissue grinder, treating with type II collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and type I DNase (Sigma-31 Daniels et al. Aldrich), and harvesting the leukocyte layer from a metrizamide (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient, as described previously (28) . Immunofluorescence Staining and Intracellular IFN-␥ Assay. Leukocytes were isolated and stained for the intracellular accumulation of IFN-␥ using reagents and the protocol of BD PharMingen. One million cells were cultured in Falcon 96-well U-bottomed plates (Becton Dickinson) with RPMI media (Life Technologies) containing GolgiPlug (BD PharMingen) at 0.2 l per sample in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 500 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 37 Њ C. Unless otherwise stated, data are shown for samples incubated in the absence of PMA and ionomycin. Cells were washed using FACS ® buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated for 15 min at 4 Њ C in 100 l of FACS ® buffer plus 9 l normal mouse serum and 1 l of anti-Fc ␥ II receptor Ab to block nonspecific staining. Cells were washed and incubated at 4 Њ C for 30 min with combinations of anti-NK1.1-PE (BD PharMingen), anti-CD3-PerCP (BD PharMingen), and various anti-Ly49 mAb or isotype controls. These were isotype control mouse (m) IgG2a-FITC (BD PharMingen), isotype control rat (r) IgG2a-FITC (BD PharMingen), anti-Ly49D-FITC (a gift from Dr. John Ortaldo, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD), anti-Ly49G2-FITC (BD PharMingen), anti-Ly49C-biotin (BD PharMingen), and anti-Ly49H (1F8)-FITC produced by us. Samples were washed twice and, if necessary, were incubated with SA-PerCP (BD PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Otherwise they were fixed and permeabilized using 100 l of cytofix/cytoperm solution for 20 min at 4 Њ C. After fixation the samples were washed twice using perm/wash solution (200 l per sample) and stained with rat IgG1-APC mAb to mouse IFN-␥ (BD PharMingen) or with a control rat IgG1-APC (BD PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 Њ C. Samples were then washed two times using perm/ wash and once using FACS ® buffer before being transferred to tubes (model 2008; Falcon) for analysis on either a FACS ® 440 (Becton Dickinson) or a FACStar™ Plus (Becton Dickinson). For these analyses, 60-80,000 events were calculated, ensuring a sizable NK cell population for a valid analysis of NK subsets. All experiments used relevant control mAbs with isotypes equivalent to the anti-Ly49 and anti-IFN-␥ mAb, but in some figures the negative isotype control plots are not shown to maintain clarity and simplicity of the figure.
