A 20 ml aliquot of extraction matrix (size fractionated silica) was added to 1 ml of L6 buffer (8.3 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 83 mM TriseHCl pH 6.4, 36 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), 2% (v/v) Triton-X-100) containing 200 ml of a 10% faecal suspension. After vortexing for 10 s the samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Following centrifugation at 16,000 Â g for 15 s the RNA pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of L2 buffer (8.3 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 83 mM TriseHCl pH 6.4), twice with 1 ml of 70% ethanol and once with 1 ml of acetone. The RNA was dried at 56 C for 5 min and was re-suspended in 50 ml of RNAse-free water containing 15 units of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor (HPRI). Following a 15-min incubation at 56 C the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 Â g for 2 min and the RNA containing supernatant was stored at À80 C. Three different methods of RNA extraction were used to investigate whether the effects of faecal inhibitors could be minimised during the RNA extraction process. Two QIAgen methods, the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit and the QIAamp DNA stool mini kit were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A third method described by Boom et al (van der Hoek et al 1995) was also used. Each of the three methods was also used to extract RNA from FIPV 79-1146 infected cell culture supernatant and from uninfected media as positive and negative controls, respectively. For each sample the P009/P010 RT-PCR assay was run and water controls for the RT and PCR steps were also included. The QIAgen viral RNA mini kit achieved the lowest C T values in the majority of the samples with the QIAgen stool DNA mini kit giving C T values ranging from one to three cycles higher (Table 3) . C T values obtained using the Boom extraction method were inconsistent when compared to the QIAgen methods. The FIPV 79-1146 sample gave a C T value 16 cycles higher than that achieved with the QIAgen viral RNA mini kit, yet in faecal sample 14 it gave almost the same C T value as the QIAgen viral RNA mini kit. In the remaining faecal samples the Boom method gave C T values ranging from two to six cycles higher than the Qiagen methods. Based on these results the QIAgen viral RNA mini kit was chosen as the method of faecal RNA extraction for subsequent work.
