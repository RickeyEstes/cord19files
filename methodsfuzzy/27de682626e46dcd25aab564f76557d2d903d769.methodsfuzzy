Winn-Deen and Iovannisc utilized fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to generate fluorescently labelled LCR products that were then detected on a fluorescent sequencer [100] . As little as 0.5 fmol of fluorescently labelled products could be detected. The main drawback for fluorescent detection is photo-bleaching. Fluorescent detection has been successfully applied in multiplex detection of various SNPs and mutations using various fluorescent probes or the same fluorescent label but with different sized LCR amplicons [53, 57] . Meng et al. developed a fluorescent detection of ligated products on microbeads [101] . In this method, three primers were used. The common downstream primer was phosphorylated and biotinylated at the 5 0 -end and the 3 0 -end respectively. Two allele-specific primers were labeled with two different fluorescent dyes at their 5'end. The ligation products were then captured by streptavidin-coated microbeads. A fluorescent microscope was then used for genotyping based on detected fluorescence signals.
