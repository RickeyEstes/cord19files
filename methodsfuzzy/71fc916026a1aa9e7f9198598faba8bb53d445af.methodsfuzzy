Blood samples were collected from 26 entire pedigree Tekir cats all aged greater than 6 months. One of these cats, from a single cat household, had clinical signs consistent with FIP (fever, weight loss, enlarged abdomen, presence of ascites) and 25 were overtly healthy cats. Three of the 25 healthy cats were living together in a single household (with a history of potential FIP previously in the household), and 22 were stray (outdoor living) village cats all from the same locale. The ages and sexes of these cats are shown in Table 1 . Blood samples were collected from all 26 cats for mRNA FCoV testing by RT-PCR. Anticoagulated (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) blood samples were centrifuged and total RNA was extracted from the centrifuged blood (leukocytes) by using a high pure viral RNA Kit protocol (Roche, catalogue number 1858874, Germany). For the RT reactions, 3 ml of the RNA extract solution was mixed with 3 ml distilled water and 0.5 ml random hexamer primer (Fermentas, Lithuania), incubated at 70 C for 5 min and immediately cooled on ice. Subsequently, a mixture consisting of 2 ml RT-buffer (5Ã‚, Fermentas, Lithuania), 1 ml deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates mix (Fermentas, Lithuania) and 0.5 ml Moloney murine leukaemia virus RT (Fermentas, Lithuania) was added. The reaction mixture was spun down and incubated for 10 min at 25 C and 60 min at 37 C. The enzyme was then inactivated by incubation at 70 C for 5 min. Following reverse transcription, PCR was performed using the primers and methods of Simons et al (2005) . The amplified products were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, visualised by fluorescence in ultraviolet light and the results recorded on Kodak 1D film.
