Animals. The rats were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (250 mg/kg intraperitoneally) injection and their entire tracheas were removed. The tracheas were cut longitudinally through the cartilaginous portion and placed epithelial side up on a stainless-steel grid in individual lo-ml glass vials containing 2 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco's minimal Eagle (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), gentamicin (20 pg/ml), and amphotericin B (2.5 pg/ml). No serum was added to the medium. The vials were placed in 320-ml exposure vessels (five vials per vessel) mounted on a rocking platform in a culture system where, due to the rocking action (12 cycles/min), the epithelial surfaces were intermittently directly exposed to the experimental atmosphere saturated with water vapor, and held at 37Â°C. Four atmospheres were used biologically and chemically filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide (air): filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone (air/O,); 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide (95% 02); and 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone (95% 02/03). The total flow rate of each atmosphere through the exposure vessel was 3 liters/min. Total culture time was 96 hr, with removal of old medium and addition of fresh medium every 24 hr. At the end of the incubation period. the tracheas were placed in 2% glutaraldehyde fixative and 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer (pH 7.4, 385 mOsm). Edxposure atmosphere generation and ozone monitoring. Most of the components of the system which the test atmospheres came in contact with were made from perfluoroalkoxy fluorocarbon (Teflon PFA). A few items were made of glass or type 3 16 stainless steel. The gases (filtered air, vaporized medical grade liquid oxygen, and dry 99.8% carbon dioxide) were introduced into the system at a stable pressure of 0.2 1 kg/cm'. By adjusting the flow rate of the air or oxygen stream to 2.85 liters/ min and mixing with 150 cc/min carbon dioxide, a 5% by volume carbon dioxide atmosphere was maintained in a total tlow rate of 3 liters/min through the air and 95% O2 exposure vessels. The ozone was generated by passing vaporized medical grade liquid oxygen through a silent arc discharge ozonizer to produce 60 ppm ozone in the oxygen. Fifty cubic centimeters per minute of the ozone in oxygen stream was metered into the exposure portion of the system. Flow rates of 2.8 liters/min air or oxygen and 150 cc/min carbon dioxide were added to produce the air/O, or 95% OJO, atmospheres. The exhaust lines from the air/O3 and the 95% 02/03 exposure vessels were connected to the ozone analyzer (Model 1003-AH, Dasibi Environmental Corp.) inlet and exhaust so that 2 liters/min of the atmosphere was circulated through and sampled by the analyzer. The analyzer was calibrated with an absolute ozone photometer (Model loo&PC, Dasibi Environmental Corp.) according to the national reference method for ozone analyzer calibration (Environmental Protection Agency, 1980). During exposures, concentration data from the ozone analyzer were collected every 10 min with a computer-based data acquisition system that was also used to produce statistical reports on the exposure conditions. The desired ozone concentration of I ppm was achieved with a standard deviation of 5% of the mean. High peak excursions of the concentration, which could influence the biological effects more than the mean level, were avoided. Microscopic anal~ais. Transverse sections of the membranous portion of the tracheas were prepared for lightand electron-microscopic examination by means of previously published methods (Nikula et al.. 1988 ). Specimens for quantitative ultrastructure were coded and viewed randomly with a Zeiss Model EM-10 transmission electron microscope, and montages were prepared by photographic enlargement to 4080X on 8 X IO-in. prints. Cell counts were estimated by classifying the cell type of the central 200 nuclear profiles in the specimen. The numerical density (nuclei/mm) was determined by normalizing the cell counts to the length of the corresponding basement membrane measured using a Zeiss Videoplan image analyzer. Statisticalanalysis oj'data. The numerical density data were processed for statistical analysis (one-way analysis of variance and Tukey studentized range method) with SAS software and a VAX 1 l/780 minicomputer. Probability used as criterion for significance was less than 0.05.
