RNA interference mediated by tools like shRNA, ribozymes, and DNAzymes has emerged as an important technology not only to study gene functions but also for therapeutic purpose to manage viral infections and restrict the growth of cancerous cells. The biggest hurdle in the use of these tools is the in vivo delivery to target cells. Major challenges in in vivo delivery of the nucleic acids include their immunogenicity, enzymatic digestion in body fluids, phagocytosis by the immune cells, and renal clearance. Moreover, highly charged nature of nucleic acids does not allow them to cross the cell membrane by free diffusion. Intracellular challenges to the delivery of these molecules include endosomal and lysosomal escape in the cell cytoplasm. Several strategies have been developed for efficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acids which include use of both viral as well as non-viral vectors as the delivery vehicles. With reference to respiratory viruses, numerous studies have been reported for non-viral vector mediated in vivo delivery of siRNA and ribozymes targeting the respiratory virus genome. Cationic systems like liposomes and polymers have been successfully used for systemic administration of siRNA molecules. Liposomal vectors being positively charged can efficiently form a complex with negatively charged effector nucleic acids on one side and interact with negatively charged cell membrane on the other side. The size of the vector also needs to be kept below 100 nm to prevent renal clearance after systemic administration. A polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), could be used as a carrier of shRNA targeted to mRNA encoding PA, PB1, and PB2 protein of influenza A virus. It was observed that shRNAs cloned in pSilencer2.1-U6 puro plasmid vector had a prophylactic effect on the mice infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) when delivered as shRNA-jetPEI complex through intra-tracheal route. However, these complexes could not show any therapeutic efficacy [137] . Another study was done on siRNA designed against gene encoding phosphoprotein of RSV. It was shown that siRNA delivered through intranasal route prior to infection, either naked or in complex with transfection reagent viz. TransIT-TKO reagent, could significantly reduce the viral titer and disease outcome in mice. However, again the effect of siRNA was very low when delivered after virus infection [63] . Alnylam Pharmaceuticals translated the results of study done by Bitko et al. into human trials to evaluate the antiviral activity of the siRNA under the name ALN-RSV01 which has crossed the Phase 2a clinical trial and found to be safe when delivered to healthy human individuals as nasal spray (aerosols) [65] . There are several other reports showing the efficacy of intranasal administration of siRNA in complex with transfection reagents to reduce viral titer in lungs of infected mice and to relieve the symptoms [50, 138] . However, administration of siRNA complexed with polyethyleneimine or other transfection reagent like lipofectamine through intravenous route has also been shown to exert inhibitory effect on the virus replication in lungs of treated mice leading to more than 30% inhibition in the lung virus titer [49, 53, 139, 140] . In the study done by Tompkins et al., the direct intravenous injection of siRNA-oligofectamine in PBS aided the effect of intranasal inoculation of the siRNA complex (targeted to nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase gene) thus reducing the pathogenicity of highly virulent influenza A virus strains [50] . Though PEI and other transfection reagents have been shown as effective carrier of RNAi tools in mice model, these are not feasible for clinical use because of their proinflammatory effect. Li et al. demonstrated that siRNA complexed with carriers like D5W solution and Infasurf solution is safe for clinical use. Intra-tracheal administration of siRNA-D5W solution complex targeted to spike coding gene and NSP12 region of SARS coronavirus (SCV) genome showed efficient inhibition of SCV replication and suppression of SARS like symptoms in monkey model [32] . Apart from the above-mentioned polymer or lipid-based delivery of shRNA, therapeutic RNA molecules can also be delivered through intranasal route in complex with chitosan nanoparticles. In a study done with chitosan nanoparticles, it was shown that intranasal inoculation of chitosan complexed with plasmid encoding shRNA targeted to NS1 gene of RSV could reduce RSV infection and lung pathology in rat model. The complex was also successful in modulating the immune response to RSV infection [141] . The role of ribozymes as therapeutic tool was shown by Motard et al. who designed SOFA-HDV-Rzs targeted to all the mRNA except that of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of influenza A virus. The ribozymes targeted to conserved regions of mRNA corresponding to nucleoprotein and non-structural gene of influenza A virus were found to inhibit virus replication in the lungs of treated mice when delivered intra-nasally in complex with in vivo-jetPEITM. Although the extent of reduction in viral titer in the lungs of infected mice was low, the ribozymes could significantly affect the clinical outcomes of the infected mice [79] . In the same year, another study revealed an approach to manage respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection using ribozymes. The ribozyme was designed against the L gene mRNA of RSV and expressed via an inducible RSV minigenome replicon system which generated pseudovirus particles (defective RSV particles) expressing therapeutic ribozymes. The minigenome system could be induced by actual RSV infection and had the potential to inhibit virus replication when delivered intra-nasally via pseudovirus particles as delivery vehicles [142] . Viral vectors for delivery of RNAi tools for respiratory viruses are relatively less discussed. Baculovirus is one such vector. It is an insect virus vector known for its safety and high packaging capacity. The vector is considered safe as the recombinant baculovirus is replication incompetent in mammalian cell and does not produce immunogenic viral proteins. It is reported that recombinant baculovirus vector could exhibit transient but effective expression of shRNA targeted to influenza A and B virus under in vitro condition. The duration of expression could be increased by insertion of Epstein-Barr virus sequences into the vector [143] . The use of this vector for in vivo expression of RNAi tools needs to be examined. Although RNAi has received significant attention in the basic and applied research related to biological systems, the RNAi associated immune stimulation may pose hurdle in clinical applications. The possibility of innate immune response induced by siRNAs/shRNAs or its delivery vehicles is yet another obstacle that needs to be addressed very carefully [144] [145] [146] . Recent studies have shown that advanced chemically modified RNAi molecules can be designed to trigger less immune response. Furthermore, the potential benefits of immunostimulatory siRNAs can be beneficial in case of viral infections and antagonistic cancers (reviewed in [147] ). In spite of associated innate immune responses, the nucleic acid-based strategies still hold a lot of importance and most of them are currently undergoing various phase of clinical trial. They are not only shown to be effective against viruses, but they have also been used to target non-viral diseases ( Table 1) .
