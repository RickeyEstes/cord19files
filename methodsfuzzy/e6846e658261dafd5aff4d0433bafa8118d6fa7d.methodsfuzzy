Mφ differentiation medium containing IFN-γ and LPS or interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are often used to generate pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) Mφs, respectively, but do not reflect the spectrum of macrophage activation in vivo (36) . To avoid generating Mφs whose IFN-λ sensitivity is influenced by phenotype skewing, monocytes were differentiated for 7 days with GM-CSF or M-CSF alone, as previously described (37, 38) . The resulting Mφ populations are differentially responsive to inflammatory stimuli, and are thus M1-or M2-shifted while maintaining some baseline characteristics of polarized Mφs ( Figure S3) .When compared to monocyte derived DCs (MDDCs) generated using IL-4 and GM-CSF, the resulting Mφs express elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, reduced CD1C, and unlike MDDCs, adhere strongly to culture dishes ( Figure S4 ). M1-and M2-shifted Mφs will be termed GM-Mφs and M-Mφs for the remainder of the manuscript. IFN receptor expression and response to type I and III IFNs was examined in monocytes and Mφs. Mφ differentiation increases the abundance of the type I IFN receptor, IFNAR1 transcript (Figure 2A) , and protein ( Figure 2B ) ∼2-fold as compared to monocytes irrespective of stimulus. IFNLR1 transcript abundance was increased in M-Mφs and GM-Mφs over 30-and 60-fold, respectively. The IFN-λ co-receptor IL10RB was also measured, and was not significantly modulated following macrophage differentiation ( Figure S5 ). Consistent FIGURE 1 | Macrophages but not monocytes are highly IFN-λ3 responsive. To investigate IFN-λ responsiveness, immune cell subsets were magnetically isolated and IFNLR1 expression was quantified by ddPCR (A). Mφ and pDC IFNLR1 expression was significantly higher than monocyte, NK and T cell populations (p < 0.05, n = 8). Time course analysis demonstrated that IFNLR1 expression quickly rises following monocyte plating, reaching a 30× increase at 24 h even in the absence of GM-CSF addition (p < 0.001, n ≥ 5) (B). Similarly, IFNLR1 surface expression during macrophage differentiation (MFI) increased at days 3 and 7 (p < 0.001, n ≥ 5) (C). Isolated immune cell subsets were treated with 100 ng/ml IFN-λ3 for 8 h and the expression of ISGs viperin and ISG15 were examined (n ≥ 7) (D). Consistent with IFNLR1 expression, Mφs and pDCs were highly responsive to IFN-λ3, whereas monocytes and NK cells were not (n ≥ 5). Data are representative of two (B,C) and three independent experiments (A,D). One-way ANOVA (A), Mann-Whitney test (B,D), paired t-test (C), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 (mean ± SE). with gene expression, IFNLR1 protein was absent in monocytes, and increased in GM-Mφs compared to M-Mφs. The IFNLR1 bands at 70 and 45 kDa represent the full length and soluble isoforms of IFNLR1, respectively (24) . To confirm that elevated IFNLR1 expression confers response to IFN-λs, monocytes and Mφs from three healthy subjects were treated with IFN-λ3 for 15 min and STAT1 phosphorylation (Y701) was examined by Western blot. Monocytes did not phosphorylate STAT1 in response to IFN-λ3, whereas both M-Mφs and GM-Mφs were highly sensitive ( Figure 2C ). All cells demonstrated no STAT1 phosphorylation pre-treatment ( Figure S6 ). Mφs were subsequently treated with either interferon-alpha (IFN-α) or IFN-λ3 to determine whether cognate receptor expression defines sensitivity. Following 8 h of IFN-α or IFN-λ3, all measured ISGs were significantly increased by both IFNs (Figure 2D ). M-Mφs were more sensitive to IFN-α, demonstrating stronger induction of all ISGs, particularly CD80 and TRAIL. In contrast, GM-Mφs were more sensitive to IFN-λ3, increasing the expression of both ISG15 and viperin compared to M-Mφs. To confirm that macrophage differentiation and not treatment with M-or GM-CSF specifically induce IFNLR1 expression, monocytes were also differentiated using 10% autologous human serum from healthy individuals. Compared monocytes, human serum differentiated macrophages (HS-Mφs) possess increased IFNLR1 transcript abundance and possessed similar IFN-λ3 responsiveness as MDDCs and GM-Mφs, both of which express high levels of IFNLR1 ( Figure S7 ).
