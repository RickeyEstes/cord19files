Cells, viruses, and bacteria. The 293A cell line was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) (R70507), and the A549 and Caco-2 (C2BBe1 clone) cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) (ATCC CCL-185 and ATCC CRL-2102). Cell lines were tested for and verified as Mycoplasma negative. Escherichia coli strain K-12 (ATCC 10798) was purchased from ATCC. E. coli strain DH5‚ê£ was a gift from Michael Gilmore at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School. HAdV-D19 (ATCC VR-1096) and HAdV-D29 (ATCC VR-1107) were purchased from ATCC and verified by molecular typing of the major capsid genes. Viruses were purified using the cesium chloride gradient method, verified as endotoxin negative, and the titers of the virus were determined by the tissue culture infectious dose method.
