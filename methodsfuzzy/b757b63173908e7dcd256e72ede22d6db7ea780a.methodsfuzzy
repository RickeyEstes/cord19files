All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literaturebased decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for platelets (AP + IBS and PC + IBS). The current analysis expanded on the previ- (Table I) .'5x1"- 23 A decision tree ( Figure 1 ) was constructed for patients receiving AP + IBS versus AP without IBS. An identical decision tree was constructed for analysis of PC + IBS versus PC without IBS. The baseline model included the current risks of infection with HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV-1, or bacterial agents for each plateletdonor exposure. The model simulated subsequent transfusion-related events and outcomes, as well as events that would occur naturally; patients may experience morbidity and mortality due to several causes (eg, their underlying disease, transfusion-related complications, general mortality of populations of same age and sex). Clinical outcomes resulting from underlying disease and transfusion-related complications were assigned a treatment cost and utility Life expectancy estimates were calculated using the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy method24%25 and took into consideration competing mortality from disease-specific and naturally occurring causes. The excess annual mortality rates and QALY weights (utility) for the study populations are presented in Table I . The direct medical costs attributable to the use of AP + IBS and PC + IBS (as well as the present value of future costs attributable to treating transfusion-related complications) were incorporated in the baseline model. No indirect costs (eg, work productivity losses) were considered. Projected economic costs and health benefits in future years were discounted at 3% per annum, consistent with current practice. The model then estimated the incremental cost and health benefit (ie, QALY) of using AP + IBS and PC + IBS versus untreated AP and PC, respectively The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was then calculated as (costAP+lBS -costAP>/(QALYAP+'BS -QALY*'), representing (in this case) the incremental cost per QALY gained of using AP + IBS versus untreated AP
