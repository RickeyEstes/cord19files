Molecular cloning of spike and nucleocapsid cDNA. A total of six specimens from three probable SARS-CoV patients, according to the WHO case definition, were collected by nasopharyngeal swabs. The viruses were immediately inactivated by immersion in Trizol reagent (Gibco, Rockville, MD). Viral RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain spike and nucleocapsid cDNAs, specific primers designed for the spike and nucleocapsid genes were retrieved from the SARS-CoV TOR2 strain (GenBank Accession No. NC_004718), and RT-PCR was carried out using a Qiagen one step RT-PCR kit (Hilden, Germany). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and positive clones were analyzed with ABI Prism 377. Expression and purification of 6Â His-tagged spike and nucleocapsid protein. For the expression of 6Â His-tagged SARS-CoV spike and nucleocapsid recombinant protein, the open reading frames of spike and nucleocapsid cDNA were cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). We designed two sets of primers for spike cDNA, specific for a.a. 10-647 and a.a. 648-1255, and thereby the spike protein was expressed in these two fragments. The pQE constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 (pREP4) and expression of His-tagged fusion protein was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-D D -galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30°C for 5 h. Bacterial pellets were sonicated and solubilized in lysis buffer (1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0). The purification of His-tagged fusion protein was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Antibodies. Anti-spike polyclonal antiserum was raised in New Zealand rabbits using six different spike specific peptides, SP1: N-RCTTFDDVQAPNYTQHTSSMR-C, a.a. 18-38, SP2: N-DVSEKS GNFKHLREFVFKNKD-C, a.a. 171-191, SP3: N-KYDENGTITD AVDCSQNPLA-C, a.a. 265-284 SP4: N-NYNYKYRYLRHGKLR PFERD-C, a.a. 435-454, SP5: N-DVSDFTDSVRDPKTSEILDI-C, a.a. 555-574, and SP6: N-DVDLGDISGINASVVNIQKEIDR-C, a.a. 1145-1167. Anti-nucleocapsid antiserum was produced using 6Â His nucleocapsid recombinant protein. Antibodies were further purified with an Affi-10 affinity column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Monoclonal anti-fibrillarin antibody (38F3) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Western blot analysis. Human 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-nucleocapsid for 36 h using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cell extracts were prepared by gentle pipetting and was lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Western blot analysis was carried out using affinity-purified antibodies and an ECL system (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Immunofluorescence. Peptide-induced anti-spike and affinity-purified anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were applied to BIOCHIPs precoated with SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Euroimmun AG, L€ ubeck, Germany) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS, BIOCHIPs were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with rhodamine (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, DNA was labeled with 4,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and coverslips were mounted using Sigma mounting media. Immunostained images were visualized and recorded using a Zeiss Axioplan2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss, G€ ottingen, Germany).
