We re-examined, by transmission electron microscopy, a series of liver biopsy specimens from patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 or 3 previously analyzed for HCV-induced steatosis [10] . Twenty-seven different liver biopsies obtained from patients with a high serum viral load (between 5.8 and 6.6 log IU/mL; mean 6.2 log IU/mL) were fully analyzed. Liver biopsy specimens were fixed by incubation for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and postfixed by incubation for 1 h with 2% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA). They were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions, cleared in propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon resin (Sigma, Saint-Louis, Mo, USA), which was allowed to polymerise for 48 h at 60 • C. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with 5% uranyl acetate 5% lead citrate, and placed on electron microscopy grids coated with collodion. The sections were then observed with a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Gatan digital camera driven by Digital Micrograph software (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA). For each biopsy specimen, at least 5 consecutive squares of the TEM grid (5000 µm 2 ) were observed, representing several hundred hepatocytes.
