Sample preparation and extraction Archived faecal specimens (n0104) which had been collected from a commercial farm in Ireland in 2007 and stored at 48C were examined. Samples were taken from asymptomatic suckling and weaning piglets, aged from 2 to 6 weeks. Specimens were pooled prior to extraction and analysis (n026). Nucleic acids were extracted from pooled specimens using Qiaamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen), following manufacturer's instructions. Viral nucleic acid was eluted in 100 ml of elution buffer and stored at (208C prior to analysis. For analysis of RVA in pooled specimens, nucleic acid was extracted using phenol-chloroform, with ethanol precipitation (30) . Viral RNA was re-suspended in 100 ml of DEPC H 2 0 and stored at (208C.
