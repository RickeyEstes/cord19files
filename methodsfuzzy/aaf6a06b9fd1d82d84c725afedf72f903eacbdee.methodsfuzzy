On May 12, 2008, Sichuan Province in mainland China experienced a magnitude 8.0 earthquake (also known as the Wenchuan earthquake) that killed almost 70,000 people, injured more than 370,000, and left almost 18,000 missing. In addition, nearly 4 million buildings collapsed or were damaged. More than 15 million people needed emergency resettlement, and the estimated economic losses were roughly 845 billion RMB, making it the most severe disaster since the Tangshan earthquake in 1976 (China News, 2008/9/25). From a social perspective, the relevant functions of emergency management in the past are distributed in multiple departments and at different levels of government. The function is unclear, and there is a lack of institutional mechanisms for emergency management as well as a lack of efforts by the public, the media, volunteers, and NGOs. When it comes to the exchange and cooperation of external resources, there is a widespread phenomenon of mobilization and light coordination, and social organizations are slow to develop their ability to participate in disaster relief (Xue and Tao, 2013; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhang and Zhang, 2016) . In March 2018, China established the Emergency Management Department, which had an important impact on the entire disaster management system. In order to understand and analyze how the government worked together with civil organizations, volunteer organizations, and community organizations in order to enhance social resilience after the Wenchuan earthquake, this study collected qualitative data through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions from 2016 to 2018. The main purpose of the in-depth interviews was to explore, realize, and understand the life experiences of others and the meanings they have given. As the core of interview research is an interest in other people's stories (Seidman, 2006) , the research methods related to participation, observation, and narrative helped better understand the evolution of social resilience in China (especially in Sichuan) after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Over the past two years, the research team, which consists of crossstrait scholars, has taken advantage of exchange visits and arranged for meetings and field studies in the earthquake-affected area. Qualitative data were collected through a snowballing approach. After being introduced to an officer in the Department of Emergency Management in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, and based on the recommendation of scholars in the university, the research team contacted participants involved in the relief or recovery efforts following the Wenchuan earthquake as well as scholars in the field of disaster management. Participants in the focus group discussion and in-depth interview respondents included two main targets: practitioners, who are the main persons or directors of social organizations, and scholars and researchers from universities in the public administration and disaster management fields. In order to analyze issues from different angles and include more perspectives from respondents outside of Sichuan Province, this study also conducted interviews in Beijing and Shanghai. These meetings were recorded, with the participants' permission. Although no government officials agreed to participate in interviews due to the sensitive nature of socio-government interactions, with their help, the research team was able to participate in and observe the district government emergency management working forum organized by the municipal government. Table 1 presents the information about focus groups and in-depth interviews.
