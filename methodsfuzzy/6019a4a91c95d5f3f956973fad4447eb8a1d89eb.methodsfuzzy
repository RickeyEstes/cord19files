Up until now, three strategies have been followed to predict binding affinities on the basis of a given protein-ligand binding geometry. The most rigorous and theoretically most solid approaches are first-principle methods [59] . Using quantum mechanics or computationally less demanding (however approximate) force fields, the partition function of a system is computed and the free energy differences between the bound and unbound state are determined. With the increasing speed of computers, such methods are becoming more accurate and obtaining a growing relevance for scoring [119] . However, screening large samples of docked solutions to estimate binding affinities is still far beyond tractability. Nevertheless, first-principle methods do not need any calibration or training in experimentally determined affinity data; thus, they will not suffer from inherent experimental shortcomings or accuracy limits. This differs from the other two approaches described in the following section, the regression-and knowledgebased scoring functions, which are based on empirical concepts [59] .
