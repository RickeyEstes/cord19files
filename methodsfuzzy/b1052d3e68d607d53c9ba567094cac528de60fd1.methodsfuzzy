This retrospective study used medical data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database provided by the Central Administration of the Health System. We used (1) the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) to identify episodes of T2DM (codes DX 250.00) as principal diagnoses during hospitalization and (2) Staging [13] version 5.26 to identify the severity of T2DM, its comorbidities and stages, and UTI events. Staging uses a specific methodology -MEDSTAT-COC [13]that identifies potential UTI events (designated as complications-of-care [COC] Urinary) through principal and secondary diagnostic codes, ICD-9-CM, as well as ICD-9-CM procedure codes, age, sex, and the number of days of hospitalization. The parameters for COC Urinary were as follows: code 59010acute pyelonephritis not specified; code 5909infection of the kidney not specified; code 5950acute cystitis; code 5953trigonitis; code 5959cystitis not specified; and code 5990urinary tract infection not specified. UTI events that started from day 1 of admission until discharge from the hospital were investigated in this study.
