From May 1 through October 31, 2009, trained local fi eld workers visited the hospital in Maela daily (Monday-Saturday). Patients whose illnesses met clinical case defi nitions for infl uenza-like illness (ILI) or pneumonia (Table  1) were identifi ed by clinic staff at the time of examination, and these patients were asked to complete an additional clinical interview. Inpatient and outpatient department cases were included in the surveillance. From July 27 through October 31, 2009, original clinical case defi nitions were modifi ed to capture each patient who had a history of fever during the current illness but who was not febrile at the clinic visit (either because of the intermittent nature of fever or self-administration of antipyretics). A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected from each patient; a sterile 8-French infant feeding tube was inserted into the nasopharynx and then withdrawn while suction was applied with a 20-mL syringe attached to the feeding tube. The nasopharyngeal secretions and the tip of the feeding tube were transferred to a 1-mL tube of viral transport medium and stored in a cool box until transfer, within 24 h, to a -80Â°C freezer before analysis. All NPA specimens were subjected to a panel of realtime reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for the following viruses: infl uenza A (separate primer/probe sets for infl uenza A [universal], pandemic [H1N1] 2009, seasonal subtype H1N1, and seasonal subtype H3N1 detection) (20) ; infl uenza B (CDC in-house assay [details available on request]); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; CDC in-house assay [details available on request]); and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (21) . An internal control PCR specifi c for the human RNAseP gene was used to monitor sample adequacy and to detect the presence of PCR inhibitors (22) . Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR run. A Rotorgene 6000 real-time PCR thermocycler (Corbett Life Science, Mortlake, New South Wales, Australia) and SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used throughout. All laboratory work was conducted at the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit microbiology laboratory in Mae Sot, Tak Province, Thailand. To compare virologic results from 2009 with our surveillance data from 2008, we subsequently restricted the 2009 dataset to match data collected in 2008 (i.e., we included only patients whose illnesses met the strict case defi nitions and who were sampled on either Monday or Tuesday in the outpatient department). Clinical and laboratory data collected in 2008 were identical to data collected in 2009. To estimate the incidence of infl uenza-associated illness, we reviewed passive disease surveillance data collected by the hospital in Maela and collated by the Com- mittee for Coordination of Services for Displaced Persons in Thailand. This surveillance system captured data only on patients visiting the hospital for treatment. The number and incidence rate (calculated by using monthly camp population census data) of clinically diagnosed upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) were reported by month. No information was available to determine the number of ILI cases; therefore, we could not estimate the proportion of URTIs caused by infl uenza viruses in Maela. However, because most LRTIs reported are likely to be clinical pneumonia, we estimated the incidence of infl uenza-associated pneumonia as the incidence of LRTI multiplied by the percentage of pneumonia patients with specimens positive for infl uenza A. To determine the effect of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 on overall case numbers, we compared 2008 data with 2009 data.
