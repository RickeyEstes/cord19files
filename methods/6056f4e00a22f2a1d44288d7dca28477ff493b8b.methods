Twenty-one [14] [15] [16] day old piglets from four litters of conventional York breed swine were studied: eleven received an inoculum of TGE virus' ; controls were matchedfed littermates. Infected animals were killed 40 hr after infection, by which time all had moderate-to-severe diarrhea. Sixty centimeters of ileum were removed, starting 5 cm from the ileocecal sphincter: 20 cm for enzyme analyses of isolated villus cells; 15 cm for ion transport studies in vitro; 5 cm for light microscopy; and another 20 cm for enzyme analyses of isolated cells. Four adjacent segments of ileal mucosa stripped of muscularis were placed in Us sing-type chambers,3 and steadystate unidirectional mucosa-to-serosa and serosa-to-mucosa Na+ and CI-fluxes were measured in paired tissues in the absence of an electrochemical gradient"; an appro-priate short-circuit current (Iso) was applied to nullify the measured spontane,.ous transepithelial potential difference (PD).8.9 Three consecutive flux study periods were used, and 15 min were allowed for equilibration before each: (a) spontaneous basal fluxes in the absence of glucose; (b) fluxes in the presence of 30 mM glucose; and (c) 10 mM theophylline added after glucose. Unidirectional fluxes Urns and Ism) were calculated,9 and net fluxes Une') were derived from Ims and Ism' expressed as lteq/cm 2 /hr. Net residual ion flux Unc,R), that part of the Is" not accounted for by net movement of Na and CI, was calculated as Is" -Inc,Na+lnc,cl, where Iso in itA was converted to It/eq/ cm/hr by multiplying by 0.0289 (3.6X10 3 / AF), where A = area of mucosa in cm 2 , and F = Faraday constant. Conductance of the tissue (mQ/cm2) was calculated as Isj PDxA. Tissue for light microscopy was fixed in Bouin's fluid, and sections were stained with hemotosylin and eosin. Coded sections were examined by one person without prior identification of the slide, and, as previously described,' measurements of villus height and crypt depth, mucosal morphology, and epithelial cell morphology were noted. Ileal villous enterocytes were isolated selectively with the use of a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells. lO The presence of intact crypts was confirmed by light microscopy after the isolation procedure. For enzyme analyses, cells were homogenized, stored at -20Â°C,' and assayed for thymidine kinase! sucrase and lactase! Na+,K+ATPase, by the method of Kelly et al.,z using 50 ml of homogenate and an incubation medium of 2.5 mM APT (dis odium salt; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., Gr. II, and protein, using Lowry's method." Results were analyzed with Student's t-test or, where appropriate, the paired t-test. Analyses of enzyme data were based on logarithmic distribution; results were analyzed as logarithms and expressed as antilogarithms.
