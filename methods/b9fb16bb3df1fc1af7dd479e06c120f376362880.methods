The study was conducted with samples selected from cases of neonatal diarrhoea (less than 7 days old) routinely submitted for diagnosis during 2017 to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB, Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de León (UL, León, Spain). Four samples from healthy non-diarrhoeic piglets were also included to be used as negative controls. In the cases studied, a bacteriological cause for the diarrhoea had been excluded after a microbiological culture for aerobes and anaerobes and molecular analyses (PCR for E. coli virulence factors and C. perfringens and C. difficile toxins). Only cases apparently unrelated (different farms with no evident connection) were included. Finally, 47 faecal samples, each one representing an outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in 47 farms from Catalonia, Castile and Leon, Aragon, Galicia and Valencia were analysed (Additional file 1). Faecal samples were kept frozen at − 80°C until used. When needed, samples were thawed and diluted 1:5 in sterile distilled water. Then, to remove debris, diluted samples were sequentially clarified for 2 min at 2000 g, 5 min at 5000 g and 10 min at 10,000 g. Total RNA extraction was performed using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo-Fischer Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. For each reaction, 250 μL of the diluted faeces was used. The assessment of the diversity of viral RNA within each sample was directly characterised from the total RNA extracted, without any previous amplification step (no primers were required), applying a NGS approach previously applied to faeces [36] . Briefly, the procedures included: (i) the construction of a genomic library for Illumina NGS sequencing from the total RNA extracted, using a commercial protocol and reagents (Protocol for use with Purified mRNA or rRNA Depleted RNA and NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®, New England Biolabs); ii) the NGS runs using an Illumina MiSeq platform available at the Genomics and Bioinformatics Service of the UAB and a read length of 250 bp; iii) the trimming of low quality reads (those showing a QC score < 20 as determined by FastQC©software, Babraham informatics), using Trimmomatic© [38] ; iv) the taxonomic classification of the quality reads against a pre-built database containing the viral genomes available at GenBank with Kraken [39] ; v) the initial filtering of quality reads against a reference file containing the concatenated sequences of a panel of RNA viruses described in faeces (Additional file 2); vi) the mapping of quality reads against the complete genomes of the RNA virus identified in the steps iv) and v), with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner [40] , applying the BWA-MEM algorithm for long reads [41] ; and vii) the assembly of a consensus sequence in fasta format for every sample and RNA species identified, using the program QUASR [42] . For the software programs used in steps iii), iv), vi) and vii) -FastQC©software, Kraken, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and QUASR, respectively -, the default parameters of every program were applied. Next, a database for every RNA species identified was constructed by downloading the available complete genome sequences from GenBank. Finally, the sequences obtained were aligned and phylogenetically compared with the datasets constructed for every complete genome, or segment in the segmented genomes identified. The phylogenetic relationships among sequences were analysed using the software MEGA7 [43] , by means of a Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm, using the matrix of pairwise p-distances and 10,000 bootstrap replicates to estimate the confidence of the internal branches of the trees. In the cases where a presumptive aetiological agent could not be clearly established, further analysis to detect unknown RNA viruses were undertaken with the program rnaSPAdes [44] , an RNAseq de novo assembler included in the package SPADES [45] . Also, the RNAseq outputs were analysed with VirFind, a web-based bioinformatic pipeline specifically designed for virus detection and discovery [46] . In both cases, the default parameters provided by the programs were used.
