A cross-sectional study was performed in the consultation for travel medicine and international vaccination in Reims University Hospital between July 2014 and October 2015. Consecutive adults (>18 years old) who attended for pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination were eligible to complete an anonymous questionnaire with closed answers to evaluate their level of knowledge about MERS-CoV. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Reims University Hospital under the number 2018-01. Participation was voluntary and without compensation. The standardised questionnaire recorded information on the participant's gender, age, place of birth and educational level (high school certificate yes/no). The second part of the questionnaire concerned knowledge about MERS-CoV. All questions are listed in Table 1 . To evaluate the effectiveness of the information given during the consultation, the same questionnaire was completed by each Hajj pilgrim before and after the consultation, where the information about MERS-CoV was provided. The information given to the Hajj pilgrims was provided by a nurse, using an information leaflet. The last one defined MERS-CoV and detailed the geographical area at risk of MERS-CoV contamination, the different transmission routes of the disease, symptoms, severity of the disease, availability of treatment or vaccines and preventive measures to reduce the possibility of contracting and/or spreading illness during travel and after return (see supplementary material). All the answers to the questionnaire were given in the information leaflet. Two nurses participated in the study, and both received the same instructions. The questionnaire and the information leaflet were first tested on non-healthcare providers to assess their intelligibility. Additional explanations were also given on top of the routine information usually delivered during the travel medicine consultation. If the Hajj pilgrims were not able to read or understand French, they were assisted by a healthcare provider and an unofficial translator. The responses to the two questionnaires (before and after) were then compared. A question was considered to be answered correctly if the correct answer (for questions with a single answer) or all the correct answers (for questions with multiple correct options) were given. Quantitative variables are presented as mean values with standard deviation. Qualitative variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Responses before and after explanations were compared using McNemar's test. A P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
