This is a retrospective study of annually gathered information about influenza in children (<18 years hospitalized at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden during 1998-2014. The hospital is a tertiary referral center with surgery and a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with resources for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), but only children resident in the catchment area were included in the study. We obtained population data from the Stockholm area database at Statistics Sweden (www.scb.se). During the study period, the number of children in the primary catchment area increased by 17%, from 197,945 to 230,877. The number of person years for a specific age group during a certain year was considered equal to the number of children on December 31.
