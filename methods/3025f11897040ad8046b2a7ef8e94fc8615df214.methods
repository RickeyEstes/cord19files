We analyzed the age profile of 120571 cases with influenza like symptoms and specimens tested the microbiology laboratory of Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) during the study period of January 2004 to December 2013. This laboratory is one of largest sentinel surveillance laboratories in Hong Kong and covers 20% of the population. During the whole study period, direct immunofluorescence (IF) tests were conducted to test influenza (type A or B), RSV, adenovirus and parainfluenza (type 1,2,3) [6] . Influenza A positive specimens were subtyped into seasonal A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) by viral culture and also subtyped into the pandemic virus A(H1N1) pdm09 by RT-PCR during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic until early 2010. Non-subtyped influenza A positive specimens were allocated into three subtypes by annual ratio of total numbers of each subtype. Because the A(H1N1)pdm09 did not emerge in Hong Kong until May 2009, the annual ratio of year 2009 was separately calculated for the first 17 weeks of 2009 and the remaining 35 weeks. Weekly age-specific numbers of positive specimens were aggregated into the age groups of 0-4y, 5-17y, 18-64y, 65y and above. Weekly age-specific positive proportions were calculated as weekly age-specific numbers of positive specimens divided by weekly total numbers of specimens tested for each age group. To assess the impact of the 2009 pandemic on virus circulation, the overall positive proportions in five pre-pandemic seasons ( Here influenza season was defined as week 18 of the present year to week 17 of the following year to ensure that other seasonal factors were comparable between the periods. Hence the length of these nine seasons was shorter than the entire study period of January 2004 to December 2013. Positive proportion was used instead of positive number because the former was less affected by yearly variations in the number of specimens collected for each age group. We used wavelet analysis [7, 8] to assess the seasonal patterns of age-specific virus epidemic curves. Unlike other approaches that decompose the temporal variations of time series, wavelet analysis does not require stationary datasets and thus is suitable for virological data in Hong Kong given their unpredictable seasonality. This approach has been adopted to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza activity across different states of the United States [9] as well as the synchrony of different surveillance data in Hong Kong [10] . A detailed description of wavelet analysis can be found in references [8, 11] . Briefly, Morlet wavelets at the frequency ranging from biannual to quarterly cycles were fitted to age-specific virology data to reveal the temporal change in relative dominance of these cycles. Similar to R 2 in linear models, wavelet power spectrum was calculated at each time point for each frequency to quantify the relative dominance of these cycles over time. Wavelet power spectrum ranges from 0 to 1, with the highest indicating the complete dominance and the lowest the complete missing of certain cycle. We calculated the mean week of the epidemics (MWE) to compare the epidemic peak time in the pre-and post-pandemic seasons [12] : where v i denotes the number of laboratory confirmed cases at week t (= 1,2,. . .,49, -2, -1,0) of season i. Because of two-peak patterns shown in most respiratory viruses, MWE was calculated separately for the warm (weeks 18 to 49) and cool season (week 50 to week 17 of the following year) within each influenza season. Here we replaced the week numbers 50 to 52 by -2 to 0 to avoid the dominance of these large numbers. Some virus-age groups were excluded from this analysis, due to small numbers of cases (annual total < 20 in half of study years). All analyses were conducted in R package version 2.12.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Wavelet analysis was conducted by using the sowas and Rwave packages of R [7, 13] .

Written consent was waived as only the aggregated data were used in analysis.
