A two-month prospective survey during February and March 2003 was performed. A trained medical student collected data daily (except at weekends). The initial diagnosis prompting admission to the isolation facility, basic demographics and other relevant clinical details were recorded. All patients admitted to a dedicated isolation bed were Infections requiring isolation Suspected/proven enteric infection, e.g. Escherichia coli 0157 and hepatitis A Varicella-zoster virus infection, i.e. chickenpox a and shingles (other droplet/airborne spread viral infections, e.g. measles a and influenza, are also appropriate) HIV-positive or 'high-risk' patients with respiratory tract infection requiring exclusion of tuberculosis and/or an induced sputum for PCP Suspected/proven pulmonary tuberculosis a , particularly if multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) is suspected (MDR-TB must be admitted to one of the negatively pressurized isolation rooms) Patients with other resistant organisms (mostly infection, but some colonization if isolation in the ID unit is requested by the infection control team) at high risk of transmitting to other patients, e.g. a patient with a productive cough and confirmed penicillin-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia Fever within three weeks of travel to an area where there is a risk of viral haemorrhagic fever a , in particular sub-Saharan Africa Herpes-simplex virus and other contagious skin infections (e.g. impetigo), particularly if extensive/severe such as in eczema herpeticum Patients requiring 'protective' isolation may be admitted to one of the isolation cubicles if a suitable bed is not available on one of the oncology/haematology wards or if the patient poses a significant risk to other vulnerable patients (e.g. chickenpox or shingles) The following infections do not always require isolation but may benefit from ID nursing and medical expertise, and can be discussed with senior ID staff who will arrange admission, depending on risk assessment and bed status Suspected/proven viral or bacterial meningitis/encephalitis Severe community-acquired pneumonia if the respiratory unit is full Skin, soft tissue and bone infections, particularly if Streptococcus pyogenes is suspected/proven or if the patient is suitable for the outpatient and home parenteral therapy service Bacterial tonsillitis, particularly if S. pyogenes is suspected/proven (suspected quinsy should be referred to Ear, Nose and Throat Department) Glandular fever Severe sepsis or septic shock of any cause Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Pyrexia of unknown origin Other patients may also be appropriate-please discuss with ID staff HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PCP, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; ID, infectious diseases. a Ideally these infections should be admitted to one of the negatively pressurized isolation rooms. included. Data were collected using a pre-piloted data collection form, and were subsequently transcribed to an Excel database. Two members of the study team assessed the appropriateness of each isolation episode independently according to the following criteria. (1) Infection or non-infection-i.e. whether the patient was suspected or proven to have an infection by healthcare staff on admission. (2) Infection risk or non-infection risk-i.e. whether the patient was a potential communicable infection risk at the point of admission according to the Tayside Health Board's infection control guidelines. 4 (3) Appropriate or inappropriate admissionaccording to the local guidelines for admission to the new facility (Table I) . To allow comparison, data from our previous audit (February-May 2000) were re-analysed according to the above criteria. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and SPSS for Windows (version 10). Where appropriate, percentages and 95% confidence intervals are presented. c 2 test was used to compare the use of isolation facilities before and after the transfer.
