The Relationship between R 0 and Initial Epidemic Growth Rate During the early phase of an epidemic, the observed exponential growth rate, k, is related to the basic reproduc-tive ratio, R 0 , of the infection. Mathematically, k is just the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium, and one can show that k must satisfy for the SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods (further details are given in Protocol S1). This equation translates into an expression for R 0 in terms of k and the other parameters, as is presented in equation 4. Therefore, if we can estimate the growth rate k from data, we can use equation 4 to obtain an estimate of R 0 .
