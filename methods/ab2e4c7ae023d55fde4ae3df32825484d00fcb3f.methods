As many features of GOST as possible are pre-specified so that much of the statistical section of the trial protocol can be developed in advance, before the nature of the disease is known and without details of the experimental treatment. Other elements, such as details of the ordinal outcome scale, the randomisation ratio and the day on which a patient's primary assessment will be made, will have to be quickly determined by investigators once an outbreak occurs. Patients will be randomised between an experimental treatment (E) and standard care (S), stratified by treatment centre and perhaps by one or two other key prognostic factors. Usually the allocation ratio will be set to 1:1 for simplicity and because expected sample sizes are minimised if this choice is made [3] . If, however, the availability of E were limited, then the allocation ratio could be modified to randomise more patients to S than to E. The primary patient response will be the status of the patient, D days after randomization, classified into one of k outcome groups, C 1 , . . ., C k . D is likely to be set at 7, 14 or 28 days. The outcome categories must be unambiguously defined and each patient must fall into exactly one of them. They must also reflect progressively less desirable states as one moves from C 1 (the best outcome) to C k (the worst outcome). Outcome C 1 might reflect complete recovery and C k death before Day D. Intermediate outcomes might include C 2 : alive and requiring only basic support and C 3 : alive but requiring intensive support, where these terms would need careful definition for specific diseases. It is not necessary for the number of patients in every outcome category to be large, and the method remains valid and accurate if one or more categories turn out to be completely empty, provided that at least two categories are well represented. The special case k = 2 allows for a binary outcome such as alive or dead. Use of a response that is available after a short and fixed duration of follow-up reduces the risk of loss to follow-up and is essential if the trial is to yield an early conclusion. GOST is presented for the case of an ordinal response because expected sample sizes will be reduced if more than two outcome categories can be reliably identified [3] . Furthermore, at the outset of a trial concerning a new infection, it may not be clear whether the key issue will be the prevention of death or the reduction of morbidity. Using a categorisation that distinguishes between a number of outcome states will allow the trial to be informative if life or death proves to be the major issue or if fatalities prove to be rare and the need for intensive therapy becomes the key concern. In normal circumstances, a pilot study of conventionally treated patients might be used to determine a binary endpoint for the trial: here we are concerned to start the definitive randomised study as early in the outbreak as possible. The probability that a patient on E achieves an outcome category that is any one of C 1 ,. . ., C j , is denoted by P Ej . Achieving an outcome in any one of categories C 1 ,. . ., C j is preferable to being in one of the categories C j+1 ,. . ., C k , an event that occurs with probability 1 -P Ej . The odds of the former event is O Ej = P Ej /(1 -P Ej ), and P Sj and O Sj are defined similarly for patients receiving S. The odds ratio R j is defined by R j = O Ej /O Sj . Notice that these definitions make sense for values of j from 1 to k-1, but they are not used for j = k as P Ek and P Sk refer to the probability of a patient being in any of the outcome categories, which must be 1, and the corresponding odds values are undefined. The null hypothesis is that E has no effect, in which case P Ej = P Sj and so R j = 1 for each value of j from 1 to k-1. If this null hypothesis is true then the probability of concluding that E is better than S (an event that will be designated "E wins" hereafter) is set to equal 0.025. This is the one-sided risk of type I error (denoted by α), and the value of 0.025 is chosen for GOST to follow convention. As well as considering the properties of the design when the treatment has no effect (the null hypothesis), we consider its properties when there is a tendency for patients to achieve better outcome categories on E than on S across the whole outcome scale (the alternative hypothesis). Thus, treatment with E might lead to a greater chance of complete recovery, a greater chance of complete or partial recovery, and a smaller chance of death. Specifically, situations are considered in which all of the odds ratios from R 1 to R k−1 are of equal magnitude (denoted by a common value R) and greater than 1. The design is constructed to ensure that, if R = 2, then the probability that E wins is 0.90. This is the power of the trial. The alternative hypothesis is a compromise between the desires to detect small but worthwhile treatment effects and to complete the trial quickly. For a binary outcome, an odds ratio of 2 corresponds to an increase in success rate from ⅓ on S to ½ on E, or from ½ to ⅔, or from ⅔ to ⅘. Typical sample sizes when GOST is employed are in the range 150-300 (totalled over both treatment groups). The value of 0.90 is chosen for the power of GOST as it is a conventional choice: choosing 0.80 would allow too large a risk of missing a treatment effect as large as R = 2. For an increase in success rate from ½ on S to ⅗ on E (R = 1.5), GOST will conclude that E is better than S with probability 0.47. The sample size would triple to 450-900 if a power of 0.90 were specified for the alternative R = 1.5. The trial will be monitored using a series of up to 20 interim analyses, equally spaced by newly accrued patient responses. It will be seen in the results section that such a choice will lead to around 20 to 30 new responses (totalled over S and E) being needed between consecutive interim analyses. It will also be seen that typically only 8 to 12 of these analyses will be required before the trial stops. The data requirements for each patient at each interim analysis are modest: patient identification number, date of randomisation, treatment, treatment centre and any other baseline stratification factors, and status on Day D. Setting 20 interim analyses for GOST is a subjective choice of the authors achieving a much quicker reaction to the message of the data than setting just 3 or 4 interim analyses while being more practical than updating the sequential plot every time a Day D report is received. At each interim analysis two test statistics are calculated. The first is a cumulative measure of the observed advantage of E over S and is denoted by Z. The second quantifies the amount of information about the treatment difference contained in Z, and is denoted by V. Expressions for computing Z and V, allowing for stratification factors, are taken from [4] and presented in equations (E1) and (E2) of the Supporting Information (S1 Text. Supporting technical details). The monitoring of GOST can be depicted by a plot of the values of Z computed at each interim analysis against the corresponding values of V, using the diagram shown in Fig 1. A completed plot is presented in the results section. The stopping rule is represented by two straight lines. If Z lies above the upper line, the trial is stopped and E wins. If the plotted value of Z lies below the lower line, the trial is stopped and it is concluded that no evidence that E is better than S has been found. This design is a special case of the triangular test [1, 2] , and it was proposed as the phase III part of a trial strategy for Ebola virus disease [5, 6] . Fig 2 shows the probability that E wins, plotted against the natural logarithm, θ, of the true odds ratio R. When R = 1 (θ = 0) the plotted probability is 0.025 and when R = 2 (θ = 0.693) it is 0.90. Fig 3 shows the probability of stopping at or before selected interim analyses, plotted against the true value of the log-odds ratio θ. In both of these figures values of θ corresponding to selected values of the odds-ratio R are also indicated on the horizontal axis. Although a maximum of 20 analyses is allowed, it is very unlikely that more than 16 will be required. If the treatment is either harmful (R < 1, θ < 0) or very efficacious (R > 2.7, θ > 1), then it is unlikely that more than 4 interim analyses (one fifth of the maximum sample size) will be needed. Fig 4 shows the expected value of V at the end of the trial (that is the average value of the final value of V over many iterations of the same trial) plotted against θ. As discussed later, the values of V in Fig 4 can be converted into expected final sample sizes. During the trial, V will be calculated according to equation E2 in S1 Text, but prior to the trial starting, the relationship between sample size and V can be approximated using equation E3 in S1 Text to yield a plot of expected terminal sample size against θ, as will be illustrated in the results section below. The primary analysis will be based on the sequential design used, and will feature a onesided p-value for the null hypothesis of no treatment difference, and a median unbiased estimate and 95% confidence interval for R. In the final dataset, the numbers of new patients recruited to each treatment arm may not be as planned in the protocol, the allocation ratio might not be as intended and the information V accrued might not be as anticipated. Provided that departures from the plan are purely chance deviations rather than being prompted by emerging data, actual values of these quantities will be used in the analysis. Thus it is acceptable if an unexpected surge of recruitment leads to there being more information available for an interim analysis than anticipated, but it is not acceptable for investigators to see a value of Z close to the stopping boundary and to bring forward the next interim analysis in the hope of a quick conclusion. The valid analysis is described in [1] and statistical code for its implementation is provided in [2] . Conduct of the final analysis will need expert statistical input. Unlike the finalisation of the design, there should be sufficient time for the trial statistician to study and practice these methods ahead of the trial reaching a conclusion. Although the final analysis will require technical input, the conclusion of the trial-whether E wins or not-will be immediately apparent from a glance at the plot of Z against V. When the trial is stopped, there may still be patients under treatment whose outcome is unknown, as well as patients whose status became available during the conduct of the interim analysis and its discussion. Data from these patients will be added into a final "overrunning" analysis [7] , provided that they followed the protocol without any change of treatment due to the stopping of the trial. The latter might not be the case if the experimental treatment is suspected of being harmful and it is consequently withdrawn from current patients.
