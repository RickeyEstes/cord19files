Permutation entropy. Here we make use of permutation entropy as a modelindependent measure of the growth in complexity and unpredictability of infectious disease time series. Given a time series {x t } t=1,…,N indexed by positive integers, an embedding dimension d and a temporal delay τ, one can consider the set of all sequences of values s of the type s = {x t ,x t+τ ,…,x t+(d−1)τ }. Note that successive values x t+iτ ,x t+(i+1)τ for generic i can be in an arbitrary relative order. To each s, one can associate the permutation π of order d that makes s totally ordered, that isd ¼ πðdÞ ¼ fx t i ; ; x t N g such that x t i <x t j 8t i <t j . In this way, via π we associate a rankorder quantity that is independent of the actual values the time series takes and we can associate a probability p π to each permutation by simply counting how many times it appears in the data as compared to the total number of sequences appearing. The permutation entropy of time series {x t } is then given by the Shannon entropy on the permutation orders, that is H p d;τ ðfx t gÞ ¼ À P π p π logp π . We find that diseases cluster based on the best-fit dimension, d (see Supplementary Figure 2 ), and that the diseasespecific slopes for a random effects model of (log)entropy and (log)time series can be predicted based on the embedding dimension (Supplementary Figure 3) . In the manuscript, we show results obtained by fixing τ = 1 to aid the intuition of the reader and select the most conservative (smallest) value of H p ðfx t gÞ ¼ min d H Figure 4 ). In addition, we also confirmed that similar results were obtained by using the weighted permutation entropy, as presented in refs. 32, 40 and implemented in the R package statcomp v. 0.0.1.1000 58 , see Supplementary Figure 5 . Although, it is worth pointing out that weighted permutation entropy attempts to normalize away exactly the kind of structure infectious disease modelers aim to predict. Markov chain simulations. In order to assess the amount of non-random structure in the real outbreak time series, we build synthetic symbolic time series by simulating Markov chains over the symbol distributions obtained from the empirical time series. For each real time series {x t } i , we extract the set of permutation symbols {π} as in the standard calculation for permutation entropy. We utilize τ = 1 and the embedding dimension d i previously selected during the permutation entropy computation as described by Brandmeier 38 . For a time series with embedding dimension d, there is a maximum number of d! states, corresponding to the possible permutations of length d. Using the permutations as states, we then count the number of transitions n ij in the real time series between each pair of symbols (i,j) and use it to build a Markov chain with transition probabilities between states given by p ij ¼ n ij P j n ij . In order to obtain a synthetic symbolic series, we repeatedly start from a randomly selected node and use the Markov Chain described above to produce symbolic series with the same number of symbols as the corresponding real time series. For each iteration, we calculate the associated symbolic entropy. In Supplementary Figure 6 , we compare the synthetic entropies versus the permutation entropy of the original time series and show that the former are systematically higher than the real ones, implying that there is additional structure in the outbreak time series that is not captured simply by the probabilistic transition structure. Epidemic simulations. We simulated a standard SIR model with restart on a class of temporal networks in which it is possible to control the expected number of secondary neighbors of nodes. The temporal networks were constructed using the SAD model, a modified version of the well-known activity driven (AD) model 59 , in which activations of nodes can involve two (like in the standard AD model) or more nodes establishing reciprocal links. We simulated two types of networks: in the first the number of nodes contacted in every activation was kept constant (regular SAD with s = 4); in the second we allowed the number of contacted nodes to fluctuate between interactions (irregular SAD, we sampled s from a normal distribution with mean 〈s〉 = 4 and coefficient of variation = 0.4). All networks had N = 1000 nodes. Node activities were sampled from a power-law distribution~a −α with α = 2.2 and rescaled in order to have an average activity~10 −2 , such that nodes activated on average every 100 time steps. Crucially, for this class of networks it is possible to calculate explicitly the (SIS) critical threshold λ c = β 0 /γ 0 , where β 0 and γ 0 are respectively the matched infection and recovery probabilities at the transition. In order to investigate the behavior of the predictability across the epidemic transition, we fixed γ 0 = 0.1 and let β vary from 0.5β 0 (below the transition) to 4β 0 (far above the transition), where β 0 = λ c γ 0 is the threshold infectivity matching γ 0 . The values of γ 0 was chosen in order to match the average outbreak peak length to those observed in the data (roughly around 4 weeks). We then simulated the SIR model on the networks described above for T = 5000 steps: each outbreak was seeded with five randomly infected nodes and let run its course; at the end of the outbreak, we repeated the seeding until we reached the prescribed time-series length. We calculated the permutation entropy of the synthetic time series in the same way we processed the empirical ones. Significance tests on moving-window permutation entropy. We use a permutation test to determine whether different time-series windows have distinct symbol distributions. Specifically, we fit a multinomial distribution to the normalized symbol frequency distributions and repeatedly simulate data from the estimated multinomials. Then, we calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between each pair of simulated distributions. With these simulated distributions, we can ask how often we see fluctuations in our estimate of the permutation entropy just due to sampling. More formally, we use these simulated distributions as a null distribution for calculating a frequentist p-value based on the observed Jensen-Shannon divergence between the symbolic frequencies in time series windows.
