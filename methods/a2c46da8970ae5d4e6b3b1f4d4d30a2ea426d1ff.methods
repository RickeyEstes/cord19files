The study was approved by Health Canada and the Research Ethics Board of Mount Sinai Hospital with written informed consent obtained from all participants. In October 2008, 60 working adults from Toronto, Ontario were recruited into a pilot study of influenza infection and followed for symptoms of acute respiratory illness until May 2009. Subjects were asked to report all episodes with either fever or two or more respiratory symptoms (stuffy/runny nose, cough, scratchy/sore throat, sneezing, hoarseness) with acute onset (i.e. not associated with allergies). They were then to submit a self-collected flocked mid-turbinate swab (Copan FLOQSwabs TM ; Copan, Italy) and have a nurse-performed flocked NP swab obtained as soon as possible, preferably within 24-48 hours, after onset of symptoms. Subjects were provided with a mid-turbinate swab kit (including written and pictorial instructions), they were also verbally instructed to insert the mid-turbinate swab into one outer nare up to the swab's collar and rotate the swab three times, then place it in universal transport media. Study nurses were available to answer questions. Mid-turbinate swabs were collected immediately before NP swabs, which were obtained from the opposite nare by trained study nurses. Swabs were transported to the Ontario Central Public Health Laboratory in universal transport medium (UTM-RT; Copan, Italy). Total nucleic acid was extracted from each specimen using the easyMAGH (bioMerieux, Quebec, Canada) automated extraction system. To control for extraction, all specimens were tested for human gapdh using the TaqManH GAPDH Control RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Total nucleic acid was tested using the SeeplexH RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit (Seegene, Seoul Korea) for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza virus (PIV)1, PIV2, PIV3, human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E/NL63, hCoV OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus A/B, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus. PCR products were visualized using ethidium bromide on 2% agarose electrophoresis gels as previously described [8] . Although specimens were identified by code only, it was not possible to blind laboratory personnel to the swab type during processing. Statistical analysis was completed using Prism Windows 5.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, USA).
