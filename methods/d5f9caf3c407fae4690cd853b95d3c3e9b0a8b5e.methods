The survey questionnaire used in this study was developed from an established framework of hospital disaster resilience. The framework was derived from analysis of existing literature and through a three-round of Modified-Delphi consultation with key experts in China [18] . The resultant questionnaire consists of 9 sections and 166 items (the framework and questionnaire can be found in the Additional files 1 and 2). Most questions are in the format of binary variables, and can be answered by "yes" or "no". The relevant framework and questionnaire can be accessed from the additional files. The feasibility and suitability of the questionnaire were tested by a pilot study of three hospitals (n = 3). For the purpose of this study, we collected and analyzed the data focused on the following areas of interest: (1) hospital demographic data; (2) hospital internal safety (e.g., infrastructural safety and strategies for infectious diseases); (3) emergency leadership and cooperation; (4) disaster plan; (5) disaster stockpile and logistics management; (6) emergency staff; (7) emergency critical care capability (e.g., on-site rescue, hospital treatment, surge capacity); (8) training and drills; (9) and disaster recovery mechanism. Excluding the first section of the survey which addressed demographic information, Sections 2-9 (covering 161 survey questions) represent the eight key domains of the established evaluation framework of hospital disaster resilience. A tertiary hospital is defined as cross-regional facility providing comprehensive and specialized medical care. In China they are further classified into subgroups: Grade A, Grade B, and Grade C according to their service levels, size, medical technology, medical equipment, management and medical quality [19] . Shandong province is the second largest province and is located in the east of China. In this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals of Shandong province in China. A total of 50 tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province were selected using stratified random sampling according to their subgroups (i.e., Grade A, B, C). The sample was composed of 28 tertiary A hospitals, 20 tertiary B hospitals and 2 tertiary C hospitals, which was selected using the contact list obtained from the Provincial health department. Between January 2013 and June 2013, the questionnaire accompanied by an official letter from the provincial health department stating the importance of the survey was sent to these hospitals. Each hospital was asked to designate a department director to be responsible for coordinating the completion of the questionnaire. Ethical approval was obtained from Queensland University of Technology (approval number 1200000170) and written informed consent obtained from each participant hospital. Each returned questionnaire was reviewed for its completeness and consistency. For those questionnaires which were incomplete and/or contained inconsistent responses follow-up telephone calls were made to ensure completeness and consistency. The data from returned questionnaires were then transferred into a database, which was set up using Microsoft office access 2007. Data was checked, cleaned, and analysed using SPSS Statistics version 21. As the study was conducted in China, the Chinese language was used to capture responses, but the results subsequently were translated into English for final analysis and reporting. A score was assigned for the binary variables (e.g., "is there"). Two options of "yes" or "no" are assigned to the score of "1"or "0" respectively. Then, the scores of each domain were calculated by adding together the score of all the relevant questions. A total score was calculated by summing the score across all eight domains, which is a proxy for measuring disaster resilience in an institution. The higher the total score, the better the hospital's disaster resilience. Further analyses were conducted to understand the correlation between resilience domains and the descriptive information about the hospitals. A mean score and ninetyfive percent confidence interval of means (95% CI) were used to describe each resilience domain. Comparisons of the mean score of each resilience domain among different hospital categorizes were performed, with p < 0.05 as the level of statistical significance. Due to the small sample, non-parameter test (Mann-Whitney Test) was used as the statistical method. Factor Analysis was used to test the construct validity of the evaluation framework by extracting key factors of disaster resilience from the different domains. Most variables in this study were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentage.
