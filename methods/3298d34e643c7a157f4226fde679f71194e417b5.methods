We use the generalized Richards model (GRM), which is an extension of the original Richards growth model [21] . With three free parameters, the Richards growth model has been fitted to a range of logistic-type epidemic curves [16] . The generalized Richards model is defined by the differential equation: .

The exponent α measures the deviation from the symmetric s-shaped dynamics of the simple logistic curve. The model recovers the original Richards model for = 1, and reduces to the generalized logistic model [17] for α = 1 and =
