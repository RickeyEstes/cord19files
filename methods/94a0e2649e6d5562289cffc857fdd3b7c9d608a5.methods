This research records the mental state of the nursing staff toward a new infectious disease and the changes after a prevention plan had been conducted by the hospital. Research subjects are nursing staff of the largest obligatory SARS designated treatment hospital in Taiwan. After researchers explained the study purposes, 116 volunteers answered the questionnaires completely. The questionnaires were administered before caring for SARS patients, 2 weeks after caring for SARS patients under the prevention program, 1 month after the program began, and 1 month after the hospital returned to normal functions. The staff cared for SARS patients for 3 months in total.
