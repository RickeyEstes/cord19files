Column flotation experiments were carried out in a glass column of 30 mm in diameter and 950 mm in height, fitted with a fine porous glass sparger at the bottom. Compressed air was introduced into the column through a rotameter. In every run, a quantitative of fly ash and 600 ml of deionized water was stirred in a hybrid mixer for 5 min. After that, a collector (kerosene) and frother (methyl isobutyl carbinol) were added subsequently and conditioned for 5 min. The slurry was then transferred into the column. The required air flow rate was maintained by rotameter. The experiments were carried out by varying different operating parameters such as slurry concentration, kerosene dosage, frother dosage, and the air flow rate. Slurry concentration, collector dosage, frother dosage and air flow rate in the flotation process were set as range of 0.015-0.1 kg/l, 3-15 kg/t, 0.5-4 kg/t, and 0.04-0.08 m 3 /h separately with reference to preliminary experiments. One variable at a time was varied while keeping other variables at constant. The two-stage flotation (rougher-scavenger flotation) process was applied in order to fully and efficiently remove the carbon from the HSWI fly ash, that is to say, the rougher tailing from the first flotation stage were re-fed into the column and the cleaning process was continued under the same experimental conditions. The combined froth from the two stages and tailings remaining in the flotation column were vacuum filtered, dried and weighed and then determining LOI of each product. Determination of calorific values of the froth samples was carried out using an IKA-C5000 calorimeter device. The scanning electron microscopyenergy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was employed to provide imaging information about the morphology and the composition of the raw fly ash and the final product by a FEI NANOSEM 430 apparatus. In addition, to evaluate the effect of soluble salts on the ash characteristics during the slurry preparation process, the conditioned fly ash were analyzed and the conditioning process are slurry concentration 0.05 kg/l and conditioned time 10 min.
