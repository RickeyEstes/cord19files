The study was conducted at two acute-care teaching hospitals in Cleveland between October 2015 and May 2016. The hospitals provided training for medical students from three different medical schools, residents in internal medicine and surgery, and fellows from multiple subspecialties. The institutional review boards of both institutions approved the study protocol.
