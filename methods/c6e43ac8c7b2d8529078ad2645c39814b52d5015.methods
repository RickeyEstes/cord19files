This project included a review of data obtained from a survey of public health practitioners recruited among members of the International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS) Public Health Practice Committee (PHPC) during 2012 and 2013 (1, 2) . In these surveys, questions were selected for discussion and additional responses collected from influenza surveillance coordinators using a web-based survey tool managed by ISDS staff on behalf of the PHPC. During 2014, additional information was requested to assess approaches to identify novel influenza strains, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viruses. Special emphasis was made to obtain information on comparative approaches to cost-effective surveillance in follow-up to an ISDS policy paper (3).
