Materials. We used an α-ISG15 antibody from Santa Cruz (F-9) at 1:200, an α-SQSTM1/p62 antibody from Abcam, UK (ab56416) at 1:1000. We used an α-LC3 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13393-x ARTICLE antibody from MBL, Japan (M152-3, clone 4E12) at 1:1000 and an α-ACTIN antibody from Sigma, Saint Louis, MO (AC-15, A5441) at 1:5000. We used an α-mTOR antibody from Sigma (PA5-34663) at 2 µg/sample for immunoprecipitation, an α-mTOR antibody from Cell Signaling (7C10) at 1:1000, an α-tubulin antibody from Sigma (T6074) at 1:5000, an α-ubiquitin antibody from Cell Signaling (P4D1) at 1:1000, and an α-NEDD8 antibody from Cell Signaling (19E3) at 1:1000. We used an α-HA antibody from Sigma (H6908) at 1:1000 for immunoblotting, and an α-GFP antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-81045) at 1:1000. We used an α-FLAG ® M2 antibody from Sigma (F3165) at 1:10,000, an α-HA tag antibody-ChIP Grade from Abcam, UK (ab9110) at 1:5000, and an αalpha-tubulin antibody from Genetex (GT114) at 1:40,000. We used α-HA antibody magnetic beads from Pierce (88837), and anti-flag antibody magnetic beads from Sigma (M2 M8823 Millipore) for immunoprecipitation. Bacterial and mammalian growth conditions and infections. Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD (BUG 600) was used for all infections in this study. Listeria was grown in Brain Heart Infusion media (BD). Prior to infection, overnight cultures of bacterial strains were diluted in new media and grown to exponential phase (OD 0.8-1), washed three times in serum-free mammalian cell culture media, and resuspended in mammalian cell culture media at the indicated MOI. A fixed volume was then added to each well. Cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 201 × g to synchronize infection. The cells were then incubated with the bacteria for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Following this incubation, the cells were washed at room temperature with 1× PBS, and cell growth medium with 10% serum was added with 20 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria. The cells were then harvested at the indicated time point to collect bacteria for colony-forming units or to collect protein lysates for SDS-PAGE analysis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in DMEM with Glutamax (Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transformed through transfection (Fugene HD, Promega) with a plasmid containing the SV40 Large T antigen. Retrovirus was generated by transfection of Phoenix cells (ATCC CRL-3213) with pBabe puro GFP-LC3 (Plasmids listed in Supplementary Data 6) using Fugene HD. In all, 1.5 ml of collected virus was mixed with 500 μl of conditioned media of MEFs supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Millipore), and applied to MEFs. Virus was collected and applied to MEFs in the presence of polybrene (Millipore) as described (in the protocol "Production of retroviruses using Fugene 6" from the Weinberg lab on Addgene). Cells were then selected using 2 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days. The population of cells that survived puromycin treatment was expanded and tested for GFP-LC3 expression. For maintenance, cells were initially grown without puromycin, however, we observed that the USP18 C61A/C61A cells with GFP-LC3 would lose expression over time, likely due to deleterious levels of autophagy, therefore we were required to maintain the cells in puromycin. Overexpression systems in tissue culture. Huh-7 cells (obtained from the laboratory of Eliane Meurs at Institut Pasteur) were transfected (Fugene HD, Promega) with 0.5 µg of myc-mTOR or myc-mTOR K2066R. Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were starved without amino acids with HBSS Ca 2+ + Mg 2+ + medium for 4 h. Cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 (100 nM) for 30 min and subsequently lysed with 1× RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with Complete Mini Protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). HEK293T (obtained from Prof. Sven Eyckerman) or HeLa (obtained from ATCC-CCL2™) cells were grown to~80% confluence in DMEM + 10% FBS and 1% P/S before being transfected with E1/E2/E3, and HA-ISG15-LRGG or HA-ISG15-LRAA using polyethylenimine (PEI). After 24 h, they were transfected with mGpi1-FLAG, GFP-MYH9, or eGFP-HSP90-β for another 24 h or 48 h. Plasmids used: pcDNA3.1-HA-ISG15, pcDNA3.1-HA-ISG15-LRAA, pcDNA3.1-hUbe1L (E1), pcDNA3.1-UbcM8 (E2), pcDNA3.1-Ubch8 (E2), pTriEx2-hHERC5 (E3), pCMV6-mGpi1-FLAG (Origene), pCMV-GFP-MYH9, pEGFP-HSP90-β (Supplementary Data 6). Cell lines are tested for mycoplasma prior to expansion in the laboratory, and subsequently 2-3 times per year or if they exhibit symptoms (slow growth, increased cell death following transfection or infection). We did not use ICLAC cell lines in this study, but two cell lines (HEK293T and HeLa) were authenticated by PCR single-locus technology by Eurofins on March 20, 2019.
