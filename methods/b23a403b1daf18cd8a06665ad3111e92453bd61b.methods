Organisms and cultivation S. cerevisiae ATCC 32167 was purchased from ATCC. S. cerevisiae deletion mutants with the parental phenotype BY4742 Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 were obtained from Open Biosystems (Heidelberg, Germany). The derived yeast deletion mutants Δlsm1 Δpat1 and Δdhh1 are resistant to the antibiotic geneticin and exhibit auxothrophies for histidine, leucine, lysine and uracil. Yeast cells were grown on YPD-agar plates (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/ l peptone, 20 g/l glucose) containing 200 mg/l Geneticin. Cultivation was carried out first on complex YPD-medium at 30°C followed by a second pre-culture on defined synthetic medium containing (NH) 4 [12] . The main culture was carried out in defined synthetic medium using 1000 ml baffled shake flasks. The same medium without additional amino acids and uracil was also used for the cultivation of S. cerevisiae ATCC 32167 that is the wild type of the used reference strain BY4742. For inter-strain comparison of intracellular metabolite concentrations, two parallel cultures were grown, and three samples were taken during the exponential growth phase. Cells were harvested at optical densities between 2 and 3. Exponential growth was observed for at least 30 min after taking samples for metabolite extraction to ensure that no changes in cell metabolism occurred, due to substrate limitation effects.
