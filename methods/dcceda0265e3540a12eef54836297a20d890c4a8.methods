Fabrication of swCNT-FET. We fabricated FETs using p-type single-walled CNTs swCNTs. A suspension of swCNTs was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of swCNTs (Hanwha, Korea) in 50 ml of 1,2-dichlorobenzene. To pattern the swCNT channel on a silicon dioxide wafer, an OTS self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique was used. AZ5214 photoresist was patterned on the silicon oxide wafer using conventional photolithographic techniques. The wafer was then placed in a solution of OTS (1:500, v/v in hexane) for 5 min to form the OTS SAM on the wafer. The OTS-coated wafer was then dipped in acetone to remove the AZ5214 patterns, which resulted in an OTS-patterned wafer. The OTS-patterned wafer was then placed in the swCNT solution for 30 s, and rinsed using 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The swCNTs were then selectively absorbed onto the bare silicon dioxide regions, whereas the OTS SAM regions blocked the absorption of the swCNTs. Source and drain electrodes (Au/Pd, 30 nm/10 nm) were fabricated using conventional photolithography, thermal evaporation and lift-off. The source and drain electrodes were passivated using photoresist. Further details of swCNT-FETs can be found in Lee et al. 29 . Preparation of the test virus, antibodies and mixed solutions. Bacteriophage MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) and anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein antibody were used as the target virus and specific antibody. Bacteriophage MS2 is commonly used in aerosol experiments as a surrogate for human and animal viruses 30 . Bacteriophage MS2 is nonpathogenic, can be prepared in high concentrations, is ideal for detection in aerosol experiments, and responds to antimicrobial agents in a manner that is similar to human viruses 31 . Escherichia coli strain C3000 (ATTCC 15597) was selected as the host bacterium. To recover bacterial cells from a freeze-dried state, 10 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) were mixed with the freeze-dried bacterial cells. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with agitation. A total of 0.1 ml of the incubated bacterial solution was injected into another 10 ml of TSB. The TSB solution containing the bacteria was then used as the host bacterial solution following incubation for 6 h at 37 °C with agitation. TSB (1 ml) was injected into the freeze-dried MS2 virus, and 0.1 ml of the viral solution was extracted. The extracted solution was mixed with 0.3 ml of the host bacterial solution and 29 ml of soft tryptic soy agar (TSA), containing 8 g/l agar. The resulting agar solution was poured into a Petri dish and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The surface of the agar was removed using 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.0. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 5,000 g, and the supernatant was used as the virus solution in subsequent experiments. The virus solution was diluted using PBS to control the number concentration of the virus particles. Virus solutions with virus: antibody number concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1:1, 1:1, and 10:1 were prepared. Influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain A /Beijing/262/95 (8IN73-2, HyTest, Finland) was prepared for universality test. H1N1 virus solution was prepared with 10 ml of PBS and 120 μ l of H1N1 virus stock, Anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein antibodies (ABE76, Millipore, Germany) and monoclonal mouse anti-influenza virus type A (3IN5, HyTest, Finland) were used. The MS2 coat protein of bacteriophage is an RNA-binding protein that assembles into a pentameric structure to form the phage shell. The MS2 coat protein binds to a stem-loop structure in the viral RNA and facilitates packaging of RNA molecules into viral capsids. In addition, it represses synthesis of the viral replicase enzyme. The MS2 coat protein is widely used as an experimental model for the study of RNA-protein interactions that are involved in virus assembly. With the H1N1 antibodies, hybridoma clones were derived from hybridization of Sp2/0 myeloma cells with spleen cells form BALB/c mice immunized with purified influenza virus type A strain H1N1. Two antibody solutions were prepared: one from 10 ml of PBS and 120 μ l of anti-enterobacteriophage MS2 coat protein stock, and the other from 2.5 ml of PBS and 195 μ l of H1N1 antibody stock. The virus and antibody solutions were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Information. ' After the mixed solution was prepared, the particles were aerosolized using the following procedure. Compressed air was passed through a clean air supply consisting of an oil trap, a diffusion dryer, and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. The particle-free compressed air then entered a Collison-type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA), containing the mixture. The aerosol flow rate was controlled using a rotameter. Dry, clean air flowed at 2 lpm, forming a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop from this jet was used to draw the mixed solution up through a tube, which was then broken into droplets due to the high-velocity air jet. The resulting larger droplets impinged on an impactor, whereas the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized mixed solution was passed through a diffusion dryer to remove water and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution. The neutralized particles entered a unipolar aerosol charger, with a stainless-steel needle (wire) electrode located at the center, which was used to generate a corona discharge at the sharp tip. The corona discharge generated air ions, which moved along the electric field to a grounded cylinder (made of duralumin). The charge per particle was controlled using a direct current (DC) voltage supplied from a high-voltage power supply. A bias of − 8 kV was applied to the needle to charge the particles. Details of the charger are described in Park et al. 32 . The charged particles (i.e., virus, antibody, virus-antibody) then entered a 30-cm-long cylindrical nozzle (6 mm in diameter), which was used to induce a fully developed flow to minimize the entrance effect at the nozzle (which had a Reynolds number of Re = 700). The nozzle filet had a radius of curvature of 2 mm at the tip to minimize the electric field 33 . After the charged particles were ejected from the nozzle, they were guided by an electric field and deposited on the substrate, which was located on an electrode that was biased at 7 kV. The separation between the nozzle and the substrate was 10 mm. The swCNT-FET was located where only the virus-antibody bound particles were deposited (i.e., in Zone 2). The virus-antibody bound particles were deposited on the channel of the swCNT-FET, which led to a decrease in the source-drain current in the swCNT-FET. To measure the current, the swCNT-FET was connected to a semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200, Keithley, USA). A back-gated biasing method was used; the gate bias was varied in the range − 3 V to + 3 V, and a constant source-drain bias of 100 mV was applied. Aerosol sampling was carried out upstream of the nozzle. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system was used to characterize the size distribution of the particles, which consisted of a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, 3081, TSI, USA) and a condensation particle counter (CPC, 3025, TSI, USA), which could measure the diameter in the range 4-165 nm. The SMPS system was operated with a sample flow rate of 0.3 lpm and a scan time of 180 s. Average particle charge. The average particle charge was characterized by measuring the electric current resulting from the charged aerosol using an aerosol electrometer (3068A, TSI, USA), which consisted of a Faraday cup and an electrometer. Particles in the sample flow were collected in a high-efficiency conductive filter housed in a metal enclosure, which constituted the Faraday cup. Charged aerosols entered the instrument through an outer metal housing, which shielded the electrometer input from external electric fields. An absolute filter was used to remove the charged particles from the air stream, which was enclosed in an inner metal housing and electrically insulated from the outer metal housing. A signal feed connected the filter to the input of a solid-state electrometer amplifier. The electrometer had an analog output voltage range of 0-10 V, which corresponded to a maximum current of − 12.5 to +12.5 pA. An ion trap was used to remove free unattached ions, and to enable charged particles to pass through the ion trap zone, where the ion trap voltage was 200 V 34 . The average charge number of charged particles was calculated as follows: where I is the measured current, Q is the flow rate, and N is the total number concentration of charged particles. The average charge number was also calculated using the following expression 24 where v i,rms = 240 m/s is the mean thermal speed of gaseous air ions, K E = 9.010 9 Nm 2 /C 2 is the electrostatic constant of proportionality, k B is Boltzmann's constant, d is the mean particle diameter, T is temperature, and t = 0.0133 s is the particle residence time. The concentration of corona-generated air ions was determined as follows: where I C = 1.21 × 10 −7 A is the corona current, Z i = 1.6 cm 2 /Vs is the mobility of the gaseous ions, and A = 9.84 × 10 −7 m 2 is the internal surface area of the ground electrode.
