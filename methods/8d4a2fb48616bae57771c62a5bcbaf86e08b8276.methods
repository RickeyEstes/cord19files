Data and Samples Collected on the Plane. Passenger and crew movements. Our study team flew on 10 flights, mostly on Boeing 757 aircraft, of 3.5-to 5-h duration between Atlanta and five destinations on the US West Coast. Eight of the 10 flights occurred during the traditionally recognized annual influenza season (October 2012 to March 2013), while two other flights occurred in May 2013. On each flight, 10 public health and nursing graduate students recorded all movements of passengers and crew in the economy cabin using a specially designed iPad app. The graduate student researchers sat in paired aisle seats and were responsible for recording the movement in their "virtual zone," which consisted of their row and the four rows in front of them. The Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) determined that IRB review of this study was not necessary. Environmental sampling. Another member of our research team operated two air-sampling pumps that sampled the cabin air in the back of the plane (the "dirtiest air in the cabin" according to a Boeing engineer). One pump operated continuously and the other operated during five 30-min intervals (including boarding and deplaning). Both pumps sampled at 3.5 L/s, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health protocol for stationary sampling and approximately the normal breathing rate of adults. Other members of our research team took swabs of the door handles (inside and outside) of a randomly chosen aft lavatory, as well as swabs of the tray table (both sides) and seat-belt buckle in two randomly chosen seats. All samples were taken before passenger boarding and again after all passengers had deplaned. Movement Reconstruction. After each flight, the movement observations were collated from the separate observation zones. Research assistants then aggregated, cleaned, and prepared the data for analysis of behaviors, movements, and ultimately time-delimited contact networks. Laboratory Analysis. Environmental samples were sent to a highly qualified molecular biology laboratory, which performed on all air samples a comprehensive qPCR respiratory virus panel assay for a broad range of respiratory viruses and subtypes representing the majority of circulating respiratory disease-causing pathogens. More detail on the methods are given in SI Methods. Data and software for the simulations are available at dx.doi.org/10.15139/S3/OOYETQ. Fig. 4 . This seating heat map shows the probability of an infectious crew member infecting each of the other passengers (square) and crew members (circle) when the probability of infection is set at 0.0045 per 1 min of contact. In this example, other crew members are at highest risk, followed by passengers seated in aisle and middle seats.
