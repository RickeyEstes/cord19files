Sample collection, RNA extraction, and PEDV detection Small intestine or stool specimens were obtained from suckling piglets, post-weaning piglets, and sows presenting acute watery diarrhea at pig farms in Japan, between December 2013 and February 2016. Intestinal samples were collected from dead piglets, and fecal samples were non-invasively collected immediately after excretion. Thus, no aggressive actions toward the pigs were carried out for sampling purpose. Samples of two major vaccine strains that have been employed in Japan, P5-V (Nisseiken Co., Ltd) and 96-P4C6 (Kaketsuken Co., Ltd., Japan), were collected from commercial vaccine bottles used in the swine farms. Sample preparation, RNA extraction, and PEDV detection were performed as previously described [23] . Japanese field samples may contain both PEDV variants with large deletions in the 5′terminus of the S gene and PEDV strains with an intact S gene [24] . Due to the complexity in discriminating, isolating, and individually sequencing PEDV strains, only specimens containing PEDVs with an intact S gene were used in our study. Finally, 45 PEDV-positive field samples were collected from 37 farms, located in five different prefectures in Japan. These samples, along with the two vaccine samples described above, were sequenced to determine the full-length sequence of the S, M, and N genes ( Table 1) . All these field PEDVs were confirmed to possess an intact 5′-terminus of the S gene, showing only the expected prominent single DNA band from PCR products on a 1.2% agarose gel [24] .
