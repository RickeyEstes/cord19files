Stochastic and deterministic SIRV-type epidemic models in which individuals are susceptible (S), infected and infectious (I 1 or I 2 ), recovered and immune (R), or (partially) protected against infection by antiviral prophylactic treatment (V) form the basis of the analyses. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the model. Details are given in Text S1. Throughout susceptible individuals enter the population by birth. The (natural) death rate of susceptible and recovered individuals is denoted by m, and the excess mortality while on antiviral treatment is given by c. Hence, life expectancy is m 21 in the absence of infection and antiviral control, and (m+c) 21 while on antiviral drugs. In the infected classes (I 1 and I 2 ) the excess death rates resulting from infection are given by n and n(12AVE I ), where AVE I is the antiviral efficacy for infectiousness and virulence. In the following, c and n will be referred to succinctly as the cost of antiviral prophylaxis and infection. From the susceptible class individuals move to the protected and infected classes at rates s and l. The parameter l is colloquially called the force of infection, and it depends on the prevalence of infection (Text S1). Individuals in class V are infected at a reduced rate l(12AVE S ), where AVE S denotes the antiviral efficacy for susceptibility. This implies that individuals in class V cannot be infected at all if AVE S = 1, while the antiviral drug provides no protection against infection if AVE S = 0. Finally, the rates of recovery and non-compliance are given by a and r, respectively. An overview of the model parameters and their default values is given in Table 1 . Details of the model analyses are provided in Text S1.
