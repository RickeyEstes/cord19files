Peptides were synthesised on an Applied Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesiser (ABI, Framingham, MA, USA) by standard Fmoc/2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) methods, purified to homogeneity by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC: Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and characterised with a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer (ABI Voyager DE, Foster City, CA). The peptide sequences are shown in table 1. Biotinylated CP-1 and NP-1 were prepared by addition of biotin with HBTU to the N-termini of the peptides during their synthesis. The inhibitory activity of the synthetic peptides on SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells was assessed as previously described. 26 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue-culture infectious dose) of SARS-CoV WHU strain (accession number AY394850) was mixed with an equal volume of a peptide at graded concentrations and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The mixture was added to monolayers of Vero E6 cells in 96-well tissue-culture plates. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, the supernatants were removed and fresh medium was added. On day 3 after infection, the cytopathic effect was recorded and the concentrations of the peptides resulting in 50% inhibition (IC 50 ) were calculated. To measure the binding affinity or kinetic dissociation constant of the SARS-CoV related peptides, we used surface plasmon resonance with an optical biosensor (model BIA 2000, BIAcore Inc, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Biotinylated CP-1 (2 mol/L) was immobilised on streptavidin sensor chips (BIAcore). A surface reference to which no biotinylated CP-1 was bound was included in the analysis. The derivatised sensor chips were washed and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7·4, 20 L/min), and the peptides to be tested were introduced at five serial dilutions in running buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7·4, and 0·005% P20) in 200 L injection volumes and at a flow rate of 20 L/min. conformation via HR1 and HR2 interaction to form a fusogenic hexameric core structure, which brings the viral and target-cell membranes into close proximity, resulting in fusion between them. At the intermediate state, a C-peptide can bind the viral gp41 HR1 region and block formation of the SIX-HELIX BUNDLE, thus inhibiting virus fusion with the target cell. 20 The discovery of these HIV-1 fusion-inhibitory peptides launched a new line of investigation of viral fusogenic mechanisms and identification of antiviral peptides against infection by many other enveloped viruses-simian 21 and feline 22 immunodeficiency viruses, Ebola virus, 23 Newcastle disease virus, 24 and respiratory syncytial virus. 25 Similarly to HIV-1 gp41, the S2 domain of SARS-CoV spike protein contains HR1 and HR2 sequences, which tend to form a coiled-coil structure (figure 1). The association, followed by 15 min of dissociation. The sensogram response data were analysed by commercial software (BIA-Evaluation version 3.1), and the kinetic dissociation constant was calculated. Each experiment was done at least three times. The secondary structure of the peptides was determined by circular-dichroism spectroscopy as previously described. 27 The isolated peptides or peptide mixtures were diluted in phosphate buffer (50 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 7·2) at the final concentration of 10 mol/L, and the circular-dichroism spectra were acquired on a spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc, Japan) at 4°C with a bandwidth of 5·0 nm, resolution 0·1 nm, path length 0·1 cm, response time 4·0 s, and scanning speed 50 nm/min. Thermal denaturation was monitored at 222 nm by application of a thermal gradient of 5°C/min. The spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent. The melting curve was smoothed and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated with Jasco software utilities as previously described. 28 The apparent molecular masses of the peptides and peptide mixtures were measured by SEDIMENTATION EQUILIBRIUM analysis on a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with a real-time video-based data-acquisition system and Rayleigh optics. The peptides were run at three initial concentrations (250 mol/L, 500 mol/L, and 1000 mol/L) in 10 mmol/L sodium phosphate, pH 7·2, containing 150 mmol/L sodium chloride and 5 mmol/L tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Sample volumes of 110 L were used in six-sector cells equipped with quartz windows. All experiments were done at 25°C, and sedimentation equilibrium data were collected at 48 000 rpm (167 731ϫg) for NP-1, 35 000 rpm (89 180ϫg) for CP-1, and 25 000 rpm (45 500ϫg) for CP-1/NP-1 complex. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were edited by the program REEDIT (Jeff Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Center, Storrs, CT, USA) and analysed by a non-linear, least-squares method with the program WINNONLIN. 29 The values of the partial specific volumes for the peptides were calculated from the aminoacid composition with the program SEDNTERP (David Hayes, Magdalen College, Oxford, UK; Tom Laue, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA; John Philo, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). Native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) was done as previously described. 30 The isolated peptides and peptide mixtures at indicated concentrations were mixed with Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at a ratio of one to one and were then loaded (25 L each well) on a 10ϫ1 cm Tris-glycine precast gel (18%). Gel electrophoresis was carried out with constant 125 V at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue. The image was taken by a FluorChem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp, San Leandro, CA, USA). In another set of experiments, mixtures of NP-1 and biotinylated CP-1 were analysed by N-PAGE as described above. The peptides in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, Piscataway, NJ, USA), which was blocked with 3% non-fat milk at 4ºC overnight, followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, the membrane was stained with 3,3Ј-diaminobenzidine dye and the image was taken as described above. A Bio-Sil SEC 125-5 column (300ϫ7·8 mm, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for size-exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC) to assess oligomer formation. 30 The HR1derived peptide was incubated with HR2-derived peptide (final concentration of peptide 50 mol/L) at 37ºC for 30 min, and then a 20 L sample was injected into the column connected to an HPLC system (Waters Delta 600, Milford, MA, USA). Phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7·2) was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1·0 mL/min. The ultraviolet absorbance at 195-320 nm was recorded with a photodiode array detector (Waters 996). A Bio-Rad gel-filtration R12000 processor (sgi, Mountain View, CA, USA). The models were optimised with the "Refine 3" option in Modeller, which uses conjugated gradient together with molecular dynamics by simulated annealing techniques. Five models for each run were built, and the model with the lowest objective function was selected. The protein geometry was verified by Quanta Protein Health Check, and the resulting model was evaluated further for its stereochemical properties by Procheck software. 34 We used the docking program GRAMM 35 to model the interactions between NP-1 and CP-1 peptides. This docking algorithm predicts the structure of a protein (peptide) complex by maximising the geometric match of the images of two protein (peptide) molecules. The details of the docking approach have been described elsewhere. 36 Role of the funding source The funding source had no role in study design; collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; the writing of the report; or the decision to submit it for publication.
