Viral particle purification and extraction for GS FLX sequencing. A volume of 500 ml from 92 respiratory aspirates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 mins to pellet any cellular debris. The supernatant was then collected and passed through a 0.45 mM sterile filter (Millipore) at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes for further removal of cellular material and bacterial sized particles. The filtrates were collected and spun in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Optima LE-80) at 32,000 rpm for two hours at 8uC. Sample supernatant was discarded, and viral particles resuspended with 110 ml of Hanks buffered saline. Subsequently, the filtrates were treated with a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes that included Turbo DNase (Ambion), Baseline ZERO (Epicentre), Benzonase (Novagen), RNase A (Fermentas) in a x1 Turbo DNase reaction buffer to remove unprotected nucleic acids as previously described 18 . Viral nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Respiratory virome library construction for GS FLX sequencing. Nucleic acid extracts from each sample were treated separately in either 'RNA only' or an 'RNA and DNA' sequence-independent amplification route as described previously 18, 43 . Briefly, 10 ml of extracted nucleic acids was incubated with DNase (Ambion) for an RNA virus-only enrichment. For the RNA and DNA enrichment the nuclease treatment step was omitted. Both reactions were then reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and 100 mM of a distinct random primer consisting of a 20-bp nucleotide sequence at the 5' end and a randomized octamer sequence at the 3' end. Following reverse transcription, the cDNA was made double stranded by using a single round of Klenow fragment polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR amplification was performed in duplicate for both the RNA and RNA plus DNA fractions by using primers consisting of only the 20-bp fixed portion of the random primer. This resulted in a total of four PCR reactions per sample, which was subsequently pooled and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and the DNA concentration determined by nanodrop (Thermo scientific). The amplified products were run on a 2% agarose gel, yielding a DNA smear. Fragments of approximately 500 to 1000-bp were excised from the gel, and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Equimolar concentrations of amplified samples were pooled and built into two separate DNA libraries and run on the GS FLX titanium platform (454 Life Sciences). GS FLX pyrosequencing read analysis. Sequence reads were filtered through sequence similarity to local human (human genome hg18) and ribosomal sequence databases using BLAT. Remaining filtered reads were then identified and binned according to the different PCR primers used to amplify the sample. Each read was subsequently trimmed of the primer consisting of a fixed 20-bp nucleotide sequence and an adjacent 8-bps representative of the random portion of the primer. All filtered reads were later mapped against the European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI) viral and phage genome reference databases (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) using ssaha2 for taxonomic identification 44 . Additionally, filtered binned reads were built into contigs using Newbler, and taxonomically identified by comparison to GenBank (best hit) as bacterial, viral or unknown using BLASTn and BLASTx searches. A cutoff off value of # 10 25 was used for determination of the significance of a hit. Any sequence with an E value of . 10 25 was deemed unclassifiable and removed. Viral particle purification and extraction for PacBio RS sequencing. Complete genome sequencing of the divergent HPIV4 (sampe 459) was performed through a metagenomic framework and sequenced on the PacBIO RS. The viral particles were treated in a manner like the 454 sequencing experiment, but with a few notable exceptions. Three aliquots of 150 ml of respiratory sample was clarified and filtered in a 0.45 mM sterile filter (Costar) as described above. Nuclease treatment employed double the concentration previously described 18 . All other experimental processes up to and including the PCR product pooling and purification was performed alike the 454-processing-pipeline with the exception that 8 amplifications (x4 RNA only and x4 RNA plus DNA) were performed. Subsequently, the purified DNA products were measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen), built into libraries and sequenced. PacBio RS library construction and sequencing. Small fragments (,100 bp) in the DNA sample were removed prior to library construction with one purification of 1.8 3 volumes of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics) as per the manufacturers instructions. Fragment size assessment and quantification was verified using a Bioanalyzer 2100 with DNA 7500 chemistry (Agilent). A single SMRTbell library was generated using standard reagents and protocols (overhang ligation protocol). As the input fragments are significantly smaller than those previously tested on the PacBio RS, we sequenced the library at 5 different on-chip concentrations (80 pM, 40 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5 pM). PacBio RS sequence analysis. Total sequence output from the five SMRTcells was then filtered by mapping against five HPIV reference genomes (HPIV1 -NC_003461.1, HPIV2 -NC_003443.1, HPIV3 -NC_001796.2, HPIV4a -AB543336.1, HPIV4b -EU627591.1) using BLASR. To increase the stringency of the bioinformatic approach, mapped HPIV4 reads were further filtered on a minimum pass accuracy of 80% and minimum read length of 100-bp. Assembly of filtered reads into contigs was subsequently achieved using the Allora software 45 then taxonomically identified using BLASTn by comparison to GenBanks non-redundant database. Sanger sequencing. Primer walking and Sanger sequencing was additionally used to obtain the full genome of HPIV4_DK(459) and for confirmation of the amplified 57 nucleotide insert. All homologs (singlet reads and contigs from GS FLX data) matching HPIV4_DK(459) were aligned with the four currently available HPIV4 genomes in GenBank (HPIV4a -accession numbers AB543336.1, HPIV4baccession numbers EU627591.1, AB543337.1, JQ241176.1) using Geneious v5.4.2 software 46 . Multiple primer sets were designed from the alignment, including consensus primers to fill the ends of the sequences and any significantly large gaps within the genome. Primers were designed using Primer3 47 and prepared by Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg Germany (Supplementary Table S2 ). Amplification of each viral target was achieved by using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a 50 ml reaction volume. The final reaction mixture contained 1x OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 400 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 2.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.6 mM of each primer, and 2 ml of OneStep RT PCR enzyme mix. PCR cycling conditions varied depending on the estimated size of the amplified product (Supplementary Table S2 ). Amplified material was sent to Macrogen (The Netherlands) for purification and Sanger sequencing in both directions by following the companies recommendations and use of the same PCR amplification primers for sequencing. Following full genome recovery, sequenced fragments were aligned to the four reference genomes and then assembled using Geneious v5.4.2 46 . To compare genome coverage between GS FLX and PacBio RS, unfiltered GS FLX and PacBio reads were mapped against the Sanger sequences obtained by Primer Walking using ssaha2 44 . Using the pileup feature in samtools 48 , the number of reads with base calls divergent from the consensus were recorded and plotted along with coverage. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) of divergent HPIV4. Nucleic acid extraction. Viral RNA was extracted from respiratory secretions using the MagNa Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics) on the KingFisher semi-automated magnetic particle processor (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturers instructions. For quality control purposes, two negative template controls (one per plate) were simultaneously extracted in each KingFisher run, where sample was replaced with sterile water (Ambion). Nucleic acid extractions from each respiratory secretion or negative template control were then stored at -20uC in RNase free microfuge tubes. Multiplexed real-time PCR primers, probes and positive controls. Aligned pyrosequencing data (described above) was used to design a multiplexed TaqMan qPCR assay for qualitative detection of a 61 bp fragment matching the HN gene in HPIV4_DK(459). All real-time primers and probes (Supplementary Table S6 ) were designed using Primer3 software 48 and prepared by Pentabase (Odense Denmark). To ensure analytical performance, a synthetic DNA control was designed consisting of the same primer and probe sites for the HPIV4 target (HN real-time assay not insert real-time PCR assay) and an additional 5 S ribosomal RNA sequence for distinction between real and false positives. The DNA oligonucleotide was ordered from Pentabase (Odense Denmark), (59CAAACCCATTGGTGTTATACCCAGTAGTTTGATT-GCTAGATGCAGGGTCTGCACAGTTGTGCAGTGTCTGCACATCCTTGTAG-GAGTCGTGCGTCGATGAAGAACGCAAGTGCAATCAATATGTATCACTAG-GAACC39). Real-time PCR 'insert' assay. A real-time RT-PCR assay was also designed on the aligned genomes (using Geneious) 46 of all five completely sequenced HPIV4 strains. The primers were designed using the same software (as above) and prepared by TAG Copenhagen (Copenhagen Denmark). Real-time PCR assays. All real-time RT-PCR assays used 5 ml of template nucleic acids from each respiratory sample to 20 ml of reaction mix. The reaction mix was made using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and contained 5X OneStep reverse transcription (RT)-PCR buffer, 400 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 2.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.1 mM of the TaqMan probe and 1 ml of OneStep RT PCR enzyme mix. PCR cycling consisted of an initial cDNA synthesis step at 50uC for 30 min followed by an initial denaturation step at 95uC for 15 min and then 45 cycles of amplification at 95uC for 15 s, 55uC for 60 s and 72uC for 15 s. Real-time amplification was performed on the Roche LC480 light cycler. Negative template controls and multiple diluted positive controls were simultaneously run in all (HN assay only) real-time PCR reactions. Phylogenetic analysis. Human parainfluenza viruses type 4 (HPIV4). Alignment of the full Sanger sequenced genome of isolate HPIV4_DK(459) and all the four other available HPIV4 reference genomes, as well as all coding regions, individually and concatenated, were achieved using the MAFFT plug-in 49 in Geneious 46 with subsequent visual inspection and manual correction. Signs of saturation on the third www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 2468 | DOI: 10.1038/srep02468 codon postion of the alignments were tested using DAMBE 50 , but none were found. Nucleotide substitution models were chosen using the Bayesian Information criterion in ModelGenerator 51 and Maximum likelihood trees built using the PHYML plugin 52 in Geneious with 1000 bootstrap replicates. All trees were visually inspected and annotated using the FigTree graphical viewer interface version 1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) including mid-point rooting for clarity.
