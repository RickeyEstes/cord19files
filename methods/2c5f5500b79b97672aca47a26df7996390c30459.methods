Study subjects. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive adult patients admitted with respiratory disease between November 2015 and December 2016 at Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital in Seoul, South Korea. In total, 422 cases of PTB and CAP were identified. Of these, intensive care unit admission cases due to severe respiratory failure or shock (n = 122), referred cases already receiving therapy (n = 20), and readmission cases (n = 4) were excluded. Finally, 277 patients with PTB (n = 62) and CAP (n = 215) who were admitted to the general ward were included in the analysis. The Institutional Review Board of the Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital approved this study and permitted the review and publication of patient records. The requirement for informed consent by individual patients was waived due to the retrospective design of the study. The diagnosis of PTB was considered definitive when: (1) microbiological examination (acid-fast bacillus stain, polymerase chain reaction, or acid-fast bacillus culture) using respiratory tract specimens confirmed infection with M. tuberculosis 3, 19 ; or (2) the patient's clinical presentation met the criteria for clinical active PTB established by the World Health Organization, when microbiological tests for tuberculosis were negative 20 . Tuberculosis pleurisy was defined when the lymphocytic exudate with pleural fluid adenosine deaminase level was ≥40 U/L and clinical improvement was observed after anti-tuberculosis treatment. CAP was defined as the presence of a new infiltrate on chest radiography without evidence of PTB plus at least one of the following: (1) respiratory symptoms including cough, sputum, dyspnea, or pleuritic chest pain; (2) fever (body temperature ≥38.0 °C) or hypothermia (body temperature <35.0 °C); or (3) abnormal breath sounds on auscultation 21 . Delta neutrophil index measurement. The DNI value was automatically calculated by cell analyzer, as previous studies described 14, 15, 22, 23 . The DNI value was measured in peripheral blood using an automatic cell analyzer (ADVIA 2120 Hematology System, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Forchheim, Germany). After red blood cell lysis, cell size and stain intensity were measured by the tungsten-halogen-based optical system of the MPO channel to count and differentiate granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes based on their size and MPO content. This was followed by cell counting and classification according to size, lobularity, and nuclear density, using the laser diode-based optical system of the lobularity nuclear density channel counted. The DNI value was calculated by the following formula and presented as a percentage (%): DNI = [neutrophil and the eosinophil subfractions measured in the MPO channel by a cytochemical MPO reaction] − [the polymorphonuclear neutrophil subfraction measured in the nuclear lobularity channel by the reflected light beam] 17 . Patient management and data collection. The microbiological etiologies of all patients suspected of having PTB or CAP were evaluated in peripheral blood, sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens, or pleural fluid using the following tests; microbiological culture for bacteria; a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for bacterial agents including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae etc.; a multiplex real-time PCR for common respiratory viruses; and a urinary antigen test for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila. The DNI value was routinely included in complete blood count tests at our institution, thus, initial DNI values before starting treatment for PTB and CAP were available for all patients. All data for clinical characteristics including age, gender, smoking history or underlying disease, laboratory examinations including the DNI, white blood cell (WBC) count, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and radiographic findings at the time of initial admission were collected anonymously. Statistical analysis. Data on categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages, and data on continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Data were compared using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the DNI for diagnosing PTB were calculated using standard definitions. The predictive value of inflammatory markers, including the DNI for PTB, was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated. Multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed to identify factors to predict PTB. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW software (ver. 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and a two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
