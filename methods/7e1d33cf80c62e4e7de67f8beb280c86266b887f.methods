Investigating Animal Contact Network Structure. Animal contact networks were constructed from position data recorded by a wireless remote location system in three pens of calves over 8 d (21, 21 , and 27 animals in pen #1, #2, and #3, respectively), as described in our previous study 20 (also a brief summary in SI methods), and were undirected in this study (i.e. animal i contacting animal j implied animal j contacting animal i simultaneously). All the experiments were approved by and complied with animal regulation policy of the Kansas State University. A contact was defined as whenever two animals were within a distance of 1 foot (,0.3 m, about the length of a calf head) in a fixed time interval (10 s), and if two animals were in contact for several consecutive intervals, each 10-s interval would be regarded as an individual contact. Therefore, the contact networks not only described whether two animals were in contact, but also explicitly measured how many contacts (and the total duration of contacts, since each contact lasted for a fixed 10 s) were made in each given period. In this study the total number of contacts of each individual were aggregated at an hourly level, as well as at a daily level, for comparison. Among various quantitative measurements of network structure, centrality measurements were used to differentiate relative importance of the individuals in the group [21] [22] [23] [24] . We computed degree centrality, which specifically measures the number of edges on a node (in this study, equivalent to one individual calf's total number of contacts with other animals in a 1-h period; one calf could have more than one contact with another calf in that period). The degree distributions of the contact networks at pen level (pen #1 through pen #3) and for all pens combined for the entire observation period were fitted with different probability distribution, including gamma and normal distributions with maximum likelihood methods, and the goodness of fit was determined by a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Contacts were further divided on hourly bases, and the degree distribution of hourly networks was computed and compared against that of the entire observation period. The degree order, which measures the order of individual degrees in the network (lowest number corresponding to 1, highest number corresponding to the number of cattle in the pen, in ascending order), was computed for each hour and averaged over the entire period (192 h) to investigate whether certain calves were consistently more active (consistently higher degree order) in the contact network throughout the time. A hypothetical population of animals with constant hourly degree order was simulated, and the distribution of summed contact of each pen and the hypothetical population was compared by the K-S test to investigate whether the observed network order was consistent through time. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to further test whether the degree distribution of the networks varied among different individuals in different pens and/or in different hours on different days. The hour factor was nested in the day and the individuals were nested in the pen. Furthermore, spectrum analysis was performed with timeSeries package in R to explore the periodic (within-day) change of the time series of aggregated degrees (number of total contacts of all calves in each pen) in the networks. The ANOVA and spectrum analysis focused on the number of contacts (network degree distribution) and did not reveal the internal structural change of the networks (e.g. correlation of two individual calves across two different hours). Thus a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was applied to further investigate the similarities between the networks in different hours in a day 25 . The QAP was designed to measure the structure similarity (e.g. nominal, ordinal, and interval associations, for both network topology and roles in individual node) between two networks with the same nodes (in our study, the same individual animals). The QAP was comprehensively applied between each pair of the networks in two different hours within the same day (total of 24 3 23/2 5 276 pairs per day). The entire day was divided into three different intervals based on number of contacts: low-contact intervals from 12 am to 5 am (at hourly interval, e.g. 12 am indicated 12 am to 1 am, and the same held thereafter); high-contact intervals during 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm; and the remaining hourly intervals were considered as having medium contact. The average percentage of similarity between low-contact intervals and other low-contact intervals (whenever P . 0.05 of QAPs) for all days across all three pens was calculated. The percentages of similarity between two high-contact intervals and between high-and low-contact intervals were also calculated. These results further measured and revealed the potential network structure change. To illustrate, the actual networks were plotted at four different hourly intervals in a given day (e.g., 2 am, 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm, corresponding to animal sleeping, feeding, and other social behaviors, on August 11, 2011, for each pen) for visualization of both temporal and individual heterogeneities. Modeling Direct Transmitted Pathogen Dynamics. As shown in the results section, the actual contact network was highly dynamic, featuring substantial individual and temporal heterogeneity. Compartmental models such as directly transmitted SIR type (susceptible-infected-recovered) usually assume a constant number of contacts over time and for any individual. Therefore, with the typical compartmental model, the underlying network corresponds to a regular random network 3 . However, because the assumption of same degree distribution over time and among individuals was not consistent with our analysis of the observed contact network, it was necessary to investigate how changes in the contact network could further impact disease dynamics quantitatively 26, 27 . To do so, the sources of heterogeneity (temporal change in degree distribution and individual rank) were incorporated in a simple discrete time, agent-based SIR-type model. The probability of infection of the i th susceptible individual in a time period t (b i,t ) was a function of the number of pairwise contacts and was proportional to number of infected animals (j) at t: where b 0 was the transmission coefficient (a constant), C ji,t represented the number of pairwise contacts of animal i in time t, I j,t and N t represented jth infected animal and total animals in time t, respectively. Because of the closed population, N t ; N for any given t. Thus we could re-organize the expression to b i,t~b 0 0 X j C ji,t I j,t . To simplify the model, recovery was considered independent of contact; an infected individual had a constant recovery probability (c) in any time, and once it recovered from the infected state, it would stay in the recovered state, assuming no leaking or waning immunity. Two sets of parameters, b ' 0~2 :5|10 {6 ; c~10 {3 and b ' 0~1 0 {5 ; c~2|10 {3 , were fed into the model, representing diseases with smaller and larger basic reproduction numbers (R 0 ). A total of 100 individuals were simulated with one infected at the beginning of simulation; the other 99 animals were initially susceptible. The simulation lasted for 100 days, with a 1-h time step. The hourly number of contacts for each individual was simulated from the fitted distribution (see SI figure 2) using the mean and variance of contacts in each hour, and the number of contacts was assumed frequency-dependent and independent of population size, according to the observed data (e.g. pen #3 had 27 animals but the number of contacts was not higher than pen #1 and pen #2, which both had 21 animals). We used this assumption to simplify the model, but as discussed later, the model could be altered to be density-dependent or for more complicated conditions for the specific disease system at hand. The degree order was simulated through a random permutation (from 1 to population size N 5 100) in each hour. The time series of mean disease prevalence, and contribution of new infection from each individual were investigated. A total of four conditions were simulated for comparison and 100 simulations were run for each condition. The first condition (C1) did not use temporal (mean contact number in each hour) nor degree order change, as a baseline scenario representing general model assumptions regarding the contact networks for infectious disease studies, such as constant number of contacts over time and among individuals. That is, if a certain individual had the highest contact number (degree order) at the first time interval (h) in the network, it would remain the most active during the entire period of the simulation. In this condition, individual variability still existed (however, the mean hourly contact number remained the same through simulation) and individual variability was simulated by the variance of the aggregated total observations across all three pens (69 animals) at that time interval; such variability determined the individual ranks. In contrast, condition C4 was simulated with both temporal network degree distribution and degree order changes to investigate the effects of these two sources of variability. Two more conditions were also simulated for further comparison. Condition (C2) assumed the mean contact number was the same at any time interval (hourly, h), but the degree order changed during the simulation (no temporal with order change). The simulation of the next condition (C3) incorporated temporal variability (change of number of contacts at an hourly basis using the observed contact network), but assumed the contact network degree order was static over time (temporal with no order change). The maximum prevalence and its associated occurrence day in each condition for each set of parameters were recorded, along with outbreak size (n), duration of outbreak (T f ), and basic reproduction number (R 0 ). The R 0 was numerically computed from the secondary infections in the simulations. To compare the complete dynamics among these four conditions (C1-C4), we computed the time series of the difference (D) of any two conditions a and b. Thus a total of six new time series, D 12 , D 13 , D 14 , D 23 , D 24 , and D 34 were calculated. Each of the new time series was fit to an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, with three parameters (p, d, q). If the fitted three parameters were 0, 0, 0, it indicated the difference between the two time series a and b resembled white noise; hence, those two time series were assumed to be similar. Otherwise, the two time series were statistically different. Besides the dynamics of prevalence, we also investigated individual contribution to new infections by computing the Gini coefficient, a parameter that quantified the heterogeneity in the group of individuals for the new infection. A homogeneous population would have a zero Gini coefficient, while a more heterogeneous system would give a higher Gini coefficient.
