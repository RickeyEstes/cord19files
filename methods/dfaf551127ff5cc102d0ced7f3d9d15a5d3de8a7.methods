A systematic literature review examined Chinese international health cooperation and global health agenda on infectious diseases prevention, control and elimination. In particular, challenges and opportunities related to Ebola and other emerging epidemics as well as health systems development issues, global health investment and support were reviewed. Referenced publications and extensive sources of data include books, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and webbased peers reviewed journal articles, government annual reports and conference proceedings, policy reports and conference papers. The books reviewed were related to health, public policy and international cooperation. The journal articles concern all of this paper's research areas since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the Third Ministerial conference from November, 2006 to December, 2015. Government documents came from the China-Africa partnership members, related countries' government agencies (e.g. Ministry of Health) and other international agencies and organizations, such as Global Fund, World Health Organization (WHO), The World Bank and The United Nations (UN). [10, 11] All review materials were published, and experts 'reports were assessed. Published papers on Chinese foreign diplomacy and policy reports and previous Chinese literature in relation to infectious diseases prevention and control and elimination programs, research and funding were reviewed to trace international health cooperation actions, information communication and strategies including Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) declarations on health development in 2013 and 2015 in Beijing and Cape Town respectively. [12, 13] Furthermore, screened abstracts of the citations were identified for potentially relevant studies and full text documents were obtained for relevant publications. The articles were scrutinized to ensure that multiple publications from the same study related to trade and commerce, socio-economic, science and technology transfer were excluded. This systematic literature search which identified 334 unique records were reviewed and 277 records were excluded based on review of the title and abstract. Overall, 57 full publications and 13 reports met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed ( Figure 1 ). www.mchandaids.org | Â© 2016 Global Health and Education Projects, Inc.
