We applied a simple susceptible-infected-recovery (SIR) model [2] to the data assuming an incubation period following its empirical distribution in the early stage of the outbreak in Japan. Experiences of Japanese people living in Wuhan until the outbreak provide information related to mild cases because complete laboratory surveillance was administered for them. During January 29 -February 17, 2020, 829 Japanese people returned to Japan from Wuhan. All had received a test to detect COVID-19; of them, 14 were found to be positive for COVID-19 [3] . Of those 14, 10 Japanese people had exhibited mild symptoms; the other 4 showed no symptom as of February 25. Moreover, two Japanese residents of Wuhan exhibited severe symptoms: one was confirmed as COVID-19. The other died, although no fatal case was confirmed as COVID-19 by testing. In addition, two Japanese residents of Wuhan with mild symptoms were refused re-entry to Japan even though they had not been confirmed as infected.

We therefore apply these proportions to the simulation. Assuming that the power of infectivity among severe patients and mild patients were equal among the asymptomatic cases, half of the symptomatic cases can be assumed. This assumption about relative infectiousness among asymptomatic cases compared with symptomatic cases was also assumed in simulation studies for influenza [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . We sought R 0 to fit the number of patients during 14 January -28 February and to minimize the sum of absolute values of discrepancies among the reported numbers and the fitted values. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the 10000 iterations of bootstrapping for empirical distribution. We used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showed any symptom in Japan for 14 January -8 March, 2020. During this period, 432 cases with onset dates occurred. We excluded some patients who had returned from China, and who were presumed to be infected persons from the Diamond Princess. They were presumed to be not community-acquired in Japan.

Therefore, published data of patients must be adjust at least a few days. To adjust it, we applied the following regression. We denote Xt-k|t as the number of patients whose onset date was t-k published on day t. The reporting delay multiplied by the latest published data are expected to be predictions of the number of patients whose onset date was t-k. We used this adjusted number of patients in the latest few days including those after VEC was adopted. We used the published data on 2,5,6, 9,10, 11 and 12 March,2020 by MLHW [1] . First, we estimated R 0 in Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before VEC was introduced. Then, using the adjusted data of patients, we estimated R v after VEC was adopted.
