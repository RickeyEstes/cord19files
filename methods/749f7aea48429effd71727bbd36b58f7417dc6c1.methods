In general, an ideal ventilation system should establish its optimal airflow pattern inside an isolation room, such that clean air from the airsupply vents may carry the air across infectious sources, and then flow through the exhaust vents completely. This paper investigates the airflow patterns associated with various ventilation arrangements, in order to develop an understanding of the effects of these arrangements on the regions of droplet fallout.
