This cross-sectional study is the part of a large quasiexperimental study conducted on Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in the year 2018 that are traveling through private hajj companies. The data set in this study was collected from January to November 2018. Various private Hajj companies were approached and invited to participate in the research. Pilgrims from companies who were willing to participate were met at the beginning of the weekly Hajj/Umrah orientation course. Pilgrims were included in the study if they are aged 18 years with or without any chronic medical conditions. The participants were briefed at the start of the session and informed written consent was given to them. A self-administered questionnaire was given to those participants who signed the informed consent form. The survey included pilgrims' demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, the highest level of education, comorbidities, respiratory illness prior to departing for the Holy Land and history of influenza (flu) vaccine (within the past 1 year) and pneumococcal vaccine (within the past 5 years). In this study, pilgrims were categorized into "at increased risk" as those in which influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine are strongly recommended i.e., pilgrims aged 50 years and above and/or had pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, diabetics, lung, or kidney diseases (28) . Aside these, other pilgrims and those less than the age of 50 years were classified as "non-risk pilgrims."
