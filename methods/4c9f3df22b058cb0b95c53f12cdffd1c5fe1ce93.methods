Molecular Modeling. The importance of p4a in viral pathogenesis and host immune evasion has been extensively investigated through in vitro assays; however, no structural studies have been conducted to unveil its RNA binding mechanism. MERS-CoV p4a is 109 amino acids long and contains an approximately 70-72 amino acid-long DSRM. To model the p4a DSRM, a template structure was searched against a PDB 40, 41 by BLAST and through the threading-based modeling server, I-TASSER. The template structures selected by BLAST and the I-TASSER server included the dsRNA binding proteins, 1YYK, 2L3J, and 1DI2. Most of these structures were resolved through NMR or X-ray diffraction studies in the presence of RNA duplexes or hairpins (synthetic or natural). T-COFFEE version 11.0 was used for pairwise alignment of 1YYK (template) and the p4a sequence. Initially, Modeller 42, 43 was used to build the protein model. Also, four other online tools including I-TASSER 44 , PHYRE 45 , Swiss model 46 , and CPH model 47 were used for comparative analysis and validation of the protein models. The best model was selected based on the minimum violation of atomic contacts and maximum score criteria. The quality and accuracy of the built model was further evaluated and validated using a Ramachandran plot 48 , QMEAN 49 , and ProSA 50 . Energy minimization was performed for model refinement and quality improvement using UCSF Chimera 51 . To add charges on standard amino acids, AMBER ff99SB force field was used while AM1BCC force field was applied to other residues. The steepest descent minimization steps were set to 100, whereas the conjugate gradient was set to 10 with a step size of 0.02 Å. The secondary structure of the modeled protein was validated using Protein Structure Validation Suite (PSVS) 52 and Protein Structure Evaluation Suite and Server (ProSESS) 53 . The secondary structure elements of the 3D model were compared with those of the predicted ones in order to measure the structural reliability. The selected p4a model was subjected to MD simulations to obtain a fully optimized and stable structure for further analysis (further discussed in the molecular dynamics section). To get the desired p4a-dsRNA complex, a 21-base pair long hairpin (dsRNA) 54 was selected from PDB and docked with the fully optimized p4a using the HEX docking server 55 . While predicting the functional annotation of the query protein, the same dsRNA structure (reported in PDB structure 2LK2) was suggested by I-TASSER, among the other top three suggested structures (1YYO, 2LK2, and 1DI2). The HEX docking method is based on the rigid body docking algorithm that explicitly considers the electrostatic potential, steric shape, and charge density of the protein 55 . Parameters used for docking were set to default except that the correlation type was set to shape and electrostatics. Intermolecular interactions were checked using UCSF Chimera 51 . Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis. In silico mutagenesis was performed using the MOE that calculates the dAffinity for a particular amino acid residue. The detailed mechanism of this alanine scanning mutagenesis approach has been discussed previously 56 . The MOE program also calculates dStability of a mutant complex with respect to a wild type amino acid residue. I-Mutant server 57 was also used to predict the changes in protein stability due to the mutations. It is a support vector machine-based server, which predicts the stability of a given protein after point mutations in terms of ΔΔG at the following physiological conditions: pH of 7.0 and temperature of 25 °C.
