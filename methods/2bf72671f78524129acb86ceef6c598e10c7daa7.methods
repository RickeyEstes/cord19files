Protein expression and purification. The west Pacific octopus (Octopus vulgaris) was purchased from local fish market and keep on ice during the transfer. The cDNA of the octopus was prepared by RNA extraction from lenses according to standard procedures 14 . One of the major S-crystallin cDNAs was then subcloned into pET-28a vector (Novagen). A fused protein with a N-terminal 6x His tag was then expressed by E. coli BL21 Rosetta (DE3) (EMD Millipore). Cultures were incubated overnight at 20 °C and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β -D -thiogalactopyranoside. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mM β -mercaptoethanol), lysed by sonication and then centrifuged to remove any insoluble lysate. The remaining soluble proteins were then passed through nickel affinity beads (Qiagen) and then the bound expressed protein was released. This protein was subjected to further purified by gel-filtration (Sephacryl S-100; GE Healthcare) chromatography using a running buffer of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and the solution was supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. Octopus digestive gland GST was purified by a single GSH-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography process that has been described previously 18, 26 . Briefly, octopus digestive gland (20 g) from an octopus was homogenized with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mM mercaptoethanol and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 4 °C and 80,000 g for 1 h. After filtration, the supernatant was further purified by GSH-Sepharose 4B affinity column. The fractions containing GST were pooled and supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C. All animal experiments conformed to the regulations drafted by Animal Protection Act in Taiwan and were approved by the laboratory animal center at National Yang-Ming University. Protein crystallization. Crystals of the S-crystallin Q108F mutant in complex with GSH were obtained at 22 °C by the sitting drop, vapor diffusion method. Initial crystal screens were set up after incubating the protein at 6 mg/ml in 7 mM GSH and 0.35 mM CDNB for 1 h. Poorly diffracting crystals were grown in 0.5% PEG8000, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 6.8 and 1.65 M ammonium sulfate in 3 days and these were used for microseeding. Single crystals of a hexagonal shape and with dimensions of 0.15 mm were obtained in less than a week. All crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and structure determination. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the SPXF beamline 13C1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan, R.O.C. using a ADSC Quantium-315r CCD detector (X-ray wavelength of 0.976 Å). The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL-2000 package 30 . The crystals belong to space group P6 4 The three different groups of S-crystallin are separated by the mutations at two residues F98 and N99 and by the insertion of a long loop between the α 4 and α 5 helices. Two other residues, V102 and F106, can be used to separate GST and the ancestral S-crystallin. With a longer α 4-α 5 loop and the four "key" mutations, major S-crystallins lose their GST activity but gain significantly increased GSH binding affinity. The binding of GSH to S-crystallin enhances its protein stability, which is beneficial for the life-span of the lens and the survival of cephalopods. According to previous studies 29 , there is between 2 mM and 10 mM GSH in animal lenses. Scientific RepoRts | 6:31176 | DOI: 10.1038/srep31176 The structure of S-crystallin was solved by the molecular replacement method by the program Molrep 31 using a simulated model for octopus S-crystallin 19 as the model. The atomic model was built using the program Coot 32 . Structure refinement was carried out using REFMAC 33 . The crystallographic information is summarized in Extended Data Table 1 . Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. The experiments were performed on an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) [34] [35] [36] . The sedimentation-velocity experiments were performed using a double-sector epon charcoal-filled centerpiece at 20 °C with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. Protein solutions of S-crystallin and its mutants (0.025-1.0 mg/ml) and a reference buffer (50 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) were loaded into the centerpiece. The absorbance at 230 or 280 nm was monitored in continuous mode with a time interval of 300 s and a step size of 0.003 cm. Multiple scans at different time intervals were then fitted to a continuous c(M) distribution model using SEDFIT 37,38 . Mutagenesis and kinetic studies. Site-specific mutants were designed based on the available sequence alignment and structural information. The mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. The primers used for site-specific mutations are summarized in Extended Data Table 2 . The GST activity of S-crystallin was determined by measuring the conjugation of GSH and CDNB 26, 39 . The formation of the glutathione conjugate was monitored continuously at 340 nm. A molar absorption coefficient of 9,600 M −1 ·cm −1 for the conjugate was used in calculations. The initial velocity study for pseudo-first order kinetic assay was performed by varying the concentration of GSH from 1 μ M to 12 mM with a constant concentration of CDNB of 3.5 mM for the K m,GSH calculation and by varying the concentration of CDNB from 0.1 to 3.8 mM with a constant concentration of GSH of 10 mM for K m,CDNB . The K m was used as apparent binding affinity in the present studies. The non-enzymatic conjugation of GSH with CDNB (Extended data Fig. 4I ,j) was corrected for during each assay. Thermal stability analysis. The unfolding of each protein was monitored by measuring the CD signal of 222 nm from 25 °C to 85 °C. The protein concentration was 0.2 mg/ml without or with 1 mM GSH. The data was analyzed using thermodynamic models by globally fitting the measurements to a two-state unfolding model in order to calculate the T m of each protein 40 . Light-scattering measurement. Polymerization and aggregation of S-crystallin and its various mutants was measured by denaturant-induced light-scattering 41 . The protein was incubated with 3.5 M urea in the absence or presence of GSH at 30 °C. The protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml. The light-scattering at 340 nm was continuously monitored by UV/VIS spectrometry (Jasco).
