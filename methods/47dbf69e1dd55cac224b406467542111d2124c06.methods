The IVCMa, in southern Spain, covers a population of approximately one million residents, and is the only information center for travelers in the region. In the past 3 years, 9,000-10,000 travelers a year have visited it, accounting for approximately 3%-5% of people accessing the 107 IVCs nationwide. Travelers requesting pre-travel medical care in the IVCs receive mandatory and/or recommended vaccines, and advice related to water and food measures, prevention of mosquito bites, animal bites and other adapted recommendations to the profiles of the trips and the travelers. According to the destination and the specific characteristics of the trip, the vaccines prescribed at the IVCMa are mainly: yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid fever, cholera, hepatitis A and B, Japanese encephalitis, influenza, tetanus-diphtheria, whooping cough, rabies, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella and tick-borne encephalitis. The Foreign Health Information System (SISAEX) is an administrative database management system implemented in 2000 that collects data on travelers requesting travel-related health information at all IVCs. The variables collected by the SISAEX at the individual level (for each traveler) are: age, sex, destination, date and duration of the trip, type of trip, clinical data (diseases, allergies, treatments), previous vaccines, vaccines administered in the IVC, recommended vaccines and antimalarial prophylaxis. For the study, only the aggregated monthly data are extracted: the monthly and annual number of travelers attended, the monthly and annual number of countries visited. The monthly travel destinations were introduced as a new variable in the SISAEX database in 2005. The Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare of Spain manages and administers the SISAEX system. Although most inquiries at IVCs are related to travel to destinations that have health risks, there are also inquiries from travelers to countries not considered at risk. These commonly are travelers who are required or recommended to be vaccinated against meningitis or tuberculosis because they will be attending educational institutions or working in hospitals or clinics. Our study considered a destination health risk assignment when one of the countries visited was classified by WHO as having high or medium risk of hepatitis A virus infection [7] . Travelers typically go to IVCs on the recommendation of travel agencies, advertisements or media campaigns related to the preparation for trips to health risk countries, or on the recommendation of friends, travel websites or other information sources. The monthly number of travelers personally attended to at the IVCMa, according to the SISAEX database, was used in a descriptive study with ecologic time series design and carried out between January 2000 and December 2017. The data were obtained from medical records in a fully anonymized and de-identified manner. The information obtained from the SISAEX and used for this study is not personal, only monthly data series (number or proportions) of travelers that do not allow the identification of any user. The authors had not access to identifying information at any moment. In addition, all international travelers who are attended at the IVCs, previously request a pre-travel medical advice by phone or web are informed that their data will be used to centralize sanitary control procedures and can be used for statistical purposes and health research. Initially, a graphical exploration was planned for the purpose of globally visualizing the activity of the monthly data series. This was considering a time series is defined as a succession of observations corresponding to a variable at different times and observed at regular intervals of constant duration. To control the level of quality, two of the authors edited the master databases to standardize the data and ensure reliability of subsequent analyses. After analyzing aspects such as trends and seasonality of the number of travelers over the study period, a modeling process was developed using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. This was to expand on a simplified representation of the most important characteristics of the data series. The number of travelers visiting the IVCMa (hereinafter "TAs") increased almost continuously over the study period, although some stages of deceleration or negative growth were seen. The relationship between the TA number and high-impact international events that occurred between 2000 and 2017 was taken into account. Unforeseen impacts from internationally impactful events, such as terrorist attacks, political instability, health pandemics, natural disasters, or humanitarian and socioeconomic crises, were considered. The primary sources for tracking and detection of such events included academic studies, articles, reports, press releases, books, journals and data from relevant websites; all generally related to the tourism industry. The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) was especially useful in our search. EM-DAT was launched in 1988 by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, with the initial support of the WHO and the Government of Belgium, to facilitate humanitarian action at the national and international levels. Analysis of descriptive statistics was performed with Microsoft Excel 2011 and IBM SPSS 22.0.
