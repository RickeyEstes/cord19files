We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCWs in 2 tertiary hospitals in Beijing from May 10 to June 28, 2010. The purposive sample was enrolled from the departments where doctors, nurses, and technicians were likely to be in contact with blood, needles, and sharps, such as internal medicine, surgery, and laboratories. Temporary employees were excluded. Participants were informed verbally of the aims of the survey and provided their answers voluntarily in an anonymous written questionnaire, which assessed (1) sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, job category (doctors, nurses, technicians); (2) exposure type: exposure to blood that is potentially infectious during work lifetime; (3) exposure frequency: number of exposure episode(s) during the previous year; (4) engagement in 8 protective behaviors related to the practice of SP; and (5) awareness and training history on SP. We calculated an individual compliance score by summing the scores for the 8 protective behaviors of SP, ranging from 0 to 8. A higher compliance score indicates better compliance with SP. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All variables were treated as categorical, except age and exposure frequency. Descriptive statistics were performed to each item of exposure and compliance. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for differences in blood exposure type and frequency among 3 job categories. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to study possible correlates of compliance.
