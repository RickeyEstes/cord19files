Here we use the random walk system envisaged in the Nandy plot [11] based on a 2D Cartesian grid where the four bases are assigned to the four cardinal directions: guanine (g) to the positive x-direction, thymine (t) to the negative y-direction, adenine (a) to the negative x-direction and cytosine (c) to the positive y-direction. The method to plot a DNA sequence is to start at the origin and take a step in the positive x-direction for a guanine base, in the negative x-direction for an adenine, positive y-direction for a cytosine and the negative y-direction for a thymine, and proceed likewise for each succeeding base in the sequence, starting each step from the end of the last one taken. This way a succession of bases in the original DNA sequences is represented by a succession of points in the 2D plot, the overall trace being a representation of the distribution of bases in the DNA sequence (see e.g., Fig. 1 human beta globin). The axes essentially represent the excess of guanine over adenine along the x-axis and the excess of cytosine over thymine along the y-axis; thus the plots are basically of instantaneous values of intra-pyrimidine, intra-purine differences as we proceed along the sequence. The end point of such a curve will be given by (N G -N A , N C -N T ), where by N A , N C , N G, N T we mean the total number of adenines, cytosines, guanines and thymines in the sequence being plotted. GC-rich sequences therefore plot mostly in the first quadrant, AT-rich sequences in the third quadrant on this axes system. Once the co-ordinates are available, we use an Excel spreadsheet to plot the graph and apply the Add Trendline feature of the Excel software to fit the best polynomials for our analysis, with axes transformation where required to conform to the software's curve fitting engine. Fig. 1 shows a plot of the human beta globin gene complete cds generated using the above algorithm. We note that a DNA sequence that consists of a succession of short segments each having a complete mix of a,g,c,t with equal contributions of each of the bases within each of the segments would be expected to generate a dense cluster of points around the origin; a random distribution of the a,g,c,t along the sequence could be expected to generate a random walk. The human beta globin gene sequence complete cds inclusive of all introns and exons (Fig. 1) shows a distinct pattern where the bases appear to follow one another with some regularity, with the total extent of the representative plot arising from the non-equal composition of the bases in the sequence; other beta globin sequences produce similar plots implying that the human beta globin gene cds is not an arbitrary random sequence. Fig. 2 shows the close similarity of the shapes of the plots of three sequences of histone H4 genes of wheat, maize and chicken, demonstrating that these sequences are not random but have a close kinship in base distribution. A randomisation of the bases in the human beta globin gene [29] produces, on the other hand, a simple linear plot (Fig. 3) in the third quadrant of the axes system as can be intuitively expected for an unorganised mixture of the four bases along the sequence.
