Mice. BALB/c, RAG2 −/− γc −/− BALB/c, FVB and NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl / SzJ (NSG) mice were bred in a pathogen-free facility in the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University and Animal Resources Center at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. Wild-type and Bcl-2 transgenic FVB mice were used for the isolation and analysis of peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils. For the transgenic mice, human Bcl-2 was expressed under the control of the human MRP8 regulatory regions 3 . All animal procedures were in accordance with the guidelines and approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care at Stanford University and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. Cell culture. Human cancer derived cell lines SW620, DLD1, HL60, K562, and murine macrophage/monocyte cell line J774 were obtained from ATCC. No additional cell authentication or mycoplasma examination was performed. Cells were routinely cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SW620, J774), IMDM medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HL60), or RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DLD1 and K562). CHO and mutant lines identified as follows 39 : parent Gat-2, Lec2 (clone Gat-2. Lec2.4C, defective in the CMP-sialic acid transporter), Lec3 (clone Gat-2.Lec3.6F, defective in UDP-GlcNAc 2 epimerase), Lec8 (clone Gat-2.Lec8.1C, defective in UDP-Gal translocase). All cells were cultured in alpha-MEM (Gibco 11900−073) supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum. Cells were maintained in suspension or monolayer.
