The Gambia is a West African country of 1.8 million people with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection prevalence of <2%. A study of the etiology of severe childhood pneumonia was undertaken in the coastal area of The Gambia (Supplementary Appendix 1). At the time of the study (2007-2009), there was high coverage with conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine but no routine usage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the case currently in many African countries. Cases were children aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia defined clinically by modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (cough or difficulty in breathing, plus any of the following: lower chest wall indrawing, nasal flaring, or an oxygen saturation of <90% on pulse oximetry). Participants were recruited from the Medical Research Council (MRC) hospital in Fajara; the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in Banjul; and the major health centers at Fajikunda, Serekunda, and Brikama. Children with a cough of â‰¥2 weeks, or severe anemia (hemoglobin level <6 g/dL) or confirmed wheeze were excluded. Radiological pneumonia was defined using WHO criteria (ie, endpoint consolidation or pleural effusion). HIV testing was done if informed consent was given after standard counseling. A standard WHO guideline-based antibiotic regimen was used. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in the study from parents or guardians. The study was approved by the Gambian government/MRC Joint Ethics Committee (SCC/EC1062). Details of lung aspiration in our setting over a period of 25 years, during which there have been no associated serious adverse events, have been described previously [5] . Participants underwent lung aspiration if they had accessible consolidation adjacent to the chest wall, had no contraindications, and written informed consent had been obtained. Pleural aspiration was undertaken in those with pleural effusions. Culture, nonmolecular serotyping, HIV testing, singleplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for lytA and cpsA (for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and glpQ (for H. influenzae), 16S rRNA PCR, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), molecular serotyping, and multiplex fast-track 33 PCR, all using standard methods (Supplementary Appendix 2) [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , were performed at the MRC Unit in The Gambia, and multiplex MassTag PCR [14] was performed at Columbia University. Multiplex pathogen targets are listed in Supplementary Appendix 3. Laboratory analyses were done blinded and independent of each other. Summary results of organisms identified to genus or species level using 1 or more detection methods were compiled. Demographic and clinical data were double-entered into an SQL database (Microsoft Corporation) and verified, and laboratory data were entered into an Access (Microsoft Corporation) database, cross-checked, and verified. Statistical analyses were done using Stata software, version 11 (StataCorp).
