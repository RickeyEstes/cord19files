For this study several methods were used including a cross-sectional survey of travellers, interviews with health professionals and comparison with historical population groups. The ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine of The University of Hong Kong approved the study. A random digit dialling technique of all land-based telephone lines in Hong Kong was performed between June and October, 1998 in order to identify potential participants for the travel survey. Eligible participants were those in the household who were ethnic Chinese, aged 15-64 years, able to communicate in Cantonese and had travelled overseas (including mainland China) in the past 12 months. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Details of the data collection methods have been described elsewhere. 20 Briefly, the questionnaire included questions on demographics, types of precautionary measures taken prior to travel, whether help had been sought from any health professionals/services, and health problems experienced during and within 2 weeks after travel. For the cross-sectional survey among the residents, we contacted 527 travellers and 369 were willing to be interviewed (70% response rate). Of these 89 reported that they had travelled to Guangdong Province (the closest province of mainland China to Hong Kong). Since many of these travellers might live in nearby cities or visit there only for a short duration, they were excluded from the analysis. Therefore our final analysis is based on 280 travellers. To obtain views from health professionals regarding the demands for travel health services in Hong Kong and to assess the types of services provided by practitioners, a telephone interview was carried out with 20 systematically recruited practitioners of tropical medicine (n Â¼ 8) and family medicine (12) . Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 6.0. Missing data were excluded from the analysis. The demographic and other relevant characteristics of subjects who developed health problems during and within 2 weeks after travel were compared with those of subjects who did not develop travel-related illness using w 2 tests or Fisher Exact tests. We assumed that health problems that developed within 2 weeks after travel could have been associated with the recent travel. Excess burden of health problems due to travel was assessed by making comparison with other locally available data in a descriptive manner.
