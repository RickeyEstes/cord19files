In this study, a multi-method approach was used. 23 The framework for the ethical evaluation of PH plans was developed in the following order: (A) A list of general moral norms in PH policy and practice was created, which was based on broad and narrow moral norms presented in a systematic review of the literature. 24 The primary draft was then completed in two interactive sessions (expert panels) with six Iranian biomedical ethics and PH community professionals who had at least 10 years of experience in their respective fields. The group included three men and three women who were recommended by the Vice Chancellor of Iran's National Institute for Health Policy Research. (B) The Delphi method was used to validate the content and determine the components to be used in the framework structure. In the first round, we emailed the list of general moral norms to 20 Iranian experts with expertise in biomedical ethics or PH policy and asked them to determine the relevance and importance of each of the norms by scoring with a 5-point Likert scale (1: very low; 2: low; 3: moderate; 4: high; and 5: very high). Overall, 14 of the 20 experts responded. Based on received comments and scores, the norms that scored 3 were merged with other norms, and then the median was calculated using a frequency distribution table for each norm. In the second round, the list of revised general moral norms, with median scores resulting from the first round, were emailed to the previous 14 respondents who were then asked to re-score each norm. Analysis of scores on the revised list of moral norms showed that all respondents were in agreement in terms of which components should be used in the structure of a practical framework. (C) After determining and validating the moral norms to be applied as structural components in creating the practical framework, it was further developed in six detailed steps (see the Results section). (D) To assess the efficiency of the framework, Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control was evaluated by the final users (program experts) of the framework. After obtaining permission from the head of the Center for Communicable Diseases and Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (who had previous involvement in the project), two group discussion sessions were held with nine experts from the Ministry of Health and its affiliated universities. These experts were specifically chosen by the Director of the HIV/AIDS Control Office. In the first session, which lasted 2 h, after expressing the goals of the meeting and obtaining the oral agreement of participants, they were asked to identify ethical considerations in the form of potential strengths and weaknesses (ethical points) associated with the Fourth Strategic Plan of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control without using the framework. Then, to determine the content validity of the framework, participants were asked to rate the relevance, simplicity, and clarity of the resulting questions using the 5-point Likert scale. After summarizing the responses, the framework was refined and finalized at a meeting with attendance of those experts (content validity index [CVI] ¼ 96.2%). Then, an evaluation session of the program, which lasted 3 h, was conducted using the developed framework and its application guide with nine previous participants, as followings: 1. Form an evaluation team, consisting of three ministry experts, three university experts, and three experts working in other relevant PH institutions; 2. Specify and balance the list of moral norms in PH policy and practice, in each domain; 3. Answer questions in the form of 'yes' or 'no' by mentioning the potential strengths or weaknesses (ethical points); 12 4. Make recommendations regarding ethical pitfalls based on weaknesses (negative points); 5. Evaluate the program by integrating the results from the evaluation of each domain and decision-making as: (i) the program is acceptable; (ii) the program is acceptable with some revisions; or (iii) the program is not acceptable. (E) In order to determine the total number of weaknesses and strengths (sum of the positive and negative ethical points) that may be obtained by evaluating Iran's Fourth Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control through applying the framework, the program was previously evaluated by three members of the research team. A total number of 50 negative and positive ethical points were elicited, and this was considered the reference point. Finally, to calculate whether there is significant difference between the frequency of provided answers as strengths (the number of positive points) and weaknesses (the number of negative points) before and after applying the framework, the number of ethical points compared with the reference was analyzed using the Mac-Nemar non-parametric test due to the abnormal distribution (confidence interval [CIN] ¼ 99%).
