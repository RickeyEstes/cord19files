The FT-IR spectroscopy experiments were recorded in solid potassium bromide pellets on a Digilab Excalibur FTS 4000 spectrophotometer (Digilab, Inc., Holliston, MA), or neat by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) on a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). The FT-Raman spectroscopy experiments were recorded neat on a Bruker FT-Raman spectrometer RFS 100/S (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). The Raman excitation source was a Nd:YAG-laser (λ = 1064 nm). Given FT-IR absorbance and FT-Raman emission bands, both expressed in wavenumbers ṽ (cm −1 ), are characterized in intensity as strong (str), middle (m), weak (w), and broad (br). The 1 H-NMR (700.43 MHz) and 13 . Then acetone (1000 ml) was added. Afterwards, the crystallizing solution was cooled at + 0-2°C for 3 h. The suspension was frozen at − 25°C for 2.5 h. The evolved first yield (9.927 g) of the crystalline, white product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. Acetone (600 ml) was added to the filtrate, and it was frozen at − 25°C for 18 h. The evolved second yield (266 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. The filtrate was frozen at − 25°C for 28 h. The evolved third yield (217 mg) of the product was filtered and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo. All yields were combined (10.410 g, 91%). 1 9. 3716 mmol) were dissolved in water (20 ml) supplied with 90% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (60 ml). The solution was refluxed for 90 min. Afterwards, the yellow solution was cooled at RT (ϑ = 16.4°C) for 10 min, then at +0-2°C for 50 min. Acetone (50 ml) was added, and the turbid solution was frozen at −25°C for 1 h. Afterwards, sodium hydroxide (380 mg, 9.5000 mmol) dissolved in water (3 ml) was added under stirring. An ultrashort color change to orange was visible. The resulting turbid yellowish solution was filtered through one layer of filter paper. Residues were transferred with acetone (200 ml) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 100 ml). The filtrate was frozen at −25°C for 2 h. EtOAc (200 ml) was added, and the suspension was frozen at −25°C for 1 h. Then 10. The NMR resonances were assigned according to literature data [6, 7] . The exact cation mass was calculated according to literature data [8] . 9. 3716 mmol) were dissolved in water (20 ml) supplied with 90% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (60 ml). The solution was refluxed for 90 min. Afterwards, the yellow solution was cooled at RT (ϑ = 13.9°C) for 10 min, then at +0-2°C for 50 min. Acetone (50 ml) was added, and the turbid solution was frozen at −25°C for 1 h. Afterwards, sodium hydroxide (380 mg, 9.5000 mmol) dissolved in water (3 ml) was added under stirring. An ultrashort color change to orange was visible. The resulting turbid yellowish solution was filtered through one layer of filter paper. Residues were transferred with acetone (200 ml) and EtOAc (100 ml). The filtrate was frozen at −25°C for 2 h. EtOAc (200 ml) was added, and the suspension was frozen at −25°C for 1 h. Then 10.27 M [32% (m/m)] aqueous hydrochloric acid (1,000 μl, 10.2700 mmol) was added under stirring to the suspension with sticky residues at the glass surface. Afterwards, the crystallizing suspension was frozen at −25°C for 15 h. The evolved yield of the white, crystalline product was filtered, washed on the filter with cold (+0-2°C) EtOAc (100 ml), and dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo (447 mg, 12%). From the filtrate, only 2′deoxycytidine × HCl could be isolated (566 mg). 1 (30 ml) were added under stirring. The precipitating suspension was frozen at −25°C for 1 h. Then the suspension was filtered through one layer of filter paper (in the filter the RNA remained). Residues were transferred and rinsed with acetone (20 ml). The slight yellowish and turbid filtrate was filtered through two layers of filter paper. Residues were transferred and rinsed with acetone (10 ml). The filtrate was mixed with acetone (150 ml), 10.27 M [32% (m/m)] aqueous hydrochloric acid (800 μl, 8.2160 mmol), and EtOAc (80 ml), and was frozen at − 25°C for 1 h. Then EtOAc (60 ml) was added, and the mixture was frozen at − 25°C for 1 h. Afterwards, acetone (200 ml) was added, and the suspension was shaken vigorously for 10 s. After freezing at − 25°C for 2 h, 90% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (5 ml) was added, the suspension was shaken vigorously for 30 s, and was frozen at − 25°C for 45 min. The evolved yield of the white, crystalline product was filtered, washed on the filter with cold (+ 0-2°C) acetone (100 ml), and was dried over CaCl 2 in vacuo (486 mg, 43%). 1
