Cell culture and reagents. Huh7 and Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing Calnexin or NS4B-HA replicon were obtained from Dr Ralf Bartenschlager. Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing the T7 polymerase (Huh7-Lunet-T7) was obtained from Dr. Volker Lohmann, and the Huh7.5 cell line was obtained from Dr. Charles Rice. All Huh7-derived cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Multicell), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μ g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 , in a humidified incubator. Cell lines harboring the wild-type replicon or NS4B HA were maintained in medium supplemented with G418 (Gibco) at a final concentration of 500 μ g/ml. Huh7-Lunet-T7 and Huh7-Lunet cells stably expressing calnexin were cultured in the presence of 10 μ g/ml blasticidin (In vivo Gen). Plasmids and antibodies. The hATG5 and hATG16L1 sequences were cloned into the peGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech), thus forming pGFP-ATG5 and pGFP-ATG16L1, respectively. The Flag-tagged ATG12 (pATG12) and its dominant-negative derivative pATG12Δ G140 (ATG12DN) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Adi Kimchi 39 . The PTM vector for the expression of HCV nonstructural proteins NS3 to 5B (pTM-NS3-5B) was kindly provided by Dr. Volker Lohmann. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3, rabbit polyclonal anti-ATG5, mouse monoclonal anti-Flag, and mouse monoclonal anti-β -actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ATG12 and anti-ATG7 were purchased from Cell Signaling. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ATG16L1 antibody was purchased from MBL. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA was purchased from Roche. Mouse monoclonal anti-NS3 and anti-NS5A antibodies were purchased from BioFront. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NS3 and NS5A were obtained from Dr. Olivier Nicolas. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NS4B and anti-NS5B antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. Kouacou Konan and Takaji Wakita, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH was purchased from Santa Cruz.
