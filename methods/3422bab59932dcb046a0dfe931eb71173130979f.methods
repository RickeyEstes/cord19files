Device fabrication and operation. The closed pre-treatment device was designed using computer-aided design software. The specimen collector, chemical reagent chamber, and mechanical dissolving portions of this device were made by 3D printing using polycarbonate as a transparent material, and the rotating parts of the motor, including the magnet, were manufactured by the cutting method using acetal. A small, round magnet was mounted for the blade rotation. A small 9 V motor and 9 V battery were used. The specimen is placed in the specimen collector of the device, the lid is closed, and the motor is plugged in and turned on by pressing the switch. Sputum sample collection. The sputum used in the experiment was collected from healthy people over 18 years old who were not infected with pathogens and who showed no abnormal symptoms. We fully explained this study to the participants, obtained their informed consent for study participation, and collected the sputum. The collected sputum samples were used anonymously. We performed the collection and pre-treatment experiments of sputum according to the guidelines of Samsung Medical Center after receiving approval for the experimental protocol from the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center. The sputum was collected in a 50 mL conical tube (Falcon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC, USA) and stored at −80 °C until use. Sputum samples of similar volume and state were chosen for the following experiments. Sputum liquefaction. The standard liquefaction method for sputum is as follows. The sputum sample is uniformly mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% dithiotreitol (DTT) using a vortex mixer for 30 s and is incubated at room temperature for 15 min 11 . In the present study, the sputum sample and 0.1% DTT solution were mixed and vortexed for 30 s without incubation time for 15 min. The sputum liquefaction efficiency of the closed-type pre-treatment device was investigated by comparison with that of the standard method. Distilled water (1 mL) containing 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the chemical reagent chamber, which is separated from the sputum collector by a rubber membrane. The sputum sample was placed in the sputum collector, the lid was closed, and the switch was pressed to rotate the blade for 30 s. DTT allows the sputum protein to be liquefied 21, 22 . To compare the degree of liquefaction of the sputum, samples were placed into 15 mL tubes and photographed with an ordinary camera. From each sample was taken 100 μL to place in a well of a 96-well plate. These samples were observed under a microscope. The viscosity of the liquefied sputum was measured using the Mems & New paradigm for flow management (Rheosense, Inc., San Ramon, CA, USA) (Average n = 3-4 independent experiments per group). After each sample measurement, the device was cleaned more than 2 times in washing mode to prevent sample contamination. The data were analyzed using the Micro-ViSC program. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 600 nm using an Eppendorf BioSpectrometer kinetic (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) (n = 5-6 independent experiments per group). If the value was higher than the maximum value of 3 that can be displayed on the machine because of high absorbance, it was recorded as 3. Cell viability. The effect of mechanical dissolution using the pre-treatment device was examined. PC 12 cells, a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla (Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea), were dispersed in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to 2.5 × 10 5 /mL and 1 mL of 0.1% DTT solution and treated in the same manner as for sputum liquefaction described above. The liquefaction times were set to 30, 60, and 120 s. Then, a 100-μL aliquot of each pretreated sample was dispensed into one well of a 96-well plate, to which 100 μL of RPMI Medium 1640 (GIBCO, Waltham, MA, USA) was added. CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (20 μL) (MTS, Promega Corporation, USA) was added, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm after 3 h incubation. Cell viability was calculated using untreated cells as a control. Genomic DNA extraction. The sputum sample was spiked with 20 μL of 5 × 10 6 PC 12 cells/mL in approximately 1 mL of sputum sample, and the amount of DNA extracted was compared. One milliliter of lysis buffer (buffer 1, MagListo Kit, Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) was pre-loaded into the chemical reagent chamber. After adding the cell-spiked sputum sample, the lid was closed, and the device was allowed to run for 30 s. For comparison, 1 mL of lysis buffer was added to the sputum sample and mixed with a vortex mixer for 30 s. After dissolution, the DNA was extracted according to the protocol of the MagListo Kit (Bioneer). The final volume of elution buffer was 50 μL. The amount of extracted DNA was measured using Nano drop (ND-2000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA extraction experiments were performed using M. fortuitum (Samsung Medical Center), a nontuberculous mycobacterium. To 500 μL of M. fortuitum suspension (OD600 = 0.185) was added 500 μL of lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by mixing in the pre-treatment device for 30, 60, or 120 s. Vortex mixing was also performed for 30, 60, or 120 s. Except under lysis conditions, genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the kit protocol and was then eluted with 200 μL of the kit's elution buffer. Quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to compare the amounts of DNA extracted from M. fortuitum. The forward and reverse primers used for qPCR were synthesized as 5′-TCACCTGATCTGCAC ATAATGT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCATGCGACTT-3′, respectively (Bioneer, Korea) 23 . To sterilized PCR tubes was added 10 μL of genomic DNA extracted from M. fortuitum by the standard method and the pre-treatment device as mentioned above, primers (final concentration, 0.5 μM), and SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (20 μL total reaction volume) (QPK-201, Toyobo, Japan). Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) coupled with QuantStudio real-time PCR software v1.1. The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C pre-denaturation step for 1 min, 15 s denaturation step at 95 °C, and 40-step extension at 60 °C for 40 s. The amplified PCR products were identified by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gel.
