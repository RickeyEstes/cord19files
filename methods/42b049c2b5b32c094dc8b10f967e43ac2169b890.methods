Description of the surveillance system The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia involves the following stakeholders: (i) Primary Health Care Directorate (DSSB), which coordinates the National Influenza Program at the Ministry of Health, (ii) the National Influenza Center (NIC) at the unit of virology, of the Microbiology Laboratory, Charles Nicolle's Hospital, Tunis and (iii) a network of 268 sentinel surveillance sites selected from Primary Health Centers conducting influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance ( Fig. 1) . The ILI sentinel sites were selected on the basis of their representativeness, their geographical-demographical criteria and the presence of voluntary and motivated health professionals. Since the start of surveillance, data was collected using standardized forms that aggregated data into three age groups: 0-5 years; 6-15 years and ≥ 16 years [6] . In 2014, however, a new WHO ILI case definition was implemented with minimum data standards that included gender and age groups (0-< 2 years, 2-< 5 years, 5-< 15 years, 15-< 50 years, 50-< 65 years and ≥ 65 years) [7] . ILI sites report cases from the 40th week of the year in October, to the 18th week of the following year in April, which correspond to the influenza season that started and finish in relation to the cold period of the northern hemisphere and the passage of migratory birds [8] (http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/docs/anis/guidegripf6102016.pdf). The characteristics of the Tunisian influenza-like illness surveillance system are described in the Table 1 . Samples are placed in a refrigerator at + 4°C immediately after collection and transported in a virological transport medium to the NIC within 72 h. The NIC receives all Fig. 1 Structure of the influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Tunisia of the nasopharyngeal swabs of sampled ILI cases to be tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. At each sentinel site, if the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeds 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients (the total number of patients presented to the health care facility independently of the cause, this include all acute morbidity and excludes chronic diseases) for the week, randomly five to 10 patients responding the case definition were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week [9] : this is the sampling criteria used [8] . (http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/docs/anis/guide-gripf6102016.pdf ). Samples are weekly (5 working days from Monday to Friday) collected in order to detect influenza viruses, using real-time RT-PCR following the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) recommended diagnostic using validated in house protocols [10] . The NIC communicates the results to the sentinel sites, the DSSB and the WHO FluNet global monitoring system. The DSSB is responsible for the coordination of disease surveillance and response and ensures the reporting at national and international levels.
