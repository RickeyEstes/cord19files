In this study we adopted a qualitative research method, which is commonly used in comparative studies (Creswell, 2009; Ng, 1999) and has been instrumental in the governance study of tourism planning and development (Gill & Williams, 2011; Moscardo, 2011; Yüksel, Bramwell, & Yüksel, 2005) . Data were collected from the secondary sources. This study began with an examination of the political economy conditions of the two SAR societies, Hong Kong and Macao. Data sources mainly comprised academic literature and government reports and statistics regarding the conditions of Hong Kong and Macao's political economy and society. The power relations and governance of tourism planning as shaped under the wider politicaleeconomic framework have effects on the institutional framework of tourism planning of the two SARs. Three main aspects of the two SARs' tourism planning institutional framework were studied; these include: (1) the tourism planning administration, (2) strategies, polices and guidelines, and (3) the tourism plan-making process. Data were mainly collected from the secondary sources. First, the SARs' government website was browsed to understand their administrative structure of planning. Second, the published documents on the urban planning law, regulations and policies, and government planning studies and reports were carefully reviewed. Attempts were made to understand what laws, polices and guidelines related to tourism planning exist in the two SARs, along with the content and scope of information given for development. Information on the planning law, regulations and policies could be obtained from the governments or from the governments' websites. Third, some case studies about the two cities' tourism planning as reported in newspapers and academic articles were also reviewed. These case studies provided further insights into the operation, system and practice of tourism planning in the two SARs. Although newspapers and media reports have their own limitations in terms of the data reliability, they provide some insights into the current news of the two SARs. To improve reliability, multiple sources were checked and used. Fourth, two government officials involved in public works and one academic specializing in urban planning and tourism in the two SARs were interviewed. Finally, direct observation was used, since the author has lived in Hong Kong and Macao for more than 10 years each and therefore has been able to observe the two SARs' politicaleeconomic conditions and their tourism planning practices.
