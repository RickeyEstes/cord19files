Between February 26, 2003, and April 10, 2003, 343 patients who met the World Health Organization's case definition of suspected or probable SARS were admitted to isolation wards at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong (13) . Two hundred and one patients had laboratory evidence of SARS coronavirus infection and were included in this study. Ten of these patients had an underlying illness prior to admission: 4 were chronic hepatitis B virus carriers, 1 had hepatitis B compensated cirrhosis, 2 had mental retardation, 1 had chronic rheumatic heart disease, and 2 had ischemic heart disease requiring percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee. Standard entry forms were used to collect data on clinical history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and subsequent clinical course. Adverse clinical outcome was assessed using the endpoint of the need for assisted ventilation, death, or both. The admission frontal chest radiographs of the 201 patients were retrospectively and separately reviewed by 3 radiologists (POL, CML, and KFM) who were blinded to the clinical outcomes. The laterality, zones and site of involvement, type of opacification, and dominant pattern of disease were recorded. Each lung field was divided into three zones by drawing imaginary lines at the level of the inferior anterior angle of the second and fourth ribs (14) . A peripheral location was defined as involvement confined to the outer one third of the lung; a central location was defined as involvement confined to the inner two thirds. Consolidation was defined as air space opacity obscuring the underlying vasculature, whereas groundglass opacity was defined as clouding or hazes over the lungs without obscuration of lung vasculature. The dominant patterns were classified as lobar, lobular, interstitial, or diffuse (15) . A diffuse pattern has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Individual findings were accepted if at least 2 of the radiologists concurred.
