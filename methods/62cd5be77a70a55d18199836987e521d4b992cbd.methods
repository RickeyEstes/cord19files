Patient samples and isolation. Blood was obtained from healthy donors under informed consent or purchased as anonymous buffy coats from the Blood Donation Center at the National University Hospital, Singapore. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the National University Hospital, Singapore. Blood from resolved HBV patients was obtained at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Italy, under informed consent and approved by the local Ethics Committee. Blood from resolved SARS patients was collected at the Singapore General Hospital under informed consent approved by the Centralized Institutional Review Board of the Singapore Health Services Pte, Ltd. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the ethics committees. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (GE healthcare) and HLA-typed to four digit resoltuion. Peptide-specific T cell expansion. PBMC with HLA matching the restriction of the synthetic peptides were expanded with 1 mg/ml of each peptide for 10 d in AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) with 2% human AB serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 U/ml II-2 (R&D Systems). Cultures were tested for positive responses using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-c. Briefly, T cells were stimulated for 5 h with 1 mg/ml of the peptide in the presence of 10 mg/ml of Brefeldin A. The cells were stained with anti-CD8 PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min on ice, wahsed and fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice. Following fixation/ permeabilization, cells were stained with anti-IFNc PE (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed and then resuspended in 13 PBS for acquisition on the Facs Canto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FACs Diva software. Postive responses were restimulated to increase frequency and numbers of peptidespecific T cells. Peptide-specific T cell cultures (5 3 10 5 ) were co-cultured with irradiated (2500 rads) healthy donor PBMC (1.7 3 10 6 ) and HLA-matched EBV transformed B cell lines (3 3 10 5 ) loaded with peptide for 1 h at room temperature. Restimulated T cells were cultured in AIM-V media supplemented with 2% AB serum, 20 U/ml IL-2, 10 ng/ml IL-7 and 10 ng/ml IL-15 (R&D Systems). Functionality was tested again 10 d after restimulation using the CD107a degranulation assay to maintain cell viability. The TCR variable beta chain staining panel IO Test Beta Mark TCR V kit (Beckman Coulter) was used to determine the immunodominant Vb on CD107a1 cells following peptide stimulation. Isolation of Ag-specific T cells. Expanded T cell lines were stimulated with 1 ug/ml of peptide for 2 h in the presence of anti-CD107a-APC at 37uC and washed once before staining for immunodominant Vb, identified using the screening panel, for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed once and passed through a 70 uM cell strainer and resuspended in sterile PBS. Peptide-specific T cells were sorted using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) on a FACss Aria III (BD Biosciences) by gating on CD107a1Vb1 cells. Cloning of TCRa and TCRb chains. Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cells using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the 59 GeneRacer Core kit according the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PrimeSTAR MAX (Takara, Bio) was used to amplify the target gene using 59 GeneRacer primer and 39 Gene-specific primers for the TCR alpha constant domain (TCAGCTGGACCACAGCCGCAGC) and two alleles for the TCR beta constant domain (Beta C1 5 TCAGAAATCCTTTCTCTTGACCATGGC; Beta C2 5 CTAGCCTCTGGAATCCTTTCTCTTG). The PCR products were ligated into TOPO-vector for bacterial transformation. Colonies were screened using the same primer pair as mentioned above to verify insert and then sequenced (AITBiotech). The sequences obtained were BLAST against the Human TCR database online (IMGT/V-Quest, http://www.imgt.org) to identify the components of the TCRs. Upon identification of the alpha and beta chains, functional confirmation was performed using the wild type sequences before synthesizing the P2A-linked single cassette, codon optimized, cystine-modified gene constructs (Genescript). The gene cassettes consisting of VaCa-P2A-VbCb and VbCb-P2A-VaCa orientations were tested for expression and functionality in primary human T cells. TCR introduction into primary T cells. Retroviral vector, MP71, was used to deliver the TCR genes into the primary human T cells. 2 3 10 6 Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells were seeded into 100 mm tissue culture dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Phoenix cells were transiently co-transfected using calcium phosphate with 9 mg each of MP71-TCR Va, MP71-TCR Vb together with 6 mg of amphotropic envelope (PCL-Amp) for 24 h. For P2A-linked constructs, 18 mg of the TCR plasmid was co-transfected with 6 mg of the amphotropic envelope. After 24 h, IMDM was replaced with Aim-V supplemented with 2% human AB serum and phoenix cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before retroviral supernatants were collected for transduction. PBMC were stimulated with 600 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2; R&D Systems) and 50 ng/ml anti-CD3 (OKT-3; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) for 48 h. Untreated 24 well tissue culture plates were coated with 30 ug/ml Retronectin (Takara Bio) overnight at 4uC one day prior to transduction. Wells were then washed with HBSS and blocked with PBS 2% BSA. Lymphocytes were harvested, washed, counted and 5 3 10 5 cells plated into retronectin coated wells and mixed with 1.5-2 ml of unconcentrated retroviral supernatants collected as described above. After 24 h, the viral supernatant was replaced with Aim-V medium with 2% human AB serum, supplemented with 100 U/ml IL-2. TCR surface expression was tested with HLA-pentamers (ProImmune), HLA-tetramer produced by peptide exchange 39 or anti-Vb antibodies 72 h post transduction. Functionality of TCR redirected T cells was tested 7 days post transduction as described below. Flow cytometry analysis of TCR expression. Monitoring expression of the introduced TCR was dependent on available reagents. In most cases both anti-Vbeta antibodies (Beckman Coulter) and PE labeled HLA pentamers (ProImmune)/ tetramers (prepared in-house) were available. However, there was no TCR V beta antibody available for the HBV Env 370-79 TCR and no multimer available for the EBV EBNA-4NP 399-408 . Pentamer staining was performed for 15 minutes at room temperature in PBS, 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide (staining buffer). Cells were washed and stained with CD8-PeCy7 (BD Bioscience, RPA-T8) for 30 min on ice. In parallel, transduced T cells were stained with anti-V beta antibodies 1 CD8-PECy7 for 30 min on ice. Cells were immediately fixed with PBS 1 1% formaldehyde and analyzed on FACs Canto flow cytometer. To determine optimal TCR alpha/beta orientation we selected 2-3 retroviral clones carrying the TCRs in either the alpha-2A-beta or beta-2A-alpha orientation and used these retroviral clones to transduce T cells as described above. Each experiment was performed at least twice and the best clone from each orientation was used to test their functionality.
