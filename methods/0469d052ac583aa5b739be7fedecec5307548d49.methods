This survey was conducted by computer-assisted telephonic interview between June 27 and July 5, 2006 by IPSOS, a professional survey institute specialized in surveys in the general French population. The survey was undertaken in the Rhône-Alpes region, which includes eight districts (Ain, Ardèche, Drôme, Isère, Loire, Rhône, Savoie, and Haute Savoie). Individuals aged 18 years and over were eligible to participate. Respondents were selected by the non-probabilistic "quota" method, which consists of questioning a sample of people with the same socio-demographic characteristics as the whole population. The quotas to be respected were based on data provided by the last INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) census, according to gender, age and profession, and stratified by area of residence. Of the 800 people contacted by telephone, 600 agreed to answer the questionnaire, giving a 75% response rate. The study was carried out four months after an epizooty of avian influenza in the Ain area, a district with more than 500,000 inhabitants. Data were collected by a specially-designed questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire included basic demographic questions about age, gender, education level, marital and employment status. The two following questions focused on self-evaluated knowledge, based on a scale from 1 (don't know at all) to 5 (know very well), and the extent of anxiety based on a scale from 1 (not at all anxious) to 4 (very anxious), about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), viral hepatitis, nosocomial infections, meningitis and avian influenza. Subjects who had previously indicated self-reported knowledge of avian influenza were invited to answer questions about the disease's transmission routes, their behaviours at the time the disease had occurred in France, and their opinion on preventive measures taken by the French health authorities, also based on a scale from 1 (very confident) to 4 (not at all confident). This section was followed by questions on reactions to the likelihood of a new epidemic, sources of information, trust in these sources and level of confidence in public health authorities. In order to determine the importance of epidemics among other preoccupations, the questionnaire concluded by asking the respondents to classify their three main threats for the French society among the followed items: cancers, pollution, unemployment, terrorism, obesity and epidemics. The study was submitted to and approved by the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL). The data were described by appropriate statistics for categorical or continuous variables. The analysis was carried out with SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
