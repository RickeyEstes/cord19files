On September 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in collaboration with an international risk communication expert conducted a two-day workshop onËarlier Detection of Infectious Disease Outbreaks. The workshop was the third in a series of workshops aimed at creating an effective response to public health risks at national health policy level. The current workshop represented an example from a high-income country, while earlier workshops were held in a low-income (Southern and East Africa) and mid-income region (Southeast Europe). The workshop focused on the first capacity required by the IHR from each nation, i.e. early detection of risks to the public health. Earlier workshops were held in a low-income region (Southern and East Africa) with 19 participants from the region; and in a mid-income region (Southern Europe) with 33 participants. [17] All three workshops followed the same methodology and were designed to generate insights into systematic conditions and their influencing factors on earlier detection, and their translation into strategic planning of interventions that could be systematically implemented as part of the IHR framework. At the Israeli workshop, eighteen multi-sector professionals from diverse Israeli entities participated in the workshop: the primary healthcare system (Health Maintenance Organizations), the hospitals, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the military Medical Corps and the Ministry of Health (MoH). MoH representatives hailed from the following divisions: Epidemiology, Emergency Preparedness, District and Regional Health Offices, Hospitalization Management, Risk Communication, National Reference Laboratories, Israeli Centre for Disease Control, Environmental Health (sea-ports), Airport liaison, and Legal Office. The workshop employed a new methodology, phrased "the incubator methodology" that facilitates the structured and systematic gathering and analysis of health system information through an interactive and collaborative process with a group of stakeholders ("champions"). Basic concepts are deconstructed to their most fundamental elements. These elements are later reconstructed to suggest effective and innovative interventions. [10] Throughout the workshop the participants worked intermittently in small-groups and in plenary sessions, conducting open and interactive discussions. Matrices were used to systematically deconstruct and expand current understanding and concepts of early detection to encourage innovative thinking and re-build interventions to improve them, based on the dynamics and insights of the content experts. The workshop employed a five-step analysis approach to elucidate the necessary conditions and factors that influence (facilitate or block) each stage of earlier detection of public health risks. The stages include: 1) local recognition ofän event; 2) local reporting; 3) local assessment; 4) reporting to higher levels, from local, regional and up to national governance bodies; and 5) higher level assessment. At each stage, participants rotated through three vantage-points: human health, animal health and data requirements, all leading to the higher level recognition of "an event", i.e. an outbreak. Each breakout group assigned: a facilitator, responsible for time management, content and group dynamics, and ensuring that each voice be heard; a flip-charter responsible for documenting the main points raised during the discussion; and a presenter, responsible for presenting the outputs produced by the group to the plenary. The group composition changed at each phase, so that all participants had the opportunity to experience and voice the various viewpoints. At the end of each stage, the outputs constructed by each of the breakout groups were presented to the plenary, discussed and put to a vote to assess their relative importance. Thus it was possible to generate a prioritized map of conditions and their most important influencing factors for each component of the earlier detection. It is believed that this output will reflect the collective expertise, experience and insights of the participants. The outputs of the workshop were systematically analysed in a qualitative methodology and collated to extract practical measures.
