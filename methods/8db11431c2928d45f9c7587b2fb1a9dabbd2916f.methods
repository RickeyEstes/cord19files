A prospective observational study was performed in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy, assisted by the otorhinolaryngology clinic of a university hospital. The study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee (protocol number 363/2011). All parents or guardians signed a consent form after being informed of the objectives, procedures, and responsibilities of the research, as well as received answers to any questions regarding the study. The study included children under 12 years of age with clinical and/or radiologic criteria for adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy (recurrent tonsillitis and/or hypertrophy of lymphoid tissues leading to upper airway obstruction). Children were excluded from the study if they had fever or any type of acute respiratory tract infection at the time of collection of biological samples, if they had craniofacial malformations, if they were immunocompromised, or if their parents did not agree with their participation in the research project. Several respiratory viruses (influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4; rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus; human bocavirus; coronaviruses; and metapneumovirus) were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) in adenoid tissue removed surgically and nasal swab specimens collected preoperatively and at 1 month postoperative follow-up visit. Nasal secretion was collected with the aid of a sterile metal rod nasal swab, following the rules of asepsis. The nasal cavity was previously humidified with 1 mL of sterile sodium chloride 0.9% solution. The swab was introduced directly into the nasal cavity without contact with the patient's skin or other region. After collecting, this swab was homogenized in microtubes containing sterile Ringer lactate solution. The adenoid tissue was obtained by cold adenoidectomy under general anesthesia by curettage of adenoid tissue. Small fragments of adenoid tissue were stored in microtubes containing virus transport media, which is a solution for transportation and storage of viruses in tissues. After collection, the samples were transported in liquid nitrogen in microtubes to the Research Laboratory of Virology and Molecular Biology, where they were frozen at À80°C, and subsequently viral genetic material in the secretion and adenoid tissue was extracted according to a standardized protocol by the laboratory. After extraction, q-PCR was performed of respiratory viruses using the handset Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems (Life Technologies™, California, USA) following the manufacturer's specifications and protocols. The FTD-Respiratory-21 kit from Fast-Track Diagnostics™ (Junglinster, Luxemburg) was used to identify respiratory viruses. The database was created using Microsoft Excel program (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, United States). The data were analyzed using absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies, average, and standard deviation, depending on the variable studied. The averages of continuous outcome variables were compared by the Student t test. The association of the qualitative measures between groups was performed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test to determine statistical significance. The software used for analysis was SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM™, Armonk, New York, USA) version 13 and the assumed level of significance was 5% (p < 0.05).
