PT was coated onto PVDF centrifugal tubes by adding 200 μL of varying concentrations of PT. Tubes were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min. The filtrate was again added to the tube and centrifuged to obtain a homogeneous deposition of PT on PVDF membrane. This process was repeated several times to optimize PT coating on PVDF membrane based on the fluorescence intensities. Subsequently, the deposited films were washed 5 times with DI water by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 3 min 2 μL of HBV DNA at varying concentrations in plasma samples were then dropped on PT incorporated PVDF membrane to serve as control spots. PVDF membranes with 2 μL of prehybridized HBV DNA and PNA was also prepared as a reference sample to serve as sample spots.
