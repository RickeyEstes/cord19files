The initial target was to treat 20 animals divided equally into control and test groups at random. 6 glass vials, each containing 3 ml (1 dose) of liquid were packed in boxes arranged in two batches of 10. In each batch there were 5 boxes containing Arsenicum album 30c and 5 placebos containing only vehicle potentized to 30c. Any effect due to the vehicle alone could therefore be discounted as it was the same in both sets of vials. The boxes and vials were numbered, the key being held by the dispenser. The animal was assessed by the veterinary surgeon according to a number of criteria (Figure 1) , and a treatment plan made. The score for 'brightness' was purely subjective, to give some idea of the severity of the disease. Following administration of the conventional treatments, a box of vials was taken from one of the batches of 10, the code number recorded, and the animal given one dose orally. The farmer was instructed to give the 203 remaining 5 doses over the next two days at 6 hour intervals and to record progress. The number of animals with bloody, watery and pasty scour were counted.
