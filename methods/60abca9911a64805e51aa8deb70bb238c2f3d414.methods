We analyzed the data from NCDCPH where the samples from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and inpatients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) from sentinel sites throughout the country are referred to be tested for influenza virus. The following case definitions were used: ILI was defined as acute onset of fever >38 • C, and cough and/or sore throat in the absence of other diagnosis. SARI was defined as acute onset of fever >38 • C, cough and/or sore throat and signs of respiratory distress requiring hospitalization. For ILI the time interval between sampling and onset of symptoms was defined as <72 hours. Each primary health care provider was responsible to collect specimens 2 times per week from all the patients seeking for medical assistance that day and who satisfied case definition. Combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken for testing. Endotracheal aspirates were used for intubated patients. Specimens were placed into appropriate [5] . For the patients with lethal outcome detailed demographic and medical information was collected by chart review using data collection instrument. Collected medical data included underlying chronic disease, clinical diagnosis, and treatment and vaccination history.
