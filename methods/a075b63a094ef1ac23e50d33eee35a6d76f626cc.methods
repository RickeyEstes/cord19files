Immunocytochemical methods parallel those of IHC. There are several steps previous to the incubation of the primary antibody (e.g., endogenous peroxidase block, nonspecific binding block, avidin-biotin block, AR). After the primary antibody incubation, a secondary, and sometimes a tertiary, reagent is necessary to demonstrate the immune reaction. The peroxidase block is necessary when using immunoperoxidase techniques; the usual method is with 3% H 2 O 2 in deionized water. In blood-rich smears, the use of alkaline phosphatase procedures rather than immunoperoxidase will avoid the background produced by endogenous peroxidase without the need for strong (with sometimes deleterious effects on antigenicity) quenching reagents (Dupr√© and Courtade-Saidi, 2012) . AR may be necessary on some occasions. Unfortunately, there is no rule to determine a priori whether AR is needed or which method is optimal. The approach to standardize ICC is similar to that for IHC. A comprehensive list of antibodies used in ICC at the National Cancer Institute, including antibody sources, dilution of the primary antibody, and fixation and AR methods, is available (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) .
