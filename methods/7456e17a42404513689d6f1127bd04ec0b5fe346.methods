Experimental design. A total of 1032 rats (129/sex/ exposure concentration) and 866 hamsters (107 to 109/ sex/exposure concentration) were exposed by inhalation to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm of methylene chloride. Exposures were 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, excluding holidays, for 2 years. Approximately 95 rats and hamsters/sex/exposure concentration were part of the chronic toxicity and oncogenicity portion of the study. The remaining animals were sacrificed as part of the cytogenetic studies (rats only) or for one of the interim kills at either 6, 12, 15 (rats only), or 18 months. Test material. vapor generation, and chamber analysis. Technical grade material was used throughout the exposure and was determined by gas chromatographic analysis to be greater than 99% pure methylene chloride. The nominal concentration of methylene chloride vapor in the chamber was determined from the rate at which the liquid methylene chloride was dispensed and the total chamber air flow. The concentration of methylene chloride was measured at least 3 times/day for each chamber. The daily time weighted average concentration for each chamber was calculated. Animals and animal husbandry. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Spartan SD rats, SPF derived, from Spartan Research Animals, Inc., Haslett, Mich.) and male and female Golden Syrian Hamsters [Ela: Eng (Syr) from Engle Laboratory Animals, Inc., Farmersburg, Ind.] were used in this study. When they arrived, the rats and hamsters were approximately 6 weeks of age. They were acclimated for approximately 2 weeks and were assigned to exposure groups using a computer-derived randomization procedure. All animals were placed in wire-bottom stainlesssteel cages. Hamsters were placed 3 to 4 per cage for the first year, then housed individually for the remainder of the study. .Rats were housed no more than three per cage. The chambers used were 8 X 8 X 8-ft rooms (14.5 m3) with stainless-steel ceilings in the shape of a regular quadrangular pyramid and walls and floors coated with epoxy resin. They were operated under dynamic air flow conditions with temperature and humidity controlled air and were maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle. During the nonexposure periods of the study, the animals were kept in the same chambers with a filtered air supply. The controls for the study were also kept in a similar chamber, but were exposed to filtered air only. Food (Purina Laboratory Chow, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO.) was removed from all animals during exposure, but was provided ad libitum during the nonexposure periods of the study. Water was provided ad Iibitum throughout the study by means of an automatic watering system. In-life observations and palpable masses. Rats and hamsters were observed daily during the work week for general health status and signs of possible toxicity. Moribund and dead animals were culled daily. In addition, all rats and hamsters were palpated monthly for palpable masses starting by the third month of the study and continuing thereafter for the duration of the study. Body weights. A subgroup of 50 rats and hamsters/sex/ exposure concentration were weighed weekly for the first 8 weeks of the study and monthly thereafter. in addition, animals designated for the 6-, I2-, 15 (rats only), or 18month interim kills, as well as all animals killed at the termination of the study, were also weighed after fasting overnight prior to necropsy. Hematology. Blood samples for hematologic determinations were collected from the severed cervical vessels of hamsters at the time of necropsy and from the tail veins of rats prior to necropsy at the 6-, 12-, 15-(rats only), 18-, and 24-month kills. The hematological determinations included packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (RBC), total and differential leukocyte counts (WBC), and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration. These techniques were performed using either automated' or manual procedures. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were calculated on all animals using the total erythrocyte count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration, and packed ceil volume (PCV) data. Additionally, a reticulocyte count was performed on all animals from the 18-month kill and from a maximum of 10 animals/sex/dose from the 24-month kill. Clinical chemistries. Blood for serum was collected from rats and hamsters following decapitation at necropsy from all the animals at the 6-, 12-, 15-(rats only), and 18month kills. Serum samples from a maximum of lo/sex/ dose were saved at the 24month kill. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) and serum ghrtamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) activities and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were determined on all samples.4 In addition, total protein and albumin were determined on all hamster samples from the 12-, 18-, and 24-month kills5 Serum was obtained by orbital sinus puncture after 30 days of exposure from 10 rats/sex from the control and 3500-ppm exposure groups for determination of SGPT activity.5 Urinalysis. Urinalysis was performed on ah animals from the 6-, 12-, 15-(rats only), and 18-month kills, and from a maximum of 10 animals/sex/dose from the 24month terminal kill. Specific gravity,' pH, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood, protein, and urobilinogen were determined on all samples.6 Carboxyhemoglobin determinations. Blood samples for carboxyhemoglobin determinations were obtained from the tail veins of 4 rats/sex/exposure level following 6, I 1, 18 (females only), and 2 1 months (except the 1500-ppm males) of exposure. Orbital bleeding was used to obtain blood samples for carboxyhemoglobin determinations from 4 hamsters/sex/exposure level following 22 months of exposure. Because of differences in male and female hamster carboxyhemoglobin values, additional hamsters were ordered and exposed to one 6-hr exposure at the 3 Coulter Counter Model ZBI, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Fla.

Blood was obtained by orbital bleeding from a maximum of 6 hamsters/sex/exposure concentration. Blood carboxyhemoglobin was determined spectrophotometricahy (Amenta ef al., 1963) . Cytogenetic sfudies. Bone marrow cells were collected from 5 rats/sex/group for cytogenetic evaluation after 6 months of exposure. Bone marrow samples were processed by conventional techniques and examined for evidence of cytogenetic effects. Pathological examinations. All animals were necropsied. Moribund rats and those at scheduled sacrifices were killed by decapitation following clamping of the trachea under methoxyflurane anesthesia. The eyes from all rats were examined by gently pressing a wet glass slide against the cornea and examining the eye under bright fluorescent illumination. The lungs and trachea from all animals were removed as a unit and expanded with phosphate-buffered 10% Formalin. AU tissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% Formalin (except as noted below for eyes). At each of the interim and terminal kills, the eyes from a minimum of 5 animals/sex/exposure concentration were preserved in Zenker's fixative with the remaining eyes from all of the animals fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% Formalin. Prior to fixation, the weights of the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and testicles were recorded from animals sacrificed at the interim and terminal kills. Representative sections of organs and tissues were processed using conventional methods and were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Special stains and electron microscopic evaluations were conducted on selected tissues or lesions as needed. Statistical evaluation. Hematology, clinical chemistry, organ weight, and body weight data were evaluated using analysis of variance and the Dunnett's Test (Steel and Torrie, 1960) . Statistical evaluation of tumor incidence was performed by Fisher's Exact Probability Test (Siegel, 1956 ). In addition, palpable mass data were evaluated using a modified Wilcoxon Test (Haseman and Hoel, 1974) . The level of significance chosen for all cases was p < 0.05, the overall level of statistical significance is unknown because of the large number of statistical comparisons. The final interpretation of numerical data considered statistical analyses along with other factors such as dose-response relationships and whether the results are plausible in light of other biological and pathological fmdings.
