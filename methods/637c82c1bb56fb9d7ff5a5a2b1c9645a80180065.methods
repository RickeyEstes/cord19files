Construction of specific control sequence. A specific control sequence derived from mtDNA sequences of two extinct species-thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) and the moa bird (Dinornis struthoides)-was constructed as described previously 8 . Construction of pACYCDuet-1-TM. The specific control sequence was cloned into multiple cloning site 2 (MCS2) of the pACYCDuet-1 vector (p15A-type replication origin; Novagen, Merck, Germany; Fig. 1 ). In brief, a 191-bp amplicon encoding the specific control sequence was obtained by PCR using a de novo template construct and the TM-NdeI F and TM-AvrII pac R primer pair, which included NdeI and AvrII restriction enzyme sites; the TM-AvrII pac R primer also included one C-variant pac site ( Table 3 ). The reaction mixture was composed of 12.5 µl of FastStart PCR master (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Germany), 7.5 pmol of each primer and 3.3 pmol of template DNA. The assay was run in a total volume of 25 µl under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 56 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 30 seconds; final extension was at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The results of the PCR amplification were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%). The PCR product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) and subsequently cleaved at 37 °C for 2 hours. The composition of the restriction mixture was 500 ng of PCR product, 2 µl of NEBuffer 2 (New England Biolabs, UK; NEB), 20 U and 4 U of NdeI and AvrII endonucleases, respectively (both NEB), in a final volume of 20 µl. The cleaved PCR product was also purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The pACYCDuet-1 vector was cleaved at 37 °C for 2 hours. The restriction mixture was composed of 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 5 µl of NEBuffer 2 (NEB) 20 U and 4 U of NdeI and AvrII endonucleases, respectively (both NEB), in a final volume of 50 µl. The cleaved vector was dephosphorylated with 0.25 U of calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (NEB) at 37 °C for 1 hour. Subsequently, vector DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Ligation of the specific control sequence to the MCS2 of the cleaved pACYCDuet-1 vector was performed using the Quick-ligation kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformation of E. coli TOP10 (Life Technologies, USA) was also performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transformed cells were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) (Sigma-Aldrich, Czech Republic) agar plates containing chloramphenicol (34 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight. Plasmid DNA was isolated with the NucleoSpin Plasmid kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of specific inserts was confirmed by vector-specific (DuetUP2 and T7 terminator) and insert-specific (TM F and TM R) primers ( Construction of the expression vector with a single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag for production of His-tagged MS2 PLP -pACYCDuet-1-TM-CoatDimer-His. The sequence of maturase and the single-chain version of the coat protein dimer containing the His-tag were synthesized de novo (Life Technologies) (Fig. 2) . The de novo construct also contained a transversion of adenine (A) at position 639 to cytosine (C). This change does not influence the amino acid sequence of maturase but leads to deletion of the NdeI restriction site (CATATG −› CCTATG). Fusion of the two sequences encoding the coat protein was done as in the pCT2dl-13 construct 18, 19 . The sequence (-GGTACCCATCACCATCACCATCACGGTACC-) encoding the His-tag flanked by two KpnI restriction sites (underlined) 13 was inserted between residues 11 and 12 of the second coat protein amino acid sequence (corresponding to the position between codons 15 and 16 of wild-type coat protein sequence) 14 . The de novo construct was verified by sequencing (Life Technologies). The fragment encoding the maturase and single-chain version of the coat protein dimer with the His-tag modification was obtained by PCR with the KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, USA) using the de novo template construct and the MS2 NcoI and MS2 NotI primer pair, which included NcoI and NotI restriction enzyme sites ( Table 1 ). The reaction mixture was composed of 5 µl of 5 × Kapa HiFi fidelity buffer, 0.3 mM dNTP mix, 7.5 pmol of each primer, 1 U of Kapa HiFi polymerase, and 5 pmol of template DNA. The assay was run in a total volume of 25 µl under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 25 cycles of 98 °C for 20 seconds, 55 °C for 15 seconds, and 72 °C for 70 seconds; final extension was at 72 °C for 5 minutes.
