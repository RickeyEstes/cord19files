Protein sequence retrieval. Whole proteome of the LIC, encoding 3654 proteins was retrieved from the Universal Protein (UniProt) database (Proteome ID: UP000007037) (http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/) in FASTA format and used for further analysis. UniProt is a comprehensive resource for protein sequences and annotation information which provide functional information about proteins with accuracy and consistency.
