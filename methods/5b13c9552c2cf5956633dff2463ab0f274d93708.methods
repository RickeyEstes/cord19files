In order to investigate the interannual variation of surface PM concentration in the SMA, we conducted a 12-year simulation using a regional air quality modeling system. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emission (SMOKE), and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models were utilized to simulate meteorology and chemistry over East Asia (27- 52 was used to prepare biogenic emissions. MCIP-processed ground reaching solar radiation and 2-m temperature were used to adjust hourly biogenic emissions such as isoprene and monoterpenes. Other vegetation data like leaf area index, plant function type, and emission factors were also used as released with MEGAN v2.04. Biomass burning and dust emissions were not included. The modeling configuration was tested for multiple years as part of the Integrated Multi-Scale Air Quality Study for Korea (IMAQS-K) system, which was initially developed as a prototype of the official national air quality forecast system in South Korea. The IMAQS-K system has been operational since 2012. Descriptions on physical options are provided in Kim et al. 53 , and basic model performance evaluations for 12-year period are provided in the supplementary materials. Model performed well in reproducing spatial and temporal variations of meteorology and chemical components. While total particulate matter concentration generally underestimates in the model, current analysis, using percent change of inter-annual variation, is designed to be less affected by the model bias. Surface monitoring data. Hourly observations of surface PM concentrations and wind speed were obtained from NIER and KMA, respectively. PM measurements, based on the beta-ray absorption method 54 , were collected from 247 urban air monitoring network sites, and wind data were collected from 79 meteorological monitoring sites. Locations of monitors are shown in the supplementary material. Note on other controlling factors. (1) A recent study on the regional emission attribution to the South Korea suggests that the relative attribution of foreign emission sources is not sensitive to inter-annual variation of meteorology 55 , contributing around 60% of the SMA PM concentration. Combined with the current declining trend of anthropogenic emissions from China, we can rule out the possibility of the increased efficiency of Chinese emissions transport. (2) The number of diesel vehicles in South Korea has increased 13% from 2012 to 2014. Since non-truck diesel vehicles emit 5.6% of total NO x emission in South Korea 5 , resultant impact is small (<1% of total PM). However, careful and continuous monitoring of diesel vehicle emissions is necessary due to their high uncertainty in emissions factors as we have learned from the Volkswagen emission scandal 56 .
