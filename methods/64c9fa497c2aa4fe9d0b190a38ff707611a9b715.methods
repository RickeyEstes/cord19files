Traditional DEA models have been widely utilized in the study of environmental and energy efficiency (Dyckhoff and Allen, 2001; Qin et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017) , but they ignored undesirable outputs (Seiford and Zhu, 2002) . CO 2 is an undesirable output in the calculation of CEE, and linear transformation method can be utilized to add undesirable outputs into the traditional DEA model (Seiford and Zhu, 2002) . Combining DEA and window analysis, DEA window analysis can be utilized to estimate the dynamic effect of efficiency (Charnes and Cooper, 1985) and is suitable to estimate the CEE during the period of 2000e2010 in the YRD.
