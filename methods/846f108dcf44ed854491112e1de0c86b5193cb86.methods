Data for this study were collected as part of the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) 2009. QSS is an annual statewide survey conducted by the Population Research Laboratory (PRL) in CQUniversity Australia's Institute for Health and Social Science Research. Through a costsharing arrangement, QSS enables researchers and policy-makers to incorporate questions into the survey. Queensland is the second largest Australian state by land area, and the third most populous state. QSS uses a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system and trained interviewers to randomly sample households across Queensland, including metropolitan Brisbane (South East Queensland) and the rest of the state (Other Queensland). To ensure equal representation of males and females, households are randomly pre-determined to provide a male or female respondent; if a person of that sex is not available then the household is not included in the survey. QSS 2009 consisted of a standardized introduction, specific questions incorporated by researchers and the University, and 37 demographic questions. The questions were pilot tested by trained interviewers in 92 randomly-selected households, with modifications to the questions guided by both responses from the pilot study subjects and feedback from the interviewers. Final   interviewing was conducted between 20 July 2009 and  19 August 2009, between the hours of 10:30 am to 2:30  pm and 4:30 pm to 8:30 pm on weekdays, and between  the hours of 11:00 am and 4:00 pm on weekends. Four questions related to respondents' anticipated compliance with a physician's advice to stay home if they had a viral respiratory illness were incorporated into QSS 2009. The four questions were: • If you had a common cold and your doctor recommended that you stay home for at least seven days so as not to infect anyone else, how likely are you to do so? • If you had the regular flu, but not swine or bird flu, and your doctor recommended that you stay home for at least seven days so as not to infect anyone else, how likely are you to do so? • If you had the swine flu and your doctor recommended that you stay home for at least seven days so as not to infect anyone else, how likely are you to do so? • If you had the avian or bird flu and your doctor recommended that you stay home for at least seven days so as not to infect anyone else, how likely are you to do so? Responses were recorded using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from "very unlikely" to "very likely." Responses were subsequently dichotomized as "yes" (very likely or likely) and "no" (very unlikely or unlikely) and crosstabulated in a 2 × 2 table. Because the data are essentially repeated measures of likelihood to comply under different circumstances, discordance between responses for the different diseases was analysed using McNemar's test. Bivariate associations between relevant demographic variables and anticipated compliance were analysed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test; where demographic variables were recorded as ordinal data, analyses utilizing chi-square for linear-by-linear association were conducted to identify any significant trend effects. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify covariates and interaction effects, and to adjust for confounding. Each variable was entered into or removed from the logistic regression model using both forward and backward methods to identify significant covariates, the remaining variables were then individually entered into the model to identify potential confounders. The final model included significant covariates, potential confounders and significant interaction effects. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance; for the multivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. QSS 2009 had a target sample size of 1,200 subjects, with 800 subjects from South East Queensland and 400 from Other Queensland; thus the a priori estimated sampling error at the 95% confidence level was ± 2.9% overall, ± 3.6% for the South East Queensland sub-sample, and ± 5.1% for the Other Queensland sub-sample.
