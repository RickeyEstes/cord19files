Preparation of RL. The herbal material was prepared as described previously 23 . Briefly, 500 g Yingshi and 300 g Jinyinhua were mixed, minced, macerated with 12 L absolute ethanol for 24 h, and refluxed for 2 h twice. Supernatants were filtered, concentrated, freeze-dried and produced RL (Yield: 15.2%). To control its quality, we established an HPLC chromatogram for RL and quantified the contents of gallic acid and chlorogenic acid (Supplementary Figure 1) , which is the same as the Supplementary Material of a previous report 23 . Animal treatments. Male Wistar rats (140 ± 15 g) were supplied by the Chinese University of Hong Kong and housed under standard conditions (25 ± 2 °C, humidity: 60 ± 10%, 12 h-light:12 h-dark) with free access to water and chow. Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into six groups of eight. Five groups were immunized intradermally, at the base of the tail and the back, with 200 μ g bovine type II collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) in 0.05 M acetic acid emulsified with equal volume incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) on day 0. A boost injection of 100 μ g collagen-IFA suspension was given in the same manner on day 7. From day 14 to 56, immunized groups were intragastrically (i.g.) administered with 165, 330, 660 mg RL/kg/day, 2.5 mg indomethacin/kg/day and saline, respectively; while normal controls were i.g. administered with saline. Retro-orbital blood samplings under anaesthesia were performed at various time points. Sera were collected by centrifugation (1500 G, 20 min). At day 57, the rats were fasted overnight and killed by anaesthetic overdose. After taking radiographs of hind limbs, left paw tissues (whole joints including synovium, adjacent tissues and bones) were pulverized using a mortar and pestle filled with liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.35% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA of pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10 μ g/mL aprotinin, 10 μ g/mL leupetin and 10 μ g/mL pepstatin A. Right hind limbs were collected for histological examinations. Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from spleens as described 6 . Red blood cells in the suspensions were removed by treatment with 0.16 M Tris-NH 4 Cl solution. Liver tissues were dissected and homogenized in ice-cold saline using an ultra-Turrax T-25 homogenizer. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hong Kong Baptist University. All experimental procedures were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health. Every effort was made to reduce the number of animals used and minimize their pain and distress. Macroscopic scoring of CIA. Each hind limb was scored on a 0 ~ 4 scale: 0 = normal; 1 = mild, but definite ankle erythema and swelling, or limited to individual digits; 2 = moderate ankle erythema and swelling; 3 = entire limb erythema and swelling including digits; 4 = maximally inflamed limb with multiple joints involvement. The arthritis score was the sum of the scores of the two hind limbs (maximum: 8). To quantify oedema, hind paw volumes were measured using a plethysmometer.
