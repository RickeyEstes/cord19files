We represent an RNA molecule by a sequence, S, of its four bases, Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Uracil (U). We denote the length of the RNA molecule by n and refer to each base by its index i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. When an RNA molecule folds, bonds may form between canonical pairs of bases (A-U, C-G, and G-U) (see Figure 1 ). Throughout this work, we consider only cases where each base may pair at most with one other base, and represent base pairing between i and j by i.j. We define a secondary structure, R, as a set of pairs i.j, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; i.j and k.j can belong to the same set if and only if i = k. If i.j and k.l are two base pairs of a secondary structure, R, and 1 ≤ i < k < j < l ≤ n, we say i.j crosses k.l. We refer to a secondary structure with crossing base pairs as a pseudoknotted secondary structure and a secondary structure with no crossing base pairs as a pseudoknot-free secondary structure (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 shows different kinds of loops in a secondary structure. We refer the readers to Jabbari et al. [48] or Rastegari et al. [56] for precise definition and illustration of terms used in the figure. Figure 1 Pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free secondary structures. Examples of loops and canonical base pairs in a pseudoknotted and a pseudoknot-free secondary structure. The blue base pairs belong to the G big structure and the green base pairs belong to the G small structure, as defined in Section 'Definition of G big and G small '.
