A mixed-methods approach consisting of key informant interviews and a web survey was used to assess Ontario' s public health accountability and performance management initiative. All data collection and analysis were conducted by the principal author with university ethics approval and editorial feedback from co-authors. This study used many elements of a case study approach, such as interview and survey methods and triangulating analysis, which have been used extensively in the field of implementation research (Long and Franklin 2004; McDermott 2004; Mischen 2006) . Research conforming to case study characteristics has also been used to investigate public accountability and performance management (Christensen and Laegreid 2014; Hildebrand and McDavid 2011) . Key informant interviews were conducted in three public health units (sites A, B and C). Sample selection was conducted to reflect diverse implementation contexts characterized by both rural and urban service environments, as well as municipal and regional governance. In total, 20 semi-structured key informant interviews of ~1 hour in length were conducted. All interviews were tape-recorded and professionally transcribed in full. Public health unit informants included executive, management and specialists in various areas of public health, such as chronic and infectious disease prevention and control. These groups of individuals represent the primary implementers of the province' s public health accountability and performance management intervention. Four separate interviews with representatives of the MOHLTC were also conducted during the same period of data collection. These interviews also followed a semi-structured approach and included individuals directly involved with the development of the province' s quality improvement initiative. Interview questions for both public health unit and Ministry informants included specific and broad items relating to facilitators and barriers within the four dimensions of CQI. For example, Ministry and public health informants were asked to choose characteristics of Shortell et al.' s (1995) organizational cultures typology (i.e., teamwork, risk-taking, bureaucratic, efficiency-focused) that best reflected their work environment. Broader items included questions asking informants to independently identify what conditions or factors were critical to the success of implementing Ontario' s system of accountability and performance management. In addition to key informant interviews, a web survey of public health managers was conducted. Targeting all public health managers in each of the province' s 36 health units, recruitment involved contacting each senior executive to seek approval and access to their organizations. In total, 12 public health units agreed to participate and provided contact lists of public health managers; 97 surveys were distributed; 53 questionnaires were returned, providing a response rate of 54.6%. This sample, while only covering one-third of all public health units, represented a near-equivalent distribution of rural, mixed rural and urban, and urban jurisdictions. Survey questions, for example, asked about manager discretion, relating to stakeholder decision-making in the strategic dimension; resistance to the intervention, relating to barriers in the cultural dimension; familiarity with components of the initiative, as well as sentiment regarding performance measurement pertinent to the technical dimension; and prospective thoughts on the use (and usefulness) of collected information for performance management and quality improvement. Directed content analysis was applied to qualitative data by using an initial coding frame informed by pre-existing empirical and theoretical literature (Hickey and Kipping 1996; Hsieh and Shannon 2005; Potter and Levine-Donnerstein 1999) . Strong, anomalous themes were then coded separately. Established codes were then matched with facilitators and barriers of Shortell et al.' s (1998) four dimensions of CQI and analyzed. Quantitative data collected using keysurvey.com were recoded for descriptive and bivariate analyses using SPSS. Two-sided Fisher' s exact tests (p â‰¤ 0.05) assessed association because of the small survey sample (Daya 2002) . Findings from the survey supplement the qualitative data, and all presented findings did not feature missing data (n = 53).
