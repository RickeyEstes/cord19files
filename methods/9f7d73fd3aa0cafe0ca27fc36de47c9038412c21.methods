Details of the implementation of the stochastic system are described in Appendix B. One practical approach to estimate the parameters k, p and q of the HM model, when the individual-level processes are unknown, would be to fit these parameters using time series data (Gubbins and Gilligan, 1997; Bjørnstad et al., 2002; Finkenstä dt et al., 2002) . Indeed, with a sufficient number of parameters a satisfactory agreement between the model and the data is almost always possible. A direct fit of time series, however, will not tell us whether the disease transmission rate is well approximated by the functional form kS p I q of the model. We instead fit the parameters k, p, q to the transmission rate ''observed'' in the output of the stochastic simulation. Specifically, we obtain least-squared estimates of k, p, q by fitting the term kS p I q to the computed number of pairs [SI] that gives the disease transmission rate of the stochastic system (see Eq. (1)). We then incorporate these estimates in Eq. (2), and compare the infective time series produced by this HM model to that generated by the original stochastic network simulation. example. In this way, we can address whether the transmission rate is well captured by the modified functional form, and if that is the case, whether the HM model approximates successfully the aggregated dynamics of the stochastic system. We compare the stochastic simulation with the predictions of three sets of model equations, representing different degrees of approximation of the system. Besides the HM model described above, we consider the bilinear mean-field model given by Eq. (4), which assumes k = n 0 /N and p = q = 1. This comparison demonstrates the inadequacy of the wellmixed assumption built into the bilinear formulation. We also discuss a restricted HM model with an incidence function of the form ðn 0 =NÞS pr I qr in Eq. (2), with only two heterogeneity parameters p r and q r , as originally proposed by Severo (1969) and studied by Liu et al. (1986) , Hethcote and van den Driessche (1991) and Hochberg (1991) .
