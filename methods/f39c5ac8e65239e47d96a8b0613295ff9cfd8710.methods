In collaboration with a research librarian, we searched the PubMed electronic database for studies that were published between June 1, 2002, and June 1, 2012. Using a Boolean combination of keywords and medical subject headings (Appendix 1), we conducted separate searches to capture adherence rates of HH during routine patient care, adherence rates of aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters, adherence rates to urinary catheter insertion guidelines, and rates of equipment contamination. We selected these procedures because they are more likely to increase the risk of infection when compared with less invasive procedures such as peripheral intravenous catheter insertion. Articles were excluded if they concerned the contamination of cultures; described self-reported compliance; did not separate ED data from other areas under study; were review articles; and were commentaries, editorials, or discussions of the issue (ie, not data based). We also excluded studies that examined compliance during outbreaks or pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or emergency situations because we were interested in standard practices during routine care. Using the same terms and time frame, we also electronically searched the tables of contents of the following journals: Academic Emergency Medicine, Emergency Medicine Journal, Emergency Medicine, Journal of Emergency Nursing, Annals of Emergency Medicine, European Journal of Emergency Medicine American Journal of Infection Control, Journal of Hospital Infection, and Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. Finally, we hand searched the reference sections of pertinent review articles that were identified in the PubMed search. One researcher initially screened study titles and abstracts for overall relevance. The 3 authors then independently reviewed remaining study titles and abstracts. Collectively, study authors discussed the rationale for remaining articles based on the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. Articles that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria were reviewed in full text. Figure 1 , at the initial screening phase, 853 articles were identified (850 from the original PubMed search; 3 through supplemental means). After removing duplicate citations and limiting articles to those published in English with available abstracts, 589 abstracts were screened. An additional 553 studies were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria, primarily because they were self-reports of practices, did not report ED data separately, and/or observations of the placement of devices were made during emergency procedures. The full texts of 36 papers were reviewed, and 23 articles were identified as meeting study inclusion. These are summarized below.
