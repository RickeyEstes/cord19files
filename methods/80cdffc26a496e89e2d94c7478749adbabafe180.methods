Periodic surveillance for finding AFI patients in ED of participating hospitals was performed prospectively (Figure 2 ). AFI was defined as 1) fever: body temperature ≥38 °C at admission, or 2) chief complaint of febrile or chilling sensation. Demography of patients and chief complaints were investigated in this first step (CRF #1). Cases were classified into six categories based on their clinical diagnoses: 1) respiratory AFI [AFRI] , 2) gastroenteric AFI [AFGI] , 3) exanthematic AFI [AFEI], 4) other infectious AFI, 5) non-infectious AFI, and 6) unclassified AFI. Participating infectious diseases specialists regularly reviewed and reformed this classification. Because the aim of GAFINet is primarily monitoring communityor aboard-acquired infection, nosocomial AFI cases or the patients transferred from another hospital were excluded. When a patient had a history of international travel or he/she were undiagnosed in three days after ED admission, more comprehensive information (CRF#2 & #3) including history and final diagnosis were obtained. For a baseline data, age-and sex-stratified ED visits were also gathered weekly. The proportion of AFI cases per 1000 visits was determined for one week period and analyzed by febrile diseases categories with age-stratification. Characteristics of cases with international travel histories or undiagnosed cases were also described separately.
