We describe the transmission pattern and contact tracing of a MERS-CoV-infected HCW, resulting in an outbreak in PMAH in SA. All suspected HCWs were tested for MERS-COV using real-time polymerase chain reaction. 14 The target upstream of MERS-CoV was upE and ORF1a. 14 The first case who initiated the outbreak was designated as the index case with all her positive contacts designated as primary transmissions. As described previously, subsequent cases resulting from the first-generation cases were called second-generation transmission, and infected HCWs from those were designated as thirdgeneration cases and so on. 15
