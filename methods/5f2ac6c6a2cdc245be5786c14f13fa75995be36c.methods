An assessment of the Jeddah outbreak conducted before our investigation at KFGH (9) produced a list of all MERS cases in Jeddah diagnosed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) conducted at the Jeddah MOH regional laboratory or Jeddah-area hospitals. This list included patient demographics, clinical data, onset date, and exposure data (including exposure to healthcare facilities) (9) and was used to identify ill persons with exposure to KFGH. We defined a case as RT-PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in a symptomatic person during March 2-May 10, 2014, who was exposed to KFGH as a HCW, patient, or visitor. We selected this study period to capture all persons with exposure to KFGH in the 14 days before illness onset. We categorized cases as potentially KFGH-acquired if affected persons had known KFGH contact before MERS onset and not KFGH-acquired if their first contact with KFGH followed MERS onset. We used KFGH electronic records to determine admission and discharge dates, inpatient rooms and beds occupied, and demographics for emergency department (ED) patients and inpatients. We assumed an incubation period of 2-14 days (5) and that patients were potentially infectious for 14 days after the onset date. To track the source of infection in individual patients, we looked for instances where an infectious inpatient was in the same room on the same date as a susceptible patient during the 2-14 days before MERS onset in the susceptible patient. We interviewed administrative, infection control, and clinical personnel at KFGH to review infection control recommendations and conducted a facility walk-through to evaluate infection control measures.
