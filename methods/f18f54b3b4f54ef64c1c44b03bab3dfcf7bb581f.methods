In the preparation of this review, various comparable literature data on MSW from Europe, North America and Japan were collected [27, 28] . All the articles were selected on composts of MSW origin. On account of the similarity of the problems encountered, our literature review also covered compost made from sediment wastes from water treatment stations and green wastes (gardens, parks, forests, etc.) . For the same reasons, some articles that treated non-composted SS were considered.
