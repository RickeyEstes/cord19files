Mice. Female C57BL/6 aged 6-8 weeks from the SPF unit at the Francis Crick Institute Mill Hill Laboratory were housed under reverse light conditions (light 19.00-07.00, dark 07.00-19.00 GMT) at 20-22 Â°C, and had continuous access to mouse breeder diet and water. Core body temperature was measured with an infrared surface thermometer (Fluke); body weight was calculated relative to a baseline measurement taken before infection; and erythrocyte density was determined on a VetScan HM5 haematology system (Abaxis). This study was carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (Home Office licence 80/2538 and 70/8326), and was approved by The Francis Crick Institute Ethical Committee.
