Publications containing abstracts were extracted with a literature search performed in August 2007 using the online version of the SCI 速 (http://scientific.thomson. com/products/sci/)-ISI Web of Knowledge Service (version 3.1). Author-generated key words, such as "obstructive sleep apnea", "obstructive apnea", and "OSA", and KeyWords Plus 速 were analyzed. KeyWords Plus 速 in the SCI database supplies additional search terms extracted from the titles of articles cited by authors in their bibliographies and footnotes. 16 Data collected from the online searches were extracted and manipulated in Excel spreadsheets to provide the input for the analysis, and the search results were checked to verify that all entries were related to OSA. Documents were analyzed according to trends of publication output, subject category, journal pattern, country of publication, authorship, author-generated key words, and KeyWords Plus 速 . The trend of annual publication output was determined from 1991, the first year in which abstracts were available in ISI, to 2006, the last year for which complete information was available at the time of the search; and the analysis was performed for 4-year periods within this 16-year time span. Articles originating from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were grouped under the United Kingdom (UK) heading. The impact factor of a journal was determined for each document as reported in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2005. We determined the type of collaboration for each article by the address of each author, where "independent" was assigned if no collaboration was found and "international collaboration" was assigned if a paper was co-written by researchers from more than 1 country.
