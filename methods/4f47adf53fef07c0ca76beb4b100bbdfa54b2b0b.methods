The PCR fragments were cloned into a pCMV mammalian expression vector (clontech). Primer sequences used for M1 are 5′ -GAATTCCACCATGCAGCTGGCCACCTTAT-3′ and 5′ -GAAGATCTTTAAGCGTAATCTGGAA CATCGTATGGGTATCCTCCTCCTCCGGACTGCTGCCCAGG-3′ . Primer sequences for M3 are 5′ -GAATTCCACCATGGCCTTCCTATCCACA TCTG-3′ and 5′ -GAAGATCTTTAAGCGTAA TCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATCCTCCTCCTCCATGATCCCCAAAATACTCCAGC-3′ . M1 and M3 mutants were similarly constructed using primer sequences listed in Table S1 . Location prediction of signal peptides was performed on the SignalP 4.0 Server 57 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Reporter assays. 293T Cells were grown to 60-75% confluency in 48-well plates and transfection was perforned using BioT (Bioland Scientific LLC) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed 24 hours posttransfection for dual-luciferase assays (Promega). For each assay, the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the renilla luciferase reading in the same well, and the ratio was calculated based on the vector control (the value of which was set as 1).
