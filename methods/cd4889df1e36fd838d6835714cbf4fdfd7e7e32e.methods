This study was conducted in two university hospitals in Daejeon, Korea: Chungnam National University Hospital (CNUH) and The Catholic University of Korea Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital (DSMH). To evaluate the changes in clinical features more clearly, we divided the subjects into 2 groups according to their time of admission, a decade-interval apart. We reviewed medical records of a total of 615 KD patients: those admitted between January 2000 and December 2004 (the 2000-2004 group, n = 284) and those admitted between January 2010 and December 2014 (the 2010-2014 group, n = 331). The selection of KD was based on clinical diagnostic criteria guidelines established by the Japanese Kawasaki Disease Research Committee or the American Heart Association (AHA) [1, 18] . There were 330 cases from CNUH and 285 cases from DSMH. KD patients that had spontaneous defervescence without IVIG treatment during hospitalization were excluded (28 cases). Complete KD is defined as having fever of ≥5 days with at least 4 of the 5 principal clinical signs: 1) bilateral conjunctival injections, 2) changes in the lips and oral cavity, 3) polymorphous exanthema, 4) changes in the peripheral extremities, and 5) acute nonpurulent cervical lymphadenopathy. Incomplete KD was defined as having fever of ≥5 days with 3 or fewer principal signs, with or without cardiac lesions once other KD-like diseases with similar findings had been excluded. Because the diagnosis of KD in this study was made by experts in KD, independently, at each hospital during the study period (HR Kil and KY Lee) , there were few differences in the policy of diagnosis and IVIG treatment in this study. Laboratory parameters were examined at least twice during hospitalization at presentation and at discharge. All patients underwent 2D-echocardiography of the coronary arteries during hospitalization and again at approximately 1 or 2 months after discharge. Echocardiographic findings that were performed during hospitalization were analyzed. CALs were defined as ectasia when there was coronary arterial dilatation ≤4 mm in children that were younger than 5 years or ≤5 mm in children that were 5 years or older, or when the diameter was <1.5 times the size of the adjacent coronary artery. Aneurysm was defined as coronary artery dilatation in excess of that ascribed to ectasia, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare guidelines [18] . We compared the clinical and laboratory indices between the groups.
