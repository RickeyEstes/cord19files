All procedures for creating and breeding the pigs were approved by the IACUC at the University of Missouri and viral challenge experiments were approved by the IACUC at Kansas State University. Design and cloning of ANPEP guide RNAs (gRNAs) Guide RNAs were designed to regions within exon 2 of the ANPEP gene. Exon two was selected to target for Cas9 cleavage because it includes a large block of coding region and disruption near the start codon would minimize the likelihood that a truncated protein would retain any functional domains. In some predicted transcripts, exon 2 could be placed in part or in whole as the first, second, or third exon. Since the start codon locates to exon 2, all guide RNAs, listed in Online Resource Table S1 and Online Resource Fig. 1 , were designed after the start codon so that INDELs would result in a frame shift followed by a premature start codon. The oligonucleotide pairs consisting of primers 1 and 2 were annealed and cloned into the p330X vector, which contains two expression cassettes, a human codon-optimized S. pyogenes (hSpy) Cas9 and the chimeric guide RNA.

Plasmids with the appropriate insert were propagated in Top10 cells (Invitrogen) and plasmid preps were performed with a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were placed at -20Â°C until use for in vitro transcription or for transfection.
