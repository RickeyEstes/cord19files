Virus sequences were downloaded from GenBank and alignments were generated using standard bioinformatics software (blast [40] , clustal [41] and EMBOSS [42] ). Candidate overlapping CDSs were identified using either MLOGD or analysis of conservation at Figure 3 for details). The predominantly positive scores indicate that ORFX is likely to be a coding sequence, but is subject to significantly weaker purifying selection than ORF3. The negative scores at the 3' end of ORFX indicate that the C-terminal region of the putative product is not subject to strong functional constraints.
