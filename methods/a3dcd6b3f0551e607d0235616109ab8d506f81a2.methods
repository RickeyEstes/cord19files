We model a vaccine trial by first generating a model of a main population and a network of individuals grouped into communities, the structure of which has been described previously (see Supplementary Table 1 for parameters) (16) . The model is compartmental, using deterministic (differential equation) dynamics for the main population and stochastic dynamics in the communities. We simulate an epidemic in the main population with a seasonal transmission rate that generates an epidemic curve with a shape similar to the epidemic curve of the 2015 Zika outbreak in Brazil (17) . The disease is introduced into communities via infectious contact with the main population, and transmission occurs when infected individuals transmit to their susceptible connections in the communities. All susceptible individuals have a daily probability of infection from each of their infectious neighbors of 1-e -β , where β is the force of infection, as well as a daily external hazard of infection from the main population, which varies with the prevalence in the main population. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Symptomatic (or Infectious/Asymptomatic)-Recovered (SEIS(IAS)R) model, with estimated incubation and infectious periods of a Zika-like disease (Supplementary Table 1 ). Vector transmission is not directly modeled, so the serial interval of the simulated disease is shorter than that of Zika virus disease. Symptomatic and asymptomatic infections are assumed to be equally infectious, and whether an individual is infected by a symptomatic or an asymptomatic individual does not affect their probability of becoming symptomatic. The baseline parameters of the model assume 20% of those infected in both the vaccine and control .

The epidemic and the vaccine trial are simulated in both a network of individuals grouped into five relatively disconnected communities as well as in a network of individuals in one large community. 7.5% of the individuals in the communities are enrolled into a 150-day long trial, and individuals are randomized to the vaccine or control groups. All individuals enrolled into the trial are assumed to be naïve to the infection, which in practice might require serologic testing of all individuals prior to enrollment. The vaccine is leaky, meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon each exposure to an infectious individual. The daily probability of infection from vaccinees' infectious contacts is 1-e -β(1-VE) , where VE is the assumed direct leaky multiplicative vaccine efficacy (8, 18) . VES is estimated with seven different approaches, which are described in Table 1 . Trial status (i.e. vaccine or control) is the explanatory variable for all Cox proportional hazards models, and individuals who are never infected are censored at the end of the trial. Approach 1 assumes that the time of infection is known exactly (to the day) even for asymptomatic infections and therefore would be strictly applicable only where very frequent testing is performed throughout the trial. Approach 2 assumes that infection is unobserved for asymptomatic infections, so only symptomatic infections are included in the Cox regression, and those infected asymptomatically are assumed to have survived without infection to the end of follow up. Because this latter approach leads to bias in estimating VES (see Figure 1 and Results), we consider five additional approaches. In the interval censored Cox models, the exact day of infection for the symptomatic individuals is known (and in practice would be laboratory-confirmed). For the asymptomatically .

Two different interval lengths are assessed to determine if increased frequency of testing yields more precise results (19) . As mentioned above, this method assumes the ability of the serologic test to distinguish between vaccine acquired immunity and naturally acquired immunity, currently possible for some but not all vaccines/pathogens (20-22). The results from the network with five communities are analyzed first with the same seven approaches, treating the five communities as if they were one large community. Alternatively, to account for the potential for heterogeneity in hazard rates between communities, the Cox models in Approaches 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 are stratified by community (16) , and estimates from Approaches 3 and 4 are calculated separately within each community and meta-analyzed using inverse-variance weighting. Empirical coverage probabilities are calculated by the proportion of simulations with 95% confidence intervals that cover the true VES parameter of the model (60%). Power is estimated by the proportion of simulations in which P < 0.05 for the null hypothesis of VES=0 and the estimated VES is greater than 0. The trial is also simulated with fewer participants to assess power in smaller trials. Additionally, to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing progression to symptoms, VEP is estimated by: The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/295337 doi: bioRxiv preprint Finally, to assess whether the results hold in other contexts, trial parameters such as trial length, VES, and the proportion of the infected individuals in each arm of the trial that becomes symptomatic, are varied. R code for these analyses is available at: https://github.com/rek160/Asymptomatic-Infection-Vaccine-Efficacy. Figure 2 displays the results of the median of 500 simulations in the single-community network, showing VES estimates from the seven approaches described above across three values of R0, the basic reproductive number. As expected, Approach 1 returns accurate VES estimates, while Approach 2 returns estimates biased towards the null because there is differential overestimation of person-time at risk, with worse overestimates in the controls (Figure 1 ). This bias is exacerbated as R0 increases. Approach 3 returns an estimate biased toward the null compared to the true value of VES, also as expected and also worsened at higher levels of R0 (8) .
