Fourteen patients aged from 22 to 73 years old (median of 45 years), were diagnosed as probable SARS patients based on WHO criteria in February 2003. Serial serum samples were collected at 7-210 days after the onset of symptoms, and were subjected to antibody analysis. Anti-viral antibodies (IgG, IgM) were assayed by indirect fluorescence (IF) kits developed by Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology and approved by State Drugs Administration of China (Si et al., 2003) . 20 l diluted sera (1:20 or greater dilution) were added onto slides containing monolayers of SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells and non-infected Vero cells as a negative control. The slides were incubated at 37 • C for 30 min, washed three times with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and then FITC-labeled anti-human IgG or FITC-labeled anti-human IgM were added for 30 min. The slides were washed as before, and fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. The dilution for cut off is 1:20. Anti-nucleocaspid (N protein, NP) total Ig was assayed by an antigen-capturing ELISA (AC-ELISA) co-developed by Sina-American Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Shi et al., 2003) . For this assay, 100 l of serum samples were added to wells coated with recombinant N protein, the plate was incubated at 37 • C for 30 min, and then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. 100 l HRP (Horse radish peroxidase)-conjugated N protein was added and the plate was incubated for another 30 min followed by washing as above. Then 100 l of TMB substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride, 0.01% H 2 O 2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.8) was added and incubated at 37 • C for 20 min, The reaction was terminated by adding 50 l 2 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The maximum dilution of the serum at which a positive signal was obtained (IFA), or an absorbance at 450 nm wavelength greater than 0.15 (cutoff value) was given, was defined as antibody titer. The data were analyzed by SPSS11.0 software and the geometric means of seropositive samples were employed in all statistics. Neutralization antibody was assayed by the following protocol: 1 ml diluted serum was mixed with 1 ml DMEM medium containing 2 × 10 6 SARS-CoV (strain BJ-1) virus, and incubated at 37 • C for 1 h in a water-bath. Then the mixture was aliquotted to 8 wells (200 l each) of Vero E6 cell monolayers grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The plate was incubated at 37 • C, 5% CO 2 for 7 days. The highest dilution of the serum at which 50% of the wells were protected from viral cytopathic effect was considered to be the neutralizing titer.
