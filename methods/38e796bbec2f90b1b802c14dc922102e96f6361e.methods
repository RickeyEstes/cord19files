We use the following ordinary differential equation model to simulate the coronavirus within-lung growth: where E p (t), E * p (t) and v(t) are the number of uninfected pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus. β is the infection rate of virus, π v is the virus production rate, E p (0) is the initial value of uninfected epithelial cells, and the term d E E p (0) assumes a constant regeneration of uninfected epithelial cells. d E , d E * and d v are the death rate of uninfected pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus, respectively. The death rate of E p (t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonary epithelial cells, while, d E * and d v are the combination of the natural clearance rate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used to describe the within-lung infection process of flu virus [5, 11] . By the definition of generation matrix of basic reproduction number R 0 [3] , the R 0 of model (1) can be written as, This number is an important value to measure whether the epidemic or species could die out or not [16] . In this study, the sensitivity analysis result of R 0 is shown in the next section. In this study, the chest radiograph score data from serve patients (with high chest radiograph scores) are collected from the work of Pan et. al [14] and Oh et. al [13] Our estimation is based on these two data sets. We consider the chest radiograph score as a way to reflect the infected pulmonary epithelial cells [13, 14] , which is also the target attacked by the immune cell [12] . Thus by the Poisson distribution, the likelihood that used to extimate parameters can be written as, where D i is the smoothed chest radiograph score of the serve patient at time The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . which is larger than the clearance rate of the virus on the outside surface [4] . This result shows the immune system can clear the virus directly. The estimation result also shows that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 in serve patients is around the mean value 3.79 which is lower than that of MERS virus (8.16) . These results illustrate that the immune system can not clear the virus effectively at the beginning time of symptom onset. By these estimated parameters of COVID-19, the solutions of model (1) are illustrated in Figure . 2. The partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) method [9] is used to do the sensitivity analysis of R 0 . The result ( Figure . 3) shows that the parameters E p (0), β, π v , d E * , and d v have almost the same level of influence on R 0 . Parameters d E * , and d v have negative correlations with R 0 , while E p (0), β, π v have positive correlations. The positive correlation of E p (0) with R 0 may give a explanation on why the babys, who have small amount of pulmonary epithelial cells, are not likely to get infected and have lower mortality ( [15] Table 1 ).
