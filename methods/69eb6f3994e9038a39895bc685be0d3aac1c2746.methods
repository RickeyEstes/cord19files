The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades (CCP06-03-09). All participating parents and case and control children older than 7 years of age were given oral and written information and provided written consent. This matched case-control study included cases and controls from a source population of children with acute viral infections and was conducted in 15 French pediatric respiratory clinical departments from September 2006 to June 2009. Acute viral infection was diagnosed by clinical symptoms by the provider. The following acute viral infections were as follows: herpes virus infection; varicella; gastroenteritis, defined as acute diarrhea, with at least 3 loose stools per day; nasopharyngitis, defined as runny nose, nasal congestion, and cough; bronchiolitis, defined as cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze at auscultation; flu-like syndrome, defined as cough with fever and myalgia; bronchitis, defined as cough and bronchial congestion; and viral pharyngitis documented by a negative test for rapid diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection. Acute viral infections were divided into 3 groups: upper respiratory tract viral infections, lower respiratory tract viral infections (LRTVIs) (bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and flu), and others. All acute viral infections were not severe and did not require hospitalization. Consecutive patients 3 months to 15 years of age who were hospitalized for empyema in 1 of the 15 participating centers were eligible. Empyema was defined as the presence of a pleural effusion on chest radiograph and at least 1 of the following results of tests on pleural fluid: pH < 7.2, lactate dehydrogenase >1000 IU/L, glucose <2.2 mmol/L, protein >3000 mg/dL, white blood cell count >50 000 cells/mL, 16 and/or a positive bacterial culture or Gram stain. To be a case, the empyema had to follow doctor-diagnosed acute viral infection based on clinical symptoms and identified within a maximum of 15 days preceding the date of the first pleural puncture. Controls were children 3 months to 15 years of age with acute viral infections from the same "source population" as case children, which was defined as children evaluated by the same private practitioner for acute viral infections. Controls were recruited as follows: upon case identification, the doctor who referred the child to the hospital was contacted to identify, among his/her patients, children matched for age (+/Ã€1 year) who consulted for same viral symptoms during the 15 preceding days with the similar time window as the matched case ( Figure 1 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Exclusion criteria for cases and controls were chronic respiratory disease, acquired and/or congenital immunological disorders, malignancy, collagen vascular disease, sickle cell disease, congenital heart defects, neuromuscular disease, hemophilia, and/or heart failure; treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents during the month preceding identification; and known intolerance of NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Exclusion criteria for cases were absence of at least 24 hours of apyrexia between recovering from LRTVI symptoms and a diagnosis of empyema and time between onset of acute viral infection and a diagnosis of empyema <72 hours (to decrease the possibility that symptom onset was possible onset of the bacterial infection). For each hospital case, after questioning the parents, a trained doctor or nurse completed a detailed and standardized form, recording symptoms, treatment concerning the period between onset of acute viral infection (first day of clinical symptom), and empyema diagnosis by pleural puncture, corresponding to the time of exposure. For the controls, the parents were contacted after the consultation with the treating physician and data recorded retrospectively exactly as done for the cases, with the same detailed and standardized form, recording clinical items concerning the same exposure window-timing from the acute viral infection onset as the matched case. Primary providers went at controls' home to obtain nasal swab specimen and record data ( Figure 1) . Symptoms, treatments (antibiotics, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen) according to the doctors' prescriptions, and self-administered medications were recorded daily. The following information also was recorded for all enrolled children: demographics, immunization status, and type of acute viral infection as stated by the doctors. In addition, a nasal swab was obtained for respiratory virus screening. For the cases, initial clinical findings, results of biochemistry and microbiology tests, radiograph findings, management, and length of stay were recorded. Two doctors reviewed the medical records of all identified patients and independently validated each case.
