Children between 0-16 years were recruited as part of the MAVRIC (Mechanisms of Acute Viral Respiratory Infection in Children) study on presentation to Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) for Children, Perth, Western Australia between January 2004 and January 2014. Cases and controls were recruited through all seasons, and a questionnaire was administered to all subjects to determine symptoms of any current illness, including coryzal symptoms, and risk factors, including birth history, postnatal and in utero cigarette smoke exposure, daycare attendance, atopy and allergy history, diagnoses of acute illness (children were excluded if they had any chronic illness other than asthma), recent antibiotic use, systemic steroids. Recurrence data was collected on cases included in the study from birth. Hospital presentation records were used to determine frequency of respiratory presentations both prior to and following presentation. Five patterns were determined described as "few", "persistent", "multiple A", "multiple B", and "atypical". (See supplemental methods for further definitions). Cases recruited had acute wheezing illness with no other co-morbid conditions besides asthma, eczema, or atopy. Controls with no pre-existing chronic disease including chronic respiratory illness were recruited from four sources: siblings and relatives of cases, PMH patients (presenting with minor injury/fractured limbs), volunteers from the local community or day care facilities. A proportion of controls had symptoms of mild acute respiratory infection but no wheeze. Blood, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and nasal samples (wash or blow) were collected from each participant. Several cases were followed up within 9 months of recruitment and viral, OP swab and blood samples were repeated at this time. This study was approved by the PMH for Children, Perth, Western Australia Human ethics committee (Reference: 1761EP). At least one parent or guardian provided informed written consent for children, prior to participation in the study.
