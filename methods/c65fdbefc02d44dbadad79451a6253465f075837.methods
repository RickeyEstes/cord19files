Data preparation. All genome sequences and complete coding sequences (CDSs) of spike genes were downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) on July 17, 2014. Sequences of spike genes were extracted from the 1044 coronavirus genomes and pooled with 1380 downloaded CDSs. Then, we removed replicate sequences and sequences that contained non-standard bases or were incapable of coding complete products. The length of each sequence is longer than 3,000 bases. Among all 777 valid nucleotide sequences that are listed in Supplementary Data S1, 730 sequences fall into six categories according to different hosts: 196 for humans, 182 for porcines, 77 for bovines, 74 for bats, 28 for murines and 173 for avians. The majority of the remaining 47 viruses were isolated from the two epidemic diseases caused by the coronavirus in the past 12 years. Although we only listed the hosts from which they were isolated, these viruses have been verified or suspected to have the ability to infect different hosts; thus, all 47 sequences were employed Scientific RepoRts | 5:17155 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17155 to explore interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Viruses from other mammals, including canines, felines, rabbits, equines, alpacas and whales, were excluded from the data set as the number of spike sequences for each host is insufficient for establishing a separate group. spike sequences were computed using our original Python scripts. Dinucleotide bias is the ratio of the observed value to the expected frequency of each of the 16 dinucleotides: where ρ XY is the dinucleotide bias, f XY is the frequency of dinucleotide XY, f X and f Y are the frequencies of nucleotide X and nucleotide Y 38 , respectively. In this study, we considered 19 factors, including three mononucleotide frequencies (G, C and T) and 16 dinucleotide biases. As none of the frequencies has a normal distribution, the nonparametric "Kruskal-Wallis Test" was employed to investigate the difference in each factor among six categories. As a result, significant differences across categories were detected for each factor; thus, all 19 factors were employed for modelling. Modelling, validation and prediction. As a classifier, the SVM can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using a kernel technique that is rooted in structural risk minimization. In this study, the R package e1071 (Version: 1.6-3) 20 was employed for the SVM analysis. "C-classification" was adopted as the model type and "Radial" was adopted as the SVM kernel in our analysis. The MD is a measure of the distance from a point to the centre of a distribution; the principle of this discriminant is that individuals belong to the closest group in the distance. The MD is defined as , where X denotes the population, x denotes the individual, μ is the mean value of the population, T denotes the matrix transpose, and ∑ denotes the covariance matrix of population 39 . The R program "distinguish.distance.R" 40 was employed in the MD analysis. Leave-one-out cross-validation was employed for both SVM and MD analyses. When the trained models are applied to a sequence for testing, each of the six categories of hosts will obtain a p value from SVM and a MD value. Based on p values and MD values, three steps will be taken to determine candidate hosts. First, the host of minimal p value or MD value is reasonably regarded as the preferable host. Then, two adjustable empirical thresholds can be used for each model to pick out other potential hosts. In this study, we adopted 0.05 and 0.01 for p value, 200 and 100 for MD value; i.e., likely hosts were determined if p < = 0.05 or MD < = 200, and very likely hosts were defined by p < = 0.01 or MD < = 100. The two steps are unsupervised prediction. In case that the isolate source is among the six host groups for modelling, a supervised prediction can be applied as the third step, i.e., all host species with p values or MD values no more than those of the observed host will be listed as potential hosts, which can be practical references for researchers to evaluate a virus's threats to human or other animals. Compare the tendencies of MD and SVM in predictions. Two groups of two-dimensional vectors were generated in silico as two populations. The number of vectors in the first population are randomly generated from the normal distribution N(1, 1), and the number of vectors in the second population are randomly generated from N(3.5, 0.5). As the first population has a larger standard deviation (SD), we refer to it as the "loose" population and refer to the second population as the "tight" population. The two groups of data are employed for the leave-one-out cross-validations of MD and SVM. All Python and R scripts employed in this study are available from the authors upon request. The prediction can be performed using the spike gene sequences of the coronaviruses on our web server, which is available to the public at no cost at http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/seq2hosts.
