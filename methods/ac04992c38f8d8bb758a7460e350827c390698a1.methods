Using laboratory records, we identified patients between birth and 21 years of age who had laboratory confirmation of RSV by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), or viral culture at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, WA, USA, between 2008 and 2013. For RSV quantitative viral load, the PCR threshold cycles of the nasal swab samples were compared to those of a standard curve generated by amplification of known numbers of RNA transcripts of the PCR amplicons. 11, 12 We included patients with hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplant (SOT), or hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who were outpatient at the time of diagnosis. Sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were abstracted from the electronic medical chart using a standardized form in Project REDCap. 13 An illness episode was defined as the presence of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, wheezing, increased work of breathing, rhinorrhea, and/or apnea) in a patient with RSV detected by laboratory testing. The end of the illness episode was defined as a minimum of 14 days following symptom resolution. Only the first RSV illness episode for each patient was included in this analysis. RSV-associated hospitalization was classified based on provider documentation of reason for hospitalization in the medical record. Potential healthcare-associated infection was defined as an RSV illness in a patient seen in clinic two to eight days prior to RSV detection ("potential clinic acquired") [18] . Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/ll. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 500 cells/ll. Viral or bacterial coinfections were determined by chart review of laboratory results obtained within 48 hours of diagnosis. Chest imaging obtained within seven days of diagnosis was included. Abnormal chest imaging was defined as a radiology result of consolidation, alveolar infiltrates, or airspace opacities. RSV-attributable mortality was defined as death due to RSV-associated respiratory failure. Data were analyzed using STATA 12Á1 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Fisher's exact tests were used for comparison of categorical variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum and ANOVA tests were used for comparison of continuous variables. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seattle Children's Hospital.
