Data for this study derived from a large cluster-randomised controlled trial involving Hajj pilgrims from Saudi Arabia and Australia that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of facemasks against viral respiratory infections during Hajj. The detailed methodology has already been published elsewhere [40] . The study was conducted over three consecutive Hajj years, from 2013 to 2015. The Hajj tour group leaders, who were responsible for catering Saudi or Australian pilgrims were approached and invited to take part in the study. In the consenting groups pilgrims were met by the research team members in their tents on the first day of Hajj in respective years (October 13th in 2013, October 2nd in 2014 and September 22nd in 2015) in Mina tent city, Greater Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Only data from domestic Hajj pilgrims, who performed Hajj from Saudi Arabia, regardless of their nationalities, were included in this analysis. All participating pilgrims who gave consent were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire on the first day of Hajj. The questionnaire included participants' demographic data such as gender, age, address and occupation; their medical histories including pre-existing medical conditions and pregnancy status; and their vaccination history including the receipt of influenza, and the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine if unvaccinated. Participants who were aged 65 years or above, and/or had preexisting medical conditions such as chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological, hepatic or renal disease, or those who were pregnant or immunocompromised were categorised as 'at increased risk' pilgrims (for whom annual influenza vaccination is recommended [11, 41] ). Otherwise healthy pilgrims and those younger than 65 years of age were categorised as 'not at increased risk'. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Ã’ 24, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of different variables on vaccine uptake. Only variables with a P value of 0.05 in univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model. A P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant for this report. Ethical approval for this study was obtained in Saudi Arabia from King Abdullah Medical City (KAMC), Institutional Review Board (IRB Ref. No.: ; and in Australia from the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (HNEHREC Reference No: 13/07/17/3.04).
