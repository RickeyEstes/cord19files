The study was divided into two periods: During the baseline period, we conducted active prospective surveillance of VAP, VAE, CLABSI and CAUTI using the CDC and NHSN definition and INICC methods. During the intervention period, we implemented a multidimensional approach for VAP, VAE, CLABSI and CAUTI in addition to performing active surveillance. This multidimensional approach included a bundle of infection control interventions including hand hygiene, active screening, contact precaution and environmental cleaning. The baseline rates of CR-HAI were compared to the rates obtained after intervention, and we analyzed the impact of our interventions by Z score. Results The two years of study period were divided to 4 epochs with six-month duration. 621 patients were admitted in the ICU with 6190 bed days. Central line utilization ratio was 65 percent.The rate of CLABSI was reduced from 21 to 7 per thousand catheter days (p < 0.007). The incidence of VAP plus VAE decreased from 26 to 11 per thousand mechanical ventilation days (p < 0.0128) while ventilator utilization ratio was 51 percent. The rate of CAUTI also decreased from 23 to 9 per thousand catheter days (p < 0.0126). Conclusions The implementation of this multidimensional approach for CR-HAI was associated with a significant reduction in the CLABSI, VAP plus VAE and CAUTI rates in the participating AICU. This study started since Sep, 2011 via a multidisciplinary team among Kaohsiung veterans General hospital, fire bureau and department of health, Kaohsiung city government. The unique accessory device for 12 lead electrocardiography apparatus has 10 holes, which are arranged according to a standard electrode placement for the 12 lead ECG measurements. The design of inter-nipple line and mid-sternum line on the device can assist the staffs to perform ECG shortly. This breakthrough innovation designed to address the core issue of the efficiency of the ambulance pre-hospital ECG system. Therefore, the invention successfully promoted Kaohsiung city council to set up Asian first ambulance prehospital telemetry electrocardiogram system. The innovative design of a ECG exam accessory device was patented in Taiwan and won golden award in Geneva and Korean international invention. The consecutative chest pain patients received ambulance ECG exam were enrolled from Jan. 2011 to September. 2015 in 18 different fire brigades at Kaohsiung city. The ECG implementation rate is defined as chest pain patients received ambulance ECG exam divided by all patients with chest pain. This was a retrospective study in a 16 bedded adult general medicosurgical ICU in a large acute hospital in England. The sample was collated from the ICU discharges in 2014 and 2015, identifying those patients who were readmitted within 48 hours of discharge. Specific times of discharge and readmission, underlying cause, length of readmission stay and final outcome data was collected. The results of 2014 and 2015 were compared. Our project consisted of a series of tools to raise awareness, educational interventions, daily prompts and practical measures to promote adherence. In addition we adopted a pressure-control, volumeguarantee mode of ventilation as the initial standard for all patients ventilated on our unit. Our critical care technologists offered ongoing practice education for members of the clinical team whilst a run-chart of week-by-week performance offered immediate feedback on the status of the project. This is a retrospective registry study includes a survey of critical care of registry data (all patients > 15 years) receiving care in two general Level I critical care units with similar rate of admissions during 2010-2014. Data of nurse/patient ratio is collected from each unit. The data is analyzed by descriptive and comparative statistical Method Elaboration of an ad hoc questionnaire after literature review and validated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. The construct of quality of service (QS) was measured by using three different constructs: quality of the communication (QS1), with two dimensions ("kindness and respect" and "sincerity and empathy"); quality of the information (QS2), with four dimensions ("welcome", "information about disease", "shared decission making" and "empathy with family needs"); technical and infraestructural quality (QS3), with six dimensions ("human aproach, "professionalism", "waiting room", "facilities", "visiting hours" and "meals"). The construct about the process of death was measured by using three dimensions ("technical quality", "human quality" and "quality of the information given". Finally, the construct about overall satisfaction with the service was measured with three dimensions about satisfaction with "form and content of the information", "technical and structural quality", and "process of death". 95 relatives of deceased patients participated with a post mail questionnaire (response rate: 38,9 %). After a month since the death, recruitment by telephone was carried out. Analysis of psychometric properties: convergent validity with correlation coefficient of Pearson, predictive validity with multiple regression models in order to predict the dimensions of satisfaction from the scales of quality, and reliability with α Cronbach and test of two halves. We conducted a retrospective study from a total of 476 patients admitted with in the ICU between January 2015 and December 2015. For the purpose of this study, and to obtain a profile of the microorganisms in our ICU, resistant microorganisms (RM) were defined as those with non-susceptibility to one (RM1) or more than one class of antibiotics (RM2).We also compared our results whit previous studies conducted in the ICU. Local Ethic Committee approved the study protocol. Critical ill patients admitted to ICU for sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were studied. Demographic data, severity indexes at admission and physiological variables were recorded. Blood samples for cytokines analysis were collected at days 1, 2 and 4 after admission. The cytokine analysis was performed with Bioplex technology and 27 cytokines were analysed. Statistical analysis: Multivariate projection technique was applied to analyse variation and collinearity within the cytokines dataset without a priori selecting potential relevant molecules. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify principal components (PC) which account for the majority of the variation within the dataset. This study used a dataset from a national registry containing data on patient and ICU level combined with a web-based survey on treatment policies. The relationship between in-hospital mortality and determinants was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions CAP is a disease with a high in-hospital mortality. We have shown that, after correction for confounding factors some treatment and organizational factors are related with outcome in patients with sCAP. The need for mechanical ventilation remained an independent risk factor for mortality, and liberal use of tracheostomies for the weaning process was also associated with higher mortality. The mean number of ICU admissions with sCAP per year was inversely correlated with hospital mortality. Many other parameters that are often claimed to be associated with better or worse outcome (like differences in antibiotic therapy) did not correlate with outcome. Background and objectives Severe asthmatic patient who requires the use of invasive mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit is, despite its low incidence, a potentially very serious case, which requires early and very specific respiratory care. This care will largely determine the average ICU stay, occurrence of secondary injuries or even death. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of severe asthmatic patient admitted to ICU and to analyze the initial treatment. Descriptive study of patients admitted to the ICU of the Clinical Hospital Virgin of Arrixaca in the period between January 2011 and September 2015. We analyzed different variables, age, sex, APACHE II, SAPS II, parameters of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and laboratory parameters. Results 18 patients (6 women) admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe asthma. The average age was 35.06. The average stay in the ICU was 14.39 ± 25.55 days, with 16.89 ± 6.67 APACHE II and SAPS II 33.72 ± 13.45 points. Eight patients needed non invasive mechanical ventilation (44.4 %) with a failure rate of 50 % (4 patients). The use of invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 10 patients, 3 of them needed tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation and sevoflurane Anaconda® device was used in 2 of them. Data respirator parameters were collected during the first 48 hours, highlighting VT (ml / kg) 6.46 ± 1.23, 2.25 ± 2.26 initial PEEP, Ppeak 37.0 ± 13.32 and 12.57 ± 4.68 AutoPEEP cm H2O. The average pH at admission was 7.21 ± 0.14 with a range of [6.99 to 7.40], PCO2 of 64.5 ± 24.22 mm Hg and a lactate concentration of 2.91 ± 2.11 mMol/L. All patients were administered inhaled beta-agonists (two patients salbutamol endovenous) and corticosteroids. 5 patients required magnesium sulfate, 11 patients required sedation; 6 of these patients required relaxation with atracurium or cisatracurium. One patient presented barotrauma while using noninvasive mechanical ventilation prior to endotracheal intubation. A retrospective, observational, cohort study of critically ill adult patients with influenza admitted to a Level 3 ICU Dublin, between Decemeber 2015 and March 2016. IntelliVue Clinical Information Portfolio (ICIP) was used to obtain data. The patients admitted to the adult ICUs of a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan, who met the criteria of intubated over 48 hours and prepared for extubation were collected retrospectively between January 2005 to December 2015. Patient's characteristics, disease severity, rapid shallow breath index (RSBI), maximal inspiratory pressure  We performed a post-hoc analysis of the SUP-ICU 7-day inception cohort study (1) conducted from Dec 2013 till April 2014 in 97 ICUs in 11 countries. From this cohort (n = 1034), we included adult general ICU patients with an ICU stay of ≥3 days. We assessed the use of life support day 1-3 in the ICU and the crude and adjusted association between its duration and 90-day mortality using logistic regression analysis. After exclusion of patients with Impaired left ventricular systolic function, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension due to causes other than COPD, and those who had any contraindication to exercise test, thirty stable COPD patients were divided into laser and control groups (15 pts each). Medical treatment was optimized in each group with the addition of LLL in the laser group. In addition to history and physical examination, MMRC scale, 6 MWT, echocardiography with measurements of RV dimensions, TAPSE, and lateral tricuspid annulus tissue Doppler velocities were assessed in each patient before and after LLL. The LLL was done using the following parameters: Wave length: 905 nm, Output 5-20 mw & Frequency 500 HZ. Laser probe was placed on intercostal space corresponding to the site of lesion both anteriorly and posteriorly on chest wall and arm with standardized laser acupuncture points of application with a frequency of 5 sessions/week for 2 successive weeks.  All patients under consideration for extubation by the AICU physicians, who underwent a PT assessment of extubation were included. This assessment was documented within the patient's electronic casenotes. Data was collected by retrospective casenote review during a 3 week period in August 2015. The project was registered as a service evaluation and therefore ethics requirements were waived. Demographics, details of the PT assessment ,and outcomes following extubation were collected (Table 72) . Extubation failure was defined as reintubation up to one week following extubation.  Patients with mild ARDS, according to the Berlin definition [3] , were categorized into 4 groups based on measurements obtained at presentation of ARDS or 24 hours after: PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 250 mm Hg and PEEP = 5 cm H2O (group I); PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 250 mm Hg and PEEP > 5 cm H2O (group II); PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mm Hg and PEEP = 5 cm H2O (group III); PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mm Hg and PEEP > 5 cm H2O (group IV). Patients no longer receiving mechanical ventilation after 24 hours were classified as 'extubated' (group 0). No patients died within 24 hours. The primary outcome was all-cause in hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were , ICU-and 90-day mortality and the number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28. Serum samples were analyzed in duplicates with Luminex Plate in a 1:2 dilution and per manufacturer´s directions. Analytes were IL-6, vWF-A2, IL-8, IL-10, RAGE, ICAM-1, and SP-D. We analyzed biomarker concentrations in specimens from the treatment versus placebo arms at baseline (before the study drug delivery) and day 2 (after at least one dose of the study drug). The observed concentrations that were above or below calibrated expected range were replaced with highest and lowest observed within the range concentration values, respectively. Subsequently, the values were log-transformed and differences between treatment arms were compared by type 3 folded F test. We conducted a prospective, population based observational study in 6 public hospitals. During a one month period from May to June 2015, we identified all patients admitted to any Singapore public hospital intensive care unit (ICU) who met ARDS criteria. Demographic information, clinical management data and ICU outcomes data were collected. Concurrently, a survey was conducted to determine ARDS management preferences of physicians at the study centres involved. We performed a prospective observational study in adult ICUs at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from October 2012 to May 2015. Patients were included if they met the Berlin definition of ARDS. Data collected included patients' demographic, severity of illness, management and clinical outcomes. All the studied patients were followed until discharged from the hospital. In this observational prospective study on ARDS patients, we performed LUS on the first day of prone position treatment at different time points: before (supine -S0), immediately after (P0) and 1 hour after (P1) initiation of prone position, immediately before (Pfin) and after returning the patient supine (Sfin). For the LUS protocol, we used a 2-4 MHz curvilinear transducer and we divided each hemithorax in 2 anterior, 2 lateral and 3 posterior zones. The worst LUS pattern detected in each zone was considered as characterizing the examined region. Off-line image review by two independent physicians, unaware of timing, position and patient's characteristics, was used to calculate a modified LUS aeration score, as previously described [2] . Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to correlate changes in LUS score (V-LUSS) with changes in compliance and PaO2/FiO2 (P/F). This was a retrospective study including adult patients with ARDS due to confirmed influenza A(H1N1) pneumonia needed mechanical ventilation in a medical center between July 2009 and May 2014 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We investigated the patients' characteristics, clinical presentation, severity of illness and outcomes. Eleven mechanically ventilated patients after elective cardiac surgery with moderated ARDS according to the Berlin criteria, but using a P/F ≤ 250 mmHg, received descending PEEP titration in steps of 2cmH 2 O from 23 to 5cmH 2 O performed in two randomly ways. One of them was performed with steps of 40 seconds (total time less than 7 minutes), and the other, in steps of 4 minutes (total time of 45 minutes). Each PEEP trials were preceded by standard (or maximal) alveolar recruitment manouver. PEEP trials were performed with PEEP titration tool available in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) device (ENLIGHT 1800, TIMPEL). This tool [1] provides a report with a functional map ventilation, demonstrating the amount of collapsed and hyperdistension tissue for each step of PEEP. The minor PEEP with less than 5 % of collapse was chosen as the optimal PEEP. This is part of a translational research, in the experimental setting, 3 pigs with establish lung injury received a descendent PEEP titration using EIT monitoring and dynamic Computed Tomography (CT). The CT was performed to evaluate the correlation of collapsed tissue amount in each step of PEEP between CT and EIT. Patients underwent a CT scan at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O end-expiration and a second CT scan at end-inspiration. Airway and esophageal pressure were recorded during tidal ventilation. Energy load per breath (Joule) was defined as the area between the inspiratory limb of the deltatranspulmonary pressure (x-axis)-volume curve and the volume axis (y). Tidal strain was defined as tidal volume (ml)/gas volume at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O (ml); lung inhomogeneities were computed as previoulsy described [2] . Intratidal collapse and decollapse was defined as the difference in not inflated tissue between end-inspiration and endexpiration expressed as fraction of total lung weight. (J) was significantly related to lung strain (Fig. 101, upper panel) and inhomogeneity (Fig. 101, lower panel) ; the relationship between delivered energy and intratidal collapsedecollapse did not reach statististical significance (r 2 = 0.10, p = 0.11). The patients, >50 years old, admitted to the medical and pulmonary intensive care units (ICU) in Gazi University Hospital were prospectively included. Patients without consent and stayed < 24 hours in the ICU were excluded. Frieds, Clinical and Edmonton frailty scores (FS) were calculated and CGA parameters were assessed by the geriatrician. The length and the result of weaning were recorded. The weaning was classified as simple, difficult and prolonged weaning. Prospectively collected data from 131 consecutive adult patients undergoing LT between January 2013 and December 2014 were evaluated. Indications, associated complications, time to initiation and duration of the maneuver were analyzed and the effects of PP on gas interchange were evaluated. Finally, outcomes in this cohort were compared against the rest of LT recipients. Continuous data are reported as median and interquartile range(IQR) and categorical data as numbers and percentages. Differences between categorical variables were assessed with the Chi-square test and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney test. The Student "t" test was used to evaluate the effects of PP on gas interchange. Conclusions PP was found to be a safe and successful therapy for refractory hypoxemia after LT and should be considered as an option in treating these patients. Background Iron is an essential element for both proper immune function and for the growth of most human pathogens. Alterations in iron status may affect the immune system and the risk of infections. No populationbased studies have investigated the association between markers of iron status and the risk of bloodstream infection (BSI). We studied 64033 participants with baseline measurements of SI, TIBC and TS in the second survey of the population-based HUNT Study in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway (HUNT2, 1995-97). SI, TIBC and TS were categorized as low (<2.5-percentile), high (>97.5 percentile) and quintiles of values between the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Incident BSIs through 2011 were identified though linkage to prospectively recorded information at the local and regional hospitals. For each measure of iron status, we assessed the risk of a first-time BSI and fatal BSI using Cox proportional hazards regression, with the middle quintile as the reference. The primary analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Additionally, we adjusted for self-reported comorbid conditions; lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, kidney failure, diabetes and body mass index at baseline. In a prospective population-based cohort study, 65236 participants of the HUNT2 Survey (1995-97) in Norway were followed up through 2011 by linkage to prospectively recorded information on BSI at the local and regional hospitals. Using Cox regression, we estimated ageand sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of a first-time BSI and fatal BSI (death within 30 days after BSI) by baseline body mass index (BMI) measurements and self-reported smoking habits, leisure time physical activity and alcohol intake. In additional analysis we also adjusted for education and lifestyle factors. Recent observational studies showed that obese critically-ill patients have an unexpectedly reduced risk of death, having low mortality rate in the course of septic shock, as well. This situation is described as "obesity paradox". Leptin, a hormone made by white adipose cells regulating energy balance by inhibiting hunger and which rises proportionally to body weight has also been shown to have a role in immune modulation. Therefore, leptin could play the pivot role in case of obesity paradox. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mortality and body mass index (BMI) in patients with septic shock. In addition, we tested association of leptin levels with BMI and mortality. Between September 2014 and January 2016, 52 patients with septic shock were included in the study. As a control group, 27 healthy people with BMI (kg/m 2 ) similar to patients' BMI values were included. Patients who had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, malignancy and who received corticosteroids chronically prior to ICU admission were excluded. Patients were categorized into five groups according to BMI (group 1 (n = 6) ≤18; group 2 (n = 14) 18.1-24.9; group 3 (n = 19) 25-29.9; group 4 (n = 10) 30-39.9; grup 5 (n = 3) ≥40 kg/m 2 ). We measured leptin levels at 9:00 a.m. after patient has been diagnosed with septic shock. Muscle mass and force were assessed on admission and at the end of the ICU stay in patients with an expected length of stay (LOS) of at least 5 days. Mass was measured from anthropometric variables (skinfolds of calf and arm) using the Lee formula (1) and bioelectric impedance (phase angle (PhA)) at 50 Hz. Force was measured using the Medical Research Council (MRC) score (2) and dynamometry (handgrip test). Effect of time over the ICU stay was assessed using a Student's t test. Correlations between mass and force, and between these variables and the APACHE II score, the duration of ICU stay and of mechanical ventilation were investigated. Prospective observational study in a surgical intensive care unit (10 beds) of a university hospital. Patients met the berlin criteria of severe ARDS after renal transplantation and needed invasive mechanically ventilation were included.12 consective hours of prone position ventilation and post-pylorus feeding tube placement were applied to all included patients Results In total, 8 patients were included, average 38 ± 10 years, 6 (75 %) were men. The 28-day mortality was 12.5 %(1/8). The ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen(Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2)on 1 h,6 h and 12 h after prone positon were improved significantly than before(P < 0.05). The time to reach target feeds was 73 ± 15 hours through Post-pyloric feeding, the rate of aspiration is 0, Nutritional status of all patiens was gradually improved. From September 2013 to February 2014, the data was acquired at the nine intensive care units in the four provincial academic medical centers retrospectively. Statistical analysis was conducted to confirm risk factors with using correlation analysis and logistic regression. Patients were identified from our ICU patient database (Ward-Watcher) and additional clinical details acquired from electronic databases. CT Images were exported as DICOM files from our PACS system. The cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles were measured using ImageJ software in duplicate by two independent users and the average values were used. Analysis used Excel (MS) and GraphPad (PRISM). Results 45 patients met inclusion criteria and of these, 21 patients had ≥ 2 CT scans in ICU, enabling serial estimation of L3 paraspinal muscle CSA (L3MCSA). The average age was 53 (16.6) years. The median APACHE II score was 17. Patients underwent a median of 2 interventional/surgical procedures. The mean ICU LOS was 48 (26.9) days and ICU mortality was 19.1 %. 95 % of patients had a decrease in their L3MCSA during their ICU stay. See Table 80 . The median % L3MCSA change / day was -0.56 %. Higher pancreatitis severity score (Glasgow score at admission to our ICU) was associated with greater loss of muscle (p = 0.03). Increased systemic inflammation (% of time with CRP > 200 mg/l) was associated with increased rate of loss of muscle (r = -0.45 and p = 0.03). L3MCSA was not demonstrated to relate to duration of ventilation or ICU mortality. Critically ill patients for whom PN was planned, and who did not have a contraindication to PN were included in the study. Patients already on PN or who did not give consent were excluded. Three different PN solutions were used: a soya oil containing solution [long chain fatty acids(LCT)], an olive oil containing solution, and a solution containing middle and long chain fatty acids(MCT/LCT). Nutritional support was planned to provide 25-30 kcal/kg/day. Age, sex, admission diagnosis, smoking status, APACHEII and SOFA scores, invasive procedures performed, FiO 2 levels, administered drugs, transfusion were recorded for 3 days(0, 24 and 48th hour). Lipid profiles(HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride), liver enzyme levels(AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, total/direct bilirubin), CRP, prealbumin values were recorded. As well, nosocomial infections that developed during admission, ICU and hospital length of stays and outcomes were recorded. Serum samples were collected before start of PN, at 24th and 48th hours of PN for PON-1, stPON1, ARE and total thiol levels and stored at -20°C. Biochemical studies were conducted after collection of all samples. PON1, stPON1 and ARE were measured spectrophotometrically. Plasma native thiol, total thiol and disulphide levels were measured as previously defined. Human primary myotubes were incubated with serum from consecutive ICU patients taken in the first 24 h of admission (n = 95) and healthy volunteers (n = 10) with a similar age range (40 -60 years old). Myotubes were cultured in 96-well plates, at 7 days of differentiation they were incubated with 10 % of human serum for 24 hours in the presence or absence of chloroquine (50 μM, 6 hr), an inhibitor of autophagy. p62 expression, a marker of autophagic vacuole accumulation, was measured by in-cell western, with an Odyssey scanner. The autophagic flux was calculated as followed: autophagic flux = p62 expression (+CQ) -p62 expression (-CQ). The results were normalized against cells number and expressed as a % of the autophagic flux in control condition. The screening on all serum samples have been repeated in 5 independent experiments. Results were analyzed by ANOVA with a Fisher post-hoc test. Gastric aspirate samples were sent to the laboratory for testing by pH meter. Nursing education was done to introduce the test and procedure. A pH ≤ 5.5 was considered confirmation of gastric placement. Data collected included aspirate pH, use of acid inhibiting drugs, calories from EN and ordered and delivered, time EN held before pH testing, tube insertion marking length, and aspirate appearance. Ongoing education and changes to nursing and nutrition practice were made as results were evaluated as part of our PDSA cycle. Statistical analysis included mean pH, stratified by acid inhibitor, mean calorie deficit from holding EN for the test, and the 90 th percentile laboratory turnaround time. We compared near-simultaneously performed CO measurements in severe sepsis patients using TPTD with the PiCCO (Pulse index Continuous Cardiac Output) system or TTE. Outcomes were compared using t-tests, linear regression Results Forty severe sepsis patients were studied. An analysis of 120 data pairs revealed that PiCCO yielded similar CO measurements to TTE (p > 0.05). PiCCO-derived CO measurements highly related to and TTE-derived CO measurements (R = 0.75, p < 0.05). Conclusions TTE can used for objective cardiovascular monitoring and to guide goal-directed fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis patients instead of PiCCO, and is noninvasive and convenient. In a subgroup of 226 patients from the 6S trial we analysed differences between the HES-and Ringer's groups in delta plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 from baseline to day 2 after randomisation using multiple linear regression analysis. Additionally, associations between the changes in cytokines and 90-day mortality were investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. We imputed values missing due to discharge or errors using multiple imputation. Our inclusion criteria was as follows; 1) septic patients of any sources of infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, soft tissue infections, upper and lower GI tract perforation, and bacteremia), 2) those admitted to our ICU, and 3) the daily BNP concentrations were measured during the ICU stay. We excluded patients who had been already on hemodialysis. We first described the time lag between the day of the peak BNP concentration and that of maximum daily fluid balance. We conducted multivariate regression analysis on this time lag with patient age, sources of infection, and maximum daily fluid balance as covariates. Prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted on 42 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, Patients meeting inclusion criteria was randomly assigned to receive either gelatin 4 % (21 pts) or saline 0.9 % (21 pts). Patients received 500 ml of either solution every 30 minutes till reaching the goals of initial resuscitation, using a Sidestream Dark Field device mean flow index was determined before and 6 hours after resuscitation. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and vasopressor therapy was recorded every 30 min during the first 6 h. Arterial blood samples were collected at three specific times: on randomization before fluid administration, 6 and 24 hours after initial resuscitation. Urea, creatinine, urine output and SOFA score was measured daily for the first 5 days after resuscitation. Thirty five successive patients with severe sepsis/septic shock in whom a CVC was inserted were the subject of this study. Simultaneous central venous and antecubital peripheral venous samples were withdrawn and tested for oxygen saturations. We compared 35 pairs of simultaneous ScvO2 and SpvO2 samples. Wistar rats were subjected to sepsis (iv. E. coli 2x10 9 CFU/mL, DL80 in 26 hours, n = 10) and microcirculation of sublingual regions and jejunum were captured by Sidestream Darkfield images (SDF). The total vessel density (TVD) was analyzed by software AVA-3.0 at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 consecutive hours post sepsis. The sham group was injected with saline only. (n = 5). In all periods of the study the animals were kept under general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation, receiving hydration (7 ml saline/kg/hr, iv). Fifteen landrace pigs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Catheters were inserted into carotid artery, pulmonary artery and portal vein for blood sampling, and for invasive pressures and cardiac output monitoring. A gas-tonometer was placed into jejunum for mucosal-CO 2 determination while a jejunostomy was prepared to visualize gutmucosal microcirculation. At each measurement time-point, arterial, mesenteric-venous and mixed-venous blood samples were obtained to blood gases analysis. Images of intestinal microcirculation were acquired using the Side-stream dark Field technique. These video-sequences were stored under a random number for ulterior blinded analysis. After baseline measurements (BL), fecal peritonitis was induced. When hypotension was not responsive to fluid resuscitation, norepinephrine was started and shock was declared (TS). Then, pigs were randomized to a fixed-dose of dobutamine at 5 μg/kg/min (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6). New measurements were performed 2 (T2H) and 6 hours (T6H) after. Three sham animals subjected to identical monitoring served as time-  We studied 18 anesthetized, mechanical ventilated and invasively monitored sheep, in which autologous feces were injected into the abdomen. Fluid administration was titrated to maintain initial pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Vasopressors were not used. Arterial, mixed venous (v), and right femoral venous (fv) blood samples were collected at baseline and every 4 hours to perform blood gas analysis and lactate (LACT) measurements. A microdialysis catheter was placed in the posterior leg muscle to measure the lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio every hour. We calculated the fCO 2 gap as PfvCO 2 -PaCO 2 , fLACT gap as fvLACT -art LACT, fO 2 con- Tables 83 and 84 , and all data before and after the development of hypotension are presented in Table 85 . ( † = only 12 animals; * = p < 0.05 vs T1). In this prospective study, we measured routine hemodynamics using indwelling arterial catheters and transthoracic echocardiograms in septic patients upon ICU admission. Hemodynamic variables included cardiac index (CI), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP). Ees was measured by echocardiography using a single-beat (EesSB) Method Ea was calculated as 0.9 systolic arterial pressure/stroke volume, and then the Ea/EesSB ratio was calculated (normal value < 1.36).The measure were repeated every day for a maximum of seven days. Prospective enrolment of pediatric patients who met the criteria of septic shock. Electric cardiometry (ICON) was used to measure time-domain HRV continuously in real time for 2 hours after admission to intensive care unit. Electric impedance cardiography was used to determine cardiac output. Hemodynamic parameters which discriminate survivors from non-survivors were evaluated. The study population consisted of 81 nurses who work in intensive care units in hospitals at tel aviv district. The subjects were asked to complete a structured questionnaire containing 69 items. Which examined the perception of nurses´patient safety climate in workplace, communication between employees, frequency of reported incidents, organizational and departmental policies and procedures and practices. Data were collected in April-May 2015. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital specialized in cardiac surgery and reference in Latin America. Patients older than 18 years old who had undergone heart transplantation between January 2011 and January 2015 were included. Patients with congenital heart disease were excluded. The Numeric Stress Scale, an established Likert scale ranging from "0" or "No Stress" to "10" or "Unbearable Stress" was used to collect self-assessed perceptions of stress ratings. A 10 minute massage was provided by certified massage therapists using portable massage chairs set up in a conference room. We conducted a retrospective analysis over two years (January 2013 -December 2015), of records of patients who were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU The mean capillary glycaemia was 5, 16 ± 1, 40 g/l. Twenty two patients (40 %) had pseud hyponatremia. Seven patients (13 %) presented hyperkaliemia at admission. The mean c-reactive protein level was 15,28 ± 23,81 mg/l. The mean level of bicarbonate value was 10,68 ± 5 mEq/l at admission. The mean overall osmolarity was 318 ± 16 mEq/l. 28 patients were infected (54 %). All patients had a close bedside monitoring of blood glucose, blood gas and blood electrolyte measurement according to our local protocol management which will be detailed in this work. The fluid replacement therapy was based on crystalloids. Three patients received alkalinization. Four patients presented a coronary syndrome. Five patients developed hyperchloremic acidosis. The overall mortality rate was 13.5 % (7 patients). The mean hospital stay in our ICU was 37,8 ± 22,7 hours. Factors associated with mortality were type 1 of diabetes (p = 0.004), SAPS 2 (p < 10 -6 ), shock ((p < 10 -6 ), and acute renal failure (ARF)(p < 10 -6 ) in univariate It was a prospective, observational study at the teaching department of emergency and intensive care in the regional hospital of Zaghouan, including patients with severe dyspnea over six months. All patients underwent physical examination, 12-lead ECG, RX Thorax, NT-ProBNP essay and echocardiography by an attending cardiologist on admission.  Consecutive patients from November 2014 to March 2015 were entered into a standardised ERAS programme incorporating twice daily physiotherapy for five days postoperatively with pre-specified mobility milestones. Of these, 17 were eligible and offered prehabilitation, incorporating twice-weekly cardiovascular and strengthening classes for 4 weeks, of which 13 attended. Outcomes measured were functional capacity by incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), anxiety and depression by HADS score, and perceived health status by EQ5D. We also compared data for those who attended prehabilitation to those who received ERAS only post operatively. Postoperative outcomes were time to mobilise 30 m, mobility level at critical care discharge by MMS and total hospital length of stay (LOS). Thirty eight patients were enrolled into the study. Continuous intravenous infusion of DEX was initiated at the rate of 0.8 μg/kg/h following by gradual increase or decrease to keep the level of sedation between 7 and 14 points in the Cook Scale. Blood samples for PK assessment (2.0 mL) were collected from the arterial catheter. The analysis was made for the concentrations obtained at two occasions: first from 0 to 24 hr after infusion initiation and second from 0 to 8 hr after infusion end. Data analysis was conducted using WINBUGS software With informative literature priors. We performed a retrospective observational study including all patients admitted to level 3 areas requiring CRRT for refractory metabolic acidosis at Harefield Hospital during 2015, i.e. pH less than 7.15 and base deficit less than or equal to -8 mmol/L. This population included patients admitted after cardiac and thoracic surgery, heart or lung transplantation, mechanical circulatory devices, out of hospital cardiac arrests (OOHCA) and medical admissions from the cardiology or cardio-thoracic surgical wards. Demographic variables were collected, along with the timing and duration of CRRT. Prospective, observational study from 2013 to 2015. We included all patients admitted in the ICU after a recovered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and all patients with an in-of-hospital cardiac arrest admitted in the hospital less than 48 hours and without previous administration of antibiotics. We took samples of tracheobronchial secretions through the endotracheal tube in all patients within the first three days of admission. Demographic information, comorbidities, performing of therapeutic hypothermia, empirical antibiotic therapy administered and the result of bronchial aspirates culture were collected. Empiric antibiotic therapy was considered adequate when at least one effective antibiotic was administered within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.
