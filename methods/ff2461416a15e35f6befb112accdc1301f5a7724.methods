Mixed-methods study design Contemporary GPs are very new to China, a large and diverse country with complex histories and traditions. As a new phenomenon, there are many 'unknown unknowns' and a dearth of reliable data about GPs that would allow us to conduct rigorous quantitative analysis. Our study employs a mixed-methods approach deemed most appropriate to examine the breadth and depth of understanding of GPs by PITs in Henan. 5 6 The participants of the study are the PITs in Henan Province. Henan is located in central China and represents the middle of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions in terms of economic development (figure 1). As the second most populous province in China, Henan is one of the key loci for the GP capacity building. For instance, the Tuition-waived Rural-oriented Undergraduate Medical Programme (TRUMP) students in Henan, a single province, account for around 10% of the whole country's TRUMP students. Two rounds of fieldwork were carried out in Henan (figure 2). The first round involved qualitative focus group discussions (FGD) with TRUMP medical students as well as the other PIT groups. However, for the purposes of this paper, we will include only the qualitative findings from the TRUMP group as they revealed similar themes with the other groups. Analysis of the qualitative findings informed the design of the quantitative questionnaires which was administered to each of the three PIT groups in the second round of fieldwork. The quantitative data were analysed together with the further exploration of the qualitative materials. This allowed us to examine whether the findings from the qualitative and quantitative studies converge, diverge or relate and help strengthen the reliability and validity of our findings. In sum, the qualitative and quantitative elements are triangulated to inform answers to our research question and enhance the robustness of our investigation. 7 8 Sampling For the qualitative study, we took a purposive sample of medical students in Henan in order to maximise variation. 9 10 The sampling continued until information saturation was achieved. In China, most medical schools provide training in western medicine, while some provide training in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Among all the medical schools in Henan participating in the TRUMP, there was only one TCM school-Henan University of Chinese Medicine (HUCM). To represent this proportion of medical students, HUCM was selected. For the remaining 'western medicine' schools, Xinxiang Medical University was the most active participant of the TRUMP, accommodating around half of the TRUMP students in Henan. Accordingly, it was chosen and identified as a key institution to investigate TRUMP. Within the selected schools, the senior medical students were the preferred participants given their years of experience within the programme. 11 The quantitative study was expanded to cover all three PIT groups because they are all relevant to the viability of GP in China. The entire first cohort of TRUMP students (enrolled in 2010 and due to graduate in 2015) in all the medical universities in Henan participating in the TRUMP were included. Similarly, all the GP Transfer Training (GP-TT) trainees in Henan from 2014 to 2015 were surveyed. Henan has 24 tertiary hospitals responsible for its Standardised Residency Training in General Practice (figure 3), which are the largest and best tertiary hospitals in Henan Province. Nine of them were randomly selected for the quantitative study (figure 3), and all the GP residents in these nine hospitals were surveyed.
