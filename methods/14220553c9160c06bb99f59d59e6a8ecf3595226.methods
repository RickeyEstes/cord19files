First, we highlight two pathways school closure can effect pathogen induced mortality. School closures, , can affect mortality via (1) reduction in cases and (2) a reduction in the healthcare labor force that treats sick patients and prevents mortality. While no pharmaceutical treatment is available, supportive measures are still important for patient survival. Define cumulative mortality as  where is the baseline mortality fraction for cases, / is the percent increase in the case mortality rate through the reduction in healthcare labor force from a school closure ( 0) , and / is the percent decrease in cumulative cases from the school closure. If there are no school closures, 0, then ⁄ 0. This implies mortality is . This model highlights the tradeoff between the case-reducing effect of school closures and the cost in terms of lost healthcare labor supply. Analyzing the net effect of school closures on mortality requires estimation of three factors that are not part of canonical epidemiological models. 8, 9 The first term is , which is the effect of school closure on the healthcare labor force and is between zero and one. The second term is , which is a first-order approximation of the life-saving (mortality-reducing) effect of healthcare providers on the probability of a patient dying from disease or disease-related complications. The third term is / , which is the reduction in cases associated with a school closure. The first term, , is rarely calculated. Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond provide a preliminary estimate for school closures in the US of a 6-19% reduction in the healthcare workforce. 1 To provide detailed estimates, we use data from the US Current Population Survey (CPS) to quantify the impact of school closures on healthcare labor supply, . The CPS is an ongoing monthly survey of approximately 60,000 US households jointly administered by the US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. We access the data via the Integrated Public Use Microdata. 10 We use the recent dataset, which includes information on just over 3 million individuals spread across 1.25 million households between January 2018-2020. The detailed data in the CPS allows us to characterize the family structure and likely withinhousehold childcare options for healthcare workers. It also enables us to describe the exposure to child care obligations for specific occupations within healthcare and across states. We calculate the share of healthcare provider households that are single parent, where a parent is defined to include head of household, opposite or same-sex spouse, partner or roommate, and an opposite or same-sex unmarried partner. We use the personal CPS sample weights for all calculations to ensure that the estimates are nationally representative. The second term, , is calculated in development contexts and in emergency medicine, but to our knowledge has not been measured for accute infectious diseases (e.g., influenza or COVID-19) or included explicitly in epidemiological models. It is useful to know the critical value of where school closure stops saving lives and starts increasing mortality, which is defined by the condition Imposing condition (2) as a strict equality and rearranging yields , when exceeds this value, then more lives are lost from school closures than saved. 1 is the maximum percent increase in the mortality rate that does not reverse lives saved from school closures. is a more inutive quantity, and it also provides a number that is invariant to . The epidemiological literature has focused on the final term, / . This value is usually determined by adjusting the conditional infectivity, either parametrically or through a behavioral model within an epidemiological model to account for a school closure. 11 Models are required because there is little unconfounded experience with school closures during an epidemic, and few analyses of any behavior All rights reserved.

We focus on the midpoint of this estimate, 0.15, but consider cumlative case reductions from school closures between 0 and 50%.
