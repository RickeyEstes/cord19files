Medical records of patients who presented to EHC (including Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown, or The Emory Clinic) from July 20, 2014 to January 28, 2015 and met CDC criteria for PUI [6] after travel to or residence in Ebola-affected countries in West Africa were retrospectively reviewed. The CDC PUI case definition includes epidemiologic and clinical criteria (Table 1) . To ensure complete case findings, the real-time log of cases maintained by the physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic was supplemented by querying infectious diseases and ED staff for all PUI evaluated during the study period. During this outbreak, routine screening of all patients to identify those meeting PUI criteria were implemented at all points of entry in the healthcare system, including the ED and outpatient clinics [14, 15] . Screening questions about recent travel and symptoms of illness were asked at the time of appointment scheduling (for outpatients) and arrival at all clinics, EDs, and hospitals. Examples of triage flowcharts used by the EHC Department of Emergency Medicine can be found on the EHC Ebola preparedness website [5] . Outpatients who met criteria for PUI were triaged by on-call infectious disease physicians to the tropical medicine clinic, ED, or ETU for further management [14, 16] , depending on the level of suspicion for EVD and symptoms. Whenever possible, PUI with low epidemiologic risk for EVD and without "wet" symptoms (such as active diarrhea, vomiting, or bleeding) were triaged to the tropical medicine clinic. Persons under investigation for EVD were triaged to the ED if they required evaluation outside of clinic hours, reported "wet" symptoms, or had any medical indication for ED-level care. Triage to the ETU was made on a case-by-case basis and reserved for patients for whom there were high levels of concern for EVD, based on epidemiologic risk factors and clinical symptoms. Persons under investigation referred to EHC by public health authorities (after identification through active monitoring and screening programs) were also triaged in a similar manner. For the outpatients evaluated at the tropical medicine clinic, a detailed protocol for receiving the patient in an isolated ambulance entrance, security-escorted transport to the clinic, and evaluation in the clinic was developed and described elsewhere [14] . When possible, physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic, ED, or ETU were notified in advance of a patient meeting PUI criteria. For patients arriving unexpectedly, screening protocols were integrated into the check-in procedures in the EDs and clinics to identify and isolate PUI [14, 16] . Patients screening positive in areas not designated to evaluate PUI were urgently evaluated by an on-call infectious disease staff to confirm their status and arrange transport to the tropical medicine clinic or ED if needed. All PUI were immediately isolated and managed by physicians in consultation with the hospital Infection Prevention department, infectious disease division, and public health agencies. After initial evaluation, decisions regarding patient disposition were individualized and made after discussion with public health authorities. Considerations included the presumptive or confirmed diagnosis, severity of illness, and feasibility of close monitoring and social distancing of patients in the community. Infection prevention precautions and personal protective equipment (PPE) were used as per CDC recommendations for PUI [17] ; however, whether or not to maintain enhanced levels of isolation for hospitalized PUI was determined on a case-by-case basis after discussions with Infection Prevention and public health authorities. In all cases in which EVD testing was performed, the PUI remained in isolation at the place of evaluation until the results were available and a disposition plan was made. Routine practice drills and continuous performance reviews were standard in all areas of evaluation. Non-Ebola diagnostic tests were performed at the discretion of the physician and usually included routine a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. For febrile patients, blood cultures, malaria rapid diagnostic testing (BinaxNOW; EVD, and other possible exposures, and are categorized into "High," "Some," and "Low (but not zero)" risk according to CDC criteria at the time of evaluation of these cases [6] . Alere, Orlando, FL), and blood smear examination for malaria parasites were routinely performed. Laboratory testing was performed in the routine clinical laboratory of EHC when suspicion of EVD was low (after consideration of presenting symptoms and epidemiologic risk level). However, for PUI with increased concern for EVD (including all patients where Ebola testing was indicated), testing was performed at a specialized isolation laboratory located in the ETU [18] until EVD was determined to be extremely unlikely based on a negative Ebola virus test and other epidemiologic and clinical features of the case. In these situations, some tests were limited because routine microbiologic cultures could not be performed in the ETU laboratory [18] . The decision to perform Ebola virus testing was made by the infectious diseases physician and public health authorities with consideration of clinical and epidemiologic risk factors for EVD. When Ebola testing was performed, a multiplex reversetranscriptase assay for multiple pathogens that included Ebola virus was performed (FilmArray Biothreat Panel; Biofire, Salt Lake City, UT), and a specimen was sent to the Georgia Department of Public Health for confirmatory testing in some cases. Patients who recovered from their illness were considered to be ruled out for EVD, even when Ebola testing was not performed. Data collected for this study included demographic information, purpose of travel, travel history, vaccination history, malaria prophylaxis use, presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory test results, and final diagnosis. Fever was defined as a temperature of ≥38°C before presentation (as reported by the patient or the health department) or upon presentation; OR having a subjective complaint of fever. The purpose of antecedent travel was categorized into 1 of 4 groups: Ebola outbreak response, business travel (ie, conducting business unrelated to Ebola response in affected countries), visiting friends and relatives in the Ebola-affected country (VFR), or immigration to the United States. Epidemiologic risk of EVD was determined based on CDC criteria [6] . The final diagnosis for each patient was considered confirmed if testing identified an etiologic cause of symptoms (eg, influenza A). A syndromic diagnosis was assigned for patients without a confirmed etiologic cause found on diagnostic testing. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the presence of fever and 1 of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, or other respiratory symptoms. An acute diarrhea syndrome was defined as an illness with reported prominent diarrheal symptoms, with onset within 3 days of presentation. Data were analyzed in aggregate with standard descriptive statistics using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). This study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board.
