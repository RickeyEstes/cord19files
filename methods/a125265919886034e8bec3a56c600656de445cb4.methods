The evidence-based approach used to develop IPC competencies and terminal objectives for health care workers comprised the following steps: review of literature, review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, identification of an expert panel to review and refine the competencies and terminal objectives, use of a Delphi survey process to vet the competencies, terminal objectives and comments of the expert panel, and delineation of competencies by occupation. This process is similar to that used in other competency identification projects, including that used to outline the public health worker competencies for emergency response by Gebbie and Merrill. 2
