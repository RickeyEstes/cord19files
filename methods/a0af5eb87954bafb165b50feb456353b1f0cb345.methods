Chang Gung Medical Group belongs to Chang Gung Foundation, a private non-profit foundation, and consists of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou (where the headquarter is located), Taipei, Keelung, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung, a nursing home, a health village for senior citizen, a university, and an institute of technology. It is a conglomerate-integrating service, education and research. There are 7,651 beds, 1,368 attending physicians, 1,258 residents, 307 interns, 5,269 nurses, and 7,063 other health workers and administrative personnel with a total of 15,261 employees among the franchise hospitals. Service includes primary to tertiary referral care. It covers approximately one-tenth of the medical service in Taiwan. In late March 2003 when SARS began to appear in Taiwan, the CEO of the Group (Chairman of the Steering Committee) issued a 4-level of alert to all hospitals. Guidelines were provided for each level of alert. Level 1 refers to the appearance of SARS patients in the community, but not yet having a SARS patient admitted to the hospital. Emphasis at this stage was focused on education and training of physicians, nurses, and all other personnel regarding the knowledge of SARS and its preventive measures. Health care workers were asked to wear a N-95 mask and to wash their hands, along with the use of gowns, gloves, protection eyeglasses, and face shields if necessary; patients with fever and upper respiratory tract infection were screened. Each person was asked to protect him/herself and measures were taken to avoid being infected and/or becoming an infection source; each unit chief was asked to educate and protect his/her subordinates, not to be infected, and not to become an infection source. These education courses were repeated and enthusiastically received in the three hospitals (Linkou, Taipei, and Keelung) located in northern Taiwan; however, people in the two southern hospitals appeared to be indifferent about SARS when checked retrospectively. Level 2 refers to the existence of SARS patients in the hospital but with no contact infection among health care workers. A Committee for ''War against SARS'' was set up in each hospital at this stage. The superintendent of the hospital headed the committee. The deputy superintendent was in charge of the daily operation of the five working subcommittees: medical, nursing, material supply, administrative, and research. The medical subcommittee held daily meetings dealing with the diagnosis, management, and report of SARS cases to the government health authority. It was also responsible for organizing physicians into working groups ready to take care of SARS patients when the infection became overwhelming. The nursing subcommittee was in charge of the nursing manpower. The subcommittee on material supply was in charge of all material supply necessary for prevention and care of SARS and also assured the quality of the materials. The administrative subcommittee assured the execution, inspection, and supervision of the overall operation. The research subcommittee was responsible for planning, funding, and supervising the research projects relating to the epidemiology, clinical aspects, laboratory diagnosis, immunology, and genomic aspects of SARS. Since SARS patients were likely to be screened in the emergency room, a negative pressure area was constructed in the emergency room in all hospitals in mid April. Each hospital was ordered to convert the top floor (or top two floors) into a negative pressure ward with individual negative pressure patient rooms. A designated floor with individual rooms in the intern, resident, and nurses dormitory was drawn out, ready for the quarantine of personnel exposed to SARS patients. Level 3 refers to the appearance of contact infection of medical personnel involved in the care of SARS patients but without secondary in-hospital infection. The area or floor where contact infection occurred was contained; patients were triaged into three groups for quarantine monitoring: febrile patients, contact patients, and a-febrile non-contact patients. Each patient stayed in an individual room with the same group of health workers caring for the same patient to avoid cross contact. The non-contact afebrile patients were allowed to be discharged and quarantined at home. The list of these patients was given to the health authority for surveillance. The febrile and the contact patients were discharged after the quarantine period if their condition was stable and thus, the floor was gradually evacuated and emptied. Only one single visitor at a time wearing a N-95 mask was allowed to visit a patient under quarantine. Entrance to the hospital was controlled, each person entering the hospital underwent the measurement of their body temperature; visitors were required to fill out a health card requesting personal data and medical history over the previous 10 days. Elective surgery was barred; admission was limited only to those with serious condition. Level 4 refers to the occurrence of secondary in-hospital infection. The operation procedure will be described in the result section.
