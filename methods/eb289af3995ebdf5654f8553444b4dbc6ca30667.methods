Highly pure (>98%) RTD-1 hydrochloride was produced by solid phase peptide synthesis as described 31, 32 . Caspofungin and fluconazole were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). RTD-1 was dissolved at 0.5 mg/ml in 0.01% acetic acid and antifungal drugs were prepared in sterile water. For animal injection, peptides and antifungals drugs were diluted in filter sterilized saline solution. In vitro antifungal assays. C. albicans strains were tested against RTD-1, fluconazole, and caspofungin in microdilution broth in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A2 with the exception that 25 mM MOPS was used in place of 165 mM MOPS, as described previously 39 . Overnight cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ -free PBS, pH 7.2, and suspended in test medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 25 mM MOPS, 2 mM L-glutamine) at 10 4 CFU/ml 62 . Incubations were conducted in flat bottom, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner bio-one, Monroe, NC) containing 0.2 ml test medium per well. Duplicate 0.1 ml aliquots of serial two-fold dilutions of peptides and antifungal drugs were dispensed into wells, each of which was inoculated with 0.1 ml of fungal cell suspension containing 1 × 10 3 CFU. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 hours after which A 600 was determined using a SpectraMax M5e plate reader. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest agent concentration that completely inhibited growth as determined by A 600 absorbance. Minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined by plating, on YPD plates, 10 µl from wells in MIC assay without cell growth and the first well with measurable turbidity as described [63] [64] [65] [66] and corresponding aliquots from the no-agent controls. Under MIC incubation conditions, no filamentation occurred allowing for accurate CFU counts after plating on YPD plates which were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. MFC is reported as the lowest concentration of peptide or antifungal drug that killed ≥99% of the input organisms. MICs and MFCs of RTD-1 were also performed in the presence of 50% mouse serum. Serum was prepared from blood collected by cardiac puncture from BALB/c mice. After coagulation at room temperature, serum was www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ collected by centrifugation (200 g for 10 min followed by 23,000 g for 15 min), and diluted with an equal volume of yeast inoculum in MIC test medium described above. Kinetics of RTD-1 candidacidal activity was determined at peptide concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 µg/ ml using a liquid suspension assay described previously 39 . Overnight cultures of C. albicans 53264 or 43001 were grown to mid-log phase in 5% yeast peptone dextrose broth (YPD) (Difco) at 30 °C. Approximately 2 × 10 6 CFU/ ml were incubated with 0, 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 µg/ml RTD-1 or 10 µg/ml caspofungin, suspended in 10 mM PIPES, pH 7.4, plus 5 mM glucose (PG), in 96-well plates with shaking at 60 RPM at 37 °C. At timed intervals, samples were diluted 1:1000 fold into PG buffer and aliquots plated onto YPD agar plates (TekNova), and surviving organisms quantified by colony counting after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C. Fungicidal activities of RTD-1 and caspofungin were similarly determined in whole blood. Citrate anticoagulated blood was obtained by cardiac puncture from CD-1 mice. Approximately 5 × 10 4 CFU/ml of C. albicans SC5314 or 53264 were incubated with 0, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 µg/ml RTD-1 or caspofungin in 96-well plates with Analysis of the effect of each agent on Candida biofilms was performed using an XTT colorimetric assay 67 . One Fig. 3a,b) . Saline-treated moribund mice (M) were euthanized between 5 and 10 d p.i. CFU/g (geometric means with 95% CI) were plotted for each treatment cohort and analyzed by Fisher's LSD test. (b) RTD-1 normalizes blood neutrophils and monocytes in long term survivors of systemic candidiasis. Blood PMNs and monocytes were quantified in naÏve mice, moribund saline treated mice, and RTD-1 treated long term survivors (n = 6 per cohort; mice from studies presented in Fig. 3a,b) . Effect of RTD-1 treatment was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. (c) Cytokines normalized by RTD-1 in candidemic long term survivors. In long term survivors, RTD-1 treatment restored pro-inflammatory biomarkers TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6 to levels equivalent to those of naÏve animals (n = 3-11 in each cohort). Effect of RTD-1 treatment was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Systemic candidiasis model. BALB/c female mice (7-8 weeks old) and CD-1 female mice (4-5 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and allocated randomly in groups of five mice per cage. Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle in thermostatically controlled rooms for the duration of the experiment. C. albicans inocula were prepared fresh each day from saturated cultures grown overnight in YPD medium, washed in sterile PBS, and fungi were counted with hemocytometer. Stock suspensions were prepared in sterile PBS. BALB/c mice were challenged with 2 × 10 6 CFU/ml wild-type C. albicans reference strain SC5314, while CD-1 mice were challenged with 1.8 × 10 7 CFU/ml (0.15-0.2 ml) C. albicans clinical isolate 53264 by i.v. injection into the lateral caudal tail vein using a 28 G 1/2 inch needle. Animals were treated by i.v., s.c., or i.p. routes immediately post-infection (p.i.) or 24 h p.i. with sterile saline (control), RTD-1, fluconazole, or caspofungin administered at the concentrations indicated in a 0.200 ml. Mice were weighted and monitored daily for general clinical condition. Mice were euthanized as approved by the USC IACUC and in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experiments were repeated at least three times. To assess systemic fungal clearance, renal fungal burden was determined. Mice were euthanized at times indicated, and both kidneys were weighed, homogenized in 5 ml of sterile PBS, and serial dilutions of homogenate were plated on YPD agar plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. CFU per gram of kidney was calculated.
