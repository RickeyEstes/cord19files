Case reports of Aspergillus meningitis, meningoencephalitis, arachnoiditis and ventriculitis as well as series of CNS aspergillosis were identified through a search of PubMed and Scopus databases of the English literature, and the reference lists were reviewed for additional cases. Research was conducted from the year 1973 through 2011. Used research terms included "Aspergillus meningitis", "cerebral aspergillosis", "central nervous system aspergillosis", "Aspergillus arachnoiditis", "mycotic meningitis". For the purpose of this review a case of meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by Aspergillus spp. was defined during life as follows: 1) a cerebrospinal culture positive for Aspergillus spp. together with a meningeal or encephalic syndrome; 2) the presence of galactomannan antigen or Aspergillus DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in the CSF, together with a meningeal syndrome. Post-mortem diagnoses of Aspergillus meningitis were included if the autopsy clearly indicated involvement of the meninges or a picture of meningitis with microscopic identification of Aspergillus hyphae or a positive Aspergillus culture. When inflammation involved the spinal leptomeninges the case was classified as spinal arachnoiditis. Patients were considered immunocompromised if the following conditions were met: 1) HIV/AIDS infection; 2) solid organ transplantation; 3) hematologic diseases with or without bone marrow transplantation; 4) autoimmune diseases treated with steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs; 5) diabetes mellitus; 6) any other condition treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs.
