Nested-PCR screening. Faeces suspended in RNAlater reagent (Ambion, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were subjected to DNA extraction using a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) or QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA). DNA from spleen tissues was prepared using DNAzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) or QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). For nested PCR screen targeting for NS1 gene of BuV, we followed the method of Sasaki et al. 9 . Complete genome sequencing. To determine the complete genome sequence of megabat BuV, a DNA library was prepared from the faecal-DNA samples using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illmina, San Diego, CA) and were sequenced on an illumina MiSeq instrument using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 600-cycle (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence reads homologous to known BuVs were identified by read mapping using CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). The overlapping large fragments were amplified by conventional PCR with specific primer sets designed from each identified sequence read. The 3′ end of virus genome was amplified by the modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends as reported previously 32 . All the amplified fragments were assembled manually into a contiguous sequence. Phylogenetic analyses. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT 33 using the FFT-NS-I method. Phylogenetic inferences were performed on multiple sequence alignments with MrBayes 3.2 34 using a General Time Reversible model with a rate variation between sites modelled with a gamma distribution (+ Γ ) with six categories and allowing for a percentage of invariable sites (+ I). Additionally, this study implemented a second analysis approach over the same sliding window that incorporated the power of Bayesian inference to support or reject hypotheses regarding the topology of the phylogenetic tree. For each window, a hypothesis of the clustering of two particular sequences was tested against the null hypothesis that the cluster was less likely than those sequences independently clustering with any other under the same model parameters. To maximize the inferential power of the approach, the marginal likelihoods of the models assuming opposite topological hypotheses were compared with the stepping stone 37 sampling approach implemented in MrBayes 3.2. Then, the difference of the calculated marginal likelihoods for both models, i.e., the model assuming a clustering and the model without the clustering, represented the Bayes factor, which usually is interpreted as supporting the first model if the difference exceeds three and strongly supportive when it exceeds five 38 . All hypotheses were tested under the same model assumed for the phylogenetic analyses.
