Three questions guided this literature review: What public health systems exist for communicating PHEPR messages from public health agencies to HCPs? Have these systems been evaluated and, if yes, what criteria were used to evaluate these systems? What have these evaluations discovered about characterizations of the most effective ways for public health agencies to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs? Table 1 lists the subject terms and keyword terms identified for key concepts for the search. To ensure retrieval of different types of PHEPR messages we included both health alerts (messages of the highest level of importance that warrant immediate action or attention) and health advisories (messages that provides key information for a specific incident or situation, such as a guideline change, and might not require immediate action). We also included as search terms any system, communication method or device that facilitated these communications. Public health literature is reported to be poorly indexed in bibliographic databases and dispersed across a wide variety of journals and other sources, as well as across many disciplines [16] . We included "grey" or non-peer-reviewed literature sources [17] to ensure wide coverage of less accessible materials such as government reports and conference proceedings ( Table 2) . The exact search terminology used was tailored for each database as appropriate to its structure and thesaurus to ensure a high degree of sensitivity ( Table 3) . The Web of Science Â® database was used to conduct cited reference searches of relevant articles. In addition, we hand-searched (known as snowball sampling) the reference lists of relevant articles and the tables of contents of the following journals: Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Disaster Medicine & Public Health Preparedness, and American Journal of Disaster Medicine. The review was limited to publications in the English language and to materials published between 01/2000 through 01/2011. All search strategies were recorded at each step. Citations from database searches were downloaded into the EndNote bibliographic reference program (http://www.endnote.com/) or manually entered as needed. Duplicates were removed. Figure 2 illustrates the identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion numbers, and rationale for excluded materials in our search and selection process [18] . Articles were included if they described systems or tools for public health agencies to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs or included an evaluation of these systems or tools. Data extracted from the articles included: purpose, location, organization or agency involved, HCP population, method(s) of communication, and type of evaluation performed, if conducted. If an evaluation was performed, the outcomes were extracted.
