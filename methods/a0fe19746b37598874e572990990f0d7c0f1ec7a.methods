We performed a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study on a convenience sample of febrile infants 60 days of age and younger who were evaluated for the presence of SBIs with at least a blood culture at 26 EDs in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) from December 2008 to May 2013. The methods for the parent study have been reported previously. 16, 17 The institutional review boards at all participating sites approved this study and eligible infants were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of participants. The methods pertinent to this secondary analysis are described herein.
