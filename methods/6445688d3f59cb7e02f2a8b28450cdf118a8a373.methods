We follow [29] to infer mixing matrices from the self-reported contact data. We group the study participants and their contacts by age into following age groups: 0-4, 5-9, 10-12, 13-14, 15-17, 18-19, 20-21, 22-24, then 5 year age bands from 25 to 74, with a single category for those aged 75 and over: the finer structure chosen to provide higher resolution for school and university ages. For each of those age groups, we find t ij : the total number of reported contacts over the course of 24 hours between participants in age group j and their reported contacts of estimated age group i. To find the mean number of contacts (m ij ) who are in age group i as reported by participants in age group j we divide t ij by n j -the total number of participants in age group j. This results 2 in the 'social contact matrix' M = (m ij ), where m ij = t ij /n j . This is the raw contact matrix as derived from our study data. We can deduce more from our reported contacts as the contacts are reciprocal (if person A was in contact with B, that means that the person B was also in contact with person A). On a population level that means that the total number of contacts from age group j to i, must be equal to the total number of contacts from age group i to age group j. As the sample of participants might have a different population structure than the wider population, this step depends on the country-specific population structure: we define w i as the total population size of the age group i. In our case, volunteers needed to be in the UK to participate in the study, so we use the 2018 mid-year estimate of the population structure of the UK (available from ONS [1] ). The reciprocal matrix C = (c ij ) gives the population contact matrix, where c ij = 1 2 (m ij + m ji wi wj ) [29] . The population matrix C is of particular importance for infectious disease dynamics because it is related to the next generation matrix [7, 27] . The next generation matrix N captures how the infection spreads when pathogen is first introduced in a population, and its (i, j) entry gives the expected number of new infections in compartment i produced by in infected individual introduced into compartment j. As a result, the dominant eigenvalue of N is equal to the basic reproduction number R 0 or the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single individual introduced to a completely susceptible population. The relationship between the two matrices is is the dominant eigenvalue of C (its spectral radius). Analogous to the eigenvector representing stage-specific contributions to overall population reproduction in demographic theory [3] , the dominant eigenvector here gives an indication of which age-groups most contribute to transmission in the population, assuming no age-specific differences in susceptibility or infectiousness (Fig 2) . We repeated these calculations stratified by type of contact (physical or conversational) and by context (home, work, school, other), resulting in 8 matrices each for the raw contact matrix shown in Fig S1 and population contact matrix in Fig 3. We further stratify these matrices by contacts made during the week ( Fig S2) and during the weekend ( Fig S3) . As participants filled out the contact survey at the end of the 24 hour period, we define the weekend based on the time they activated the app in the following way. To avoid weekend/week overlap, we consider participants who activated the app after 18:00 on Fridays and before noon on Sundays as those reporting their weekend contacts, and those who activated the app after 18:00 on Sundays and before noon on Fridays as those reporting contacts made during the week. This excludes 2,451 users with 24,983 contacts that report their contacts both during the week and the weekend. We also analysed the relationship between the density locations participants typically visited and their social contacts. We focused on a subset of the data with participants that had at least 10 recorded GPS locations (n=26,153). We used data from 2011 Lower Layer Super Output Areas for England and Wales, Small Areas for Northern Ireland, Data Zones for Scotland to estimate the population density per square km for each recorded GPS location in our dataset, with density layers matched to GPS location based on whichever had the nearest centroid. We then calculated the mean density across all GPS locations recorded for each participants. Finally, we compared reported household size with social contacts for participants that had at least one reported physical or conversational contact (n=40,575). To explore the relationship between household size, average density of GPS tracks and social contacts, we used a generalized additive model [30] . The model was defined as g(E(y)) = b + f (x) + a, where y was the binary outcome variable (i.e. reported contacts made), x was the predictor (i.e. household size or average density of GPS tracks on log 10 scale), g was the link function, b was the intercept, a was age (to adjust for possible confounding), and f was a smooth function represented by a penalized regression spline. Results for fitted GAMs are shown for a = 30.
