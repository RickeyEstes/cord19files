The study utilized a retrospective design to study a cohort of MERS patients reported in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study site is Riyadh, which is the capital city of Saudi Arabia, located in the center, and with a population of over 5 million. We chose to study cases reported from the Riyadh Region because this region has a more substantial number of cases than any other regions in the country. Also investigating one location may provide a more precise estimate of the climate factors where the cases are reported. The Ethics Committee at the Saudi Ministry of Health has granted approval to conduct the study, IRB log number:18-138E. The study has been exempted from patient and publication consent due its design. Data were obtained from Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All hospitals in Riyadh and other regions are required to report laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV cases to the Saudi Ministry of Health through this center. The study included all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. The study aggregated daily and weekly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and patients' data into monthly reports. Data on the climate situation throughout the study period, based on Google reports, were calculated using the monthly average of temperature • C, relative humidity (%), ultraviolet index, cloud, and wind speed in Riyadh (24.7136 • N, 46.6753 • E).
