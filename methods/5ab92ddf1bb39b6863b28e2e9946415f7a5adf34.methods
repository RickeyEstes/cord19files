T HIS SURVEY WAS undertaken by the committee for infection control for the emergency department (JAAM) and a joint working group. Some emergency departments in Japan have inpatient units. However, this study focused on the outpatient unit of emergency departments. A total of 517 hospitals certified as educational institutions for board-certified acute care physicians in Japan (JAAM-certified hospitals) received a written request between March and May 2015 to provide written evaluation of infection control in the emergency department. The questionnaire (Table S1 ) covered the following: (i) demographics of the hospitals, (ii) contents of infection control manuals for emergency departments, (iii) consulting systems between emergency departments and infection control departments, (iv) negative-pressure isolation rooms in emergency departments. The need for ethical approval was waived because the survey did not include clinical or personal data.
