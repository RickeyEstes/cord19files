The survey instrument was designed to provide facts about transmission, susceptibility and immunity, a clinical description of smallpox, and information about treatment and protective gear, followed by a questionnaire (Table 1 ). In August 2002, after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, survey packets were distributed to approximately 300 paramedics employed by Huron Valley Ambulance, which serves a population of approximately 1 million in Washtenaw and surrounding counties. Packets, including stamped self-addressed envelopes for return of questionnaires, were delivered to employee mailboxes. Responses were confidential and voluntary. If no vaccine was available and paramedics had no protective gear, 4 (4%) answered that they probably would remain on duty . no respondent definitely would remain on duty.
