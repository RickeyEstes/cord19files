Specificity ( 3.7. Sensitivity of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) for serum, whole blood, and pleural effusion The reactivity of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) with serum and whole blood samples from cats infected experimentally with FCoV and control uninfected SPF cats was investigated. Its reactivity with all specimens was similar to that with plasma samples (Fig. 6) . The reactivity of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) with exudate samples judged as anti-FCoV antibody-positive (n = 9) and -negative (n = 6) on ELISA was investigated, and the results of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) were the same as those of ELISA (Fig. 6) .
