No single accepted term describes the methods of measuring multimorbidity. In this review we use the term "index" to refer to any method of quantifying disease burden or predicting specific outcomes that includes more than a count of conditions. This could be by weighting conditions (for example, by allocating a score to each), adding other elements, or exa mining other variables such as drug or physiological parameters. search To capture all relevant publications we conducted a broad search. We included a variety of terms for multimorbidity derived from previous systematic reviews on this topic 3 4 and other literature discussing terminology in this area of research. 7 We developed the search strategy iteratively with the support of an Academic Support Librarian. The final search terms are listed in the appendix (appendix eTable 1) and include multimorbidity, comorbidity, polypathology, polymorbidity, pluripathology, multicondition, and multiple chronic conditions. The search was restricted to adults older than 18 years and to English language publications. eligibility criteria We planned to summarise reports of novel indices and were primarily interested in the original report of each index. Therefore we excluded papers that either used existing indices or measured multimorbidity using only disease counts. In the initial screening process we included only the original form of each scale and not adaptations or updates; these were found later. Records that were not original research papers, such as conference abstracts, letters, and systematic reviews, were excluded. We defined multimorbidity as multiple cooccurring conditions without reference to a specific disease, so excluded papers were those that focused on comorbidities of an index disease or on comorbidities within one disease area (such as the coexistence of several psychiatric conditions). As most people with multimorbidity are adults living in the community and managed in primary care, we excluded articles about children, animals, or people admitted to hospital or living in residential care. We included studies of hospital inpatients when the primary focus was follow up after discharge (for example, mortality one year later). As resources were limited, we excluded papers when full texts were not available in English. study selection Two authors used Covidence software independently to screen titles against exclusion criteria and the subsequent abstracts against the same criteria. 8 We then extracted the full texts of relevant abstracts for further screening. Any disagreements at the title, abstract, and full text stages were resolved by discussion, and a third author mediated unresolved conflicts. We excluded papers that referred to an existing index, but listed the indices that were used when excluding them at the abstract stage. We found the original papers describing these indices and returned them to the title screening stage. Additional relevant titles were found by reviewing previous systematic reviews on this topic, searching the bibliographies of included full text papers, and tracking their citations using Google Scholar. Emerging relevant titles were added to the screening process.
