These studies were phase Ib/II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated prophylactic nasal dosing of PrEP-001 in healthy adult subjects who were subsequently inoculated with HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). These two viral strains were selected as models since HRV-A16 is known to effectively elicit symptomatic colds and H3N2-IAV viruses are circulating in most flu seasons, so they represent frequently occurring strains that are suitable for use in healthy volunteers challenge studies. The HRV-A16 was obtained as a Wild-Type HRV-16 Challenge Virus from Retroscreen Virology Ltd and H3N2-IAV was obtained as a Wild-Type Influenza A/Perth/16/2009 Challenge Virus from Meridian Life Sciences. Both challenge viruses were manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and had undergone quality testing by the manufacturer regarding appearance, sterility, infectivity and contaminants according to pre-determined specifications. Before study initiation, independent ethics committee approval was obtained (Study 1 -NRES Committee London -City & East; Study 2 -North East -Newcastle & North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee) and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to their participation. Both studies were conducted at specialised quarantine units in the UK; Study 1 between July 2013 and September 2014, and Study 2 between September 2015 and March 2016. In Study 1, eligible subjects comprised healthy males or females aged 18-45 years (inclusive), with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 28 kg/m 2 (inclusive) and body weight ≥50 kg. Study inclusion criteria were similar in Study 2, although subjects up to 55 years were eligible to participate. All subjects were screened for the absence of antibodies to the relevant challenge virus. Subjects were excluded if they had any significant acute or chronic uncontrolled medical illness or had any condition, including a history of abnormal pulmonary function, associated with increased risk of complications of respiratory viral illness or that would make the subject unsuitable for a quarantine challenge study. All subjects were non-smokers and non-atopic. The use of any medication other than the study drug was prohibited, except for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and contraceptive therapy during the entire quarantine phase of the study. Both studies followed the same format: screening, prophylaxis/inoculation (within a quarantine environment), and follow-up. Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1, with randomization numbers generated by the sponsor and corresponding to blinded treatment kits that were assigned sequentially in ascending order. The assigned randomization number determined whether a subject was given either 2 doses of PrEP-001 or matching placebo, one dose at 48 h and one dose at 24 h prior to nasal inoculation with 10 TCID 50 of either HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). The 2-dose regimen was chosen based on results from an initial rhinovirus challenge study where a single dose was administered 24 h pre-inoculation (see Additional File 1 for study results, including Additional Fig. 1 and Additional Tables 1-3) . In both studies, each nasally administered dose of PrEP-001 was 6.4 mg (4 × 800 μg administrations per nostril using a dry powder applicator). Following inoculation (10 TCID 50 in 100 μl administered as two 25 μl instillations per nostril, alternating nostrils between instillations), subjects were observed specifically for potential allergic reactions within 30 min, and for the following 24 h; subjects were then monitored throughout the quarantine period. Subjects completed a modified Jackson questionnaire which assessed 10 symptoms on a 4 point scale, 3 times daily for 8 days. Daily nasal discharge was collected and regular nose and throat lavage samples were taken. Patients returned for follow up 28 days after the study. The approach in both studies was to assess total symptom score, duration of symptoms, mucus production, viral shedding, seroconversion, and the percentage of subjects with study-defined clinical illness over an 8-day quarantine period. Viral shedding was monitored in nasal lavage by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Mackay et al., 2002) . Safety was assessed throughout the study by the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes from baseline in routine clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).
