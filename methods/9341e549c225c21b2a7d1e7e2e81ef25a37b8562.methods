Each of the eight members of the organizing committee, convened and chaired by one of us (WAY), assumed responsibility for one of the specific topic areas (or tracks) identified for consideration (Table 1 ) by first recruiting other experts to assist in developing draft recommendations and facilitating the discussions at the stakeholder meeting. Each track developed a draft document that the organizing committee circulated in advance to meeting participants. These documents included a statement of the present situation and a vision for the future, and suggested recommendations or a framework for recommendations to make the transition to the desired state. While the background documents were used as the basis for initial discussions at the meeting, they were not necessarily adopted by the participants as part of the final recommendations. Participants included both the dissemination of clinical information systems and the interoperability among those systems in the definition of NHII, but these two concepts were not clearly differentiated. At the meeting itself, participants self-selected into one of the eight tracks and met for five one-hour breakout sessions consisting of facilitated discussions leading to development of final recommendations. In addition to the facilitators, each breakout session included several ''invited experts'' selected by the track chairs. Because of the large number of participants (more than 580), six of the eight tracks were divided arbitrarily into two separate groups that independently developed recommendations. Each breakout group presented its report at the final sessions of the NHII 03 meeting. The organization of the meeting followed a previously used model. 22 Subsequent to the meeting, each track chair developed a summary of the recommendations from that track in consultation with the facilitators. The authors reviewed all the recommendations and reassigned them to meaningful categories based on their contents. We then organized these final categories into a reasonably coherent set of programmatic recommendations designed to facilitate the development of the NHII.
