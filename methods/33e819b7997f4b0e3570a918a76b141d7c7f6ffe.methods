During the SARS outbreak period, our hospital closed all out-patient clinic (OPDs) from May 16 to June 2, 2003 . Although doctors tried to contact registered patients, interview them by telephone, and mail them their medications, many patients could not be reached due to outdated or incorrect contact information. After the SARS outbreak, the subjects of the study and their families were interviewed regarding their epileptic attacks before, during, and after the SARS outbreak, specifically recording the type and frequency of seizures, any withdrawal of medication, sleep habits and other factors associated with seizures. All of these epilepsy patients had undergone neurological examinations, monitoring of antiepileptic medications, electroencephalography (EEG), and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain. Classification of their seizures was based on their history and the above diagnostic tools according to the 1981 classification of epileptic seizures from the International League against Epilepsy. In our epileptic clinic, around 300 epileptic cases were regularly followed up in monthly basis. They were all recruited into the study. All seizures that occurred before, during, and after the SARS outbreak period were registered in the patient's medical history, seizure diary or both. With the help of such a diary, a patient keeps a personal annual registration of seizures. Unfortunately, 44 of the 271 patients did not keep seizure diaries regularly and could not be included in the analysis of seizure frequency. Although 10 self-report seizure free patients of these 44 cases stopped the drug in the SARS period, and 3 among them had seizure relapse in drug-withdrawal period. They were still excluded because of possible non-reliable seizure-free history. Nineteen new cases were also excluded because their history of seizures did not extend to 6 months prior to SARS outbreak. No cases of sudden death were reported during the SARS period. The definition of ''before SARS outbreak'' is the period before our hospital closed and when patients still had access to medication; ''during SARS outbreak'' is the period when the hospital was closed or until the patient resumed medication after drug withdrawal; ''after SARS outbreak'' is the period after the SARS outbreak when the patients began to visit the OPD and undergo follow up observation for 6 months. Seizure frequency ''before SARS period'' is the average numbers of seizures per month during the 6 months prior to the SARS outbreak; seizure frequency ''during SARS period'' is the number of seizures during the outbreak; seizure frequency ''after SARS period'' is the average number of seizures during the 6 months after the outbreak. The age range of the remaining 227 cases was 9-93 years, mean 37.3 AE 14.8 years. One hundred and fifteen were males; 53 had primary generalized seizures and 132 had secondarily generalized tonicclonic seizures; 31 had complex partial seizures and 11 had simple partial seizures. One hundred and one patients were on monotherapy; 93 were on two drugs, 28 were on three drugs, and 5 were on four drugs. To compare the risk factors for seizure recurrence, primary generalized seizure was classified as generalized. Simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures were classified as partial. Those using only one type of drug were classified as monotherapy; the others were classified as polytherapy. As for the etiologies, those with central nervous system (CNS) infection, tumor, stroke, vascular anomaly, traumatic hemorrhage, and developmental disorders were classified as symptomatic. No etiologies were found in the idiopathic group. According to drug withdrawal and number of seizure attacks during the SARS period, the patients were divided into the following four groups for comparison of the impact of SARS on seizure control: (1) ''continue drug/no attack'', (2) ''continue drug/ attack'', (3) ''stop drug/no attack'', and (4) ''stop drug/attack''. The seizure frequencies were analyzed by using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests for each group during the before-SARS outbreak in comparison to the SARS outbreak and during the SARS outbreak in comparison to the after SARS outbreak. Chi-square tests were used for comparing the differences between the ''stop drug/no attack'' and ''stop drug/attack'' groups regarding seizure etiology, seizure type, and number of different drugs. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for seizure recurrence, including age, sex, drug withdrawal, seizure etiology, seizure types, and number of different drug types used.
