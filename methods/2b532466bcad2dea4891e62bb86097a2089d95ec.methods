In April 2018, an outbreak of calf diarrhoea occurred on a bovine farm in Henan Province. According to the farm workers' descriptions, the morbidity of calves less than one month old was 100% (56/56), and the mortality was approximately 12.5% (7/56); the affected calves displayed muddy, watery, or bloody diarrheic stool and were anorexic and lethargic. The outbreak lasted for more than 10 days, despite routine treatment with antibiotics, including sulfonamides, penicillin, cephalosporin, and enrofloxacin, which were less efficient. Meanwhile, no clinical signs were observed in other bovine herd age groups, including young and adult cattle, during the outbreak. To diagnose the enteric pathogens, a total of eight faecal samples were collected from sick calves and used for RNA extraction and virus isolation. The faecal samples were also tested for Coccidium species and Cryptosporidium species using the sucrose floatation method. Faecal suspensions of each sample were prepared by diluting faeces 1:10 (w/v) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). These sample suspensions were mixed for 30 s and centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and maintained at − 80°C until further processing. Total RNA was extracted from 200 μL of the supernatants using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit Ver.5.0 (Cat# 9766, TaKaRa Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the RNA was maintained at − 80°C. Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Transcription Kit (Cat# 6210A, TaKaRa Bio Inc.) for firststrand synthesis. All samples were examined for BNoV, BCoV, BRV (A, B, C), BVDV, BKoV, BAstV, BNebV, and BToV, which can cause calf diarrhoea, and were detected by RT-PCR using specific primers (Table 2) as described previously. To confirm the accuracy of the results, all tests were performed three times. The positive samples were then filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and diluted with DMEM containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Then, Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK, ATCC) cells were incubated with the dilution to observe the cytopathic effect (CPE) daily. After five blind passages, the whole cell lysates were centrifuged and then analysed for BNoV. The complete genome of BNoV was amplified from eight overlapping fragments with specific primers and the 3'RACE method (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Briefly, eight pairs of primers were designed based on the conserved regions of available BNoV strains in the GenBank database. The PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T vector and sequenced (Sangon, China). We further designed special primers flanking the genome (3 race-F) and then acquired the 3'UTR region by semi-nested PCR according to the instructions of RACE kits (Cat# 18373-019, Invitrogen). The sequences were assembled with SeqMan and then aligned using MegAlign software (version 7.0; DNASTAR Inc., WI, USA). Pairwise sequence identity calculations were performed using Clustal W software within DNAStar 7.0 software (available at https://www.dnastar.com/). The phylogenetic tree was analysed using MEGA 7.0 software (available at http://www.megasoftware.net/) with the neighbour-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Meanwhile, recombination events among BNoV strains were further investigated using RDP4 software with seven different algorithms, RDP, Bootscan, MaxChi, GeneConv, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq [36] . To further characterize the VP1 sequences, an aa alignment was performed using all 29 complete BNoV VP1 sequences available in the GenBank database. The VP1 protein forms an icosahedral particle with two principal domains, a protruding (P) domain and shell (S) domain. The S domain resides between residues 48 and 218. The more variable, surface-exposed P domain is predicted to be located between residues 219 and 511, with the P1 domain mapped from 219 to 270 and from 397 to 511 and the P2 domain mapped from 271 to 396 of the capsid.
