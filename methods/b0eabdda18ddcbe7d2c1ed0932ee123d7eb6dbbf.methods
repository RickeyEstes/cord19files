Cell lines. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK-293T; originally referred to as 293/tsAJ609neo; DuBridge et al., 1987) were used for transfections and to determine the tropism range of the pseudotyped virus together with the NP2 human glioma cell line (Soda et al., 1999) , baby hamster kidney 21 cells clone 13 (BHK-21; originally obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection as ATCC CCL-10; Stoker & Macpherson, 1964) , human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (TE671; Stratton et al., 1989) and mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A; originally obtained from ATCC CCL-131). HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with Glutamax and 15 % fetal calf serum (FCS) at 10 % CO 2 ; all other cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10 % FCS and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin at 5 % CO 2 . Plasmids and pseudotype production. For transfection, 5610 6 HEK-293T cells were plated 24 h prior to addition of a complex comprising plasmid DNA and Fugene 6 that facilitated DNA transport into the cells (as described by the manufacturer; Roche). The HIV type 1 (HIV-1) gag-pol construct pCMV-D8.91 (Zufferey et al., 1997) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct pCSGW (pHR9SIN-cPPT-SGW, which incorporates the eGFP cassette driven by the U3 part of the spleen focus forming virus long-terminal repeat sequence; Demaison et al., 2002) or the firefly luciferase reporter construct pCSFLW (where the luciferase gene has been cloned into pCSGW in place of GFP; a kind gift from Dr B. Capecchi, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Siena, Italy), were transfected concurrently with the required envelope construct at a ratio of 1 : 1.5 : 1 mg, respectively. MLV gag-pol construct pCMVi (Towers et al., 2000) and GFP reporter construct pCNCG [a LNCX plasmid (CLONTECH) encoding enhanced GFP, with CMV driving expression of the RNA] or firefly luciferase reporter construct (Op De Beeck et al., 2004) were used at the same ratio as the HIV constructs. In each case, cells were washed 24 h post-transfection and incubated with fresh media. Supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h posttransfection and titrated on HEK-293T, NP2, BHK-21, TE671 and N2A cell lines. The remaining virus was stored at 280 uC. Fresh or frozen pseudotype aliquots were used for virus titrations and neutralization assays, respectively. Each round of freeze-thaw resulted in an average loss in virus titre of 5.7 % for CVS-11, 3 % for EBLV-1, 5.3 % for EBLV-2 and 2% for VSV pseudotype (see Supplementary  Fig. S1 , available with the online version of this paper). Viruses and envelope cloning. The RABV isolate used in this study was CVS-11 (ATCC VR-959). Its G-gene sequence was amplified using the RT-PCR Titan kit as described by the manufacturer (Roche), with primers that were designed based on the published sequence (GenBank accession number EU352767). EBLV-1 (isolate RV 9) and EBLV-2 (isolate RV 1787) G-gene sequences (GenBank accession numbers EU352768 and EU352769, respectively) were subcloned from existing transfer plasmids using specific PCR primer sets. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The PCRs introduced unique KpnI and XhoI restriction sites at the 59 and 39 ends of the genes. Once amplified, they were ligated into pI.18, a pUC-based plasmid incorporating the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (Cox et al., 2002) , and sequenced to ensure correct alignment. The VSV G-protein (Indiana serotype) expression vector pMD.G has been described previously (Naldini et al., 1996) and was used to create a control pseudotype virus. Western blot. CVS-11, DEnv (where only the plasmids containing gag-pol and reporter gene were transfected into cells), HIV and VSV pseudotyped viral particles were purified on a 25/40 % sucrose cushion to remove any G-protein not incorporated into the viral envelope before being separated by SDS-PAGE. Cell extracts for Western blots were prepared by resuspending 1610 6 HEK-293T cells (72 h post-transfection) in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (100 mM Tris/ HCl, pH 6.8; 20 %, v/v, glycerol; 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; 10 %, v/v, SDS; and 0.025 %, w/v, bromophenol blue). Proteins were transferred, using semi-dry equipment, to a PVDF transfer membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences) and blotted with SNB1, a primary mouse anti-RABV G-protein monoclonal antibody (1 : 500; a kind gift from Merial). Immunoblots for VSV G-protein were performed using an anti-VSV G-protein monoclonal antibody (clone P5D4; 1 : 10 000; Sigma). To determine protein loading/transfer, an identically loaded gel was stained with Coomassie blue and the nitrocellulose membrane was blotted with two anti-HIV-1 Gag p53/ p24 antibodies (EVA365 and EVA366 diluted 1 : 100; AIDS Reagents, NIBSC) or an anti-actin antibody able to detect all isoforms (diluted 1 : 750; Sigma). For all blots, an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1 : 5000; Amersham Biosciences) was then used prior to antibody binding detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Serum samples. Varied samples comprising sera from RABVvaccinated humans, dogs and cats and the OIE standard reference dog serum diluted to 0.5 IU ml 21 with Stabilzyme (Surmodics Inc.) were tested. Detailed descriptions of each serum are given in Supplementary Table S2 . To determine the stringency of the assay, a total of 60 serum samples were used; these were 48 dog (40/8, negative/positive; as initially determined by FAVN), nine cat (5/4) and three human (0/3) sera. An additional rabbit serum, raised against EBLV-2, was used for the cross-neutralization experiments. Sera were titrated using twofold serial dilutions to obtain the IC 100 . All experiments were undertaken at least in duplicate; if the titre varied by more than one doubling dilution it was repeated a third time and the geometric mean was recorded, in keeping with standard serological practice (Bresson et al., 2006) . Neutralization assays. Live virus experiments were undertaken using the FAVN as described previously using CVS-11 (Brookes et al., 2005; Cliquet et al., 1998) . Pseudotype TCID 50 values were calculated using the end point method (Condit, 2001) ; the CVS-11 pseudotype was serially diluted in multiple replicates which resulted in infection of all replicates at low dilutions, no infection at high dilutions and infection in some but not all inoculations at intermediate dilutions. The dilution of virus that resulted in infection of 50 % of replicates could then be calculated. In a 96-well plate, 906TCID 50 CVS-11 pseudotyped virus that resulted in an output of 8610 5 relative light units (RLU) was incubated with doubling dilutions of sera for 1 h at 37 % (5 % CO 2 ) before the addition of 1610 4 BHK-21 cells. These were incubated for a further 48 h, after which 125 ml medium was removed and 75 ml Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) was added. Luciferase activity was detected 2.5 min later by reading the plates on a Glomax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega). End-point titres (which are equivalent to IC 100 values) were chosen, as used in FAVN tests. Our initial experiments using GFP reporter proteins were analysed by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD). For all results, background RLU (virus alone or DEnv) or GFP (cells alone) was deducted before analysis. Cross-neutralization experiments were performed as above with the following mean pseudotype input (RLU): CVS-11, 5.4610 5 ; EBLV-1, 4.5610 5 ; EBLV-2, 4.2610 5 .
