We obtained the number of 2019-nCoV cases time series data in mainland China released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China and National Health Commission of China from January 10 to January 24, 2020 from [6] . All cases were laboratory confirmed following the case definition by national health commission of China [7] . Although the date of submission of this study is January 26, we choose to use data up to January 24. Please note that the data of the most recent few days contain a number of infections that were infected outside Wuhan due to travel, and thus this part of infections is excluded from the analysis. Although there were cases confirmed on or before January 16, the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [8] . To adjust the impact of this event, we considered a time-varying reporting rate that follows a linear increasing trend, motivated by the previous study [9] . We assumed that the reporting rate, r(t), started increasing since January 17, and stopped at the maximal level at January 21. The time window of the reporting rate increase accounts for the official report on improving the 2019-nCoV surveillance released by the Chinese government by the end of January 21 [10], which also coincides with the average of the incubation periods of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, i.e., the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), i.e., 5 days [11] [12] [13] . Denoting the daily reported number of new cases by c(t) for the t-th day, then the adjusted cumulative number of cases, . Instead of finding the exact value of r(t), we calculated the fold change in r(t) that is defined by the ratio of r on January 10 over that on January 24 minus 1. We illustrated six scenarios with 0-(no change), 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-and 8-fold increase in reporting rate, see Following previous studies [14, 15] , we modelled the epidemic curve obeying the exponential growth. The nonlinear least square (NLS) framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. The intrinsic growth rate (γ) of the exponential growth was estimated, and the basic reproduction number could be obtained by R0 = 1/M(−γ) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at this early stage. The function M(•) is the Laplace transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the disease [14, 16] , denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remains unclear, we adopted the SI information from SARS and MERS, which share the similar pathogen as 2019-nCoV. We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 7.6 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.4 days for MERS [17] , and mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days for SARS [18] as well as their average, see the row heads in Table 1 for each scenario.
