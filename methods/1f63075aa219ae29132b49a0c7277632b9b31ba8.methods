We included adult (age >18 years) ED patients presenting with severe sepsis/septic shock (sepsis with elevated lactate (>4 mmol/l)) or hypotension) from the prospective clinical ProCESS trial. We studied a subset of patients with microcirculatory videos obtained along with non-infected control patients. Using a sidestream dark-fi eld videomicroscope, we obtained image sequences from the sublingual mucosa and used video stabilization and frame averaging techniques to visualize slowly-moving leukocytes. We quantifi ed the number of rolling and adhered leukocytes present per 1 mm × 1 mm visual fi eld in a standardized 3-second clip. Furthermore, we extracted the total length of vessels candidate for counting of rolling/adhered leukocytes (vessels with an adequate focus). We report sample means with standard deviation and compare them with Student's t test. Results We included a total of 64 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and 32 non-infected controls. The mean number of adhered leukocytes per fi eld in the sepsis group was 2.1 (SD 2.3) compared with 0.4 (SD 0.8) in the non-infected group (P <0.001). This corresponded to a mean number of adhered leukocytes per unit vessel length of 0.16/mm (SD 0.22) and 0.03/mm (SD 0.06) for sepsis and non-infected groups, respectively (P <0.001). For the rolling leukocytes, we observed a mean number of 27.8 (SD 19.4) in the sepsis group and 12.0 (SD 8.7) in the non-infected group (P <0.001) per fi eld. This corresponded to a mean number of rolling leukocytes per unit vessel length of 2.00/mm (SD 1.67) and 0.75/mm (SD 0.55), respectively (P <0.001). Conclusion Our results show a higher number of rolling and adhered leukocytes in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock when compared with non-infected controls. This also applies when taking the total vessel length in the fi eld of view into consideration. This may hold potential as a useful tool in sepsis assessment. Introduction Platelets are now considered to be immune and infl ammatory agents as well as key cells in coagulation, and as such have been implicated in the pathophysiology of sepsis [1] . Thrombocytopenia is associated with sepsis severity and poor prognosis, and hyperactivated platelets probably contribute to microvascular thrombosis and organ failure. In the present study, we evaluated platelet activation markers as potential predictive markers of sepsis and of mortality among four commonly encountered populations of patients admitted to ICUs. Methods Ninety-nine non-infected ICU patients were prospectively screened at day 1 (T1) and day 3 (T2) of admission after elective cardiac surgery, trauma, acute neurologic dysfunction or prolonged ventilation (>48 hours). A third sample was drawn when infection was diagnosed (Tx). We evaluated platelet activation by measuring the expression of P-selectin (CD62P) and fi brinogen binding on the cell surface before and after stimulation with major platelet agonists (ADP, collagen, and TRAP) through fl ow cytometry. Clinical scores were obtained at admission. Results Patients who developed sepsis (n = 18) presented with signifi cantly higher platelet fi brinogen binding at T1 compared with patients who did not get infected (basal: P = 0.0014, upon stimulation: P <0.0035). At T1, ROC AUC for association of basal fi brinogen binding with the occurrence of sepsis was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.89). Elevated basal CD62P expression level was associated with increased 90-day mortality (P = 0.042, ROC AUC = 0.78 (0.64 to 0.88)). Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrated that mortality was signifi cantly higher after stratifi cation based on T1 basal CD62P level (cutoff MFI >31.56, HR = 13.6, P = 8.23 × 10 -6 ). Multivariate logistic regression analysis using clinical scores (SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II, SAPS III) indicated that addition of CD62P level or of bound fi brinogen level signifi cantly improved prediction of mortality (odds ratio 1.078, P = 0.003) and sepsis (odds ratio 1.033, P = 0.0012), respectively. Conclusion Predisposition to severe infection in selected critically ill medico-surgical adults can be identifi ed on day 1 of admission based on circulating basally activated platelets. Levels of activated platelets may add incremental prognostic information to clinical scoring. Reference Introduction C1 inhibitor (C1INH), belonging to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors, regulates not only complement system, but also the plasma kallikrein-kinin system, fi brinolytic system and coagulation system. The biologic activities of C1INH can be divided into the regulation of vascular permeability and anti-infl ammatory functions. In recent years, hereditary angioedema (HAE), caused by an inherited defi ciency of C1INH, has been focused. During HAE attacks, vascular permeability was markedly increased, which leads to angioedema. In sepsis, signifi cant endothelial hyperpermeability is similarly observed systemically, but the role of C1INH has not been clarifi ed in the pathogenesis. The serial change of C1INH in patients with sepsis is not clear. The objective of this study was to clarify the serial change in C1INH in patients with sepsis and evaluate the impact of C1INH on their clinical course. Methods We serially examined C1INH activity values (normal range 70 to 130%) and quantitative values (normal range 160 to 330 μg/ml) in patients with sepsis during the period between December 2012 and February 2013. We also analyzed their clinical course: prognosis, volume of infusion, body weight, urine volume, catecholamine administration, and steroid administration. Results The serial change of C1INH was evaluated in fi ve patients with sepsis (three male and two female; four survivors and one nonsurvivor; mean age, 68 ± 11 years). In the nonsurvivor, C1INH activity on admission value was 97.2% (normal range), and quantitative value was 133.1 μg/ml (below normal). In the patient with severe sepsis requiring fl uid resuscitation, catecholamine and steroid administration to maintain hemodynamics, C1INH activity value on admission was 94.4% (normal range), and quantitative value was 126.7 μg/ml (below normal range). His general condition was improved on day 6, and C1INH activity value and quantitative value increased (139.9%; above normal range, 250.1 μg/ml; normal range). In the other three patients with sepsis not requiring steroid administration, C1INH activity value on admission was 130.6 ± 8.7% (above normal range), and quantitative value was 215 ± 26.5 μg/ml (normal range). Conclusion In the nonsurvivor or the severe patient with sepsis requiring steroid administration, the enhancement of C1INH activity was not observed, and the C1INH quantitative values were low. Further evaluation of the serial change of C1INH and the validity of C1INH replacement therapy in patients with septic shock may lead to a new strategy for management in sepsis. Methods The data of a 35-bed medical ICU were analyzed from November 2012 to October 2014. The source of culture positivity was divided into three groups: patients admitted from the ER to the ICU who were referred from other hospitals or direct admissions, the second group was patients admitted within the hospital but outside the ICU for the fi rst 48 hours, and the third group was ICU-acquired infections. We also analyzed the data for type of infections, whether Gram-negative, Gram-positive or fungal. Results There were 1,051 cultures positive in a 2-year period. In total, 46.8% (n = 492) of cultures were already positive on admission, which denotes community-acquired and referred patients from other hospitals. A total of 31.1% (n = 327) of cultures were positive from patients admitted to general wards for more than 48 hours and then transferred to the ICU. Twenty-two percent (n = 232) of cultures were ICU-acquired infections. The data show community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections are the bulk of the culture load in an ICU. This could be attributed to increased surveillance and adherence to infection control practices in the ICU which may not be followed stringently in other parts of the hospital. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics in community and primary care hospitals has resulted in a spurt in growth of resistant infections. This has reached an alarming level in developing countries. Out of total cultures positive 78.3% (n = 822) were Gram-negative infections which included community-based and non-ICU infections. Conclusion Antibiotic stewardship and strict adherence to infection control protocols in hospitals and guidelines for general practitioners can signifi cantly reduce the load of resistant organisms in the ICU. This may eventually improve patient outcomes and help in preserving the antibiotics for future generations. Introduction Early microbiological documentation may reduce attributable mortality and excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and endotracheal aspirates (ETA), we studied a new molecular biology-based approach to detect and quantify bacteria in less than 3 hours. This prospective multicenter trial aimed at comparing the microbiological results obtained using this molecular protocol (easyMAG® system) and semiquantitative culture in suspected VAP. Methods ETA and BAL samples were consecutively collected during 10 months in adult patients in four ICUs of France. The molecular method includes a preprocessing liquefaction for ETA before DNA extraction. DNAs were extracted using the easyMAG® system. Realtime PCR (qPCR) was run using the ABI7500FastDx PCR instrument. The results presented here concern: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Quantifi cation was performed using qPCR standard curves, by converting the cycle threshold to CFU/ ml. Results A total of 125 suspected VAP were included from 122 patients. In total, 125 BAL and 107 ETA were collected. Sex ratio (M/F) was 76%, and CPIS ≥6 was calculated in 74.6% of the suspected VAP patients. Mean ventilation duration before sampling was 6 days. Seventy-eight percent and 65% of the BAL and ETA culture were positive respectively. Correlations between molecular method and culture on BAL and ETA are reported in Table 1 . Conclusion Sensitivity and specifi city of the new molecular approach for these main bacteria found in VAP could enable targeted fi rst-line antibiotic therapy. In the future, the development of this approach will aim at obtaining a bedside diagnostic in only a few hours. Introduction Micafungin (MCF) is an echinocandin agent with broad activity against Candida spp., which are frequently isolated in blood and eschar cultures of burned patients, who present diff erent pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics. Due to the limited information about its PK, we investigate MCF levels in plasma and burn eschar tissues in this population. Methods A PK study of MCF at standard dosage (100 mg/day). Cmax (end of the infusion) and Cmin (before next dose) plasma levels of MCF were obtained after fi rst dose and at steady state (days 4 and 5 of therapy); and on day 5 in eschars (1 to 3 hours after infusion). They were measured by HPLC. Spearman's rho test was used for bivariate correlations between MCF exposure and patient's clinical factors. Results There were 10 patients (eight men; age: 18 to 77 years). Patients' characteristics and PK are shown in Table 1 . A high interindividual variability was observed in the concentrations of MCF. Peak plasma concentrations after the fi rst and repeated doses of MCF were inversely correlated with % burned TBSA (Spearman's ρ = -0.695 and -0.750 (P <0.05), respectively), but not with the time from burn injury. MCF concentrations in burn eschars were not correlated with % burned TBSA. MCF was well tolerated. One patient had candidemia. The crude mortality was 40%. Conclusion This is the largest PK study of 100 mg daily of MCF in severely burned critically ill patients. The inverse correlation between MCF exposure and % burned TBSA suggests that patients with large burned TBSA may need higher doses of MCF. Nevertheless, MCF levels in plasma and burn eschar tissues after the fi rst and multiple doses were above the MIC90 against most clinically important Candida species. for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, common in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. There are limited data on tedizolid disposition in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). This study's purpose was to assess continuous hemofi ltration (CHF) and continuous hemodialysis (CHD) infl uence on tedizolid clearance. Methods Validated, bovine blood-based, in vitro CHF and CHD models were used with six new HF 1400 (polysulfone) and six new Multifl ow 150 (AN 69) hemodiafi lters. Tedizolid's transmembrane clearances (CLTM) during CHF and CHD were assessed by measuring sieving (SC) and saturation (SA) coeffi cients at various ultrafi ltrate (Quf ) (1, 2, 3 l/ hour) and dialysate fl ow rates (Qd) (1, 2, 3 and 6 l/hour), using a blood fl ow rate (Qb) of 200 ml/minute. Tedizolid adsorption was tested in a 1 l recirculating CHF model at Quf of 2 l/hour and Qb of 200 ml/minute over 4 hours. Adsorption (%) was calculated after correcting for the dilution by CHF priming volume. Urea was added as a control in all experiments. Results Urea SC and SA were ~1 in all experiments. In CHF, mean tedizolid SC ranged from 0.52 to 0.57 for HF1400 and from 0.50 to 0.54 for M150. CLTM did not diff er between fi lter types for Quf of 1, 2, and 3 l/hour. In CHD, mean tedizolid SA ranged from 0.46 to 0.56 for HF1400 and from 0.38 to 0.44 for M 150. Tedizolid CLTM with the HF1400 was higher than M150 values at Qd of 6 l/hours (P <0.02). Tedizolid exhibited irreversible adsorption within 10 minutes. See Figure 1 . Conclusion Tedizolid's CLTM is dependent on hemodiafi lter type and Qd for CHD and Quf in CHF. At conventional CRRT rates, tedizolid CLTM appears modest relative to total body clearance and is unlikely to require dose adjustments. CRRT adsorption in the clinical setting is likely less than what we observed in this in vitro, continuously recirculating blood model. We performed a retrospective observational study on patients admitted to the ICU for refractory CS from January 2010 to November 2014. Patients with postcardiotomy and/or post-transplant CS were excluded. Demographics, clinical, hemodynamic and biochemical values were collected. LAC was measured on arterial blood before ECMO institution (LAC0) and after 48 hours (LAC48). Lactate clearance was calculated as follows: (LAC0 -LAC48) / LAC0 × 100. Data were analyzed by comparative statistic; sensibility and specifi city were tested with ROC. Results Twenty-three patients underwent VA ECMO for refractory CS in the study period. Etiologies of CS were: 11 acute myocarditis, fi ve acute myocardial infarction and seven acute decompensation of chronic cardiomyopathy. The median time of ECMO was 10 days (4 to 15). Thirteen patients died during hospital stay and 10 survived. Three patients were bridged to LVAD and two to heart transplant; eight were bridged to recovery. The main cause of ICU death was multiple organ dysfunction (12/13). Nonsurvivors showed signifi cantly higher LAC0 (5 (2 to 6) vs. 8 (5 to 11), P = 0.021). Lactate clearance at 48 hours was not signifi cantly diff erent between survivors and nonsurvivors (79%, 95% CI = 67 to 86 vs. 60%, 95% CI = 32 to 72, P = 0.08). However, LAC48 was predictive for ICU mortality (AUC 0.82; 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.0; P = 0.011). ROC curve analysis identifi ed the accuracy was highest by setting the lactate <2 mmol/l. Patients that did not normalize lactate (LAC <2 mmol/l) after 48 hours despite hemodynamic restoration had poorer outcome at 30 days, as is shown in the Kaplan-Meier curve (logrank P = 0.006) ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion Failing to normalize patient's LAC in the fi rst 48 hours of VA ECMO assistance for CS is a predictor of ICU mortality. Targeting LAC level <2 mmol/l at 48 hours post ECMO institution might be a reasonable goal for these patients. We reviewed the use of levosimendan at Harefi eld from January 2013 through December 2013. Patient demographics, logistic EuroSCORE ( Figure 1 ), diagnosis, surgical or intervention details, inotropic support, dosage and duration of levosimendan use, length of stay in the ICU, cost (Table 1 ) and patient outcome were collected. Results Levosimendan was used in 30 patients, 23 (77%) male and seven (23%) female. Median age was 69 (59 to 72.8). Levosimendan was used post cardiac surgery, post angioplasty and in patients with ventricular assist devices (VAD) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). Most of the patients received a standard regimen of 12.5 mg administered at a dose of 0.1 μg/kg/minute for 24 hours. Concurrent noradrenaline was used in most of the patients ranging from 0.02 to 0.2 μg/kg/minute. The median length of stay in the ICU was nine (6 to 14.5) days for survivors and 23.5 (7.5 to 36) days in nonsurvivors. Sixteen patients (55%) survived and were discharged from the hospital. Introduction Levosimendan is an inotropic seldom used in emergency departments (EDs). It has shown improved mortality in patients with shock [1] with few adverse eff ects [2] . This work denotes the experience of levosimendan use in the ED of Hospital Universitario Mayor between 2012 and 2014. Methods We present a retrospective study which analyzes the eff ect, after 24 hours, of levosimendan administration on perfusion parameters of 166 ED patients. Patients had to have shock diagnosis of any cause. Diff erences between the initial and fi nal mean value of the following parameters were evaluated: lactate, central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) and venoarterial diff erence of CO 2 (DvaCO 2 ). Data were stratifi ed according to levosimendan categories (initial or rescue). In addition, association between diff erent variables with mortality was sought. Diff erences were considered statistically signifi cant at probability levels below 0.05. Results There were no diff erences in APACHE II values between patients who received levosimendan as initial therapy from those who received it as a rescue measure. A total of 41 patients fulfi lled lactate normalization requirements (lactate <2.0 or clearance >50%) ( Table 1) . Forty-four patients reached normal values of SvcO 2 and 37 patients of DavCO 2 after levosimendan initiation. There were no associations between the normalization of lactate, SvO 2 and DvaCO 2 and diff erent types of shock. Twenty-nine patients who received initial therapy with levosimendan normalized their lactate values and 12 who received it as a rescue therapy (P <0.05). Sixty-three patients developed hypotension, and none had adverse eff ects requiring discontinuation of the drug. Hospital mortality was 47.7%. Variables associated with mortality in the study group were lactate value at admission (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.7), the use of vasopressin after start levosimendan (OR = 7.5, 95% CI = 1.9 to 28.6) and the use of norepinephrine before starting (OR = 10.8, 95% CI = 1.9 to 60.7).  Nonetheless, the external jugular vein (EJV) circumference and area have not been evaluated. Considering the role of EJV visual assessment in the clinical estimation of CVP, we hypothesized that EJV ultrasound evaluation could be used to reliably estimate CVP. Methods Patients with a CVC placed as part of clinical management were evaluated. EJV and internal jugular vein (IJV) measurements were performed at the left cricoid level. IJV and EJV were visualized in short axis view; diameters, circumferences and areas were obtained at end expiration with simultaneous CVP measurement. Measures were performed by a single trained operator, who was blind to CVP values. Results Forty-eight patients were included. A poor correlation was found between CVP and IJV and EJV circumference and area in mechanically ventilated patients. A strong correlation was found between CVP and EJV circumference (r: 0.74; P = 0.0004; 95% CI: 0.421 to 0.897) and area (r: 0.702; P = 0.0012; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.88) in spontaneously breathing patients. Conventional receiver-operating characteristic curves were generated to assess the utility of EJV circumference and area to predict low (≤8 mmHg) versus high (>8 mmHg) CVP values. AUC for EJV circumference and area was 0.935 (P <0.0001; 95% CI: 0.714 to 0.997) and 0.87 (P <0.0001; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.98) respectively ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion These results highlight a potentially evolving role of EJV circumference and area in the hemodynamic management Critical Care 2015, Volume 19 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/19/S1 S59 of spontaneously breathing patients. An important aspect of the suggested approach is its simplicity, requiring basic technical skills and making it suitable in any scenario where an ultrasound machine is available. The HELP-ECMO pilot study is enrolling patients admitted to a large metropolitan ICU who require ECMO. Education on eligibility criteria and study processes was given to all ICU senior medical staff . Consent must be performed prior to the commencement of anticoagulation, often only a short time after ECMO cannulation. To facilitate recruitment at all hours, a HELP-ECMO study box is located in the ICU. Within the box is an instruction page outlining the screening, consent and randomisation process, as well as administrative tasks. Plain language statements, randomisation envelopes and consent documentation stickers are provided. A consent script is provided to ensure consistency across consenting personnel. The process is reviewed by the research coordinator the following day to confi rm local governance compliance. Results From April to December 2014, 30 patients were screened. Fourteen met the eligibility criteria and were approached for consent. Twelve patients were enrolled and randomised to receive either standard anticoagulation or low-dose heparin as per the study protocol. Consent was provided by the person responsible for 10 patients. One patient was competent to consent for themselves and one was enrolled under legislation allowing enrolment into research in the absence of a person responsible. There were two refusals. Seventyone per cent of participants were approached out of hours. Eighty-six per cent were consented by clinicians. Twenty-one per cent of patients were consented by a non-investigator. Conclusion The model of consent described has proven to be successful in this challenging patient population. The ability of all staff to perform consent for the study has been a signifi cant factor in the success of the pilot. The review of study processes by research coordinators has supported this model. Conclusion VA-ECMO is an eff ective treatment tool for refractory CS in patients with acute life-threatening heart failure. Patients aff ected by acute decompensation of CCM had poorer outcomes characterized by multiple organ dysfunction, as already known in the literature. We performed a 1-day retrospective review in June of blood request forms submitted to the cross-match laboratory, followed by a 14-day prospective review in September 2014. Group and save requests were excluded. Each form was audited against the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) minimum standards for content of a blood request form. Analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test for nominal data and t test for continuous data. Results A total of 1,163 blood requests were reviewed, 51 from CDH and 1,112 from other wards. Eighteen forms from CDH (35%) and 22 from other wards (2%) met all minimum AABB standards (P <0.0001). The mean number of standards met on the requests from CDH and the rest were 11.25 (SD 0.93) and 8.87 (SD 1.75) respectively (P <0.0001). Considering all blood requests, the standards met in order from least to most were: signature of requesting doctor (36%), urgency of request (43%), hospital number (59%), indication for transfusion (62%), type of product requested (72%), requesting doctor's name (78%), age or date of birth of patient (84%), gender of patient (89%), quantity of products requested (90%), date form was completed (90%), patient's ward (95%), and patient's full name (100%). Conclusion The audit revealed an important system failure impacting on effi cacy and safety of transfusion practice at UTH. Full patient identifi ers, as well as vital information such as the indication and urgency, were rarely fi lled in, which are crucial for the blood bank to prioritise the release of blood products. The audit shows that practice may be signifi cantly improved by a cheap intervention such as a standardised blood request form meeting international standards. Introduction In Zambia, supply of blood is insuffi cient to meet clinical need, on a national level. Paradoxically, blood is also more often transfused unnecessarily in this setting. The Zambian National Blood Transfusion Service is currently scaling up voluntary blood donation and supply systems, and requires hospitals to improve blood transfusion safety. At a rural district hospital in Zambia, we audited practice and surveyed knowledge amongst staff using standards established in national guidelines. Methods A retrospective audit over 2 months of all blood transfusion forms at St Francis Hospital, Eastern Province, Zambia. Respective patients' notes were reviewed for: record of observations during transfusion; patient demographics; and length of stay. We surveyed nurses' attitudes, confi dence and knowledge in relation to blood transfusion standards. Results In May and June 2014, 457 requests were made for blood, of which 157 (34%) received blood transfusion, of which 108 (69%) had records of observations available. The audit demonstrated that requests were mostly complete (90%), but urgency was indicated in only 32%. The matching of blood to patient by more than one nurse was recorded amongst 66% of cases. Only 2% of transfusions met minimal requirements for transfusion reaction monitoring. Of nurses surveyed (n = 20), most were experienced in their post (mean 7.3 years, range 2 weeks to 20 years). Nurses rated themselves as highly confi dent in handling blood transfusions and identifying and dealing with transfusion reactions. However, 90% believed they could identify all transfusion reactions by measuring temperature alone, and 25% would measure temperature only as a parameter to monitor the transfusion, even in ideal settings. Most knew to check observations before, 15 minutes after the start of transfusion and then hourly thereafter (88%); but only 10% would check at the start, at completion and 4 hours after completing transfusion. The most frequently reported reason for not doing observations was time pressure on the ward (85%).
