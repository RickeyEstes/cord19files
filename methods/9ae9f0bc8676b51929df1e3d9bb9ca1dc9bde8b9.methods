Through a search of the St. Louis Children's Hospital/ Washington University School of Medicine Pediatric Lung Transplantation database, we identified 6 infants with atypical presentations of ACDMPV admitted over an 18-year period (1998-2016) who underwent bilateral lung transplantation. We obtained informed consent from parents of all infants and children and this study was approved by the Human Research Protection Office at Washington University. We reviewed clinical history, results from echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, and chest computed tomography (CT), explant histology, and post-transplant course. We used Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in FOXF1 as described previously. 17 We analyzed genomic copy number variants (CNVs) using array comparative genomic hybridization with custom-designed 16q24.1 region-specific 3_720 K microarrays (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin). 17 A pediatric pathologist with expertise in childhood ILD and the diagnostic features of ACDMPV reviewed all explants. At least 2 sections from each lobe of the explant were reviewed for each subject (median number of sections per explant, 22; range, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Explant histology was compared with autopsy histology from 3 infants with classic ACDMPV and genetic defects of FOXF1 (2 with missense point mutations and 1 with a CNV deletion upstream of FOXF1). ACDMPV histologic criteria were characterized for each explant. 15, 18 Microscopic observations of alveolar capillaries were made on fields of congested, noncollapsed lung, in which architecture and capillaries were well-visualized. Findings of deficient capillarization of alveoli were described as "diffuse" (present throughout all fields, with difficulty in identifying normal capillarization in most fields), "mixed" (mixture of both normal and deficient capillarization throughout lung), and "focal" (predominantly normal, with focal areas of deficient capillarization). Findings of pulmonary vein malposition adjacent to small arteries were described as "extensive" (readily identified throughout the lung, with malposition in the majority of BVBs), "patchy" (identified throughout the lung, but in fewer than onehalf of BVBs), and "focal" (present, but in a minority of BVBs and not readily identified). Assessment of malposition of pulmonary veins did not include BVBs with tangential orientation in which a vein could not be excluded. Findings of medial hypertrophy of small arteries and arterioles were graded "mild," "moderate," or "severe," ranging from mild medial thickening to occlusive lesions. Lobular maldevelopment with deficient alveolarization was noted based on the presence of enlarged alveoli with apparent decrease in numbers of alveoli and was described as "present," "suggestive" (areas suggestive of deficient alveolarization), or "not suggestive." Lymphangiectasis was characterized as primarily involving the interlobular septae or involving both the interlobular septae and the BVBs.
