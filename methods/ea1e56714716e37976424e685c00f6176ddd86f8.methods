Fifty-four undergraduates participated in this study in exchange for partial course credit and a chance to win some ''real'' money. Participants in all four conditions started with an initial endowment of $4 and expected to play three lotteries of $1 each. This standardization of the initial endowment in all conditions was the chief design difference between Experiments 1 and 2. All other procedures were similar to that of Experiment 1. Thus, half the subjects were told that winning would result in additions to their account, while losing would have no effect, and the other half were told that winning would maintain their wealth state while losing would result in a deduction. Participants completed the task in approximately 15 min. They were then debriefed and thanked. For their participation, they received partial course credit and $6 each. That is, all of them received as much as, or more than, the amount they had earned through playing the lotteries. 8 The stimulus comprised three components. 10 In the first component, respondents read a short (1-page) caselet in which they were asked to adopt the persona of the decision maker, the head of a business unit that makes cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The decision maker makes an investment in order to ward off a threat from a competitor. There is a 50% chance that the outcome of the investment will be positive and a 50% chance that it will be negative. For participants in the gains domain, gaining a million dollars was the positive outcome and not gaining anything was the negative outcome. For participants in the losses domain, avoiding the loss of a million dollars was the positive outcome and losing a million dollars was the negative outcome. After they had read the case, subjects turned the page and read that a 50% likelihood of success was akin to a coin toss. So, whether or not their investment decision would pay off would be determined by a coin toss. Half the subjects were in the ''Heads'' condition and the other half were in the ''Tails'' condition. The experimenter then tossed a fair coin and, depending on the outcome, respondents noted whether they had won or lost. They then responded to several measures including how much money they had won or lost. In the second component of the stimulus, the subjects read a scenario regarding a wager on an NCAA basketball tournament pool. An elaborate description about the manner in which the pool was conducted revealed a 50% chance that a specific team would win (i.e., positive outcome) or lose (i.e., negative outcome). In the gains domain, the positive outcome was a net gain of $10, and the negative outcome was not winning anything. In the losses domain, the positive outcome was avoiding the loss of $10, and the negative outcome was losing $10. Again, subjects were informed that the outcome of the basketball game was akin to a coin toss, so a fair coin would be tossed to determine the outcome. Subjects were playing for either a ''Heads'' or ''Tails'' outcome, and following the coin toss by the experimenter, they noted whether they had won or lost. They then responded to several measures including how much money they had won or lost. In the final component of the stimulus, subjects responded to a variant of the Asian Disease problem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) . They were told that they had to respond to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had requested the pharmaceuticals division of their business unit to provide a drug to combat an outbreak of a rare disease. Scientific estimates suggested that Drug A would save 200 people for sure, while Drug B would save all 600 people with one-third probability but there was a two-third probability that none of them will be saved. 11 Therefore, choosing Drug A was the risk-free option that offered partial success whereas Drug B was the risky option that offered either complete failure or complete success. Subjects then indicated which one of the two drugs they would prefer on a 9 point-scale (1 = prefer Drug A, 9 = prefer Drug B) as well as on a binary choice measure.
