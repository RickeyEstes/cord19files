We used the medical records of Buraidah Central Hospital (BCH) in the Al-Qassim region and adopted a retrospective cohort design for this study. BCH is the main centre in the region for the treatment of MERS-CoV infections; patients are referred here from neighbouring secondary hospitals (e.g., King Saud Hospital in Unaizah, Sulaiman Al Habib in Buraidah, and hospitals in ArRass, AlMuthnab, and Bukayriah) and tertiary hospitals (e.g., King Fahad Specialist hospital and Prince Sultan Cancer Centre in Buraidah). The study inclusion criteria were: (1) adult (above 17 years), (2) laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection with PCR (polymerase chain reaction) detection of the virus in samples taken from the respiratory tract of the patient, and (3) patients admitted to BCH between 2014 and 2017. The exclusion criteria were: (1) suspected cases of MERS-CoV without a confirmed diagnosis, and (2) pregnant women. We evaluated â‰ˆ 1000 medical records of suspected cases of MERS-CoV and excluded the ones that did not meet the eligibility criteria. The majority did not have laboratory confirmation of a MERS-CoV infection. The accuracy of data for any patient referred to BCH was crosschecked with the patient's record from the original hospital. A total of 63 patients met the eligibility criteria and are the focus of this report. Out of 63, 43 patients' data came from the Department of Archives at BCH; the remaining 20 came from the Department of Infection Control (from discharge summaries) at BCH since they had not yet been archived (Fig. 1 ). Some key information (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) was missing from patients' records at Infection Control. All acquired data were crosschecked with their respective patient file numbers by two co-authors to ensure there was no data duplication. The exposure variable was the treatment regimen of Ribavirin plus Interferon alpha, which was the treatment of choice at BCH. The outcome variable was mortality during hospital stay. The covariates were age (in years), sex (male, female), nationality (Saudi, Non-Saudi), admission year (2014-2015, 2016-2017), vital signs on admission (body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), MERS-CoV associated conditions on admission (pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock/multiple organ failure, abdominal pain/diarrhoea), pre-existing comorbid conditions on admission (diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, chronic renal failure, and chronic heart disease), receipt of the treatment regimen (yes, no), duration of hospital stay (in days), status at discharge (alive, dead). The Regional Ethical Committee of Al-Qassim and the administration of the BCH approved this study. The ethical committee did not require that we obtain informed consent from the patients since we examined archived medical records, had no direct contact with the patients, and ensured that the data collectors abstracted and recorded the patient data anonymously.
