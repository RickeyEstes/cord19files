Isolation strategy. Quarantine was started on June 16 and ended on July 2 in 2015. All HD patients were hospitalized in a single room for 17 days, but separated differently depending on their degree of infectious risk. Close contacts (n = 54) undergoing HD at the same time (3 sessions, from June 11 to 16) as the patient with MERS received isolated HD in their rooms installed with portable dialysis machines. We defined this quarantine as "single room isolation (SRI). " The rest of the patients (n = 29) were classified as low risk and received HD at artificial kidney units, with a 1-bed width distance from the neighboring patient. It was defined as "cohort isolation (CI). " Infection surveillance was performed using real-time PCR examinations of serial sputum samples obtained from HD patients and medical staff. Participants and plasma preparation. This study included a total of 95 participants, comprising 83 HD patients and 12 medical staff, at Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital. We collected 3 mL of whole blood in EDTA-coated tubes at 2, 4, and 16 weeks after isolation. Two weeks after the quarantine was included in the isolation period; therefore, we defined the sample taken at 2 weeks as "M0". Samples obtained at 4 and 16 weeks after isolation were named M1 and M3, respectively. Briefly, whole blood was centrifuged at 1,500 × g at room temperature for 10 min, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Plasma samples were stored at −80 °C and used after 12-16 months of storage. This study was approved by the Clinical Institutional Review Board of Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Data collection. Demographic and clinical information was collected at the time of blood sampling at M0. The Charlson comorbidity index was calculated to assess the co-morbidity 30 . We obtained laboratory data, including serum hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), albumin, hsCRP, total cholesterol, single-pool kt/v, etc. for several months before and after isolation. Single-pool kt/v was calculated based on intradialytic blood urea reduction and weight change 31 . Sampling during the MERS quarantine resumed after the isolation was terminated; thus, the July sample was obtained four weeks after isolation. Accordingly, it was collected together with the sample to test for circulating cfDNA and PTX-3 at M1. Measurement of plasma indoxyl sulfate. Indoxyl sulfate was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection 32 . The chromatographic equipment was an Agilent 1260 Infinity system (Agilent Technologies, Germany). The samples were prepared by mixing 250 µL of plasma with 900 µL of the internal standard solution, which was methyl paraben (100 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (J.T. Baker; Deventer). Then, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm, and 250 µL of supernatant was transferred to the HPLC system. The separation was performed on a Spherisorb OSD-2 C18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 µm, Waters) with sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and acetonitrile (10:90, v/v; J.T. Baker; Deventer) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 375 nm, respectively. Figure 5 . The change of circulating-cfDNA depending on isolation methods in HD patients The levels of circulating cf-DNA were similar in the patients on SRI and CI. However, (A) the level of ccf-gDNA was significantly higher in the patients on SRI at M1 and M3 than them on CI. (B) The level of ccf-mtDNA was not different depending on the method of isolation. SRI: Single room isolation, CI: cohort isolation *P value < 0.05 and ** < 0.01.
