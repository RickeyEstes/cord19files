The authors developed the questions for this study. All members of APIC who were registered for the APIC 2009 Annual Educational Conference and International Meeting were invited to participate in the focus groups, regardless of size or functionality of institution or work location (within or outside the United States). The only inclusion criteria was being involved in the direct response to the 2009 novel H1N1 flu pandemic, defined as individuals who work in a hospital, health care, or public health agency that has handled/ managed at least 1 confirmed positive case of novel influenza A H1N1 in 2009. The authors recruited potential participants via e-mail. One focus group met each day in a meeting room located in the conference center site on June 7 and 8, 2009. Snacks were provided to the participants during the focus groups. The nominal group method was used to elicit information on the topics of interest. 4 The focus group method (ie, opening-ended questions) was used to elicit details from participants' experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. 5 Participants were informed that information collected would remain anonymous and that all responses were voluntary. Focus group sessions were audiotaped, and the digital recordings were transcribed verbatim. Content analysis included identifying, coding, and categorizing participants' response to the questions of interest. In addition, major themes that emerged were identified and categorized. Subjects' demographic data were obtained for descriptive statistics. In addition, participants were asked to complete an 11-item survey containing items related to the novel H1N1 flu pandemic, such as hospital or agency protocols for worker protection, isolation, and PPE usage during the event. The Institutional Review Board of Saint Louis University approved this study. APIC funded the costs of the food and meeting location for the focus groups; Saint Louis University covered the costs of data transcription. Quotations that characterize the major themes are reported. The words enclosed in brackets of the quotations are used to explain the respondents' quotes and are not the participants' words.
