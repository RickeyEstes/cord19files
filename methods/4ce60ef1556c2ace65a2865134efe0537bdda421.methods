From July 2001 to November 2003, 3545 normal term or near-term newborns underwent cranial ultrasound examination after their parents gave consent for the procedure. The infants had all been examined after birth by both an obstetrician and a pediatrician and were deemed to be healthy. Eighteen of these babies were found to have FHCs and were included in this study. Their perinatal history, physical examination, ultrasound findings, and outcome were reviewed. The initial cranial ultrasound scans were all performed in the first 3 days after delivery by using a Toshiba SSD260A real-time scanner with a 7 MHz transducer. An Acuson Aspen real-time scanner with multi-frequency high resolution transducers (5-7 MHz) was used for follow up studies. Multiple coronal, sagittal, and parasagittal views were obtained from the anterior fontanel in each examination. All initial and follow up cranial ultrasound examinations were performed by pediatric neurologists. All 18 infants had cysts adjacent to the lateral tip of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. Cysts with the distinctive elliptical, smooth, thin-walled morphology of FHCs were considered typical (Fig. 1A,B) . The term atypical was applied if the cyst did not totally fulfill the typical morphology but occupied the same location as typical FHCs. A second cranial ultrasound examination at 1 month of age was recommended for all babies diagnosed with an FHC, with serial follow up to continue at intervals of 2 months until the cysts disappeared. However, because of outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, some parents opted not to take their babies to the hospital. The Denver Development Scales were used to evaluate development of the infants who did not have follow up scans.
