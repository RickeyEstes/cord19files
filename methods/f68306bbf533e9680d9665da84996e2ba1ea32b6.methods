This qualitative study explores a range of hospital doctors' and nurses' experiences of the Ebola 2014/15 outbreak at a teaching hospital (450 beds) in Queensland, Australia, in February 2015. Following ethics approval (#HREC/14/QPCH/233), the directors of the particular hospital departments who would be responsible for delivering care to a presenting Ebola patient were approached for participation. The final sample of 21 health professionals included eight consultants and 13 nurses (four doctors and two nurses with managerial roles) of whom 12 were female and 9 were male. The sample included participants from Emergency Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Management. To ensure confidentiality, further demographic details, including specific participant positions, have been withheld. The data were thematically analysed and systematically coded. Two members of the research team independently coded and crosschecked the data, which were then refined to further develop themes and an overarching interpretation of the data. Analytic rigour was enhanced by searching for atypical and contradicting cases in coding and theme development.
