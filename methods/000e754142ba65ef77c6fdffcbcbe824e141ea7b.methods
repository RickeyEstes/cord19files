This study was performed at a 2,700-bed, tertiary care, universityaffiliated hospital between January 2012 and December 2015. All admitted patients who had positive test results for respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were prospectively identified and monitored until their discharge or release from isolation. Performance of the PCR test for respiratory viruses was at the discretion of the attending physician. Outpatients and patients discharged in the emergency room were not included. Respiratory viruses were detected by multiplex reverse-transcription PCR assay using a Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) (January 2012-October 2013) or Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) (November 2013-December 2015). The performance of those PCR kits used in this study has been evaluated in a published study. 5 6, 7 The proportion of hospital-acquired respiratory viral infections was calculated for all viruses. The incidence of such infections was calculated as the number of cases per 1,000 admissions and as cases per 10,000 patient days. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center.
