This study used an action research and participant observation approach to explore linkages with organizational change and change leadership theory while working on a practical organizational issue. The researcher reported on the theoretical framework that has guided her work, will describe the intervention and action research methods used, and discuss the results in terms of applications to both connecting theory and management practice. Participant observation is a straightforward technique that involved the researcher immersing herself in the subject/project being studied, over a 6 month period of time associated with the project implementation. While there are limitations associated with participant observation as a data gathering technique, this approach is particularly appropriate to studies of group processes associated with project team work. Action research as a subset of participant observation provides an opportunity where the participants in a focused change effort, self-reflect on their experiences in order to improve practice for themselves or the organization. Action can be undertaken by one individual, by a group of individuals, or as part of a team approach. Action research is a contemporary scientific approach which strives to contribute both to the practical concerns of people in an immediate problematic situation and to the objectives of social science. Within the five phases of action research including diagnosing, action planning, action taking, evaluating and specifying learning (Coghlan and Brannick, 2002) , the researcher is a partner in the research process with participants, observation of the current situation informed by data about the past in order to help to create the defined future state. In this study, the researcher used action research informed by theoretical considerations and the environment for change at this organization. As this project evolved several different research tools were used including the researcher keeping a research journal, document collection and analysis, and participant observation. Action research is ideally suited to provide actionable knowledge derived from collaborative work on organization issues (Coghlan and Brannick, 2002) . It provides relevant, rich, reflective information gathered in real-time as processes and changes occur. Action research has been especially useful for today's leaders in that it provides a sequence of events and an approach for managing change and problem solving that gets at issues of organizational concern (Coghlan and Brannick, 2002) .
