We measured the classification accuracy of three fever detection algorithms on a test set consisting of 213 pa-tients seen at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Presbyterian Hospital. We compared the detection performance of the three algorithms against physician classification of fever based on the patient√ïs ED report. In particular, we measured sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio positive (LR+).
