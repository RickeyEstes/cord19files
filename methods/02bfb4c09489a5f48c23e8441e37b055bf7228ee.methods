Recombinant nsP2 protease characterization. The recombinant nsP2 proteases were constructed, expressed and purified as previously described 31 . The engineered mutants were expressed and purified by the same protocol as the wild type protein. Enzyme characterization was performed as previously described 31 . Briefly, the characterization was performed with 3 synthetic fluorescent substrates corresponding to the 3 cleavage sites of the chikungunya viral non-structural polyprotein. These substrates were designated nsP1/nsP2 (AGA), nsP2/nsP3 (AGC) and nsP3/nsP4 (AGG) with the amino acids nsP2 pro AGG Metal and protease inhibitor characterization. The effects on nsP2 protease activity of metal ions and protease inhibitors were characterized as previously described 31 . Briefly, a single concentration of 2 mM metal ion was employed to test cobalt (Co 2+ ), magnesium (Mg 2+ ), zinc (Zn 2+ ), nickel (Ni 2+ ) and copper (Cu 2+ ) effects on protease activity. Different final concentrations of four protease inhibitors were used; 50 μ M chymostatin (inhibits chymotrypsin-like proteases), 10 μ M E-64 (a selective cysteine protease inhibitor), 100 μ M leupeptin (inhibits serine and thiol proteases) and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; a commonly used serine protease inhibitor). The enzyme activity in the presence of the metal ions or inhibitors was measured with the 3 fluorescent substrates. The initial reaction rate was analyzed using GraphPad Prism ® software, version 5.01. Percent remaining activity was calculated from the enzyme activity obtained in the presence of inhibitor versus the control activity in the absence of inhibitor. Stability test. Thermal stability of the nsP2 protease was determined as previously described 31 . Briefly, freshly purified enzyme was incubated at 37 and 42 °C for 10 min then activity was immediately measured using the AGG substrate at 4.5 μ M final concentration. The initial reaction rate was evaluated using GraphPad Prism ® software, version 5.01. Percent remaining activity was assessed by comparison with the control reaction at 37 °C. Table 5 . Substrate sequences of chikungunya virus nsP2 protease used in this study. The substrate sequences used in the present study have been previously reported 31 , and this table is adapted from the previous report. Briefly, the three fluorescent substrates designated as AGA, AGC and AGG (as underlined) were synthesized corresponding to the scissile site sequences (shown in upper case bold text) of chikungunya virus non-structural polyprotein (nsP1/2, nsP2/3 and nsP3/4), respectively. A 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl (Nma) fluorophore group was attached at the amino terminus and a 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) group attached to the carboxyl terminus of an additional lysine (K) residue.
