In collaboration with the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, the Gulf Cooperation Council Infection Control Center, and the World Health Organization (WHO)-International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium MERS-CoV Working Group, we developed a study protocol to screen potential donors, collect high-titer convalescent plasma, and administer the plasma in a clinical trial (13) . The study was approved by the Ministry of the National Guard Health Affairs Institutional Review Board (approval no. IRBC/233/14, June 9, 2014) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02190799). We conducted the study at King Abdulaziz Medical City, a 1,100-bed tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission International, and the hospital's Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine is accredited by the College of American Pathologists and the American Association of Blood Banks.
