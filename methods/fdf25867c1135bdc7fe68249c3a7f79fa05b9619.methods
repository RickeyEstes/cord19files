Cell lines and Virus. The GF-1 grouper cell line was provided by Dr. Chi (Institute of Zoology and Development of Life Sciences) and was cultured at 28 °C in Leibovitz L-15 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 25 µg/ml gentamycin. GF-1 cells were infected with RGNNV obtained from naturally infected red grouper larvae collected in 2002 in the Tainan prefecture. The virus was purified as previously described 52 and stored at −80 °C until use.
