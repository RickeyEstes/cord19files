Background information regarding the effectiveness and uptake of influenza vaccinations was gathered via narrative review, which included academic and newspaper articles, as well as government reports. Subsequently, these materials were analysed using Kingdon's agenda setting framework of three converging streams leading to windows of opportunity for possible policy adoption. No permissions to analyse the data used in this study were necessary or granted. The authors independently categorized historical events as falling primarily into the problems, politics, or policies stream (see Table 1 ). Categories are based on Kingdon's description as noted below. Any discrepancies in classification were resolved through discussion. In Kingdon's framework, the problems stream involves the identification of a particular social problem that has gained public or decision-maker attention and cannot be easily ignored. These problems may come to light through awareness of a change in an indicator, such as an increased infection rate, or a focusing event/crisis, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In the politics stream, the governmental agenda is formulated and the list of issues or problems to be given attention is prioritized. This stream is impacted by political events (such as changes in public opinion/national mood), and organized forces (such as a change in government due to elections). In the policies stream, experts analyse the various problems, and suggest technically feasible and politically acceptable solutions to them. Generally, the three streams flow independently of one another; however, a time-limited window of opportunity may open when these streams converge (as politically acceptable solutions to prioritized problems are identified). At this point of convergence, issues are most likely to reach the government's decision agenda-where policy problems and their proposed solutions are under active discussion by government decision-makers-and thus, most likely to result in the adoption of a new policy. Policy windows can also close rapidly. This tends to occur when: problems, politics, and policies are not adequately linked together; initiatives that are implemented lead to either failure or success; indicators of severity lessen; other critical items push the issue off the agenda; there has been movement through an "issue attention cycle" (i.e., a gradual decline of interest in the condition). Using Kingdon's agenda setting framework (three process streams that lead to windows of opportunity when they converge) the objective of this paper is to analyse the likelihood of government adopting a mandatory vaccination policy for HCWs in Ontario.
