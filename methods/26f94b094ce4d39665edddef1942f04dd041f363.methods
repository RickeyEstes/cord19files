We performed a desk review of available Chinese government policies, project documents and published articles on civil society organization (or nongovernmental organization, or grass-roots organization or community-based organization) participation of HIV/AIDS programmes in China over the past two decades. As civil society in China differs from other parts of the world, it is important to begin this analysis with a clear definition of Chinese CSOs and the specific entities this article covers. Chinese scholars and practitioners have often described three main kinds of CSOs (minjian zuzhi in Chinese) in China, 10,11 including: (i) 'civil organizations', which include mass organizations and associations that are closely affiliated with government systems and have an established national network, such as the All China Women Federation and the Chinese Association of STD & AIDS Prevention and Control (CASAPC); (ii) civilian non-enterprise units, which provide certain public goods such as social services; and (iii) 'grass-roots CSOs', which include grass-roots-and community-based organizations often involving members of the affected populations they work with; for example, people living with HIV (PLHIV) and MSM. Grass-roots CSOs are often unregistered or are registered with the Ministry of Industrial and Commerce (MOIC), but only CSOs registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) are legally recognized in China: therefore, in this article, these grass-roots CSOs will be referred to as 'unregistered CSOs'. However, organizations at all levels are today involved in the national AIDS response. This article predominately covers organizations that fall into the first and last categories outlined above, which will be referred to as registered CSOs and unregistered CSOs, respectively. The extent of civil society participation was assessed in five ways: (i) the political environment in which CSOs operate in China; (ii) access to financial resources; (iii) the number of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS; (iv) the scope of work in which HIV/ AIDS-related CSOs are involved; and (v) examples of the impact of CSO involvement on programme indicators.
