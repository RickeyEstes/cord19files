We define electric two-wheelers as two-wheel vehicles designed for transporting passengers by means of an electric motor alone or in combination with human force ( Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ). In line with EC (2013), we differentiate: e-bikes: pedal assisted two-wheelers (also referred to as pedelecs) with a maximum speed of 625 km h À1 and an electric motor a maximum continuous rated power of 60.25 kW; e-bikes include electric two-wheelers that are exempted from type approval and also larger pedal-assisted electric-powered cycles of category L1e-A that are subject to type approval; e-mopeds and small e-scooters referred to here as mid-size electric two-wheelers: two-wheelers of category L1e-B without pedal assistance and a maximum speed of 645 km h À1 , equipped with an electric motor of a maximum continuous rated power of >0.25-4 kW; e-motorcycles and large e-scooters referred to here as large electric two-wheelers: two-wheelers of category L3e equipped with a maximum speed of >45 km h À1 and an electric motor of a maximum continuous rated power of >4 kW. We do not explicitly address electric three-and four-wheelers (categories L2e, L5e-L7e; EC, 2013) because of their minor importance in Europe (ACEM, 2013b) . We consider in our review (i) peer-reviewed articles that are available through the academic search engines web of science and scopus and (ii) scientific reports and presentations, workshop documents, and working papers that are publicly available online. We conduct our online search by using the key words: ''electric two-wheelers", ''pedelecs", ''e-bikes", ''e-scooters", and ''e-motorcycles" in combination with the terms ''costbenefit", ''economic performance", ''financial performance", ''environmental impacts", ''life cycle assessment", and ''safety". We identify around 60 relevant documents that were published before April 2013 in English, German, and Dutch. As mentioned, our assessment focuses on e-bikes but also seeks to benchmark the environmental, economic, and social performance of mid-size and large electric two-wheelers against conventional modes of passenger transport. Given the limited information on mode-shift behavior (see Table A3 in Appendix), we abstain from presenting pairwise comparisons (e.g., e-bike versus bicycle) but instead display absolute results for various electric and conventional modes of passenger transport. We complement our literature review with own analysis on the economic performance of electric two-wheelers. To this end, we establish estimates for the mean price, as well as mean price differential between electric-two wheelers and conventional two-wheelers, based on the data samples shown in Tables S3-S7 (see Supplemental Material) . To quantify the cost decline in the manufacturing of e-bikes, we conduct an experience curve analysis (Henderson, 1974) . We separately model the absolute price [EUR 2012 ] and the specific price [EUR 2012 kW h À1 ] of e-bikes as well as the price differential [EUR 2012 ] between e-bikes and bicycles [P(x t )] as a power-law function of the cumulative global e-bike production [number of vehicles] as: where P(x 0 ) represents each of the three price parameters expressed in Euro less value-added tax, deflated to the base year 2012; x 0 and x t represent the cumulative global e-bike production at starting point 0 and at the end point t of our analysis; b represents the experience index. By plotting experience curves on a double-logarithmic scale, we obtain a linear curve with b as slope parameter. We calculate for each experience curve the learning rate LR (%) that represents the percentage change of the respective price parameter with each doubling of cumulative production: We estimate the error of the learning rate based on the standard deviation of the slope parameter b. We convert currencies by applying mean market exchange rates for the year 2012 (X-Rates, 2013). Nominal prices are deflated by using gross domestic product deflators obtained from the World Bank (WB, 2013). We establish separate experience curves for: (i) e-bikes sold in China and (ii) e-bikes sold in Germany and the Netherlands (see Table S2 in the Supplemental Material). The focus on Germany and the Netherlands is justified because these two countries together constitute 65% of the European e-bike market (Colibi and Coliped, 2014) . Throughout the article, error intervals represent the standard deviation of data samples.
