The HACCP assessment of Vietnam's domestic poultry trade followed the first three HACCP principles (described in Table 1) to address our aims [17] . The initial flow chart created during the first stage of the HACCP assessment (see Figure 1 ) was developed based on our long-term research of Vietnam's poultry trade. The flow chart begins with a poultry egg and tracks all the possible routes that this egg could take through Vietnam's domestic poultry trade. This flow chart was then presented to a range of experts for critical analysis; including public health professionals, epidemiologists and wildlife disease biologists. A hazard was considered to be a process within Vietnam's poultry trade providing an opportunity, at an unacceptable level of risk, for the transmission of HPAI either from poultry-to-human or poultry-to-poultry. Based on the frequency with which these hazards occur, they were then grouped into categories of posing a high or low-risk to poultry and/or humans. Following the validation of the flow chart, we referred to the team of experts again to determine appropriate Critical Control Points (CCPs). A CCP is a point in poultry trade which provides an opportunity to control, prevent or eliminate the risks for HPAI transmission. Each of these first two principles required cross-referencing outputs with existing literature on HPAI virus epidemiology within Vietnam's poultry trade. We also referred to recent reviews of the scientific literature to identify any risks which the HACCP analysis failed to identify. Critical limits were then set for each of the CCPs identified. These critical limits are thresholds used as preventative measures to control the hazards within the system. Setting the critical limits required prior research of both Vietnam's domestic poultry trade and consumer behaviour.
