Viruses and cells. All the B/Yamanashi/166/98 NS1/NP mutant viruses were generated by reverse genetics method, employing the eight-plasmid bidirectional transcriptional system as described by Hoffmann et al. 36 . Virus stocks were grown in 9-day-old fertilized chicken eggs, and virus titers were determined using plaque assays in MDCK cells. All eight segments of the recombinant viruses were sequenced. A549 (CCL-185) and MDCK (CCL-34) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish the IFN-b-inducible S-3F-ISG15GG A549 cell line, a plasmid was constructed by inserting into the pGL3 vector a KpnI-XbaI DNA fragment composed of a S-3F-ISG15-encoding sequence linked to an ISG15 promoter element at its 5 0 end. This DNA fragment was a product of PCR-mediated ligation of two smaller fragments: one fragment contains a ISG15 promoter sequence (bases -740 to 0) that was amplified from HeLa genomic DNA; the other fragment encodes S-3F-ISG15 generated by PCR-mediated addition of 3xFlag-S sequence to an ISG15-encoding sequence. The constructed plasmid (9 mg) was co-transfected with 1 mg of a linear puromycin selection marker (Clontech) into A549 cells. After selection with medium containing 1 mg ml À 1 puromycin, individual clones were selected, expanded, and the clone showing the strongest IFN-b-dependent induction of S-3F-ISG15 as well as its conjugates was used for virus infection experiments. The control IFN-b-inducible S-3F-ISG15AA A549 cell line was generated using the same procedure. SiRNAs and antibodies. All siRNAs were ON-TARGET plus siRNAs purchased from Thermo Scientific. For each gene, three different siRNAs were initially tested, and the one with the highest silencing efficiency as indicated by immunoblotting was chosen for subsequent experiments. The sense sequences for ISG15, UbE1L, USP18-specific siRNAs are as follow: 5 0 -GCACCGUGUUCAUGAAUCUUU-3 0 (ISG15), 5 0 -GCAUGGAGUUUGCUUUCUG-3 0 (UbE1L), 5 0 -CUGCAUAUCU UCUGGUUUA-3 0 (USP18). The control siRNA used was ON-TARGET plus nontargeting siRNA #1. To exclude any off-target effects, we also employed additional siRNAs for silencing ISG15 and USP18. The sense sequences of these siRNAs are as follow: 5 0 -GCAACGAAUUCCAGGUGUC-3 0 (ISG15), 5 0 -GGAAGAAGA-CAGCAACAUG-3 0 (USP18). Transfection of siRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen), using a final concentration of siRNA of 20 nM (10 nM for each siRNA if two siRNAs were transfected together). Commercial antibodies (Abs) used: anti-Flag M2 mouse Ab (Sigma #3165, dilution 1:3,000), mouse Ab against influenza B virus NP (Southern Biotech #10885-05, dilution 1:10,000 to 1:2,000), mouse Ab against influenza B virus M1 protein (Southern Biotech #10820-01, dilution 1:4,000 to 1:1,000), rabbit Ab against UbcH8 (Abgent #AP2118B, dilution1:1,000), and anti-b-actin Ab (Sigma #A1978, dilution 1:8,000 ), rabbit antibody against USP18 (Cell Signaling #4813, dilution 1:1,000), rabbit antibody against PARP (Cell Signaling #9542, dilution 1:1,000). The Ab specific for human ISG15 was kindly provided by Earnest Borden 37 . The expression of viral HA protein was detected using serum from ferrets subjected to influenza B virus infection, which was kindly provided by Jonathan McCullers 38 . To generate antibody specific for NS1B, the NS1B C-terminal domain of influenza B/Yamanashi/166/98 strain expressed and purified from bacteria (kindly provided by Gaetano T. Montelione) was sent to Harlan Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN) for rabbit polyclonal antibody production. The quantitation of western blots was performed using NIH ImageJ software and original western blot scans for (Figs 1-5 ) are provided in Supplementary Fig. 8 . Assaying virus replication, viral RNA and protein synthesis. For multiple cycle growth, A549 cells were infected with 0.1 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) per cell of wt or 67 mutant virus, followed by incubation at 34°C in serum-free OPTI-MEM medium supplemented with 1.0 mg ml À 1 N-acetylated trypsin. Aliquots of the medium were taken at interval of approximately 12 h and virus titers were determined using plaque assays with MDCK cells. For single-cycle virus replication, A549 cells were infected with 5-10 p.f.u. per cell of wt or 67 mutant virus, and were incubated at 34°C in serum-free OPTI-MEM medium. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 1,000 International Units (IU) ml À 1 of recombinant human IFN-b (Avonex, Biogen, Inc.) for 12-18 h before virus infection. For siRNA knockdown experiments, siRNAs were transfected into cells for 24 h before IFN-b treatment. At 24 h after virus infection, cells were collected and analysed using either immunoblots or real-time quantitative RT-PCR. For immunoblots, cells were lysed in high-salt RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor and 0.5 units ml À 1 benzonase (Sigma), then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. The extracts were analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. For RT-PCR analysis, cells were harvested in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was purified by Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo research). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) with either oligo(dT) primer (for mRNA) or influenza B virus gene-specific primers (for vRNA). Real-time PCR was carried out on the ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system (Invitrogen). For the measurements of HA, M, NA, NP RNA, 2 Â FastStart Universal Probe Master (Rox) (Roche) and Universal Probe Library (Roche) were used and human ACTB (Beta Actin) endogenous control (Applied Biosystems) was used as the internal control. Universal Probes (Roche) used were: #118 for HA and NP, #29 for M and #14 for NA. For the measurement of NS RNA, because of no suitable Universal Probe Library(Roche), SYBR Green based quantitative PCR with melting curve analysis was employed using Power SYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The same method was also applied to assaying NP and Actin RNA in the same experiments. The data were analysed using the comparative delta-delta Ct method. The primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 2 . Co-immunoprecipitation. For analysis of NS1B-ISG15 interaction, 3F-S-ISG15GG A549 cells were first treated with the indicated siRNA for 24 h, followed by 16 h of treatment with 1,000 IU ml À 1 of human IFN-b and then infection with 5 p.f.u. per cell of either wt or 67 mutant virus. The cells were harvested at 18 h after infection, and were extracted with cold RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5; 200 mM NaCl; 2 mM MgCl 2; 0.5% NP-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor and 0.5 units ml À 1 benzonase (Sigma). After brief sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16000xg for 10 min at 4°C. The protein concentration of the extract was measured using the DC protein assay (Biorad), and an aliquot of the extract containing 700 mg of protein was used for co-immunoprecipitations. The extract was precleared by incubation with 50 ml Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4°C, and then incubated for 3 h with 50 ul Dynabeads Protein G (that had been preabsorbed with 10 mg of NS1B Ab). The beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analysed by immunoblots probed with NS1B or Flag Ab.
