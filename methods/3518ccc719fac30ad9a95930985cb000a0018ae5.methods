We searched the scholarly and grey-literature databases to identify which capacities should be included in a framework for assessing and improving health system resilience to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards. We also sought to determine whether there were existing frameworks that highlighted these capacities that could be used in low-, middle-, and high-income settings. For the purposes of our research, we used the WHO definition of health systems, defined as "all the activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health" [19] . Specifically, we integrated literature in the following three areas: health security, health systems strengthening, and quality improvement. The aims of this research were to characterize the impacts that infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards have on health systems; to identify challenges in maintaining health service delivery during outbreaks and natural hazards; and to identify strategies for effecting sustainable change in health systems-strengthening efforts. Literature databases included PubMed, Web of Science, and OAIster. Key search terms were informed by, but not inclusive of, Kruk et al.'s definition of a resilient health system, and included "health system," "health system strengthening," "resilience," "recover," "quality improvement," "infectious disease," "outbreak," "natural disaster," "global health security," "pandemic," "outbreak response," and "essential functions," as well as a variety of different pathogens responsible for recent infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., SARS, Ebola) and natural hazard types (e.g., cyclone, earthquake). 1 See Additional file 1: Table S1 for the full electronic search strategy. Additionally, we examined the websites of major relevant public health organizations (WHO, the Rockefeller Foundation, CDC Stacks) to identify articles and frameworks not indexed in the aforementioned databases. All but one of the search results were filtered to include only those articles published during or after 2002, to capture literature emanating in the wake of the SARS epidemic, up until February 2018, the end of the study period. However, one search term did included articles published during or after 1990, to capture more broadly those resources that focused on essential health functions. Only English-language articles were considered. We included documents if they described health system capacities that could potentially strengthen health system resilience to either infectious disease threats or natural hazards. Documents were excluded if they described health capacities that were outside the aims of this research, as defined previously (i.e. articles that were purely about public health capacities that did not mention the relationship of these capacities to the healthcare system). For example, articles that described the importance of a trained epidemiologic workforce (a public health capacity) in outbreak identification and mitigation would be excluded. Articles about the importance of engagement between Ministries of Health and the public would be excluded; however, articles about the importance of engagement between healthcare facilities and Ministries of Health would be included. Documents were also excluded if the article described resilience in contexts outside of natural hazards and infectious disease outbreaks (i.e. armed conflict situations). Each of the research team members (7 in total) was assigned a set of articles to review. Each article title was reviewed by the assigned researcher for relevancy using the previously mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by a review of the abstract for those titles deemed relevant. All articles deemed relevant after title and abstract review were then read in their entirety by the assigned researcher, providing a final set of articles for analysis. Article references were also reviewed to identify important literature not located in the primary search. Articles were then thematically coded by the assigned researcher using QRS International's NVivo 11 coding software [20] and a qualitative coding instrument developed from a priori themes previously identified in other resilience checklists [1, 2, 21, 22] . Additional topics of interest that did not fit into the previously identified thematic rubric were coded as "other" for further review during data analysis. After completion of coding, through a process of inductive and deductive reasoning, the researchers identified a final list of themes and associated key literature that described the critical capacities necessary for health system resilience to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards. We then sought to identify areas of overlap between the health system resilience themes and capacities identified in our literature search, and the specific health security capacities that are the focus of the JEE.
