An exploratory, qualitative design was adopted to explore the perception of HK emergency nurses regarding their work during the HSI pandemic outbreak. Qualitative research is an interpretive and naturalistic approach of enquiry that emphasizes the description of given meanings about human experiences and realities (Denzin and Lincoln, 2003) . Employing an exploratory qualitative design in this study is appropriate to capture the subjective and humanistic perspective of work from emergency nurses during the HSI pandemic. An in-depth understanding of their perceptions will therefore be achieved.
