Ethics statement. Rhesus macaque experiment was carried out in strict compliance with Chinese government rules and regulations for animal health and welfare. The experimental protocol for immunization and blood collection at Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice experiments were performed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada. All animal experiments have been approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Immunization of rhesus macaques. year old Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) (Rh091730 and Rh100888) were immunized intramuscularly about every 4 weeks with 100 or 200 Î¼ g of recombinant EBOV GP devoid of mucin-like and transmembrane domains (GPdM) derived from the Guinean patient C7 (Genbank accession number KJ660347) identified in the 2014 outbreak 1 . The first two doses were formulated with alum adjuvant (Imject Alum, Thermo Scientific) while the subsequent doses were recombinant GPdM only. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected after the 8 th immunization, evaluated for binding and neutralization activity and used for sorting of single B cells and amplifying immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (VH and VL) by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The animals were housed in the Animal Experimental Center of the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Science.
