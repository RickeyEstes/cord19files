Our model has three main features: (1) influenza transmission, (2) population demographics, and (3) dynamic network structure. We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model which included waning immunity and seasonality of influenza transmission. We used census data [35, 36, 37, 38, 39] (Table 1) from China, to construct a population with demographic changes under a one-child policy. A simple dynamic network structure was used to group people with household links, school links and social links, allowing influenza to be transmitted along these links in the network while changing the state of each individual (S, E, I and R). The model structure is described in the section titled Model Structure (and in the Text S1 and Figure S1 ). Influenza transmission parameters were calibrated using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [40, 41] as described in the Calibration section (we chose parameters' ranges based on both the English and Chinese literature [42] ). The Computation section briefly discusses the implementation and computations based on calibrated parameters (Table 2) ; a more detailed description can be found in the Text S1.
