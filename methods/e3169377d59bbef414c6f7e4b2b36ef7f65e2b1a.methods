Data and information on OH research projects, OH training and capacity building programmes, and government support for OH in South Asian countries were collected through a range of different approaches to generate a 'landscape analysis' of OH in the South Asian region. The major focus of this analysis was on the eight member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), notably: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Data on OH research were collected through searching peer-reviewed and grey literature, a questionnaire survey of people potentially engaged in OH research in South Asia, and personal contact with key people identified through the authors' professional networks. An initial search for peer-reviewed publications on individual zoonotic diseases by a country in South Asia provided information on the volume of research associated with each disease in each country. The search was conducted in all databases in Web of Science (WoS) for publications within a 20-year period from 1996 to 2016, to capture the period of the early HPAI outbreaks that were a major driver for global investment in an OH approach. The search terms for zoonotic diseases by country included key words that captured the range of names by which a disease is described in the literature and the country name. The total number of publications returned in each search was considered a reflection of the most commonly researched zoonotic diseases in each country. A second search was conducted to specifically identify publications on OH research in South Asia, using the keywords 'One Health' and 'South Asia' plus 'One Health' and individual country names. As not all publications on OH research included the term 'One Health', a second set of searches was conducted using the term 'humans and livestock' or 'humans and animals' or 'livestock and humans' or 'animals and humans' or 'humans and their animals' or 'humans and their livestock' or 'livestock and children' and country name for each of the South Asian countries. The papers were then reviewed to identify those that represented OH research as defined in the following two ways: 1. A multidisciplinary study on a health-related topic, involving people from two or more disciplines, including human health, domestic animal health, wildlife health, ecological, environmental, sociological, entomological and other. Multidisciplinarity was ascertained from the author affiliations in published papers. 2. A multidisciplinary, multi-study research programme on a health-related topic. The programme includes individual studies that may involve researchers from only one discipline and/or data collection from either human or animal populations, but the studies are designed in an integrated way within the programme so that the results of each study can be interpreted together and contribute to designing integrated approaches to zoonotic disease control. A questionnaire was distributed to 115 professionals who were potentially working in OH-related areas in the South Asia region using the Hubnet platform (www.hubnet.org. nz/) to collect information on OH research, training, and challenges in implementing an OH approach in South Asian countries. OH research was defined as above, and OH training was defined as 'Training, education or capacity building activities and programmes that involved people from two or more disciplines related to human health, domestic animal health, wildlife health or environmental health'. Training was separated into short-term training such as short courses, workshops, and seminars of less than 1 month; long-term training programmes of 1 month or more; and university undergraduate or postgraduate education. Additional information on OH training was collected by a Google search using the terms '[Country name]' and 'One Health'. Such a broad search was found to produce the most comprehensive information on OH activities in the South Asian countries. Results were reviewed, and activities that were defined as training were collated. Further information was obtained through the authors' professional networks. Government support for OH in each country was identified through the authors' knowledge of government initiatives and collection of further details through OH networks in each country.
