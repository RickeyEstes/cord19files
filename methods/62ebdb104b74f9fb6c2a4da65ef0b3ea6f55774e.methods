This is a retrospective analysis of reported cases between December 2016 and January 2019. All reported MERS-CoV cases were obtained from the World Health Organization Web site. These cases were systematically reported and were reviewed including line listing. 10 Statistical analysis was done using Minitab version 17 software (Minitab, State College, PA). A significant P value was considered for P <.05. Boxplots of time to specified events were generated as follows: lapsed time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization, onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis, hospitalization to confirmation of diagnosis, and from onset of symptoms to death. These times (in days) were calculated based on the differences between the date of symptoms onset, date of hospitalization, date of diagnosis confirmation, and date of death (if this was the case). We used publicly reported anonymized case-patient data reported to the World Health Organization, therefore, there was no requirement for informed consent or institutional review board approval.
