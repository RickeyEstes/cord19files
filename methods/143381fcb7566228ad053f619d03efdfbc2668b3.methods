The regular expression constrained sequence alignment problem was originally formulated by Arslan (23) . The algorithm proposed in (23) is for pairwise alignment with a single constraint. In (24) Arslan extended the algorithm in (23) to support multiple alignment with multiple constraints. The algorithm proposed in (24) may be implemented. It computes mathematically optimal constrained alignments. Unfortunately, the time complexity is extremely high, involving an exponential multiplicative factor in addition to the exponential time complexity for optimal (unconstrained) MSA computations. Even for pairwise alignment with multiple constraints, its worst case time and space requirements are intensive. In addition, the algorithms in (23, 24) cannot find in the resulting alignment the regions responsible for the satisfactions of the constraints; only the alignment score, without the alignment itself, is reported. But being able to report alignments is important for a web server. It is therefore necessary to propose a solution more suitable for practical applications. For pairwise alignment with one regular expression constraint, in a previous study (25) we have proposed an algorithm, which is more efficient both in time and in space than the one in (23) . Furthermore, the alignment in addition to the score can be reconstructed without worsening the time and space complexity. In this work we extend the algorithm in (25) to support multiple constraints and multiple sequences, as required in RE-MuSiC. The resulting algorithm is more efficient than the one in (24) for pairwise alignment with multiple constraints. To deal with multiple sequences, a progressive method is implemented, using our improved pairwise algorithm as the kernel.
