Sample collection and plasma DNA extraction: A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected. Another set of blood samples from non-pregnant women and men were also obtained using them as plasma negative and positive controls for the study, respectively. Fresh blood samples were drawn into Vacutainer EDTA tubes (BD Cat. 366643) immediately and were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge; their plasma fractions were collected and stored at -80°C for further analysis. Plasma DNA was extracted using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Cat. 55114) by following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2 ml of plasma was mixed with 200 μl proteinase K, 2.4 ml on ACL buffer by pulsevortexing for 1 min in a 50 ml conical tube. Then the mixture was incubated in a 60°C water bath for 30 min. Then, 3.6 ml ACB buffer was added to the sample lysate and mixed by pulse-vortexing for 1 min, incubated for 5 min on ice and applied to the QIAamp mini column. Following the multiple wash and centrifugation steps, columns were incubated for 10 min at 56°C and DNA was eluted with 100 μl of AVE buffer and stored at -20°C for further analyses. The extraction quality of nucleic acid was confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The nucleic acid was stained with ethidium bromide. The purity of DNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance values at 260 nm and 280 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1700, Japan).
