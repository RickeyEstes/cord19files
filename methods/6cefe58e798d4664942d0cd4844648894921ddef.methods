A total of 365 primary probable SARS cases diagnosed in mainland China between 1 January and 31 May 2003, and their 7357 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission, were initially identified and screened. This was carried out using individual survey databases of probable SARS cases and close contacts, main transmission chains of SARS in important affected areas, and the medical records of SARS cases in some designated hospitals. The criteria for SARS diagnosis were consistent with the criteria from the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China for diagnosing infectious atypical pneumonia. The definition of SARS close contacts conformed to the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China criteria for determining close contacts of infectious atypical pneumonia. The histories of close contacts were confirmed by telephone interviews. All interviews were taperecorded and checked by quality control staff to monitor the quality of the interview data. Of the 365 primary probable SARS cases, 15 cases (4.1%) were excluded from the present study due to unreliable information, and 350 cases (95.9%) and their 6727 close contacts during the periods of their clinical symptoms before admission were included. There were no significant differences in age and gender between the excluded and included primary cases. All included primary cases were statistically independent. Of the 6727 close contacts, 135 (2.0%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases. The secondary attack rate of each primary case before admission was estimated by dividing the number of secondary cases that were generated by the primary case before admission, by the number of close contacts before admission of the primary case. In this study, as no active intervention measures against the primary cases such as case isolation were taken before admission, the variation of secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case may have resulted from impact of the meteorological factors and air pollution on the SARS outbreak. Therefore, this type of secondary attack rate was used as a dependent variable in the data analysis. For each primary case, corresponding average values for meteorological variables and the air pollution variable between onset date and admission date were computed by means of arithmetic mean and used in the data analysis. The daily meteorological data, including daily average temperature (DAT), daily average relative humidity (DARH), daily average air pressure (DAAP), daily average wind velocity (DAWV), and daily hours of sunshine (DHS), were obtained from the National Meteorological Centre of China. The daily air pollution data were provided by the Chinese National Environmental Protection Agency (CNEPA). Air pollution was evaluated by the air pollution index (API). 17, 18 CNEPA calculates individual pollution indices for five major air pollutants, including particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone, and carbon monoxide. The maximal individual pollution index was set as the comprehensive API for the monitoring area. In most monitoring areas, particulate matter was considered as a major pollutant. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case and the meteorological factors and air pollution. Univariate logistic regression models were initially used to identify potential risk factors for the SARS outbreak in these data. Factors assessed included DAT, DARH, DAAP, DAWV, DHS, and API. The multivariate logistic regression model included all above-mentioned factors. During a calendar year, meteorological conditions are correlated with time. Knowledge of SARS increased over time during the year, and therefore individuals and communities may have taken more effective action to protect themselves, even if they were not specifically quarantined. Thus, the time variable, i.e. the onset time of a primary case, was a potential confounding factor and was further included in multivariate analyses. Since 21 April 2003 was an important date for the control of the SARS outbreak in China, when the State Council began to disseminate daily epidemic information and many major intervention measures were commenced in order to control the outbreak, we used it as a cut-off point. In multivariate analyses, the time variable took a value of 1 when onset date of a primary case was after 21 April 2003, and 0 otherwise. As cases of a directly transmitted infectious disease are clustered in space as well as time, and meteorological variables are also clustered in space and time, the space variable, i.e. affected area that a primary case was from, was also a potential confounding factor. Therefore, we further selected two major affected areas in China, Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia, to perform multivariate logistic regression analyses. The regression models included all meteorological variables and the API variable with adjustment for the time variable. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All P-values were twosided. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 8.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
