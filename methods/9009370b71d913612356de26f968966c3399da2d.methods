Propagation and purification of NDV NDV La Sota strain (Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) were propagated in 9-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs (Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) at 37°C. The allantoic fluid (AF) with enrichment of NDV virions harvested at 108 h post-infection was clarified by differential centrifugation at 4°C, first centrifugated at 4,000 × g for 15 min and then the supernatant was centrifugated at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The viral supernatant was concentrated and firstly purified at 31,000 rpm through 5.5 ml of 20% (W/V) sucrose in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) for 2 h in a 70Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Optima™ L-100XP Preparative ultracentrifuge) at 4°C. Condensed and firstly purified virus pellet was then resuspended in TNE buffer and loaded on a preformed sucrose density gradient (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% W/V) in TNE buffer for further purification. After centrifugation at 24,100 rpm for 2 h at 4°C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Optima™ L-100XP Preparative ultracentrifuge), the purified virus band between 40%-50% sucrose gradient was collected, diluted in approximately 1 ml of TNE buffer, and finally centrifuged at 24,100 rpm for 2 h at 4°C in a SW41 rotor to exclude the residuary sucrose. In order to get high purified NDV particles, the collected banded viruses were purified for a second time according to the same purification procedure. The purified virus pellet was stored at −80°C for further use.
