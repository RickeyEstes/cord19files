This study incorporated a background literature review using Cinahl and Pubmed, a web-based survey of Masters of Public Health (MPH) prospecti to identify their modular provision, and a case study in Hong Kong. Concept analysis techniques were used to deconstruct the concept of competency in public health systematically, using the routinely available data on MPH educational provision (i.e. web-based prospecti) as a surrogate for public health education provision. To inform the analytical methodology, a PubMed search was used to identify academic frameworks that had been used for studies informed by concept analysis. This suggested that there were four main models or frameworks. [16] [17] [18] [19] In line with Botes' analysis of the limitations of concept analysis, a dual methodology, which incorporated both empirical investigation techniques (i.e. the web-based survey and data analysis) and a literature review, was used to enhance the quality of concept analysis and increase the reliability and validity of the study, 20 enabling a greater focus on the way in which support for the development of public health competency was 'operationalized' within MPH prospecti (Box 1). 18 A three-stage process was used to identify and map existing courses: identification of relevant MPH courses within overall postgraduate provision within the UK; identification of 'core modules' common to the majority of courses-theoretically, the 'generic' skills or competencies taught within universities; and mapping modular provision to the three domains of practice model to determine how MPH modular provision mapped against the operational framework for public health practice and competency development. At the time of the study (October 2005), the search strategy identified 1079 postgraduate courses, across 55 universities, which included 'public health' in their course description. Many of the courses identified were subsequently excluded as they only offered discrete modules on public health and were not primarily about public health, e.g. animal care and science degrees, with a total of 35 MPH courses identified by the research strategy. Inevitably, the eventual data-collection methodology, i.e. a web-based collection strategy for the module descriptions, had implications for the depth of information that was available on each of the modules. Whilst future studies could take a more detailed approach to this to validate the findings, the chosen methodology reflects consideration of the ethical justifiability of approaching universities for copies of their course prospecti for research and not enrolment purposes, and the time restraints involved in undertaking and submitting an MPH dissertation. The use of the Internet in research, although generally found to be valuable, raises particular concerns about the quality, authority and credibility of sources, as the ability to post on the Internet is unrestricted. 23 Whilst currency, in theory, is one area in which Internet resources have been found to have a potential advantage over print resources, 24 sites are often undated, with inconsistent updating of the links between the sites affecting the efficacy of the research tool.
