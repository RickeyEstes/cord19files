Coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks related terms from GT were collected from December 5 th , 2019 to February 8 th , 2020. These search terms represented the information search for COVID-19 and practice of personal hygiene in order to prevent disease transmission. Relative search volume (RSV) data were filtered by geographic regions in Taiwan. GT data then were compared with daily data on COVID-19 cases that were obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control' website. Moving average with interval of three days of GT queries and number of COVID-19 cases were put into chart to observe the trends along the period of observation. This moving average method used to facilitate the trends comparison among datasets. Time-lag correlation was utilized to assess whether J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the raised of GT data were correlated with the following increased of COVID-19 cases, as previously applied in other study (Shin et al., 2016) .
