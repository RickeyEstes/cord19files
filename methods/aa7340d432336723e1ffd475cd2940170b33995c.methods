After reviewing the epidemiology of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa that are commonly transmitted to humans through food, and which are included in FERG, we selected nine pathogens which commonly cause diarrhoea for inclusion in our study: Campylobacter Global spp., Cryptospordium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Giardia lamblia, norovirus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. We did not include Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), and Vibrio cholerae, diarrhoeal pathogens included in FERG, because the incidence and mortality of diseases caused by these agents have been estimated using different approaches and published elsewhere [15, 16] . Although some countries have published national incidence and mortality estimates for diseases caused by most of these nine pathogens, such estimates of foodborne diseases, which are considered to be the highest quality burden estimates for these diseases [17] , are only available from a limited number of countries. We therefore used two approaches to estimate the incidence and mortality of the diseases caused by the nine selected diarrhoeal pathogens, and applied one or the other approach in each country in the six regions. Approach 1 was applied to all countries in the European Region (EURO) and all other countries with overall low mortality as defined by WHO (http://www.who.int/choice/demography/mortality_strata/en/); approach 2 was applied to all remaining countries. Using these two approaches allowed us to utilize the highest quality available data in countries with overall low mortality which have similar sanitary and public health infrastructure and presumed incidence of foodborne diseases. The final results of the two approaches were merged in a last step to determine global estimates and estimates for the 6 regions.
