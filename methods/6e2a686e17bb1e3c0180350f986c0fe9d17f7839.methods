We undertook a search on Medline Complete regarding trials and reviews for antibody-based therapeutics in infectious diseases. The terms used in different combinations were as follows: 'therapeutic antibodies,' 'monoclonal' and 'infectious diseases,' as well as pathogen-specific terms. The results were limited to Englishlanguage reports and surveyed documents published from January 2008 to March 2018. Our methodology was further complemented by published official documents on anti-infective mAbs licensed to date by EU and US regulatory authorities. Some of the trials were identified through a search of the clinical trial registration platform ClinicalTrials.gov.
