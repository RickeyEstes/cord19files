Routine monitoring of airflow performance The airflow system performance of an operating theatre in the hospital was monitored regularly through observations and/or measurements of pressure gradient, flow pattern, temperature and humidity levels. To ensure sterility in the operating theatre, routine bacterial sampling using two types of plates [tryptone soy agar (TSA) and Sabouraud agar] was performed after each air duct cleansing and filter replacement. The plates were placed in three positions (i.e. high, low and at the air exhaust). The high position was located by the anaesthesia apparatus near the operating table, 2 m above floor level; the low position was located near the operating table, 1 m above floor level; and the air exhaust position was in front of either of the exhaust grilles. The SAS Super 100 Air Sampler (International Pbi, Milano, Italy) was used to obtain volumes of 500 L into two separate 55-mm culture plates of TSA (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and Sabouraud agar (bioMÃ©rieux, Marcy I' Etoile, France). The plates were incubated at 37 C and 30 C for two days and five days for bacterial and fungal counts, respectively. A colony count of less than 30 colony-forming units (CFU)/m 3 for the TSA agar and 3 CFU/m 3 for the Sabouraud agar was adopted as the acceptable standard in all operating theatres, but a more stringent standard was applied to the theatre using laminar airflow. 5 Theatre selection for negative pressure conversion Theatre 1 (OT-1) of the main operating suite was chosen for pressure conversion for two main reasons. Firstly, OT-1 was the furthest away from the other operating theatres, making isolation easier to accomplish. It minimized the risk of air from the corridor being contaminated as a result of traffic flow and then being drawn into the negative pressure operating theatre, which could be a risk for wound infection. Secondly, it had two free sidewalls that could accommodate the addition of a separate exhaust system, and had its own scrub area and a separate induction room that could be converted into a room for removal of contaminated clothing. The main feature of the negative pressure design, compared with the positive pressure design, was the incorporation of a much stronger low-level exhaust system. The exhaust air passed through a two-stage filtration system (prefilter plus High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter) before its final disposal via an exhaust air fan. In order to achieve the designated airflow criteria, an anteroom was constructed at the front end of the scrub and induction rooms leading to OT-1. All doors leading to these negative pressure rooms were made airtight and interlocking. The physical layout and the airflow specification of the negative pressure operating theatre suite are shown in Figure 2 . As OT-1 and OT-2 originally shared the same air conditioning system, a separate air conditioning system had to be built for OT-2 before the necessary changes were made to OT-1. Static pressure heads in OT-1 and in the adjacent rooms were monitored by differential pressure gauge measurements. Correct airflow velocities at the supply diffuser and exhaust grilles were checked by vane anemometer measurements. The airflow pattern was examined carefully using smoke tests. In order to gather more technical information for assessing the effectiveness of the present airflow system, the room air distribution before and after the conversion was examined through computer analysis.
