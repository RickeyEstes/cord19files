Materials and reagents. The P. purpurogenum Li-3that was used in this work was preserved in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCCNo.5446) for patent protection in China. The Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch was purchased from the Xinjiang Tianshan Pharmaceuticals Industry Co., Ltd., and the glycyrrhizin (purity ≥ 98%) was purchased from the Tongtian Biotech Co., Ltd. The liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritin apioside, and isoliquiritin apioside were self-purified to purities ≥ 98%. The β-glucuronidase that was used was purified using our previously reported method 29 . Other common analytical grade reagents were purchased commercially. Preparation of TEG. 100 g of rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch was cut into slices approximately 3 mm thick and mixed with deionized water three times (1 h for each time). The V: M ratios of deionized water and medical materials were 10, 8 and 6 for the first, second, and third time, respectively. The three extractions were mixed, vacuum and dried to produce 25 g of TEG that contained 7.3% GL. Separation of TFG, TTG and TSG. 25 g of TEG was dissolved in 250 ml of deionized water. In total, 90 mL of the solution was divided into 9 groups, and 10 ml of organic solution was added to each group and mixed by a magnetic stirrer. For each group, the pH was adjusted by acid and base to the desired pH value. After mixing, 10 ml of solution was transferred into a separatory funnel. The organic and aqueous phases were analysed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to determine the suitable extraction pH value. Then, the extraction solution was obtained to determine the conditions for reverse extraction. After separation, 80 ml of the solution was drawn from the organic layer and divided into 8 groups. For each group, 10 ml of double-distilled water was added, and the solutions were analysed by the method described above. Preparation of the TFG, TTG, and TSG. 15 g of TEG was dissolved in 150 ml of deionized water. The pH was adjusted to the desired value. (pH adjusted to 4), followed by the addition of 150 ml of organic solution. A total of 8.34 g of TSG was obtained from the solution in the lower layer. The top layer (the organic solution) was transferred to a new separatory funnel. The solution was adjusted again to desired pH value, and mixed with 150 ml of organic solution. A total of 1.26 g of TFG was isolated from the organic solution in the secondary top layer, and 3.99 g of TTG was isolated from the lower layer. The ratio of TFG:TTG: TSG was 3:10:22. Isolation of flavonoid compounds. The TEG was extracted three times from 5 kg of the dried roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch with ethanol. The extraction solution was vaporized in vacuo and then suspended in water. The pH was adjusted to the desired value. After adding organic solution, 112 g of TFG was obtained from the organic solution in the top layer. Then, two compounds were isolated from each of the three fractions by Sephadex-LH-20 and C18 chromatography. These six compounds (compounds I-VI) were identified using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), NMR and MS to be isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, and liquiritin apioside, respectively (Fig. 1b) .
