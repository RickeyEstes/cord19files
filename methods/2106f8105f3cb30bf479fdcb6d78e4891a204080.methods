Overexpression and purification of PmDAPIV. The periplasmic form of PmDAP IV was expressed and purified as described elsewhere 65 . A gene coding for PmDAP IV (residues 1-745) was cloned from a P. mexicana WO24 genomic DNA library by a cultivation plate assay based on DPP IV activity, the hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-Î²naphthylamide 7 . The PmDAP IV M12I mutant produced only the 82-kDa periplasmic form (residues 23-745) due to translation from Met1 and removal of the signal sequence (residues 1-22) 11 . The periplasmic form of PmDAP IV comprised 723 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular weight of 79981.58 and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.80. An E. coli JM109 (Takara Bio) transformant harbouring the full-length PmDAP IV M12I mutant sequence inserted into the pUC19 (Takara Bio) expression plasmid was used to produce the periplasmic form of PmDAP IV. Cells were grown in 2 x YT media at 310 K. Overproduction of PmDAP IV was performed by IPTG induction (final concentration, 0.1 mM) at an OD 600 of approximately 0.6. Sixteen hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 x g. The cells were disrupted using BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen), and the cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 x g for 30 min. PmDAP IV in the cell extract was purified using 35 to 70% ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic column chromatography using a 20-ml HiPrep 16/10 Butyl column (GE Healthcare), which was desalted using a 50-ml HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and finally subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography using a 1-ml Mono Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing PmDAP IV were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to 80 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (GE Healthcare). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay and a bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The column chromatography and other purification steps were performed at 298 K and 277 K, respectively.
