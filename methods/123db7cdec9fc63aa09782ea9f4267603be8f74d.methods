Immediately after this, amphiphilic polymer-DNA and aqueous buffer was added following the same protocol described above.

Anti-PD-L1-DNA conjugate linked through the "TCEP" strategy was loaded on DNA-scaffolded PLGA microparticles. PD-L1 overexpressed and wildtype K562 cells at 1 million/mL were respectively added with particles at 0.3 OD550 and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 o C, followed by cell nuclei staining with Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher #62249) and the imaging using the spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Yokogawa CSU-22).
