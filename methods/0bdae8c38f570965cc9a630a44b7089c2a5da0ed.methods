Cell culture and virus infection. PK15 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Subconfluent cultures of PK15 cells were starved without serum addition for 48 h for synchronization. Synchronized cells were mock infected or infected with PCV2 strain BJW 11 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of one 50% tissue culture infective dose units (TCID 50 ) per cell. After 1 h of virus adsorption, cells were treated with medium containing 5% FBS and harvested at the indicated times post-infection for cell cycle analysis and Western blotting. Antibodies. Rabbit, goat, or mouse antibodies against cyclin D1, cyclin E, phosphorylated-Rb (p-Rb) (Ser795), p21, β -actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako.
