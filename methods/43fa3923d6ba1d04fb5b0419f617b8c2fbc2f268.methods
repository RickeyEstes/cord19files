The study was conducted in Lagos State, South Western Nigeria, in June 2011. A quassi experimental, before and after study was done. Participants were DSNOs and assistant DSNOs of the 20 Local Governments in Lagos State. Training materials were received from the Lagos State Ministry of Health,World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Central Public Health Laboratory, Lagos. Pre-and posttests were conducted using questions developed for the purpose. Participants scores were categorised as fail (B50%) and pass (50% and above). The impact of the training was assessed by statistical evaluation of the pre-and posttests results. To quantify the impact of ESSENCE on PH activities, an evaluation of epidemiology business processes pre-and post-ESSENCE was conducted. Staff time, computer programs/ systems utilized and computational steps were compared for tasks within three quantifiable areas: visualization creation, report production and activities during PH responses. Visualizations included production of a map, chart, table and epidemic curve for the same data. Report production tested the ability to create nontextual documents with multiple graphics. Conducting ad hoc ED surveillance was compared between ESSENCE and e-mail/telephone methods. QI reviews were compared between ESSENCE and Merlin Analysis Tools. The number of software or systems requiring training, which were replaced by ESSENCE, was reviewed. Computational steps included page clicks, exporting/importing data between systems and data management. Testing was conducted by a single reviewer proficient in current systems performing the task a single time to completion. Time and computational steps were measured from the initiation of a task to the completion of a usable product and then averaged across the three quantifiable areas. We included patients with a diagnosis of influenza (ICD9 codes 487.0, 487.1, 487.8, 488.0 or a textual variant of 'influenza', excluding 'H. influenza'). We also focused on 2008 data exclusively, since at the time of the analysis, more recent CHARS data were unavailable. Of the 20 hospitals in King County, 10 provided admissions data in 2008, but data from only 9 hospitals were available in CHARS for comparison. For each of the 180 influenza hospitalizations identified by the PHSKC system, we manually attempted to find a matching record in CHARS according to hospital name, discharge month/ year, age, sex and zip code. We flagged all influenza admissions in the PHSKC system that did not have a matching record in CHARS. Next, we asked hospitals with unmatched records to reverse-identify patients and retrieve their medical charts for PHSKC review. FLR's competency is the ability to identify, analyze, index and aggregate user-generated content by collecting billions of testimonials from social networks. It utilizes cutting edge technologies for massive data aggregation and applies advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for continuous analyses, in order to convert this unstructured data into refined information. The insights gained can be used to support and enable better informed decision making processes, both for patients and healthcare providers. A query with the stringˆvomitˆ, or,ˆdiarrheaˆ, or,ˆgastroenter-itisˆ(VDG) was performed in the Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ES-SENCE) during a 7-day period surrounding the 10 Federal Holidays of each year of the quadrennial 2007Á2010. The count of ED patients during the 7-day period was compared to the count of a 28-day background by calculating a ratio between the 2 periods for both, the 4-year average and year-specific. The analysis was broken down by age groups (0Á4, 5Á17, 18Á64, 65 and plus and all-age). Database analysis was conducted using SAS 9.2. We performed simple pairwise correlation between signals using the longest period of mutual data availability, e.g., between convenient care data and patient advisory nurse data, we compared the period between April 2007 and August 2011. We also offset signals by up to 14 days in each direction to investigate whether there were lag relationships between them. Syndromic surveillance data from ED chief complaints were collected and analyzed from Ohio's syndromic surveillance application, EpiCenter for 2010Á2011. Because the term bath salts refers to a grouping of drugs, and the effects of ingestion or inhalation of these drugs can vary widely, a specific classifier was created to define ED visits related to bath salts. This classifier included many variations of the common street names for bath salts. Human exposure calls to the PCCs in Ohio related to use of bath salts were also collected and analyzed from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) during the same time period. These data were combined and a correlation analysis was performed, using SAS v 9.2 to evaluate the relationship between the two data types and to illustrate the trends in designer drug use for bath salts. Due to small daily counts of both ED visits and PCC exposure calls, the data were totaled by month for all time-series and correlation analyses. Bolivia, Brazil, India, Indonesia and Singapore were chosen for analysis based on data availability and adequate search volume. For each country, a univariate linear model was built by fitting a time series of the fraction of Google search query volume for specific dengue-related queries from that country against a 'gold standard' time series of dengue case counts for a time-frame within 2003Á2010. The specific combination of queries used was chosen to maximize model fit. Spurious spikes in the data were also removed prior to model fitting. The final models, fit using a training subset of the data, were cross-validated against both the overall dataset and a holdout subset of the data. All search queries were fully anonymized. This methodology is similar to the approach used to develop Google flu trends (3) . Predictive disease modeling attempts to exploit the complicated relationship between disease outbreaks and measurable environmental, biological, ecological and sociopolitical variables. Previous studies (3Á5) identified factors associated with dengue outbreaks such as: past cases, ambient temperature, precipitation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Southern Oscillation Index, sea surface temperature anomalies and socioeconomic factors. We obtained and preprocessed these variables to get one value per district per week. The epidemiological dengue fever case data used span 2001Á2009 and cover several districts in Loreto, Peru. We computed incidence rate per 1000 residents, enabling us to deal with significantly different population sizes in the different districts. The method predicts incidence rates 4 weeks in advance. We developed logistic regression (LR) models using part of the data set available. The second part, not previously used for model development, was used for testing. The ROC curve and positive predictive value (PPV) for the test set are shown in Fig. 1 . High specificity is easier to obtain than high sensitivity. The preliminary results are encouraging: when sensitivity is 0.375, we obtain a specificity of 0.987 and a PPV of 0.6. The strategy was to emulate a domain expert's use of ESSENCE by means of a BN whose inputs were outputs of alerting algorithms (1) applied to data streams chosen for specificity to acute illness in outpatient encounters, laboratory tests and prescribed medications in the chosen syndromes. Efforts were restricted to 5 syndrome groups seen as amenable to fusion of the ESSENCE sources: influenza-like illness, gastrointestinal, fever, rash and neurological. Major subtasks included modifying the ESSENCE chief complaint processor (2) for CAPER syndrome classification, selection and judicious use of fields in chemistry and microbiology test data, selection of generic code number (GCN) groups of prescribed medications, development and implementation of an algorithm testbed for the various streams to be fused and elicitation of domain expertise to design BNs for practical decision support. We derived and refined default alerting filters relevant to the monitor's purview, beginning with three jurisdictional levels: (1) facility; (2) facility group or station, including all clinics and divisions associated with a parent VA medical center; and (3) superuser, referring to routine system-wide monitors. The filters were based on the number of patients, statistical significance of alerts and a composite severity measure. This measure was derived from case-based criteria developed for the Department of Defense ESSENCE (2) and adapted by OPH epidemiologists for the VA population. These criteria are based on separate monitoring of evaluation\management codes for complex cases, OPH-selected procedure codes, 'bounce-backs' to an emergency setting, patient age distributions anomalous for a VA facility and extreme spikes; case disposition was not yet available. We tested candidate filters by tabulating alert rates and sensitivity to known outbreaks using 13 months of all-VA historical outpatient data. For the superuser, the filter required at least one severity factor among records composing an alert, at least 3 cases (5 for the common syndromes) and only p-values B 0.01. These restrictions were reduced in localized user filters. An ''alcohol'' syndrome was developed based on alcohol-related chief complaint keywords sensitive and specific to acute or chronic alcohol ED visits, and validated by an ICD-9 field. The data were aggregated by day from 2008 to 2010, by age and age group. These data were analyzed using general linear modeling (PROC GENMOD), a time trend analysis, and a temporal SaTScan using age groups. Potential time periods of interest were major holidays, days of week, and college start and end periods. We assume that the case-counts in the regions follow independent ZIP random variables with the same probability p of a structural zero. The ZIP model allows for additional flexibility when compared to the Poisson. When structural zeros occur, the ZIP model accounts, in average, for a reduction in the casecounts. The ZIP model allows for superdispersion or extra-Poisson variation, while the Poisson model often understimates the observed dispersion. Regarding the likelihood ratio test formulation for the ZIP model we describe our Scan-ZIP statistic considering (a) we know when a zero count is a structural one and (b) we do not know, for sure, whether or not a zero count is a structural one. For the latter case, the Scan-ZIP statistic is obtained through an EM procedure. We present our web-based technical framework designed with social network theory. Using cloud computing technology, user only needs internet to access our system and webpage, and database was built by Joomla Framework, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. National Health Insurance Database (NHID), which has over 98% Taiwan citizen coverage rate in 2009, and National Notifiable Reporting System (NNRS) were used to evaluate our system; data of syndrome groups by ICD-9CM codes from these two systems during 2009, with pandemic influenza, were first analyzed. During the period from early 2008 through mid-2009, representatives from many of the operational public health groups across the state worked together to identify the requirements necessary to support the improvement of outbreak management in New York. These requirements were prioritized by the project team and the highest level requirements were approved to begin the design and development of the Outbreak Management System (OMS). The system included the following features: creating a central outbreak incident to record incident level information, generating a unique identifier that can be shared across integrated applications to facilitate aggregated query and reporting capabilities with a common data set shared across the jurisdictions and program areas involved in an outbreak investigation and providing forms that are customizable for an outbreak but use standard sets of questions and a common vocabulary where possible. The OMS user guide and training were provided to those who will be using it to manage outbreak incidents. The IHS health database is distributed across the United States with most data maintained at 465 local care facilities. Among these 465 facilities, there are over 235 EHR deployments, using similar but separately maintained configurations of the IHS EHR. Data are entered into the EHR system as part of daily clinical care or transcribed from paper for results of clinical referrals or outside tests. We developed a surveillance system that identifies reportable cases, notifies providers and provides data to a dedicated national surveillance database. Cases are found using a locally deployed extension to the local data system that searches for a combination of ICD-9 codes, clinical data and laboratory data, based on Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definitions, on a nightly basis. Reports for situational awareness and response are made locally, regionally and nationally using an a priori established priority ranking of the public health importance of a case or outbreak. PyConTextKit's annotation lexicon can be derived from existing lexicons or ontologies and then used to extract concepts relevant to a particular domain or syndrome. In this case, the symptoms from the Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (3) and the Extended Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (ESSO) (4) have been imported into PyConTextKit. Users can create their own text classifier by porting concepts from ESSO and by adding new concepts. Concepts are ultimately mapped to standardized vocabularies like the Unified Medical Language System. PyConTextKit currently supports the following six features: view of documents to be annotated,management of a lexicon, document annotation using the lexicon,view of annotation results, document classification based on the annotations and summary statistics generation. PyConTextKit allows the user to manage a lexicon for extraction targets, such as symptoms. It also allows the user to manage a lexicon for modifiers, such as negation cues (e.g., 'no' and 'absence of') and temporality cues (e.g., 'history of'). The modifiers are applied to the targets by pyConTextKit during the annotation phase, and the user can determine the criteria for extraction of a target from a report based on the modifiers. For example, the user may only want to extract symptoms that occurred recently and not historically. The document classification feature identifies documents containing the targets and modifiers specified by the user. For instance, the user may want to identify documents with recent and nonnegated instances of respiratory symptoms and diagnoses. Finally, PyConTextKit also enables the user to view summary statistics such as the number of documents in the dataset meeting the specified criteria. If the application were run on a dataset involving patients from a particular population, for example, the user could view the number of patients meeting the criteria in that population. Taiwan's Mortality Information Regulations require medical institutions to report any mortality to DOH through the National Death Certificate System (NDCS) within 7 days after a death certification is issued. Automated data from the NDCS were daily submitted to TCDC by secure electronic transmission and processed and analyzed using SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). For each report, the underlying cause of death was determined by applying the World Health Organization classification principles (2) and searched for freetext traditional Chinese 'pneumonia', 'influenza', or 'flu' to identify P&I deaths. Reporting timeliness and completeness of this surveillance system was assessed by comparing reporting data with post-hoc mortality statistics for the year of 2008. We used an R-package 'surveillance' to detect aberrations in the P&I mortality weekly data (3) . Weekly electronic school attendance reports were received from the participating schools by short message service (SMS) or direct communication by phone to the central office of The Cambodian Children's Advocacy Foundation, Cambodia, a local nongovernmental organization for initial data processing. Absenteeism data were anonymized. Overall absenteeism data were weekly aggregated and sent to Hong Kong, via email for further analysis. We examined Twitter postings from the first 100 days of the Haitian cholera outbreak. Twitter is a microblogging service in which users can give information in 140 character length posts, 'Tweets'. We selected Tweets containing the word 'cholera' including those with the Twitter hashtag identifier ('#cholera'). Our search captured English, French and Spanish mentions of the word cholera. We define an outbreak as cholera incidence beyond an isolated case. Six countries in which cholera did or was suspected to have spread, and without endemic cholera, were examined: Canada, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Spain, USA and Venezuela. We first collected 'Twitter Updates' for each country, Tweets that came from users in a particular country, normalized by the number of Twitter users in the country. Second, we filtered Tweets in which the keyword cholera as well as a country's name was mentioned, 'Twitter Mentions'. Logistic models were constructed to analyze the relationship between volume of updates and mentions and the occurrence of a secondary cholera outbreak in the chosen countries. We evaluated our models through the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test and also by cross-validation with data from Puerto Rico, in which there was concern of a potential outbreak. For the 2010Á2011 influenza season, Spokane Regional Health District required hospitals to report any admissions with laboratory-confirmed influenza using traditional NC surveillance methods. Simultaneously, HIE records from four Spokane facilities were monitored for flu diagnoses (i.e., records with ICD9 487Á488 listed in the working or final diagnoses) and positive flu laboratory test results (including rapid antigen, DFA, culture or PCR). Records from the NC system and the HIE were matched using facility name, age, gender, county and admission date. The medical records of cases detected by the HIE but not reported through the NC system were evaluated to determine true case status. Sensitivity and PPV were calculated for each surveillance system. Timeliness, completeness and representativeness of records received through the HIE were evaluated against NC reporting. We designed an online survey that presented respondents with all the clinical concepts associated with each syndrome definition, and the question 'To what extent do you agree that the following concepts are potentially indicative of SYNDROME?' For each clinical concept, the respondent then indicated their agreement from 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree'. We publicized our survey through the ISDS Newsletter. When small area disease data in the form of counts are available, Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models are commonly used to describe the behavior of disease (5) . In this study, we use the convolution model (6) to describe the behavior of disease under endemic conditions. Each time new observations become available, we show how the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO, 7), which is a Bayesian diagnostic tool that detects unusual observations, can be adapted in a surveillance context to detect small areas of unusual disease aggregation (8) . For the joint analysis of two or more diseases, we introduce a generalization of the shared component model (9) where the underlying risk surface for each disease is separated into shared and disease-specific components. We then propose a multivariate extension of the surveillance CPO that incorporates information from the different diseases and, consequently, facilitates the outbreak detection work. The multivariate surveillance technique has the ability to detect outbreaks of disease in either one or in a combination of diseases. First, a set of syndromes in an existing JHU-APL CC parser used in civilian versions of ESSENCE were selected for evaluation. The CC parser was then used to categorize the ROV from 3 months of records from all DoD facilities (about 12 million records total). From the records matched to each syndrome, 2000 were selected; the 1000 most common strings and an additional 1000 strings at random. Two analysts evaluated the sample strings independently and identified key decisions they each used to decide whether the match between the text string and the syndrome was accurate. They then attempted to reconcile those cases where they disagreed. Unresolved differences were reviewed by a DoD consultant who offered revised rules based on clinical experience and known practice patterns among DoD providers. The modified rules were incorporated into the CC parser and tested on miniature data samples for accuracy, and then the CC parser was rerun on the full record set. The cycle of independent analysis and review was repeated with additional modifications to correct any remaining errors followed by a final full run. Before and after contingency tables were used to compare CCbased versus diagnosis-based classifications. The final product was a modified CC parser input file tailored for use with DoD ambulatory healthcare records. To achieve the objectives, the conference was structured to review the current state of biosurveillance, identify core components for a comprehensive capability and scientific and technical bases to support this capability and explore the critical improvements needed to enhance the existing regional and global disease outbreak prediction capabilities. Open discussion time was planned in order to engage broad participation during the conference to recommend approaches to establishing an effective international network, propose implementation strategies and the measures of effectiveness and identify the challenges that must be overcome in the next 3Á5 years in order to establish an initial biosurveillance capability that will have significant positive impact on biothreat nonproliferation, economy and public health. Declaration network: at the end of medical consultation, each medical staff member declares clinic signs of his patient using a numeric standardized form on computers (specific declaration software). They transmit this anonymous form to a data base located in a Military Surveillance Disease Centre in France. Analysis network: observed data are automatically compared with historical data every 10 minutes, using current past graph method (specific analysis software), to produce alarm signals. These signals have to be analysed by epidemiologists to confirm or not the real alert about outbreak occurrence. The ALR preserves the martingale structure of the regular likelihood ratio, which allows the determination of an upper limit for the false alarm rate, depending only on the quantity of evaluated cluster candidates. A fast computational algorithm incorporates this important property, determining the cutting point to control the false alarm rate, thus making a viable tool for the detection of emerging clusters in geographical maps, where the baseline of the number of cases has nonconstant average. The greater flexibility of the candidate clusters' shape produces a better estimation of the most likely cluster. However, the large cardinality of the set of candidate clusters is an obstacle for the application of the ALR procedures, generating function values so small that the alarm may not ring, even if an emerging cluster exists. To solve this problem, we propose the use of an adaptive approach also for the clusters' configuration space. We used a quasi-Poisson logistic regression model to analyze daily vaccination counts at Montréal's mass vaccination centers (MVC; n 018) before and after an automated phone campaign promoting pandemic vaccination in 13 of the city's 29 health districts. We then used a similar model to test a more mundane explanation for the considerable variation in daily use of MVC: that inclement weather and weekends deterred vaccination. As the written plan indicated, a MCPHD epidemiologist checked ESSENCE every 3 hours and sent updated numbers to the Emergency Operations Center three times a day via e-mail. The query used the following terms: 'ˆheatˆ, or,ˆdehydˆ,or,ˆhotˆ,andnot,ˆgunshotˆ'. This is one of several pieces of information used to guide decision making when considering opening additional cooling centers and creating press releases for the public. The BioSense Program monitored healthcare activity in 20 DoD facilities located in Japan from March 17 through April 11, 2011. In Japan-based outpatient DoD facilities, we monitored 10 health conditions, which are associated with injuries, and possible syndromic presentations of radiation exposure, which included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, hypotension, rash, convulsion, dyspnea, dizziness and anemia. We also searched for radiation exposure-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 990, 508.0, 558.1, E926 and E926.9. There was a 2-to 5-day lag time between the time of patient visit and time when ICD-9-CM-coded final diagnoses were available. To monitor healthcare utilization for potential adverse effects associated with KI exposure in the United States, we searched ED chief complaint (CC) data from all 635 nonfederal BioSense hospitals for the following keywords indicating a KI-related visit: (1) potas*, pottas*; (2) iodine, iodide; (3) KI; (4) radiation, radeation; (5) nuclea*; (6) Japan. A given ED visit was considered a match if the content of the CC met the following keyword inclusion criteria: 1 and 2, 3, 4 and 5 or 6. Perl Regular Expressions were used to take into account upper-and lowercase letters and word boundaries. CC data were updated within 0Á2 days following the visit date. To identify clusters of patient visits of interest, we used a modified version of the early aberration reporting system (EARS) C2 statistic (1) . For both surveillance efforts, this signal detection method was run upon the data for individual facilities. Additionally, visit data from all 20 DoD facilities were analyzed as a group. This study examines healthcare records, for the time period January 1, 2010ÁJune 30, 2011, from a North Carolina-based hospital system composed of three different hospitals for clusters of visits related to exposures. Visits were identified based upon the inclusion of terms in chief complaint data related to chemical, carbon monoxide, meningitis, food poisoning and other types of exposures. For each hospital, time series of visit counts from 1 hour cells, based on patient time-of-visit, were monitored using the past 60 days' cell counts as a baseline. Either a Poisson or a negative binomial distribution was assumed, depending on the baseline mean and variance for each hospital/hour cell. A p-value was calculated for the probability of at least as many visits as observed, and an alert was issued if this value was below 0.01, a threshold chosen to minimize the burden on the PHEs to investigate the alert. For comparison with traditional NC DETECT methods, we also applied Biosense's modified C2 algorithm (2) to the daily exposure-related visit counts for this study. Table 1 shows how C2 and TOA alerting are complementary at the 3 study hospitals. Line lists provide relevant information for each patient cluster. Table 2 gives an example of a TOA alert from a late morning cluster at a single hospital. The scope of our research included the following aims: (1) the development of a method for evaluating the completeness of laboratory data in the context of public health reporting; (2) measuring the completeness of laboratory data received from clinical information systems and an HIE using the method; and (3) comparing the completeness of the 'raw' data from clinical information systems (e.g., unaltered and unedited ELR messages) with the completeness of 'enhanced' data from the HIE (e.g., ELR messages having syntax corrected and concepts mapped to standard vocabularies). No off the shelf software was available that met local health department system requirements and budget constraints. Thus, a collaborative team of public health professionals and database programmers convened to establish a project charter that outlined the system requirements, personnel responsible, timeline and budget. A qualitative analysis of current county level systems and data helped to establish the requirements of the FITS system, as well as direct the reporting capabilities and features. The fixed budget expenditure and early deadline led to an expedited timeframe; the system was completed within 4 months. We pose a modified inference question: what is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected for the original observed cases map with a most likely cluster of size k, taking into account only those most likely clusters of size k found under null hypothesis for comparison? This question is especially important when the p-value computed by the usual inference process is near the alpha significance level, regarding the correctness of the decision based in this inference. In our novel approach, we use the previous VBScan recursively on the map with case-control point event data. At each recursive step, we compute two functions: (i) the likelihood ratio of the multiple components and (ii) the likelihood ratio increase since the previous step. As the first function always increases monotonically with every added component to the partition, the last function is used as a measure of the cost-benefit of adding a further region to the partition. This is done employing a multicriteria decision process, determining the nondominated partition solutions. Through Monte Carlo replications under null hypothesis, we compute the significance of the nondominated solutions and choose the best partition. We propose a novel method, the Geographical Dynamic Scan (GDScan) to find optimal connected clusters. It employs an adaptation of the NemhauserÁUllman algorithm for the 0Á1 knapsack problem (4). We minimize a biobjective vector function F(z)0((C(z),N(z)), where C(z) and N(z) are the number of cases and the population of the candidate cluster z, respectively. Then, we show that the solution which maximizes the spatial scan statistic is included in the set of nondominated solutions of F (the Pareto set), showing that the dynamic programming algorithm allows to solve the unconstrained maximization of the scan statistic for any given spatial dataset. However, this is typically not sufficient to solve practical spatial detection problems. The dynamic programming algorithm is thus modified to consider (i) a geographical proximity constraint and (ii) a connectivity constraint, for each region j. Assuming that the geographical proximity of a region j contains k regions, the geographical dynamic scan guarantees the optimal solution within the collection of 2ˆk subsets, searching for only a small number of subsets, which depends almost linearly on k, on average. We combine ordering-based approaches with the ALG structure to identify multiple clusters in case-control datasets, in a fivestep procedure. In the first step, we subdivide adaptively the domain into square cells (blue squares in Fig. 1 ), with controls (pink points) and cases (little dotted black squares). In the second step, the cell's ordering given by the Hilbert curve is used to sequentially join cells with the highest proportion of cases over controls. This produces loose groups of higher than average rates of disease. The adjacent groups thus formed are themselves united, according to certain criteria, into larger groups in the third step, forming the cluster candidates. In the fourth step, Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic is computed for each group, and the clusters are ranked. Finally the cases are randomized, and steps 1Á4 are repeated. That is done hundreds of times to compute the significance of each cluster. Only significant clusters are reported. An absenteeism reporting form was developed and placed on a NH DHHS website. Access to the reporting form website was through a secure NH Department of Education (DOE) web portal, and school nurses were asked to voluntarily report data into the system. The questionnaire asked for the number of students absent, the number of students absent for ILI, the number of staff absent and the number of staff absent for ILI in addition to the name of the reporting school ( Fig. 1 ). Data were exported and analyzed daily by NH DHHS staff using Microsoft Excel. School enrollment data for each school were provided by DOE so that rates of absenteeism could be calculated. Rates for overall absenteeism and absenteeism due to ILI were aggregated by school administrative unit (SAU) and posted on the NH DHHS website twice weekly in the form of a map. Schools reporting absenteeism greater than 10% for any given day were contacted to determine whether an ILI outbreak was occurring and to recommend control measures. Prior to ARRA 2009/Meaningful Use, KHA, KY CHFS and ETI created an electronic disease-reporting solution for hospitals and associated local public health. The Community Surveillance project operates in 3 population centers within Kentucky and provides real-time surveillance and disease reporting for up to 18 prevalent disease conditions across more than 20 provider locations and 6 provider organizations within the Northern Kentucky, Lexington/Fayette County and Louisville Metro communities. The software solution, ETI's HealthSIS, is able to accept meaningful use certified messaging, uncertified messaging formats and custom data streams for both reportable disease and syndromic surveillance information from a single stream within each provider location. The messaging stream used for identifying reportable or syndromic conditions is a copy of the content generated by normal hospital operations; specialized or additional data input is not required from health care provider staff. HealthSIS is configured to submit only data relevant to surveillance goals of the community from source systems; this configurable filtering capability allows for reduced resource requirements, reduced data management resources, and a manageable data set for analysis. Forty-six EDs, two major pharmacy chains, two poison control centers and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; through a pilot partnership), all contribute data to ESSENCE on a daily basis. Thirty-six separate SSH File Transfer Protocol (sFTP) data feeds are required to transfer and incorporate these data into ESSENCE. Beginning January 1, 2011, the web-based application developed by OIT was utilized on a daily basis to ensure that the transfer of data was monitored and recorded regularly. Each morning, an epidemiologist from OP&R logs into ESSENCE and verifies which data points have been consumed into the system. The presence or absence of each data point is then recorded in the data tracking application. An automated e-mail is generated that details which data sources are absent. This e-mail is sent to the OIT employees involved in the ESSENCE program, who then check the server to see if the data were transferred or if there was an error during the transfer and consumption process. The epidemiologists then contact each data source that failed to send the data on that particular day. We developed a web-based site placement calculator to aid public health officials in designing their surveillance system. We then compare the two algorithmic site placement schemes against each other by simulating the spread of influenza across the state of Iowa. Our simulations are based on an Iowa Medicaid dataset comprised two million cases classified with 30 different ILI ICD-9 codes and their corresponding geocodes from 2000 to 2008. We use the Huff Model (3) to determine whether or not a case might have been detected by a particular network of sites. Using this scheme, we compare surveillance networks based on outbreak intensity (i.e., which networks detect the highest percentage of cases) and outbreak timing (i.e., which networks detect cases temporally in sync with the true start, peak and end of the disease season). To compare network outbreak timing, we generate the noise parameters of a state space time series model using the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm implementation provided by Shumway and Stoffer (4). We then perform an analysis on which ICD-9 codes a network might consider. Data were analyzed from 900 RT-PCR-confirmed NoVoutbreaks extracted from a systematic review of articles published from 1993 to 2011, indexed under the terms 'norovirus' and 'outbreak'. SeventyÁfour variables were included in the database. We use the intensity function to visualize the plausibility of each area of some study map to belong to a possible cluster in the map. Fig. 1 presents the most likely cluster found by circular scan. Fig. 2 shows the intensity function. The intensity function map (Fig. 2) shows clearly that areas with the highest quantiles correspond ( Fig. 1 ) to areas belonging to the primary cluster detected by circular scan. But, the intensity function map also shows a significative number of areas (red color) with a high plausibility to belong to a possible real cluster and some areas (orange color) with intermediate to high intensity function values. The proposed model represents distributions of patient data (vitals, state and treatment) as a dynamic Bayesian network. The state of the patient is observed only when an alarm is triggered. The arity of the state variable is estimated from data via E-M optimization. The state and another discrete observable, treatment (a vector of administered medications), influence the continuous output variables that represent the vital signs. The vitals are segmented adaptively using a Kalman filter to reflect a potentially nonstationary periodicity of signals. The segmented vitals are then represented with a continuous Semihidden Markov Model. The trained system is capable of predicting the patient's state on-the-fly from currently observed vitals. It can also learn on-the-fly whenever user feedback is available in the form of correct labels of the predicted states. Data on influenza and pneumonia mortality were collected from 97 cities over 11 years (1996 through 2007), as reported in the MMWR (1). We used a novel method of computing the pairwise distance between two time series based on the Mahalanobis Distance derived from the time-series state-space-modeling framework. Mahalanobis Distance is a scale invariant form of Euclidean Distance that also takes correlations of the data set into account. This is an extension of a previously devised Kullback-Leibler Information-based time-series-clustering discrepancy measure (2) . All pairwise distances between cities were then used in a clustering procedure known as QT_Clust (3). This procedure was initially developed for the clustering of high dimensional genomic data. However, QT_Clust may be applied to many time-series-data sets where the trajectory rather than the process of a time series is of interest. A measure of cluster size and within-cluster distance is used to compare how geographically based influenza surveillance performs as opposed to nongeographically based surveillance. Based on the definition of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2), an updated definition of syndromic surveillance was developed, taking into account the evolution of syndromic surveillance in the past decade. Further, an inventory of syndromic surveillance systems in Europe has been started. To identify human syndromic surveillance systems, a literature review was first performed using Pubmed and Google, identifying 40 relevant publications. A brief questionnaire was sent to Triple-S partners, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and other contact persons to identify existing, past, pilot and planned systems in the different countries and the reference person for each system. The reference persons were then asked to complete a long online questionnaire for collecting detailed information (e.g., objectives, data sources, timeliness, statistical methods for outbreak detection, reporting tools and response measures). For the inventory of veterinary syndromic surveillance systems, a similar method was used. The brief questionnaire was sent to the European Food and Safety Agency (EFSA) focal points and chief veterinary officers of each Member State and to the members of the European College of Veterinary Public Health. Differently from the inventory of human systems, the veterinary inventory included mortality surveillance systems. Eight site-visits to existing systems are scheduled between June 2011 and May 2012, e.g., United Kingdom, France and Denmark/Sweden. Open to 6Á10 project partners and participants from all European countries, the visits offer an in-depth understanding of a variety of systems and facilitate knowledge transfer, through discussions on practical experiences with national and regional stakeholders (e.g., strengths and weaknesses of the systems, lessons learned from the operators and users and expectations of decision makers). The Triple-S project coordinated by the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) is divided into six work packages (WP). Three are horizontal managerial WP for coordination, dissemination and evaluation. The other three concern an inventory of existing systems (WP4), country visits (WP5) for knowledge exchange and a deeper understanding of a selected number of systems. WP4 and 5 will lead to the development of guidelines for implementing syndromic surveillance in Europe (WP6). The inventory will identify competent organizations and reference persons for animal and human syndromic systems in the European Union. A questionnaire will allow the collection of detailed characteristics of established, pilot and planned systems. The Triple-S consortium has adopted a proactive approach to stimulate knowledge exchange through eight country visits. We considered 3 models of authority: (1) (emerging topic detection) ETD uniform (i.e., equal weight); (2) ETD PageRank; and (3) bellwether. For 1 and 2, we built a directed graph of user activity, using thread coparticipation to define edges. Each EIN post was text tokenized, POS-tagged, and had stop words removed. We use a time window t 0 5 days to aggregate messages terms and a decay parameter d0 60 days. We identified emerging terms using an energy threshold approach, where emerging is defined as any term where energy! k*m energy over the interval t, where k is some constant; we used k 0 1.3. Any term identified as emerging that occurs in the postsubject line is flagged as important. For the bellwether model, we algorithmically selected 80 and 90 authors from the year prior to the one under analysis and flagged threads as important when one of those bellwethers participated in it. We also conducted 1000 random trials of selecting subsets of 80 users to follow. For evaluation, we used an annotated set of EIN threads identified as clinically important. We measured the total number of threads each authority model flagged for reading versus the number of actual important messages. We chose the following aspects of patient care to be included in the database form: presurgery patient condition and medications, anesthesia information, perfusion information, surgery information, recovery information, status of the patient at discharge and30 days and 365 days postsurgery follow-up information. Information was collected through structured questionnaire by trained data abstractor and entered into Microsoft Access software. On the basis of research hypotheses, specific data chunk was extracted and analyzed in SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Sciences) software. Impact in clinical practice Before this database, there was no way to monitor mortality and morbidity. Fortunately, with the development of database, postsurgery mortality and morbidity rates could easily be generated. It helped in development of strict enforcement of protocol to reduce the mortality and morbidity rates. It also helped in controlling preventable postsurgery complications. It also helps in identification of a gap inpatient knowledge regarding the use of warfarin after heart valve surgery and deficiencies in laboratory capabilities, both causing catastrophic complications. As a result, we modified our practice in an effort to address these issues and reduce the complication rates after heart valve surgery. Furthermore, identification of the need to quantify the midterm functional status of in-person and telephonic interview, resulting in the development of a questionnaire that has been added to our protocol 1-year postsurgery. Reusable procedures were created for MySQL TM (4) to load and transform standard EpiCenter TM data exports. Structured Query Language (SQL) statements process export file data elements to create: more granular temporal elements, category groupings to mirror daily activities and generalized lifestyles, categories based on spatial calculations and scores derived from the frequency of symptom and syndrome categories. Additional blocks of code were created in R TM (5) for automated analysis, visualization and reporting. The information graphics produced by R with enhanced biosurveillance data includes pivot tables, thematic maps, heatmaps, pictograms and charts. Edits of the code may be done with a text editor, and the local geographic coordinates of zip codes and hospital facilities can be obtained on the Internet. MCPHD and RI created a legal memorandum of understanding so that MCPHD could share the names and date of births of suspect cases to the programmers at RI. The alert went into effect in July of 2010. When a healthcare provider's search is also one of the suspected names, an alert appears on the screen informing the provider that this person should have a chest x-ray as part of a follow-up to a TB outbreak investigation. A phone number of a MCPHD nurse on call is provided. The suspect list is periodically updated to remove names of patients who have been located in other medical settings. The novel aspect of this system is that normal methods of locating these individual such as phone or address was not available. Additionally, other traditional public health methods to contact these patients had not proved successful. VHA administrative inpatient and outpatient datasets were queried separately for monthly occurrence of dengue and dengue-like diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM 061, 065.4, 066.3 and V73.5) in PR for Federal Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 to FY 2011 (up to August). Patients are unique within each FY and are counted at the first occurrence of the noted code(s). Wavelet time series analysis using the Morlet wavelet was performed to identify the presence and scale of periodic components in the inpatient and outpatient time series. Wavelet coherence analysis was subsequently carried out to determine the statistical association R(a,t) between the two time series at multiple periodic scales 'a' and time scales 't' (see equation). Finally, the phase lag between the two time series was determined by computing their phase difference as the ratio of the imaginary and real parts of the cross-spectrum of the two time series. Each of the infectious diseases that GUARDIAN monitors is modeled in GUARDIAN's knowledge base as a SNBN (1) of diagnostic features. Each model is developed through extensive literature review by infectious disease experts and encoded as a standardized probabilistic SNBN (2) . GUARDIAN uses these networks to rapidly assess each patient whose data are presented to the system. General model fitness is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The overall, threshold-independent, model quality is determined through analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (3) of each model using de-identified emergency department patients for the true negatives. To find the thresholds for each relative risk category, we use Gaussian decomposition (4) over the probability distribution of known negatives; known positives of other diseases; and known positives of confirmed, suspected and probable cases of the disease of interest. To tune the SNBN model parameters for a particular healthcare facility, we use a hill-climbing algorithm (5) over known positives from literature and a sample of patients (negative and, if available, positive) from that healthcare facility. The hillclimbing algorithm uses the 10-fold cross-validation area under the ROC curve as the metric to optimize. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted August 1, 2009, to July 31, 2011, in the emergency department of an academic medical center. The sample consisted of 2661 patients who received a nasopharyngeal swab followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for respiratory viruses. Geographic Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time for Disease Identification and Alert Notification (GUARDIAN)*a syndrome surveillance program*was utilized to review patients' records and detect the presence or absence of 37 influenza-associated symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhea, myalgias, headache and nausea among others) including reported and measured fever, cough and sore throat. Demographic factors such as age groups and gender were included in the analysis. Descriptive and x 2 test were used to determine a subset of significant signs and symptoms. A binary logistic regression with backward selection option was employed to further narrow down significant symptoms. BTA profile development consisted of the following steps. Step 1: Literature scans for BTAs: articles found in a literature review on BTAs that met predefined criteria were reviewed by multiple researchers to independently extract BTA-related data including physical and clinical symptoms, epidemiology, incubation period, laboratory findings, radiological findings and diagnosis (confirmed, probable or suspected). Step 2: Data analysis and transformation: articles were randomly divided, taking into account reported diagnosis and sample size, to generate detection (75% of articles), and testing (25% of articles) profiles. Statistical approaches such as combining frequencies, weighted mean, pooled variance, min of min and max of max were utilized for combining the data from articles to generate the profiles. Step 3: Missing data analysis: based on generated statistical and clinical judgment, specific reasonable assumptions about the missing values for each element (i.e., always reported, never reported, representative and conditionally independent) were applied to the profile. Imputed case analysis (ICA) strategies (1) used these data assumptions to fill in missing data in each metaanalysis of the summary data. Step 4: Translation: the generated profiles and synthetic positive BTA cases were reviewed (via clinical filters and physician reviews) and programmed into GUARDIAN. Step 5: Prior probability determination: using archived, historical patient data, the probabilities associated with each element of the profile were determined for the general (non-BTA) patient population. Step 6: Validation and testing: multiple mutually exclusive samples of ED cases along with synthetic/real positive BTA cases were utilized to perform 10-fold cross-validation as well as testing to generate statistical measures such as positive predicted value, negative predicted value, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for each BTA. To demonstrate the applicability and usability of BTA methodology, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was chosen since differentiating SARS symptoms from regular influenza is difficult and presents challenges for even robust surveillance systems. Daily response rates over time were analyzed to determine whether enhancements to surveillance produced any improvement in participation by EDs. During the timeframe used for the study, the total number of EDs varied due to facility closures and reorganizations and, therefore, daily response was measured by using the percentage of facilities responding each day versus the actual number.  We used Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) services to experiment with cloud computing for syndromic surveillance. We applied two cloud service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). Our first goal was to apply cloud computing technologies in order to reduce computational time needed for syndromic analyses. Scan statistics, due to their reliance on Monte Carlo simulation to find confidence levels, are particularly well suited to being improved by parallel computation. We used the R package DCluster to calculate scan statistics and combined that with the SNOW (Simple Network of Workstations) package. We also experimented with using cloud computing to parallelize the AMOEBA approach to cluster detection. Our second goal was to determine the practicality of easing the barrier of software complexity. To that end, we created software packages that include data import, analysis and visual presentation of results and released them as freely available virtual machines, or images, for the public to use. The GeoViz Toolkit was one of the software packages delivered in this manner (Fig. 1) . A/TCHHSD uses two syndromic surveillance systems: (1) Realtime Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system* utilizes chief complaint data from emergency department visits in 14 Austin Metro area hospitals; and (2) National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM)* utilizes OTC medications sales data. ATCEMS has an automated system to track the types of calls to EMS and transport to area hospitals. All three systems also provide data on patient age, sex, home zip code and receiving hospital. Information on the use of syndromic surveillance and EMS systems for each natural disaster (ice, extreme heat and fire) will be presented. Each case study will provide information on: (1) salient features of the natural disaster; (2) rationale for the type(s) of surveillance resources employed; (3) data analysis; (4) results; (5) data dissemination; (6) advantages and limitations; (7) lessons learned; and (8) process improvements. Argus reports meeting the following inclusion criteria were reviewed: (1) entities: E. coli and food/crop contamination, (2) location: Germany and the European Union (EU), (3) time period: MayÁJuly 2011. The reports were reviewed for relevant I&W with the primary goal of identifying factors that inhibited effective control of the outbreak and resulted in public health infrastructure strain. Geospatial visualizations of the Argus outbreak reports were created as the event unfolded. PHSS analysts from 40 public health agencies that contribute syndromic data to the ISDS Distribute project were asked to take an online survey. The survey, developed in consultation with state-and locallevel syndromic surveillance experts and implemented using SurveyMonkey † , consisted of 15 questions, which were crafted to obtain data in four areas: (1) basic system design and coverage; (2) CC data formatting and classification practices; (3) CC data use; and (4) impact of codifying CC on PHSS capabilities. Participants had 2 weeks to complete the survey. ISDS staff contacted nonrespondents to encourage participation 7 and 3 days before the end of the survey period. Qualitative survey data from open-ended questions were reviewed and grouped into themes or categories. Weekly case numbers were obtained from CDESS and counted patients with Shigella who had diagnosis or specimen collection dated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Six statistical models were applied to the weekly case numbers in generating signals to identify outbreaks, and signals were compared to the actual outbreak to evaluate their detection powers. Outbreak-related cases from CDESS were removed for the modeling purpose except for the cumulative sum-related methods, which used all cases. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to evaluate the performance of each method. General Linear method (GL) Yt0a'abi ct; i; i01 . . . 52; where Yt is the expected number of cases in week t, ct,i is the dummy value which equals 1 if the week of the year for Yt is the same as i, else it equals 0. Senior management of the major programmatic areas within OPH including, Communicable and Chronic Disease, Family Health, HIV/AIDS, Environmental Health and Wadsworth Center Laboratory, identified representatives to participate in PHIM-WG. Informatics, information technology (IT) and information management (IM) literature was reviewed to determine a framework upon which to build the strategy (1). Words and concepts with multiple interpretations were identified and agreed-upon definitions were used for planning discussion. An assessment of the as-is and desired state formed the basis of the strategic objectives and destinations. A community-balanced scorecard (CBSC) approach (2), grounded in the Public Health Accreditation Board Essential Services (PHAB-ES), is being used to guide the development of a strategic plan, to include performance metrics. Electronic ED chief complaints (CC) from January 1, 2011, to April 10, 2011. were queried from eight EDs within an 11-mile radius of Skid Row. Only visitors with resident zip codes that corresponded to Skid Row or that were blank to account for homelessness were included. Visits were reviewed if CC included keywords based on common meningitis symptoms and also those of confirmed cases. Coroner deaths from the same time period were reviewed for location of death and homeless status. Real-time LA City emergency dispatch calls were also reviewed if they were made from the same homeless shelter in which the two confirmed cases resided. We leveraged the Electronic medical record Support for Public Health (ESP) surveillance platform to create a chronic disease surveillance module. ESP is an open source software (esphealth.org) that reads structured EHR data, analyzes them for events of public health interest and communicates findings to public health agencies. We created algorithms to identify diabetes types using a combination of diagnosis codes, laboratory tests and medication prescriptions. We then applied these algorithms to the ESP installation in Atrius Health, a multisite, ambulatory practice with over 700,000 patients. We programmed ESP to create patient level linelists each night that detail patients' demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity and zip code), vitals (body mass index, blood pressure and pregnancy status), key laboratories (hemoglobin A1C and cholesterol levels), diabetes type and care (medications and medical nutrition counseling). De-identified linelists are transmitted nightly to a secure website called the 'RiskScape' that automatically maps selected health indicators and stratifies results by age group, race/ethnicity, year of diagnosis and body mass index. Users can customize indicators and stratifications displayed by RiskScape. A multivariate dynamic linear time series model was fitted to data on influenza-like illness (ILI) rates among networks of public and private general practitioners and school absenteeism rates, plus drop-in fever count data from designated flu clinics (DFC) that were created during the pandemic. The data streams were assumed to follow an underlying latent process with local linear trend. The estimated level and trend of the latent process reflect the magnitude and direction of influenza activity, which are then combined to infer an overall influenza activity index. Correlations between the estimated influenza level from the model and laboratory isolation rate were calculated to assess its performance before and during the 2009 pandemic. A new, unique event code was created for staff of all 57 regional PCs to use for coding calls related to this incident. This enabled CDC and AAPCC to track incident-related information requests and exposure calls using NPDS. Calls involving either information requests or reported exposures to radiation, potassium iodide and other iodide-containing products were identified, reviewed and tabulated daily. For each exposure call, individual PCs were then contacted by AAPCC officials to obtain additional data not uploaded to NPDS. CDC epidemiologists and toxicologists reviewed these data daily using set criteria to determine if a true exposure had occurred. Aggregate NPDS data were reported daily to CDC's Emergency Operations Center leadership to enhance situational awareness. We assessed destination information from the EDN system for immigrants and refugees arriving during 2009 and 2010 with TB disease (Class A TB with waiver) or a radiographic TB without positive smear or culture for TB (Class B1), or LTBI (Class B2), or contact with a TB case. The destination information was mapped with ArcGIS software to the county level and aggregated at the national level. Data were categorized by region according to the 10 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) regions (5) . Since the change of location after arrival can be entered into the EDN system by the health department, this information was assessed for the system's ability to provide secondary migration information. Dynamic social networks for the Boston area (4.1 million individuals) were constructed based on data for individuals, locations and activity patterns collected from the real world. We modeled a full season of endemic influenza-like illnesses (ILI), healthcare seeking behavior and a surveillance system for outpatient visits. The resulting in silico surveillance data contain the demographics and complete history of disease progression for all individuals in the population; those who are in a specified surveillance system create a data stream of ILI visits. Outbreaks of influenza are artificially inserted into this surveillance data. Outbreak detection using space-and-time scan statistics was used to analyze the background with and without the inserted outbreaks. The performance of the algorithm was assessed under different levels of coverage and catchment distributions. One hundred unique baseline data sets were generated. Twelve artificial outbreaks were inserted in each. Six different surveillance system designs were assessed. With the proliferation of social networks, the web has become a warehouse of patient discussions and reports, estimated at 10 billion records and growing at a rate of 40 percent per year. These reports are spread across more than 150,000 (and growing) English-language sites, forums and blogs. FLR has searched and mapped thousands of these sites and indexed hundreds of millions of posts (currently 800M) and is engaged in refining statistical methods of signal detection that enables investigation of health trends. FLR can look at large samples and discover small changes, such as drug side effects, which may not be discovered by other means for years. We selected a series of providers using NYC DOHMH's EHR network, from which we could obtain practice characteristics (i.e., number of patient visits, type of practice and age distribution) and evaluation score developed to rate a practice's ability to use EHRs. We then set up an electronic template at each practice and scheduled the transmission of a report with de-identified patient characteristics and patient counts. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from each patient presenting with ILI to test for influenza subtypes including influenza A (H1, H3 and H1N1) and influenza B by RT-PCR. Samples negative for influenza were tested for other respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and adenovirus by RT-PCR by Luminex. We analyzed the data for completeness to evaluate the success of electronic surveillance. We also compared the data by gender, age group, symptoms as well as evaluated virus frequency over time. To generate potentially informative events from vital signs, we first segment each data channel into sequences of k consecutive measurements. We then perform Fourier transformation to obtain spectral profiles of each segment of raw signal. Multiple spectral profiles, extracted from periods of observation that are considered medically benign, are then assembled to form a kdimensional flat table. We apply principal component analysis to this, and the top p components are considered further. These p components form a null space model of the expected normal behavior of the given vital sign. We build one null space model for each channel separately; this concludes the learning stage of the process. Each newly observed set of k consecutive measurements is then processed through Fourier transform and projected onto the p principal components of the corresponding null space models. Over time of observation, these projections produce p time series per measurement channel. We apply a cumulative sum (CuSum) control chart to each of these time series and mark the time stamps at which CuSum alerts are raised. These moments correspond to circumstances in which the observed spectral decomposition of a vital sign does not match what is expected. We consider each such event as potentially informative of near-future deteriorations in the patient's health status. We quantify the predictive utility of each type of these automatically extracted events using training data, which contain actual health alerts, in addition to the vital signs data. To accomplish the task, we perform an exhaustive search across all pairs of CuSum event types (inputs) and alert types (outputs) and identify pairs with high values of the lift statistic (2). Input-output pairs with lifts significantly greater than 1.0 can be expected to enable prediction of health status alerts. Fig. 1 depicts an example result obtained with the presented method. The CuSum Events (green spikes) obtained for the 9th principal component of Modified Chest Lead 1 (MCL1) signal, and the alerts (red spikes) are critical apnea conditions. We can see that, for this patient, the CuSum events most of the time precede apnea alerts, and they can potentially be used to predict an upcoming apneas. We implemented a system that builds upon existing technologies and services. The open source platform Ushahidi (2) was used to automatically search for content. An initial query report was generated from Twitter, includes username, content and timestamp. The city of each user was extracted from their profile and a query to GoogleMaps gave us the coordinates. At the end, this new information was uploaded to Ushahidi. We used the keyword 'gripa' (Spanish for flu) and scheduled hourly updates of the search. This project will investigate tools that can be used to support ingestion and translation of public health meaningful use data in the HL7 formats. Open source tools, such as Mirth, have been identified as early candidates to support this function. After the necessary translations have been made, this project will investigate transfer methods to move the meaningful use data from a public health department to a cloud environment. With data available in the cloud, the project will then investigate methods for putting the ESSENCE system in a cloud environment as well. This will provide the collaborative team a platform to evaluate the utility of both the meaningful use data and potentially the value of having regional and national data sharing aspects available to the public health users. Finally, the team will determine the scalability and performance of a cloud environment for disseminating these tools to other jurisdictions across the country. After reviewing presentations and participating in many discussions at conferences and with public health officials, a number of topics were identified that many believe use or are standards. These topics included HL7, syndrome definitions, analytical algorithms definitions and the definition of what is or is not a disease surveillance system. Next, the common understandings of each were compiled and compared with actual definitions and real world experiences from users of the standards. From this, a list of misunderstandings or poorly communicated aspects of each topic was derived. We created a timeline of events, such as a particular partner's need (Florida Department of Health's desire to detect outbreaks based on patient time of arrival) or a public health outbreak (SARS) and correlated each one with design and architecture decisions that influenced ESSENCE. We used these events to describe the epidemiology, technology, analytical, administrative, political, legal and monetary factors that were considered at each point. Looking historically and critically at each decision point, we analyzed the benefits and costs of each decision. These benefits and costs were described from many different points of view, including those of the developer, user, administrator and others. After walking through the historical timeline, we described the current architecture and feature set of ESSENCE. We also were able to point out the unique features between different instances of ESSENCE. Based on user feedback, understanding outside influences and internal research, the ESSENCE team is always looking to improve the system. Part of this presentation will be to describe the future plans for the ESSENCE system from both architecture and feature stand points. For this demonstration, we selected one disease for which we currently perform routine outpatient/ED ESSENCE surveillance (influenza) and one HAI of interest [C. difficile infection (CDI)]. First, we queried VA Inpatient ESSENCE for hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis code (ICD-9: 487, 488). These data were compared to CDC's AHDRA hospitalizations, a voluntarily reporting system for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations. Second, we queried VA Inpatient ESSENCE for hospitalizations with the CDI diagnosis code (ICD-9: 008.45) as well as total monthly discharges. Monthly rates for CDI were then calculated per 1000 total discharges. CDI rate per 100,000 population for FY 2010 was calculated using the total enrollees in VA Health Care in FY 2010 (8.343 million) as the denominator. Previous analysis from a non-VA hospital demonstrated good correlation between the CDI code and positive toxin assay (2) . An evaluative study on all 28 district hospital laboratories in all regions of Malawi. The data are routine quarterly assessments covering from October 2009 to April 2011. The main focus was on performance of culture procedures, drug sensitivity testing practice, documentation and demand and use of drug sensitivity results by clinicians. The intervention and two control groups will include subjects from the at-risk groups in the Samarqand region. In all three groups, the selection of study subjects will be done from nonbrucella-related visits to primary care centers by at-risk patients with no previous history of brucella. At-risk subjects within the intervention and first control group will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their awareness about brucellosis, specifically about its clinical presentation and risk for exposure in people. At-risk subjects in the second control group will not receive any questionnaire. The educational intervention procedures will consist of briefings to a group of healthcare professionals, delivered through BTRP regular training events, together with printed materials to be explained by the physicians to patients in the intervention group. The briefings and materials will show practical ways of preventing the spread of brucellosis targeted at common practices within the atrisk groups. The seasonality of the disease in endemic regions like Samarqand dictates that the best timing for the intervention program is in the fall (SeptÁDec), before lambing season (FebÁJun). Our measurable outcome is the number of newly acquired human brucellosis cases among the three study groups registered after the intervention. Registration of brucellosis cases will follow existing protocols within the Uzbek healthcare system. Additionally, the questionnaire administered to the intervention and one control group will provide an insight of the baseline awareness about the disease. Adequate sample size and analysis of the data will allow comparisons between the three study groups and between strata within the groups, e.g., veterinarians and farmers. The control group not exposed to the questionnaire will allow an assessment of the impact of possible increased awareness as a result of our interventions. Information on established syndromic surveillance systems was collected from peer-reviewed articles (found in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar), proceedings from all ISDS Conferences and other conferences and searches through reference lists of papers. In addition, web pages of international health organizations, surveillance networks and Ministries of Health were explored. Identified syndromic surveillance systems were categorized by country, resource level and surveillance methodology, among other features. Eight systems were selected and examined in detail to extract transferable information. Arrest records were obtained from the University of Iowa Police Department containing all alcohol-related citations from January 1, 2004 to June 26, 2011. As the University of Iowa Police Department is one of the 4 local law enforcement agencies (Iowa City Police, Coralville Police and Johnson County Sheriff), these 7002 records represent a sample of alcoholrelated arrests, albeit one focused on the downtown bar area frequented by college students. Each record contains the date of the arrest as well as the age and home address of the offender, allowing us to compare 'in town' offenders (i.e., from within Iowa City, Coralville and transients) with 'out of town' offenders. Records corresponding to football Saturdays, where some 50,000 people come to Iowa City to tailgate and attend the Big10 football game, were excluded from the analysis as not representative of the usual bar culture. A total of 1490 alcoholrelated arrest records remained in the analysis. A Fisher's exact test was used to test the hypothesis of whether the proportion of arrests of out of town patrons versus in town patrons is independent of the under 21 ordinance. We established a network of sentinel clinic and hospital sites along the geographical United StatesÁMexico border region. We utilized a shared syndromic case definition that is compatible between both countries. Standardized data collection instruments allows for exchange of surveillance data. We increased the laboratory capacity for to test for diseases of public health importance. After conceptualizing and designing the toolset architecture, we gathered objective data to calculate indicators using a systematic approach from published reports; articles from peer-reviewed journals; and websites of international organizations and national Ministries in each country. We also interviewed stakeholders. Indicators were weighted to reflect the level of impact on elements and domains, and standardized baselines were established to uniformly measure outcomes. Outcomes for each element and domain were then calculated based on the weighted, indicator data. Based on donor-funded global health projects, systems requirements were gathered and existing mobile systems were evaluated for use in surveillance in low-resource settings. In advance of the tools evaluation, literature reviews were performed, and informatics experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and various global nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and associations were consulted and then recommendations were formulated. Systems were evaluated based on minimum requirements, which included maturity, usage, scalability, interoperability, functional features related to data collection and attributes that enable country ownership and generate high data quality. We develop a theoretical model that incorporates the two channels through which screening may reduce prevalence. The model is based on a hospital composed of N treatment units (e.g., ICU and ER) divided into n DUs, that transfer patients between one another and an outside population. Disease prevalence in each DU is determined by an SIS model based on the multi-institutional framework of Smith, et al. (1, 2) . A DU's prevalence is a function of its own screening level (s) and that of their neighbors (š). We develop a cost structure similar to Armbruster and Brandeau that incorporates the various costs to screen for and treat a disease. (3) Given these costs, a single DU chooses the screening level that minimizes its net present value of discounted future costs. We solve for the symmetric, pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. We used data from the MMWR. It contains weekly syphilis counts per state. We consider the time period from 1995 to 2009. We removed week 53 when present, due to inconsistencies in reporting. We considered 53 locations: the 50 states plus Puerto Rico, and the cities of New York City and Washington DC. To predict disease activity in each state, we constructed a series of linear lagged regression models that used several states as covariates. To benchmark our models, we constructed a basic ARIMA model with one autocorrelation term. All the models were constructed to forecast 4 weeks in advance. Prediction at week t was performed by fitting the models using all past data prior to week tÁ4. To identify bellwether states, we proceeded as follows. First, we repeatedly fitted 2-covariate models to forecast each state and obtained the top 5 most frequent bellwether states for each state. Then, we obtained the most frequent bellwether states from the above lists. Argus reports meeting the following inclusion criteria were selected retrospectively: (1) disease: plague, (2) location: Peru, (3) time period: AprilÁOctober 2010. The reports were reviewed for relevant I&W of plague infection, with the goal of identifying factors that contributed to disease spread and ineffective public health response. Eight hospitals currently submit syndromic surveillance ED data to Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NeDHHS), representing approximately 18% of all ED visits for the state. Five hospitals reported complete data for the selected study period, June 1, 2010ÁAugust 10, 2011. The three hospitals not reporting complete data for the study period were excluded. These records represent approximately 15% of all ED visits in the state for JuneÁAugust. Cases of heat-related illness were identifiedusing ICD9CM diagnostic and external cause of injury codes: 992, 705.1, 708.2 and E900. Additional cases were identified from the chief complaint field using the SAS INDEX function to locate the following words within the text field: 'HEAT', 'HEATED', 'DEHYDRATED' and 'HYPERTHERMIA'. Each record returned from these searches was examined to confirm the presence of heat illness. Chief complaint fields containing keywords but not involving heat-related illness, i.e., 'applied heat to swollen ankle', were eliminated. with heat-related ED vists were 55% male (n 0273) with a median age of 34 years. Further analyses will assess correlation between heat index and heat illness in Nebraska. We propose a new approach to detect emerging patterns of keywords in the chief complaint data. Our semantic scan statistic has three steps: automatically inferring a set of topics (probability distributions over words) from the data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (2), classifying each chief complaint to the most likely topic, and then performing a spatial scan using the case counts for each topic. We compare three variants of the semantic scan: static (topics are learned from historical data and do not change from day to day), dynamic (topics are recalculated each day using the most recent two weeks of data) and incremental (not only using the static topics but also learning additional 'emerging' topics that differ substantially from the static topics). We develop a stochastic compartment model for disease populations consisting of susceptible (S), infected (I), recovered (R) and deceased (D) individuals. This model contains four parameters determining the rates of these transitions: S 0I, I0R, I0D and S 0R (vaccination). While all vaccination and death transitions are observed completely, the infected and recovered transitions are observed through sampling possibly with a delay between the transition and when the information can be used in a decision. Sequential inference of parameters is performed using Bayesian updating, which is available in closed form when independent gamma priors are assumed, and the current system state is known. For the two sampled transitions, the associated parameters are updated in a manner that is consistent with how information is gained during sampling so that the rate of information gain is proportional to the sampling rate. A cost structure is developed to weigh the outbreak morbidity and mortality versus the cost of active outbreak control (isolation, vaccination and increased sampling). The morbidity cost is quadratic to account for increased costs that occur when many individuals are sick simultaneously. Control costs include fixed and running costs, which are a function of the current number of infected individuals (3) . The effect of recovered sampling and delay is primarily assessed by running separate scenarios that have combinations of sampling and delay and calculating the average outbreak cost under these scenarios. In addition, allowing recovered sampling in a control allowed analysis of how often and when the optimal outbreak management utilized this sampling. Data were extracted from the weekly Zimbabwe cholera epidemiological bulletins available in the World Health Organization's Zimbabwe cholera epidemiological bulletin archive (2) . The focus of the data collection was on the tables titled 'Distribution of Measles IgM Positive by Age group and District of residence', which typically contained both cumulative and new cases of IgM-confirmed measles cases by district and age categories. Although not entirely consistent, the age categories were younger than 9 months, 9Á11 months, 1Á4 years, 5Á14 years, and 14 years and older. The statistical software R (3) was used for data cleaning (an extensive process) and exploratory analysis. The maptools package (4) was used to generate maps of the geographical disease progression. Fig. 1A provides an example time series for the cumulativeconfirmed measles cases in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, where all age categories have been combined. Indicated in green is the mass vaccination campaign that took place between May 24 and June 2. Fig. 1B provides an example map displaying the geographical distribution of confirmed measles cases upon extinction of the outbreak. The darker color indicates a higher attack rate (number of confirmed cases divided by total population); the darkest red area is Harare. We developed a web-based evacuation site surveillance system with 8 syndromes including acute gastroenteric symptoms; influenza or influenza-like-illness; acute respiratory symptoms other than influenza; rash and fever; neurologic symptoms including tetanus, meningitis and encephalitis; cutaneous symptoms; wound-related infectious diseases; icterus and death. Age of the patients was classified into three categories: younger than 5 years, 5 to 64 years and 65 years old or older. Analysis by evacuation site was performed automatically, and if some aberrations were found, the system showed an alert sign on the screen of a computer. The information on patients was shared with the public health center and the local government office simultaneously. Six jurisdictions provided 4 years of baseline ED data using a common ILI definition comprising 3 subsyndrome components defined by a formal code-set (Fig. 1) . Distribute sites were invited to participate in the assessment based on geography, jurisdiction size and ED coverage. Invited sites were asked to provide historical data consisting of total and ILI-related daily visit counts by age group ( B2, 2Á4, 5Á17, 18Á44, 45Á64 and 65' years). The common ILI syndrome and subsyndrome case definitions for the pilot were defined from coded or free text ED patient electronic chief complaint data as 'fever and cough', 'fever and sore throat', and 'flu'. Evaluation included comparison of syndrome time-series, subsyndrome and age-specific distribution of visits and signal-to-noise measures. The Distribute project began in 2006 as a distributed, syndromic surveillance effort networking state and local health departments to share aggregate ED based influenza-like illness (ILI) syndrome data (4) . The AGE pilot was conducted to assess the feasibility of generalizing the Distribute model from ILI trends to monitoring other syndromes. Distribute participating jurisdictions were asked to submit diarrheal and vomiting AGE syndrome ED data, following a commonly used syndrome definition. Of the 10 Distribute participating jurisdictions that submitted AGE data, 6 provided historical baseline data going back to January 2006 or earlier. Of these, 3 were state, 3 large city or county jurisdictions, located in Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern and Western U.S. surveillance regions. Syndrome time-series ratios [(weekly AGE syndrome count)/ (total ED visit count)] were assessed by jurisdiction and age group. To aid comparison of seasonal trends across jurisdictions, time-series were normalized around their baseline as a measure of relative increase [(weekly AGE ratio)/(weekly lowerquartile)]. Rotavirus vaccine 2006 pre-and postlicensure periods were compared. Gossamer combines work on (1) methods for automated surveillance based on summarized clinical data, such as the influenza and visit counts used in the Distribute project (1), (2) methods developed for the modularization of surveillance processes developed for the Shoki project (2), (3) methods developed for the automated processing of Health Information Exchange data (HIE) as part of the CDC HIE initiative (3) and (4) standard industry server virtualization and deployment techniques (4). The Distribute system was initially designed to share 4 syndromes (broad and narrow ILI, and GI syndromes). To reduce barriers to entry, the Distribute project does not impose strict syndrome definitions. This lack of standardization introduces variability between jurisdictions and a pilot has been undertaken to compare sites with preferred definitions and to develop a common ILI definition. To enable the addition of a common syndrome considerable modifications to the structure of the Distribute system were required. The approach taken allowed for the use of arbitrary indicators and stratification ranges. The Gossamer system uses a similar data storage architecture to that of the current version of Distribute, though Gossamer is more modular and better able to use external services. These features make it useful for moving beyond specific political structures or disease content areas. University of Washington together with the ISDS has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the data being received by Distribute, primarily using visual methods, examining data quality characteristics within and between sites. This process included basic exploratory analysis of data quality problems and analytical analysis of specific aspects of data quality, including the relationship between timeliness, completion and accuracy. The University of Washington together with the ISDS has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the data being received by Distribute, primarily using visual methods, examining data quality characteristics within and between sites. Several visualization tools were developed to assist in analyzing and characterizing data quality patterns for each site: upload pattern graphs (Fig. 1) , stacked lag histograms and arrays of lagged time series graphs. Upload pattern graphs are heat maps comparing upload dates with encounter dates (an example figure is given below for three sites). Stacked lag histograms provide a succinct view of the complete distribution of data timeliness for a particular site. Arrays of lagged time series graphs provide an in-depth look at how timeliness patterns manifest in time series graphs. Implementation of the latter two visualizations required implementing a specific database architecture to enable reconstruction of the data at any prior upload date. During the U.S. response to the Haiti Earthquake in January 2010, patient demographic and clinical treatment data were collected by ESF-8 responders through the EMR. Data were collected throughout the patient experience during registration, triage, treatment and discharge. Inclusion criteria for encounter records in the main analysis were entered into the EMR between January 18, 2010, and February 22, 2010, encounter occurred at one of the HHS sites in Haiti and data downloaded no later than February 23, 2010. Data were then analyzed in order to identify potential emerging conditions and operational medical needs during the entire response. We identified those discharged from any MA hospital during the H1N1 pandemic in the Hospital Discharge Database (HDD) with ICD-9 diagnosis codes correlating highly with positive viral specimens (1). Using five-digit zip codes as an identifier, we linked census data to the HDD population to provide a measure of SES indicator through aggregate levels of affluence. We used random-effects multivariate logistic regression models to explore the above objectives. Results 9737 individuals met inclusion criteria, and 1529 individuals (16%) were admitted to the ICU. Hispanics had the lowest rates of ICU stay (11% Hispanics in the ICU had the highest length of stay (8.1 days), the youngest mean age (26 years), nearly a third (32%) were B18 years, 52% were from the lowest SES group, and 58% were female (Table 1) . Differences between race/ethnic groups and SES exist (Table 1) . Results from multivariate regressions indicate that Hispanics are at 27% lower risk for ICU stay compared to Whites (OR 00.73, p B0.001*data not shown). We used spatial clustering based on reported HIV cases acquired through IDU and sexual transmission from 1994 to 2009 in the smallest administrative units (called Radas) in the rural territory of the Odessa region, Ukraine. For the formal spatial clustering, we used Kulldolf Spatial Statistics, realized in the SatScan program. Clustering was conducted by the Poisson model. We used the circle window and set the cluster size limit empirically at 15% of the at-risk population. The study was done in clusters with high RR. Visualization was carried out on QuantumGIS. OHA developed a recruitment packet to provide information to hospital Chief Executive Officers, Chief Information Officers, Infection Preventionists, Meaningful Use coordinators and IT staff. The packets will be distributed in a number of ways: primarily, during face-to-face meetings with hospital and public health stakeholders, and also during other forums such as meetings of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems as well as broader Meaningful Use seminars. Recruitment folders include a brief overview of syndromic surveillance and the ESSENCE system (Welcome to Oregon ESSENCE); a description of utility (Oregon ESSENCE: Real-time Data for Public Health Action); a list of the requested variables (Oregon ESSENCE Data Fact Sheet); examples of effective uses of ESSENCE (ESSENCE success stories); a visual diagram of the data flow process (Oregon ESSENCE data flow); and a list of action steps to begin participation (Let's Roll). OPC facilitated OHA access to the NPDS web service, which OHA could use free of charge. Access to the web service consisted of requesting approval from the local poison center and adhering to an NPDS web service data use agreement between OPC and OHA. We use FileMaker, a commercial off the shelf database application, to automatically query the NPDS web service on a daily basis. The queried data are then automatically sent from a local database temporarily storing the information to the ESSENCE servers. OHA already uses FileMaker for managing notifiable conditions data (i.e., communicable disease reporting); so, there were no new licensing costs associated with this method. This study is a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of ED vs. urgent care utilization rates for ILI in the greater Madison area from October 2009 to December 2009. The proportion of ILI encounters was calculated for two university-based urgent care centers (grouped) and compared with the ED data from the same university-based system. Proportions were calculated from ICD-9 and total daily encounter volume data. Our search methodology includes searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL and IEEE conference proceedings databases to provide coverage across a literature that is found in many disciplines and is not well-indexed. As the term 'smart home' is not well-defined, our search terms also include 'telemedicine', 'telehealth', 'e-health', 'health monitoring', 'gerontechnology' and 'gerotechnology' in combination with 'older adult', 'elderly', 'aging', 'ageing', 'community-dwelling' and 'senior'. Our inclusion criteria include any study that describes a technology designed for an older adult audience to support wellness management through social, spiritual, physical or cognitive means (4). Our exclusion criteria include smart homes designed for efficiency and nonhealth-related surveillance technologies. The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) syndromic surveillance system receives information from ED visits from all 10 acute care hospitals in Boston every 24 hours. Data received include visit date, demographics, ZIP code of residence, chief complaints and ICD-9 CM-coded final diagnosis. Disposition information was reported from 9 of these hospitals in 2010. BPHC collaborated with CDC's BioSense Program to specify a BRI syndromic case definition that combined chief complaint and ICD-9 CM-coded information and excluded motor cycle only related events. Subsyndromes were used to assess the type of injury and severity based upon 47 standard BioSense subsyndromes and 21 subsyndromes developed for this study. The data sample used for this study included over 2 million visits between 2007 and 2010. Injury visits were categorized at the neighborhood level using a standard ZIP code of residenceto-neighborhood mapping. Results were stratified by age, patient neighborhood of residence, race/ethnicity, gender and disposition (2010 data only). Several NC DETECT animal bite-related reports were developed based on chief complaint and triage note keyword searches and ICD-9-CM codes. Using the Animal Bite Keyword Report, statewide ED visit data were extracted for 2008Á2010. ED visit records in NC DETECT were examined manually to assess the performance of case definition keywords. Using the Animal Bite ICD-9-CM Code Report, statewide ED visit data were extracted for 2008Á2010. The following ICD-9-CM injury codes are included in this report: E906.0 (dog bite), E906.1 (rat bite), E906.3 (bite of other animal except arthropod) and E906.5 (bite by unspecified animal). The burden of ICD-9-CMÁcoded animal bite visits to total ED visits was examined by age group and gender. Daily text-based chief complaint data, March 23ÁMay 5, 2011, from 15 syndromic sites were obtained from EpiCenter (2) (funds provided by Utah Department of Health), mapped to 5 MLI syndromes (Table 1 ) and summarized using the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) (3) . Events of interest included all 'rash' events that contributed to an alert or had a concerning chief complaint (e.g., eye pain), all 'febrile rash' events that had a concerning chief complaint, all 'prodrome' events that had a concerning chief complaint, all 'case definition' events April 7, 2011 onward (date after which public health intervention was still possible) and all 'measles/testing' events. Visit notes, laboratory tests and results were obtained daily for each event of interest and reviewed for MLI. Summary findings, including diagnoses, laboratory results, rash descriptions and suspect exposures, were documented and non-MLI events were ruled out. Events of high suspicion for measles were further investigated via patient interview by phone and/or home visit. A retrospective design was used to evaluate clinical records for a predictive model of lab-confirmed influenza. Children who presented to the ED at Seattle Children's Hospital between January 1, 2001 and May 31, 2005 were eligible for inclusion in the study. The accuracy of four syndrome definitions were compared for identifying lab-confirmed influenza: (1) ILI from chief complaint (CC) or diagnoses codes (''ILI''); (2) ILI from CC alone; (3) febrile illness from CC or diagnoses (''Febrile''); and (4) febrile illness from CC alone. We evaluated syndrome validity over two distinct time periods: (1) the ''discrete'' 2003Á04 influenza season, which had relatively less co-circulation of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compared to most years, and (2) the ''concomitant'' 2000Á05 influenza seasons (excluding 2003Á04), when influenza and RSV co-circulation was high. Analyses during the concomitant years were further stratified by age B5 years and ]5 years. Multiple imputation was used to address missing viral lab results. The imputation model was based on testing guidelines in place at the hospital during the time of study. Forty-six EDs, two major pharmacy chains, two poison control centers and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (through a pilot partnership), all contribute data to ESSENCE on a daily basis. Data reported from June 1, 2009, through January 1, 2011, were used to examine the relationships between ED visits for ILI and antiviral (M2 inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors) prescription medication transactions in the state of Maryland. ArcGIS 9.2 was used to spatially evaluate these relationships. Data for the total population of Maryland by jurisdiction were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2010 PL94-171 release and prepared by the Maryland Department of Planning, Projections and Data Analysis/State Data Center, April 2011. Evaluation was conducted through electronic telecommunication with the disease control staff of the D/M HOs and checking of websites and S-R electronic bulletins. Poster presentation at the ISDS 10th Annual Conference 2011. Ontario's 36 public health units, the provincial ministry of health and federal public health agency completed a web survey in 2010 to identify surveillance systems used routinely and during the pandemic and to describe the perceived utility of systems for monitoring pandemic activity and informing decision making. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to elucidate drivers for specific public health actions taken during the pandemic and, specifically, to understand the role syndromic data played in influencing decisions among those who had access. Using HM's English-language global infectious disease database events (3), we identified expected periods of decreased reporting of infectious disease due to newsroom constraints between July 1, 2008, and August 31, 2011. Crowdout events were defined as averaging greater than five events per day for at least 2 weeks, plus making up at least 50% of daily events. Meeting these criteria were H1N1/swine flu (two instances), Haiti's cholera epidemic, 2010, and the E.coli outbreak in Germany, 2011. The December holiday period, when most of the newsroom is off duty, was also tested. We examined whether the average number of noncrowdout events differed significantly from the average daily HM events at baseline, defined as similarly structured periods without holidays or high-profile epidemic events. Baselines were measured before and after the crowdout period, plus during the same time period in other applicable years. Means were compared using paired t tests with unequal variances. A total of 52 case-seeking reports were posted on Epi-X during calendar year 2010, all of which were used to seek cases of infectious disease. Epi-X staff were successful in eliciting contributor feedback in regards to 30 of these reports. Four questions were asked that assessed the motivation behind posting a case-seeking report on Epi-X, the practicality of posting a case-seeking report on Epi-X, the successfulness of finding related cases by posting a case-seeking report on Epi-X and if the contributor intends to use Epi-X for this purpose in the future. Ten health centers and one hospital were randomly selected; 13 weeks were also selected randomly from the year 2009. The reporting process was reviewed in the three levels for the number of reported cases of HAV in the selected weeks: the peripheral level by reviewing the reporting forms, notifiable logbooks of the reporting sites; the intermediate level in the health directorate by reviewing the specific notification forms(SNF) from each reporting site, and the comprehensive forms from all reporting sites; and the central level by reviewing the electronic and paper reporting to the communicable diseases directorate. Sixty-eight million geocoded entries (tweets and check-ins) from 3.2 million users were collected from the Twitter streaming API for the period from September 11, 2010 through January 28, 2011. The Twitter API provides a random sample of tweets; nongeocoded tweets or tweets originating from outside the United States were discarded. In addition, users with fewer than 6 records, or those who check in too frequently (more than once in 5 seconds) or travel too quickly (faster than 1800 km/hr) were removed to exclude automated bots or other location spam. We generated a list of the 179 most commonly used drugs in the United States in 2008 based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Using this list of drugs, we consulted MicroMedex, a drug database, for information regarding possible ADEs for each drug. Next, we then obtained search volume data from Google Insight for all possible pairs of drugs and ADEs. Using a set of searches restricted to only the known ADEs for a given drug, we coded each ADE as either common or other as listed by MicroMedex. Based on this categorization, we conducted a Wilcoxon two-sample signed rank test. Finally, we constructed a negative binomial model to explain the number of ADEs found by Google Insights. The total number of detected ADEs was modeled using the number of common ADEs in MicroMedex, the number of other ADEs in Micro-Medex and the number of prescriptions for the drug based on 2008 data from MEPS as covariates. A second list of 149 drugs with REMS was obtained from the FDA and search volume as collected for each of the drugs. We fit a generalized linear model to the data starting 1 year before and ending 1 year after the initial REMS approval date. The model included a dummy variable indicating if the month occurred before or after the initial approval of the REMS. The interaction between this variable and the time covariate was used to determine if the REMS had any impact on interest as measured by search volume. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, record reviews and surveillance data analysis were conducted at the District Surveillance Units (DSUs), Primary Health Centers(PHCs)and Health Subcenters (HSCs). Five out of the 23 districts were selected for the evaluation using a probability proportion to size sampling strategy. Six PHCs were selected randomly from each of these 5 districts and 1 HSC was selected randomly from each of the PHCs. A total of 30 PHCs and HSCs were visited for evaluation. Several U.S. anthrax infections have been identified since the 2001 Amerithrax attacks. These cases were investigated by a number of local, state and federal agencies, and most were subsequently associated with exposure to imported animal hides contaminated with anthrax spores of natural origin (5Á7). Each incident presented a unique diagnostic challenge since all three forms of the disease (inhalation, cutaneous and gastrointestinal) were identified. All of the cases were reviewed to determine which laboratory and surveillance systems were used to first identify possible cases and the number of days required to confirm the diagnosis of anthrax. The role of syndromic surveillance and other advanced surveillance systems in identifying these cases and searching for additional cases was evaluated. Efforts to coordinate surveillance and communication efforts among the various jurisdictions involved in the investigation of these cases were also noted. Our solution builds on the GraphScan (1) and Linear Time Subset Scan (LTSS) (2) approaches, comparing the most anomalous subsets detected with and without the graph constraints. We consider a large set of potential graph structures and efficiently compute the highest-scoring connected subgraph for each graph structure and each training example using GraphScan. We normalize each score by dividing by the maximum unconstrained subset score for that training example (computed efficiently using LTSS). We then compute the mean normalized score averaged over all training examples. If a given graph is close to the true underlying structure, then its maximum constrained score will be close to the maximum unconstrained score for many training examples, while if the graph is missing essential connections, then the maximum constrained score given that structure will be much lower than the maximum unconstrained score. Any graph with a large number of edges will also score close to the maximum unconstrained score. Thus, we compare the mean normalized score of a given graph structure to the distribution of mean normalized scores for random graphs with the same number of edges and choose the graph structure with the most significant score given this distribution. Freely available RSS feeds from official sources, such as organizations dedicated to ending the illegal wildlife trade to include TRAFFIC, WildAid and the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT), were used to obtain information on illegal wildlife and wildlife product confiscations. In addition, information was obtained from freely available, disparate Internet sources (including discussion forums, mailing lists, news media outlets and blogs) by utilizing specific keyword search strings. For a 1-year period beginning August 1, 2010, English-language reports were collected on the illegal wildlife trade and interception points were analyzed (Fig. 1 ). When available, the origin and intended destinations of illegal wildlife products were also collected to aid in the development of proposed wildlife trade routes and hot-spot regions. Lastly, a comprehensive list of commonly traded species was compiled along with the potential zoonotic diseases that could be spread from traded animals to humans. In Connecticut, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Giardia, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio and Yersinia are laboratory reportable findings. Aggregate hospital admissions data are reported daily by all hospitals. Facility and community GI outbreaks are also reportable events. Weekly percentage of HEDSS GI syndrome visits (combined GI, vomiting, diarrhea and bloody diarrhea) were compared to the number of GI hospital admissions, number of facility and community GI outbreaks and reportable enteric diseases using correlation coefficients. GI syndrome ED visits were also examined by geographical region and age. Asthma admission records in London (2001Á2006) were used. Negative binomial regression was used to model the effect of demographic (sex, age & ethnic group), diagnostic (primary & secondary diagnosis, method of admission) and temporal (day of the week, meteorological season & year of admission) factors on the LOS, accounting for the random effects of each patient's attendance, as model 'I' and again for area of residence, model 'A'. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the two models. For a given local neighborhood with center location s c and size k, we place a bonus or penalty^i0h(1 Á 2d i /r) on each location s i , where d i is that location's distance from the center, r is the neighborhood radius and h is a constant representing the strength of the compactness constraint. Each^i can be interpreted as the prior log-odds that s i will be affected, and thus the center location (d i 00,^i 0h) is e h times as likely as its (k ( 1)th nearest neighbor (d i 0r,^i0(h). We demonstrate that the penalized score function F'(S) 0F(S)'Ss i # S^i can be efficiently maximized over all subsets S for each neighborhood. To do so, we show that F(S) can be written as an additive function (sum over locations) conditioned on the relative risk in region S, and therefore F'(S) is additive given the risk as well. We then jointly maximize F?(S) over all subsets S and all values of the risk. The NACCHO Advanced Practice Centers (APC) Program is a network of local health departments whose mission is to promote innovative and practical solutions that enhance the capabilities of all local health departments and the public health system to prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies. Real world practice situations are supported and evaluated, resulting in the creation of tools designed to export and scale roll outs of lessons learned to other jurisdictions. Syndromic surveillance data from ED visits were collected and analyzed from Ohio's syndromic surveillance application, Epi-Center, for July 2011. Since the physical effects of HRI can vary greatly and affect multiple body systems, a specific classifier was created to query ED visits that were likely related to HRI and was defined as chief complaints referencing heat 'exhaustion or exposure', dehydration or hyperthermia. Measurements for weather variables included temperature, dew point, humidity, pressure and wind speed. The average daily values of these variables were calculated from seven geographically representative cities in Ohio and used as a surrogate for statewide data. These data were obtained from Weather Underground, which collects data from Automated Surface Observations System (ASOS) stations located at airports throughout the United States. These data were analyzed via time-series analyses and stratified by age group and gender. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed, using SAS v 9.2 to determine which weather variables were the best predictors of HRI, as defined by ED chief complaint data. In 2011, NH DPHS initiated a project with Orion Health to build a Rhapsody integration engine (1) portal to receive the three types of Public Health data. A Syndromic surveillance pilot was chosen since 25 of 26 hospitals were already sending real-time data in HL7 format to the statewide syndromic surveillance system. NH DPHS collaborated with the NH Regional Extension Center (REC) to host MU guidance and brokered with Orion Health, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), and CMS to offer hospitals the option to use a modular certification for MU public health measures by selecting the Orion Health module (2) . Selecting this module allows hospitals to send data to the NH DPHS Rhapsody portal in whatever format they choose; then, the NH DPHS Rhapsody system converts these messages to the approved ONC standards for public health reporting. Orion Health contractors set up the Rhapsody server, configured data routes and built validation, filtering, and mapping logic. Mapping to HL7 2.5.1 was performed, but additional mapping to 2.3.1 was done before sending data to the syndromic surveillance application. Hospitals were directed to reroute data transmissions to the new Rhapsody VPN IP address and port, and Rhapsody was configured to pass traffic to the original surveillance application address and port. Additionally, data was sent through the normal VPN connection to compare the accuracy and performance of the new path. NH's surveillance consists of assessing individual but compatible surveillance systems for (1) rapid detection of a covert bioterrorism attack and (2) early detection of naturally occurring outbreaks (i.e., influenza). The OTC pharmaceutical system was implemented with automated data processing and alerting within an enterprise architecture. Modified Shewhart charting was developed with dynamic system modeling using a knowledge base technique. Community health status was charted with a set of state syndrome variables and dynamic processes, where baselines, thresholds, trend analysis and alerts from historic data were automatically charted (1). This technical framework was implemented in STEMS with OTC data, school absentee data and occupational health data, then later in AHEDD. The AHEDD system also used the Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance CoCo chief complaint classifier with electronic data feeds from four hospitals. AHEDD was later expanded to include drill down custom querying for all 26 acute care hospitals (allowing NH to realize statewide ED surveillance). Over time, custom querying included data mining techniques adapted from the death data application, (2) to detect narrowly defined chief complaint health conditions and cluster activity. This together with a 'Google'-like query tool allow NH surveillance staff to quickly assess any situation. Recently, a single portal infrastructure, based on AHEDD, was created to receive all external syndromic surveillance, Electronic Lab Reporting and immunization transmissions, helping hospital partners meet Meaningful Use (MU), which paves the way for integration with a statewide Health Information Exchange. Self-reported survey data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was analyzed. Because the relationship between ILI and influenza infection is strongest during the influenza season, we limited the study sample to adults aged 65 years and older who participated between January and March 2010 (N035,628). We adjusted for three categories of individual-level factors: sociodemographics, health behaviors, and history of chronic disease diagnoses. We used stratified, weighted multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between receipt of the influenza vaccine in the past year and report of ILI in the past month via adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Using CDC data for syphilis, we construct county-level syphilis distribution maps for NC and Florida and time series (1990-2010) of spatial distributions of syphilis for Florida. Additionally, for comparison, we construct county-level (from 2004 to 2010) and state-level (from 1995 to 2010) syphilis distribution time series. We review studies on document classification using machine learning for event-based biosurveillance and comparatively summarize them for close examination. Table 1 lists relevant studies we identified. These studies differ in target regions, languages, event types and surveillance criteria, as well as classification methods. This diversity illustrates the complementarity of all the approaches. We utilized all ED visit data for 2008Á2009 from the state public health surveillance system (3), accounting for 99.5% of the visits to North Carolina EDs. Included were visits with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for asthma (493.xx) in any Dx position (1Á11). We then grouped asthma visits into 11 strata based on the Dx position containing the asthma code. We identified the most frequent chief complaint and primary Dx categories for each of the 11 asthma Dx positions. We also grouped procedure codes (ICDÁ9ÁCM and CPT) for potential asthma (e.g., nebulized medications) and cardiac (e.g., electrocardiogram) conditions for each Dx position. Results 350,341 (4.0%) of the 8.7 million ED visits had a diagnosis of asthma in 1 of the 11 Dx positions. The most common chief complaints for visits with asthma were: Dx positions 1 and 2-dyspnea and asthma, and Dx positions 3Á5-injury. 69,877 (19.9%) of the asthma visits had at least 1 procedure code assigned, those with asthma or cardiac procedure code are shown in Fig. 1 . Data requesters must use the ED data in NC DETECT for public health-focused studies. Data requests from commercial entities are not approved. The data request process occurs primarily via paper and e-mail, although we have implemented a centralized tracking system to store all documentation for data requests and track changes to them over time. To initiate the process, requesters view a presentation on https://www.ncdetect. org/ReportsPortal/public/dataRequest.do and then enter information on the study purpose, the researchers involved, any grants covering the research and the specific data requested* specifically the data elements, time frame and file format. Researchers must get approval from their home institution's Institutional Review Board and sign a Data Use Agreement (DUA) with NC DPH. The DUA outlines data use requirements such as securing the data during the study, presenting data in aggregate form only (in a manner in which an individual cannot be identified), sharing materials with NC DPH prior to presentation or publication and destroying data upon completion of the study. Data requests within NC DPH typically do not require a DUA and are exempt from this process. In addition, researchers who need to determine the feasibility of a study before submitting a full data request can go through an exploratory process that requires a DUA but no IRB. While data requests are ongoing, a small Data Oversight Committee (DOC) meets once monthly to review these requests and to discuss status and outstanding issues. The NC DETECT DOC includes representatives from the NCDPH, CCHI, NC Hospital Association (NCHA) and DPH legal personnel (as needed). In collaboration with the Philippine National Epidemiology Center (NEC) and the Philippines-AFRIMS Virology Research Unit, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, the EDE program, which was developed by Johns Hopkins UniversityÁApplied Physics Lab, was introduced in the Philippines to augment the data analysis capability of the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) System. Reported significant increases in the number of suspect dengue cases/outbreaks at the municipality, provincial and regional level, which were reported to and investigated by NEC from July 1, 2011, to August 31, 2011, were used as a reference point. A defined period, 30 days prior to the date when the event was officially reported, was retrospectively analyzed. The day when an EDE alert was first triggered and the number of EDE alerts detected during this period were described. Since NEC analyzes data by morbidity week, municipalities that were detected to be above the NEC alert or epidemic threshold during a randomly selected morbidity week (week 31; reporting date of August 6, 2011) were compared with the number of EDE alerts triggered during the past 7 days before the report date of morbidity week 31. The data based on the activity of general practitioners were transmitted on week W and covered the consultations and home visits carried out by the general practitioners in the week W (1. These data were updated week by week according to the flow of repayments. The data received were aggregated, and no personal information was communicated. The thresholds corresponding to the statistical alarms for the weekly numbers of all consultations were based on a calculation using adapted versions of two historical methods (log-linear regression model of Farrington and historical limit method) and CUSUM methods. The surveillance period was spread over 134 weeks from week 1 of 2009 to week 29 of 2011. For the two historical methods, expected numbers of all consultations were calculated during these 134 weeks, using a training period of at least 3 years. A 95% confidence interval was calculated for each weekly expected number. A weekly count observed was considered significantly greater than the expected value if it was above the 95% upper confidence limit. For the CUSUM methods, only few weeks were necessary to calculate a one-sided positive cumulative sum. An alarm was obtained if this cumulative sum was greater than a fixed decision value. We have developed a web-based prototype of the cKASS system that allows individual users or collaborative communities to access the service anytime and anywhere, without a complex technical configuration process (Fig. 1) . Two types of databases are used to support cKASS. First, a relational database is used to store user information and KB descriptors(e.g., KB domain and status). Second, KBs are stored as RDF triples using triple store and queried using SPARQL, an RDF query language, with the Jena SDB (SPARQL database,) providing robust and scalable storage. Existing resources stored in standard RDF and OWL formats can be easily loaded into the triple store and used as a basis for constructing new syndrome definitions. The web interface is designed to support both individual and collaborative KB development. cKASS consists of two zones: The ADRS provides weekly condemn data to VS along with information on species and total number of animals slaughtered. June 2007ÁMay 2011 ADRS market swine data were grouped by three major swine production areas (basins) to (1) identify preoutbreak condemn baselines, (2) quantify differences in the 2010 and 2011 STB outbreaks and (3) ascertain the geographical extent of the outbreaks. In addition, a fourth basin was created representing the remainder of U.S. market swine slaughter plants. To identify critical weeks of anomalous condemns, a modification of the 'C3' version of the Early Aberration Reporting System was applied to the STB condemn series (2) . In addition to examining alerts by basin, the alerting algorithm was applied to individual plant data. Data processing was performed using SAS version 9.1 and an Excel-based 'Alerting Algorithms Tool' developed and published by Dr. Howard Burkom (3) . We collected structured self-reported data about hypoglycemia and related harms using a software application called TuAnalyze that supports SN-mediated health research (2) . Odds for harms were estimated controlling for demographics, diabetes type and health insurance. An H1N1 influenza outbreak was identified at a Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA)-sponsored conference in Baltimore, MD, in July 2009 in which affected VBA employees (both local and from out-of-town) sought healthcare at the VA Maryland Health Care System*Baltimore Medical Center. Using ESSENCE, daily counts of ICD-9 codes related to influenza diagnoses (as defined by VA ESSENCE influenzalike illness [ILI] syndrome group) were collected from the VHA Baltimore Medical Center from March 01, 2009, to September 12, 2009 . Data included case status (as defined by ICD-9 code and chart review), date and location of visit and patients' zip code of residence. We also accessed data from the VA Planning System and Support Group to determine whether the patients' residential ZIP code fell within the Baltimore VA Medical Center's catchment area. Using SAS, a p-chart (where the denominator was the daily number of patient ILI encounters) was run to determine days during which an aberrant proportion of patients from out-of-catchment zip codes were encountered. All acute care hospitals in Kentucky were invited to participate in the project. A case of sCAP was defined as a patient admitted to an ICU with the physician diagnosis of CAP. Upon patient identification, demographic and clinical characteristics were entered into an Internet-based data collection form. All patients had a nasopharyngeal swab sent to the University of Louisville Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory for identification of viral pathogens. The Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel multiplex PCR was used for viral identification. Clinical cultures were utilized to identify bacterial and fungal causes of sCAP. Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts were used to identify outbreaks. Chloropleth maps were used for spatial analysis. Each analytical mechanism was provided in real-time via the study website. We first identified a list of the most commonly used 179 drugs in 2008 based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality compiled Medical Expenditures Survey. We then used Micro-Medex, a commercial drug information service, to find a list of key publications describing ADEs for these drugs. Next, we obtained the text for the majority of letters to the editor published in The Lancet (6558 from 1967 to date; 82% of total) and The New England Journal of Medicine (3524 from 1966 to date; 75% of total). We restricted the letters to those that had the MeSH term 'adverse effect' in the indexing data. We also eliminated the letters with label 'Comment' to avoid searching letters specifically referencing a previously published paper in each journal, respectively. The resulting dataset contained 2166 letters for The Lancet and 1449 for The New England Journal of Medicine. We then compared the results from two different search strategies. In the first, an emulation of a PubMed search, we only examined the MeSH terms and the title for the letter. Our second approach included a search of the full text of the letters in addition to the title. Using these two strategies, we were able to determine the 'earliest' letter in these two journals for a given drug/ADE pair. We compared this date against the date of the citation referenced by MicroMedex to determine which search method provided the earliest detection. We used two national injury surveillance systems to examine heat illnesses in two different U.S. population subsets. We used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) to examine heat illness incidence and characteristics among sports and recreation participants of all ages from 2001 to 2009, and we used the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School RIO TM ) to examine heat illness incidence and characteristics among high school-aged athletes from 2005 to 2009 (Table 1) . NEISS-AIP, operated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, monitors consumer product-related injuries treated in a nationally representative sample of 66 U.S. hospital emergency departments (EDs) (3). Trained coders enter demographics, a brief narrative and consumer product information for each injury presenting to their ED. High School RIO TM , operated by the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, OH), monitors sports injuries in a nationally representative sample of 100 high schools (4). Certified athletic trainers at participating schools report exposure and injury data electronically. In this paper, we propose an inference model for determining the location of outbreaks of epidemics in a network of nodes. In our setting, the network is the NC counties where the basic model incorporates spatial geographical relationships between the counties. The model is epidemiological, by choice, to process daily flu counts from the counties in order to infer when an outbreak of flu is present in a county that is distinguishable from background counts. The methodology incorporates Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive (CAR) modeling. The OFSP veterinary clinics were a convenience sample of foodproduction and equine clinics in Ontario. Clinics participating in OFSP were offered two incentives: (1) free diagnostic testing at the AHL and (2) $175.00 per farm call if postmortems (PMs) were performed and farm call data were received within 10 days of the call. The first incentive was offered for the duration of the project; the second was available from October 2010 to June 15, 2011. The average number of days from farm call completion to data submission was compared pre-and post-PM incentive. The rate at which a veterinarian submitted samples for diagnostic testing to the AHL was calculated (total number of submissions/total number of farm calls). Only 20/28 OFSP clinics were enrolled in the study pre-PM incentive. A comparison of the number of submissions to the AHL for those clinics pre-and post-PM incentive was performed. Submissions of animals for necropsy or tissue for histology were classified as 'pathology' submissions. The proportion of livestock pathology submissions that were from the OFSP were compared to the total livestock pathology submissions pre-and postcommencement of the PM incentive. AHL reporting rates of livestock zoonotic diseases were compared pre-and post-commencement of the OFSP (total number of positive livestock zoonotic disease laboratory submissions/total number of livestock laboratory submissions).
