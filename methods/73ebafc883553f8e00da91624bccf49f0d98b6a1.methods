This study analyzed the data of all MERS-CoV cases that confirmed by Real time PCR by Ministry of Health's surveillance program from June 6, 2012 to January 5, 2015. This surveillance was nationwide under the supervision of Ministry of Health to ensure that the case definition was followed as per national MERS-CoV guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional review board of Jeddah Health directorate (IRB approval number A00223). Basic information for the confirmed cases that was collected included age, sex, occupation, date of onset, hospitalization, duration of hospital stay for hospitalized patients, and mortality. Duration between onset of illness and admission to hospital, case fatality rate, secondary attack rate, and basic reproduction number were calculated. Descriptive epidemiology was performed on demographic data, and analytic epidemiology was performed to assess any difference in case fatality rate among health care workers and others. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. Age was presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Length of stay in hospital and duration between onset of illness and admission were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The basic reproduction number or ratio (R 0 ), defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic in an otherwise uninfected and completely susceptible population [14] , was calculated using the following formula: Multiple logistic regressions analysis was performed to adjust for confounding factors and identify the factors associated with case fatality. All variable with p value < 0.1 in the bivariate analysis were included in the regression model. This was presented as odds ratio (OR) with confidence interval (CI). The level of significance was set at p â‰¤ 0.05.
