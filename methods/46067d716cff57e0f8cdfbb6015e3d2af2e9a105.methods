Patients who underwent more than one virological test for MERS-CoV at least 1 day apart were included in the analysis. Repeat testing was done non-systematically using respiratory tract samples from September 1, 2012 to September 31, 2013. The types of respiratory specimen collected from patients and contacts were sputum samples, nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, and endotracheal aspirate samples. With regard to MERS-CoV screening, clinical samples were screened by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification test, as described previously, with amplification targeting both the upstream E protein gene (upE) and ORF1a for confirmation; these are standard assays used in KSA for MERS-CoV testing. 2 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the time to negative repeat MERS-CoV RT-PCR test. 'Positive test' curves were drawn for patients and contacts who had repeated testing. The statistical significance of the difference between the curves was assessed using a log-rank test. SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, Version 11. Chicago, IL: SPSS Inc.; 2002) was used for the analysis.
