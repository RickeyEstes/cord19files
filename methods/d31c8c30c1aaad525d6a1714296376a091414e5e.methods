Between 1998/99 and 2010/11, INSA conducted 12 household telephone surveys using a panel of families (ECOS -Em Casa Observamos Saúde/Observing Health at Home). These surveys were used to collect data on IV coverage in the mainland Portuguese population. The ECOS panel consisted of a random sample of Portuguese families with a landline telephone and of families with landline and mobile phone since the 2009/10 sample (dual sample frame). The sample was stratified and was evenly distributed to represent the five health regions of the country. Landline phone households were selected by simple random selection from the national telephone directory. Mobile phone households were selected by random digit generation. All households received a letter from INSA with an invitation to participate in the ECOS panel and provide informed consent. Telephone contact was then used to formalize participation and record each household member's demographic data. The households included in each panel were renewed approximately every 3 years. The ECOS panel of families was approved by the Portuguese Data Protection Authority, which is in charge of ethical issues and protection of individual data collection in Portugal. The seasons included in the surveys were the winters from 1998/99 to 2010/11, except for the winter of 2000/01. In 2009/10, a specific recommendation for vaccination against pandemic influenza virus A (H1N1) 2009 was also issued, and included the abovementioned groups (except elderly and residents of institutions) and also healthy children under 12 years old, caretakers of infants under 6 months old, and professionals performing core roles, according to priority groups. No investigation was carried out in 2000/2001 season owing to lack of financing. All surveys used the same questionnaire. The questionnaire was presented to one individual (≥18 years of age) in each household using CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview) technology. This individual provided information on his/her vaccination status and information on the household. The terminology "percent of vaccinated" used in reporting results refers to individuals who reported being vaccinated or on which the respondent said they were vaccinated. The (Table 2) . A detailed description of the ECOS methodology can be found in a published report [17] . Permission to use the data for this study was obtained from the National Institute of Health. IV coverage was analyzed for the entire sample and for specific groups defined by age and sex. Information on demographic questions was collected during the initial survey done at household recruitment time. For the surveys conducted in 1998/99 to 2008/09, all IV coverage estimates were adjusted by health region using the 2001 Portuguese population census data (2001 Census data from the National Institute of Statistics). For the surveys of the 2009/10 and 2010/11 periods that were conducted using the dual sample frame, the IV coverage estimates were adjusted by health region (Census population 2001) and for cell phone and landline phone coverage of Portuguese households using the methodology described in Brick [18] and Kennedy [19] . Weighting factors were adjusted by post stratification for population age and sex distribution. To test the association (or independence) with disaggregation variables, we used the modified F-statistics of the second order adjustment of the Rao-Scott Chi-squared test [20] whose properties are presented in Rao and Thomas [21] . A 5% significance level was used for the statistical tests, and the null hypothesis was rejected when the probability of test significance (p-value) was <0.05. We also calculated 95% confidence intervals for all proportions. We used a meta-regression model to test the linear trend in IV coverage throughout the study period, and the effect of the SARS, A (H5N1), and A (H1N1)2009 pandemics. Each survey estimate was weighted by the inverse of the variance in the logit scale. The model fitted to the logit of IV coverage included three dummy variables (one for each event) and a sequence of numbers from 1 to 12 years to measure and test the time trend effect. The model was adjusted to IV coverage in the general population and age groups. All analyses were performed using the statistical programs SPSS [22] or STATA SE [23] . For sex distribution, there were no significant deviations from the 2001 population census distribution (i.e., all confidence intervals included the census population estimates). There were small differences between the age group distribution in the panel data and the population age group distribution observed in the 2001 census. These differences varied by year.
