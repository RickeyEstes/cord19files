An OH questionnaire was developed by the PICNet Needs Assessment Working Group, in accordance with the Public Health Agency of Canada's 2002 infection control guidelines. 23 The questionnaire was sent by e-mail to the OH directors of the six OH departments in the province to oversee its completion. These data were submitted to the PICNet management office for analysis by a consultant statistician. All data were entered in EpiData and analyzed in EpiInfo v.3.3. Examples of the data collected include: number of professional OH staff and employees served by the department, number of HCW immunizations, fit tests, and outbreak investigations completed in 2005, as well as descriptive data about the number and type of orientation and educational sessions conducted. The roles and responsibilities of the OH professional specific to occupational infections were divided into four categories: risk assessment, risk control, education, and evaluation. 23 Data were also collected about contract workers and medical staff working in the organization.
