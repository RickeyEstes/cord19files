We conducted a literature search, similar to that conducted by Vu et al. in 2010 (7) and identified 23 papers since the previous review. We searched the MEDLINE database from 1 January 1985 to 30 December 2018 using the following key words: "lung transplant recipients or immunocompromised hosts, " and "influenza, PIV, RSV, HMpV, CoV, bocavirus, AdV, and respiratory viruses, " respectively. Selection criteria for papers were as described in Vu et al. (7) . Briefly, selected articles included original peer-reviewed papers reporting at minimum three lung transplant cases with a description of virus detection methods, as well as a description of clinical endpoints.
