First, a word of caution: I reiterate that this study is by necessity limited and exploratory because the two epidemics, HIV/AIDS and SARS, are very different microbiologically and epidemiologically as indicated in the introduction; and there is a 10-year gap between the two surveys. The SARS study was conducted as the outbreak progressed in May 2003, 10 years after the HIV/AIDS study. Nonetheless, despite these methodological difficulties, I believe it is important to scrutinize available information on both epidemics in the hope of increasing our understanding of the dynamics of preventive action against HIV/AIDS. While the two epidemics are different in many respects, they are both serious public health threats that require a collective response [26, 30] as indicated earlier. Two general types of data are discussed here: population figures and data from personal interviews. The international population figures on the impact and spread of HIV/AIDS and SARS are taken from WHO's published reports [25, 28, 31, [44] [45] [46] . The analysis of behavior and attitudes of individuals is based on data from two separate studies I conducted in Singapore as principal investigator. The data on HIV/AIDS are from a 1993 study of attitudes and preventive behavior regarding HIV/AIDS based on a survey of personal interviews with a representative stratified random sample of 660 adults aged 21 and older following a structured questionnaire. Respondents were from the Chinese, Malay, and Indian communities, the three largest ethnic groups in Singapore. The sample characteristics and the details on measurement of the variables included in this analysis are described in Tables 1 and A. 3. The data discussed in this paper are part of a larger study on preventive health behavior regarding cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS supported by a research grant from the National University of Singapore. Further methodological details are provided elsewhere [39] . The new findings discussed in this paper were obtained through logistic regression analysis. The data on behavior and attitudes on SARS are from a 2003 study based on telephone interviews with a representative stratified random sample of 1202 adults aged 21 and older, following a structured questionnaire. The three main ethnic groups in Singapore (Chinese, Malays, and Indians) were proportionally represented. The interviews were conducted within the span of 6 days, from 5 to 10 May, while the country was facing the SARS epidemic. Telephone interviews were the only data collection option because it was imperative at the time to follow the public health advice to restrict personal contact to home and the workplace, whenever possible. The main characteristics of the sample and the attitudinal measurements applied are presented in Table 2 . Further methodological details of this study are described elsewhere [29] . The new findings presented in this paper were obtained through logistic regression analysis. While the data refer to three ethnic communities in Singapore the findings illustrate the impact of social attitudes upon the governance of epidemics in a high density global city. Acknowledging the multiplicity of factors that may play a role in shaping the success or failure of illness prevention and containment of epidemics, this study deals only with a small number of variables. The analysis of data in both studies comprised two stages: an initial scrutiny of the main assumed correlations and attitudinal scales using partial correlation and factor analysis; logistic regression to explore the likelihood of occurrence of stereotypical images of people living with HIV/AIDS, the dependent variable in the HIV/AIDS study; and likelihood of public support of the SARS crisis management, the dependent variable in the SARS study. Logistic regression is a very useful tool to explore the probability of occurrence of the dependent variable over the probability of it not occurring and the outcome is provided as odds ratios. The odds ratio is the odds of one variable occurring to the odds of another [47, 48] . The logistic regression analysis of the public image of HIV/AIDS comprised three sets of variables: sociodemographic variables (gender, age, ethnicity, marital status and religion); social class factors (occupation, personal monthly income, and educational level); attitudinal factors proposed by the HBM and the SCT (tendency to worry about falling ill; future orientation; sense of personal control of one's life; life satisfaction; perceived severity of HIV/AIDS; perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS; belief in effective prevention of HIV/AIDS) and perception of HIV/AIDS. A description of these variables is provided in Table A.3. Five sets of variables were included in the logistic regression analysis of the public support of the SARS crisis management: socio-demographic variables (gen- der; age; ethnicity; place of birth; marital status); social class (educational level and personal monthly income); health behavior variables (smoking, exercising regularly, and preventive measures against SARS taken over the 3 days preceding the interview); attitudes suggested by the HBM including perceived susceptibility and perceived severity; and attitudes on SARS crisis management. To meet requirements of the logistic regression analysis the response categories of the question on perceived susceptibility were dichotomized contrasting the respondents who expressed an estimation of their likelihood of infection on the one hand, with respon-dents who have no awareness of their susceptibility to SARS, on the other hand. The response categories for perceived severity were dichotomized into "high" severity (survival not very likely or not likely at all) versus "low" severity (all other responses including "don't know"). The complete list and explanation of all the variables are presented in Table 2 .
