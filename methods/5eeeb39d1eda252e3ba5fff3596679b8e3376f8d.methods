The genes identified in a number of recent genomewide association studies are available at the GWAS repository at the National Human Genome Research Institute http://www .genome.gov/gwastudies/ [32] and, along with pre-GWAS genes and environmental risk factors, at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/alzenvrisk.htm. The genes returned from very large sample sets (N > 10, 000) include ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A2, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6A, and PICALM whose pro perties in relation to diverse pathogens were identified by literature survey. While it is recognised that such genes, particularly APOE, ABCA7, CR1, and clusterin, which are involved in lipoprotein function and/or amyloid processing (see below), may exert effects on other relevant branches of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, the focus of this paper is on pathogens and the immune system, which appear to be the common factors integrating this network. Throughout the text, these and other genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease from the GWAS and pre-GWAS era are highlighted in bold and appended to the various processes in which they are involved (derived from a KEGG pathway analysis of these genes http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/alzkegg.htm) Herpes simplex binding proteins, and key interactors, currently numbering over 450, are stocked and referenced at http:// www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/herpeshost.html. KEGG pathway analysis of this interactome is provided at http:www .polygenicpathways.co.uk//HERPESKEGG.htm. Expression data are provided in Figure 1 and are also hyperlinked to the BioGPS webserver http://www.biogps.gnf.org/, which provides general gene information and mRNA expression profiles for most human genes, based on custom arrays from 79 human issues [33, 34] .

Data are from the BioGps website. Plasmodium falciparum [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] and is a general clearance receptor for complement opsonised pathogens [44] . Clusterin, predominantly expressed in brain, liver, and testis, (http://www.biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=1191/) is a ligand for the lipoprotein receptor, megalin (LRP2) that is involved in beta-amyloid clearance, and also a complement inhibitor that prevents the formation of the membrane attack complex, a channel that is inserted into pathogen membranes, killing them by lysis [45] . This complex is also seen in Alzheimer's disease neurones [46, 47] . The herpes simplex virus interacts with other members of the complement cascade, by binding to the complement component and CR1 ligand, C3 and its derivatives and to CD59, a further inhibitor of the formation of the complement membrane attack complex (see review) [48] . C. pneumoniae interacts with this pathway by binding to properdin (CFP), a protein that stabilises the complement C3 and C5 convertase and contributes to the formation of the membrane attack complex [49] . CD59 is also incorporated into chlamydial inclusion bodies [50] . Complement component C3 binds to melanins derived from C. neoformans [51] and cryptococcal capsules bind to C3 and activate the alternative complement pathway [52] . Complement component C3 also binds to the bacterial surface of H. pylori, and the complement pathway is involved in bactericidal effects against this pathogen [53] . P. gingivalis also uses complement receptor 3 (an integrin complex of integrin, alpha M/integrin, beta 2 (ITGAM/ ITGB2)) for entry [54] , and herpes simplex glycoprotein C also binds to this complex [55] as does C. neoformans [56] , while ITGB2 is involved in C. pneumoniae entry in human coronary artery endothelial cells [57] . This macrophage complement receptor, also known as MAC-1, generally mediates the phagocytosis of pathogens coated with complement C3 derivatives [58] . T. C3 also binds to P. gingivalis although the pathogen has devised an elegant escape strategy involving digestion of complement components C3, C4, and C5 by bacterial secreted proteases, known as gingipains [59] . The complement inhibitor CD59 is also a ligand for CD2, and CD59 activation of this receptor, presumably involving CD2AP, activates T cell receptor signalling resulting in the secretion of interleukins (IL1A, IL2 and IL6) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF2) [60, 61] . ABCA7 plays a role in the complement-mediated activation of phagocytosis in macrophages. Complement component C1q, which binds to IgM or IgG complexed antigens (relevant to most pathogens), binds to macrophage calreticulin and LRP1 and C1q binding to macrophages markedly increased the expression of both LRP1 and ABCA7, effects which enhance the phagocytic abilities of macrophages [62] . C1q also binds to complement receptor CR1, an effect involved in the immune clearance of opsonised pathogens [63] . C1q also binds to beta-amyloid and is involved in amyloid-related complement activation [64] . inter alia [65] . These processes are usurped by many viruses and other pathogens to gain access to cells and to various intracellular compartments, while the lysosomal or proteasomal pathways may be used to destroy pathogen proteins [66] . Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of several processes used by Helicobacter pylori, herpes simplex, and many other viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens to gain entry to cells [67] [68] [69] .
