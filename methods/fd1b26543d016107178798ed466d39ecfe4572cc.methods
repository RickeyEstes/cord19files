Bacterial strains and growth conditions S. pneumoniae bacterial reference strains (n = 8), non-S. pneumoniae reference strains (n = 54) and invasive S. pneumoniae clinical isolates (n = 19) were evaluated in this study (Table 1 ). All strains were cultured overnight in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Oxoid, UK) at 37°C. For enumeration, 100 μL of serially diluted bacterial suspensions were spread plated on Columbia blood agar and incubated for 24 hrs.
