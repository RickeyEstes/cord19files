Six patients with MERS CoV infection were included in the study. Four cases with symptomatic disease, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, and 2 asymptomatic cases who were close contacts of the MERS CoV patients were included. The MERS CoV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of the consensus viral RNA targets upstream of the E gene (UPE) and open reading frame (ORF1b) on a sputum sample. The workup for mycoplasma, legionella, bacterial infection, and other viruses in the 4 active cases and 2 asymptomatic cases were negative. Patients were given ribavirin and IFN-a2b according to the dosage recommended in Table 1 . Hemogram, electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzyme levels were normal upon initial presentation for all 6 cases ( Table 2) . Case 2 had a large family of 22 individuals who were all screened. One contact was positive upon screening with an asymptomatic presentation (Case 6) and a normal chest x-ray, but the computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a left lower lobe solitary infiltrate (Figure 3 ). For case 4 ( Table 2 ), 3 children had tested negative for MERS CoV, but the spouse (Case 5) developed upper respiratory tract symptoms and lung infiltrates, as observed on chest x-ray. She was negative for MERS CoV infection, but in view of her symptoms and close contact with the patient, she was labeled as a presumptive case of MERS CoV infection. Twentyeight health care workers who came in close contact with infected individuals were screened, and none of them were positive for MERS CoV infection. An antibody assay for CoV was not available in Saudi Arabia at the time of the study; seroconversion in active cases and among close contacts could thus not be identified.
