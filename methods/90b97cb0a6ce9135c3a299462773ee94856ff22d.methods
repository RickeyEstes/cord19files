Fieldwork and sampling. This study used samples collected in the context of a long-term project to document the land vertebrates of Madagascar based on voucher specimens and for a variety of studies 26 . From February 2012 to March 2013, bats were captured in the six different provinces of Madagascar using harp traps, hand nets, and mist nets. Some Pteropus fruit bats were purchased in markets. Individual bats were identified to species using external and cranio-dental characters and comparison to museum specimens. For each animal, different parameters, including age, sex, and reproductive condition 45 were recorded and this information deposited in DRYAD (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.06g12). Bat tissue samples were collected in the field and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen, then transferred to − 80 °C storage upon arrival in the laboratory. The geographic ranges of the captured bat species were variable, with some having broad distributions nearly across the complete island and others distinctly more restricted. Several species, especially insectivorous bats, occur sympatrically in the same cave systems and in the same forest blocks, or synanthropically in human-built structures. Information on the species, province and specific collection locality, sampling season, geographic coordinates, elevation, habitat type, and the number of bat species found at each site and the associated species composition are presented in Tables S1 and S2. Mean climatic conditions of the sampling sites were extracted from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org/). We used the resolution proposed by WorldClim as 30 arc seconds (∼1 km). An open-source GIS software, QGIS 46 , was used to generate the map for visualizing Madagascar bioclimatic regions proposed by Cornet 47 . Ethics statement. Animals used in this study were manipulated in strict accordance with the guidelines for the handling of wild mammals 48 Animals were captured, manipulated, and dispatched with thoracic compression following procedures accepted by the scientific community for the handling of wild mammals 48 . Pteropus were purchased in a market and were not physically collected by the research team in a natural setting. Euthanasia was used for Pteropus and not any other bat genera. All fieldwork conducted on Madagascar was before the creation and implementation of an institutional and/or licensing committee on the island to issue such clearances. A CITES permit from the Malagasy national authority was issued for Pteropus tissue export (n°243C-EA06/MG12) to CRVOI on La Réunion. Statistical procedures. Exploratory analyses were performed using Pearson chi-square (χ 2 ) or Fisher's exact tests in R software 49 (95% confidence intervals with continuity correction). With the intent of identifying variables potentially correlated with UMRV infection, we performed a binomial GLM analysis 50 . We first visually inspected the relationships between variables (mean annual temperature [MAT] , mean annual rainfall [MAR], habitat type), and "multi" a binary factor indicating whether a given site contained multiple (> 2) or one species of bat. Graphic inspection suggested an overall effect of MAT and no effect of MAR. However, relationships suggested a linear interaction between MAR and habitat types, and a possible quadratic effect of rainfall within multi-versus single-species sites. Main and interaction effects were tested separately while accounting for the effects of other variables. We retained the best model according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We then tested the effects of biotic variables (sex, diet, and age), on our best model, to determine a significance effect while accounting for the effects of abiotic factors. GLMM 51 were constructed with unbalanced variables (i.e., province, localities, and species -related to non-homogenous sampling) set as random factors in order to be compared to the best GLM fit. Statistical analyses were conducted with R software package 49 . Sample screening. Approximately 1 mm 3 of lung, kidney, and spleen collected from the same animal were pooled in DMEM medium and homogenized in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 min at 25 Hz using 3 mm tungsten beads. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the mixture supernatant using the viral mini kit v2.0 and an EZ1 BioRobot (Qiagen). cDNA products were generated via reverse transcription (cDNA kit, Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PVs were detected by a semi-nested PCR targeting part of the L-gene polymerase gene, designed as to detect Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, and Henipavirus (RMH) 52 . The 400-600 bp PCR amplified cDNAs were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and cloned into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega). Cloned PCR products were sequenced by the Sanger method (Big Dye sequencing kit, ABI, Genoscreen, Lille, France) using M13 standard sequencing primers. Bioinformatics analysis. The sequences were first compared to the published sequences from the Paramyxoviridae and published UMRVs in GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) online (www.ncbi.nih.gov) using BLASTn and BLASTx. The sequence quality of individual reads was assessed, and all sequences were processed using the Geneious Pro software package v7.1.8 53 . DNA sequences obtained from at least three independent bacterial clones were aligned to correct for most sequencing or PCR introduced errors. M13 Primer sequences were trimmed from the finalized sequences. The resulting partial sequences (~490 bp) of the L-gene polymerase gene were then aligned with Translation Alignment using the default ClustalW cost matrix in Geneious Pro software package. PVs sequences from bats reported in a previous study by Wilkinson et al. 17 were used for phylogenetic analysis (GenBank number to KF928225 to KF928256 and to K928261 to KF928265). PVs and bat Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) sequences used for the present analyses were deposited in GenBank under the reference numbers in respectively Table S3 and Table S4 . Information concerning amplified PV sequences is given in Table S3 . In order to classify the detected new paramyxoviruses, viral family-level phylogenetic analyses were performed. A total of 209 partial L-gene paramyxovirus sequences collected in Genbank were used. Sequences were trimmed to remove any free end gaps or were entirely removed if the obtained alignment did not provide at least 462 bp of non-gap overlap. Internal gaps were permitted. The tree was performed in 5,000,000 iterations in MrBayes with the GTR+ G+ I evolutionary model and a 10% burn-in rooted with an Aquaparamyxovirus sequence (GenBank number EF646380). Genbank accession numbers used for each virus genera are indicated in Table S6 . A best-fit nucleotide substitution model of the alignment was determined using jModelTest 54 with the Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) 55 , and the most appropriate one for URMVs from Malagasy bats was GTR+ G. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MrBayes v3.2 56 employing a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, rooted with a Mumps virus sequence (GenBank number AY309060). A minimum of two independent runs were made, with four chains in each run, for a total of 50 000 000, sampling every 5000 generations. The first 5000 trees burn-in were discarded. The obtained effective sample size values (ESS) for each parameter were all superior to 200. Trees obtained after the convergence point were summarized and visualized by FigTree 1.4.2 (http://treebioedacuk/software/figtree). Available full-length Cyt-b gene sequences corresponding to each bat species that were positive for UMRV infection were downloaded from GenBank. When Cyt-b sequences were not available for a given bat species, PCR using primers targeting the Cyt-b gene were performed 57 to generate ~1140 bp sequences. All bat Cyt-b sequences were aligned, the GTR+ I+ G model was also the most appropriate substitution model, and the phylogenetic relationship among bat species were analyzed using RAxML 7.2.8 Geneious plugin 53 using 1000 generations. Two subsets of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined using Mothur 58 , and based on two genetic distance cutoffs (90.0% and 98.0%), generated 24 and 39 representative sequences, respectively. To study the history of co-evolution of UMRVs with respect to their associated bat hosts, we performed event-based co-phylogenetic reconciliation, using the tool CoRe-PA 59 . CoRe-PA is an event-based maximum parsimony method, which attempts to construct the most parsimonious co-evolutionary history of hosts and associated parasites. A cost is assigned to each type of co-evolutionary event (co-speciation, host-switching, duplication, and sorting) and then, the parasite phylogeny is mapped onto the host phylogeny, while trying to minimize the total costs of all occurring events. In contrast to many other co-evolutionary software packages, CoRe-PA does not require an a priori assignment of a cost scheme. It has been shown that the results of such analyses strongly depend on the designed cost scheme, and choosing a biologically meaningful cost scheme in an a priori manner may be difficult 59 . CoRe-PA can assess several random cost schemes and evaluate these, based on the best fit with respect to the resulting reconstructions. In our study, we performed reconstruction between the phylogenetic trees of UMRVs and bats, using 5000 random cost schemes. Furthermore, to test statistical significance, we computed the reconstructions of 100 random data sets, considering the same phylogenetic trees for bats and UMRVs with different bat and virus associations. In this case, the formulated null hypothesis is that there are more co-speciation and less host-switching events in the data set, than compared to data sets with random host-parasite associations. We quantified the degree of congruence between bat and UMRVs topologies, and the potential individual associations leading to a potential co-phylogenetic structure using a global-fit method, ParaFit 60 . The latter program tests the independence of host and symbiont genetic or patristic distances, and specifically herein, tests the hypothesis of evolution independence between bats and UMRVs, i.e., one partner randomly evolving with respect to the other. Statistical analyses were done using the R software package 49 .
