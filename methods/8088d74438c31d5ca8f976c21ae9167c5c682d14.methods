We retrospectively revised all the files of children aged 0-14 years who were visited for acute asthma from 1 January to 31 December 2016 in the Pediatric ED of S. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy. All the patients with a diagnosis of "acute asthma," "wheezing bronchitis," and "bronchospasm" were included. Our center is an urban, academic, tertiary care Pediatric Emergency Unit, consisting of a Pediatric ED with approximately 23000 visits per year of children aged 0-14, a shortstay observation with 6 beds, and a ward with 28 beds. Patients arriving at the ED are registered by a triage-qualified nurse and seen first by pediatric residents and the attending physician. Two more nurses are available for the ED patients and 1 for the short-stay observation. Triage acuity is defined by a 4-grade colour scale, white being the less urgent and red being the most. A white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs; it can be reevaluated by the triage nurse if the symptoms modify and it might gain a higher priority. A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant, acute-onset symptoms; they should be reevaluated by the triage nurse every 30-60 minutes until medical evaluation. A yellow code is for those with severe lesions and altered vital signs that require rapid medical evaluation, so that these cases are closely communicated to the attending physician. A red code means that the condition is life-threatening (vital functions are compromised) and the patient requires immediate evaluation. A Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is in the same building and intensivists' consultancies are available as needed. For each patient presenting to the Pediatric ED, a record form is filled in by the nurse and medical staff, including demographic data, anamnestic information, vital signs, physical examination, treatment performed in the ER (if done), clinical reevaluation after treatment, diagnosis, discharge modality, and home therapy prescription when applicable. For children requiring a short-stay observation, prescribed examinations, therapy, and subsequent reevaluations are also noted on the same form. The etiology of asthma exacerbations was considered as infectious if the episodes were concomitant to a respiratory tract illness documented by the clinical examination and/or laboratory or radiologic investigations; as allergic when there had been a clear exposition to a likely triggering allergen in a susceptible individual (known atopic or with a family history of allergic disease or with previous asthma episodes) and with no concomitant respiratory infection; as exerciseinduced when the exacerbation had been precipitated by physical activity; if no overt cause could be ascertained, the etiology was classified as "unknown." The following data were considered for the study: age and sex of the patient, month of the visit, triage colour tag, acute asthma severity (see Table 1 ) [8] , etiology of the exacerbation, previous history of asthma or other chronic conditions (if reported), use of long-term control therapy for asthma, vital signs, presence and severity of dyspnea, severity of the exacerbation, administered therapy, and discharge modality (home, short-stay observation in the ED, and admission to the Pediatric Unit Ward or to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit). The data were collected in a Microsoft Excel5 database. A descriptive analysis was performed for continuous variables (median, 25th and 75th percentiles). Data distribution was checked using MedCal Statistical Software (Version 17.4 MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). The associations between qualitative variables were evaluated with Chi-square test. Results were deemed as significant
