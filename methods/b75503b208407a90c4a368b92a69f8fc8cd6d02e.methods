We utilised data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) for the period July 1998-June 2005 and data from the National Mortality Database (NMD) for the period January 1997-October 2004. The NHMD contains administrative, demographic and clinical information about all patients admitted to public and private hospitals in Australia. The NMD contains cause of death information for all registered deaths in Australia. Hospitalisation and mortality data were supplied by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). All data supplied by the AIHW were categorised using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) [22] . For both hospitalisation and mortality estimates a number of ICD-10 groupings were examined: influenza and pneumonia (ICD J10-18), other respiratory disorders (ICD J, excluding J10-18), circulatory disorders (ICD I), and for mortality, all-cause death was also examined. The analysis was restricted to records in which these ICD codes appeared as the ''principal'' cause of hospitalisation or the ''underlying'' cause of death. Monthly hospitalisation and mortality data were utilised. Population estimates were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) [23] . Influenza (A and B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity were obtained from the Laboratory Virology and Serology Reporting Scheme (LabVISE). LabVISE is a national system of sentinel laboratories which analyses specimens all year round. In 2005, there were 11 participating laboratories from all states and territories except Western Australia and the Northern Territory [24] . LabVISE data were supplied from January 1997 to June 2005. In Australia RSV activity has been known to overlap with influenza activity (Fig. 1) . Internationally, previous models have shown that RSV (like influenza), while often undiagnosed, is responsible for significant mortality [15] . As in previous models estimating influenza disease burden [15] [16] [17] RSV activity was included as a covariate in the model. By including RSV activity in the model, the deaths (or hospitalisations) attributable to RSV are accounted for, and should not be confounded with deaths from influenza. Poisson and negative-binomial regression models are basic models for count data analysis. We used a generalised linear model (GLM) procedure, assuming Poisson-distributed errors with the response variable (hospitalisations or deaths) assumed to be linear and additive in the covariates [20] . We tested for over-dispersion of errors, and when this was observed (in all models except those for mortality 50-64 years), the models were run again with negative-binomial error distributions. A negative-binomial model allows for the variance to be greater than the mean, and is therefore more appropriate in cases of over-dispersion. In the final models (for hospitalisation and mortality), the values of Pearson chi-squared and deviance divided by the degrees of freedom were not significantly larger than one suggesting a good fit to the data. The regression model was applied to each of the disease categories in the study. The model used was as follows: where Y(t) is the number of deaths or hospitalisations predicted by the model in a month for a specific age-group, [A](t), [B](t) and [RSV](t) are laboratory specimen counts for a given month (for influenza A, influenza B and RSV, respectively), sin(2 t/12) and cos(2 t/12) are proxy variables reflecting annual fluctuations that are independent of influenza and RSV, and [population](t) represents the age-specific population size, to account for changing demography. Values for the parameters˛andˇ1-ˇ6 were then obtained by running the regression model. The number of hospitalisations or deaths attributable to influenza was calculated by the difference between the number predicted by the model and the number predicted by the model when the influenza laboratory reports were set to 0. All statistical analysis was conducted in SAS statistical software (V 9.1 SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
