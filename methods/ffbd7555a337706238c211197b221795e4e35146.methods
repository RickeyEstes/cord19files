We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using direct and total traveller volumes and final destination cities of travellers originating in Iran in February 2019, using data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (accounting for 90% of global air travel, with the other 10% modeled using market intelligence). As exported cases were identified in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada, we used the methods of Fraser et al (3) to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Iran necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Iran, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are residents of Iran (4) .

We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination countries' ranking on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks.
