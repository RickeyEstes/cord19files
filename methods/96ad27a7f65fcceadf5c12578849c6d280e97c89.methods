The Public Health Organizational Capacity Study (PHORCAST) is a repeated, cross-sectional survey of all CDP organizations at the regional, provincial and national levels in Canada. Data were drawn from two waves (2004 and 2010) of a national census of all organizations engaged in CDP at regional, provincial and national levels in Canada. Organizations included in the 2004 census were identified in an exhaustive internet search and through consultation with key contacts in all provinces. In addition to formal public health organizations (FPH), the census included NGOs and coalitions, partnerships, and alliances (termed herein as 'grouped organizations'). 'New' organizations identified in 2010 included those created after 2004, existing organizations with 'new' CDP divisions or offering 'new' types of programming, and those formed by the amalgamation of two or more previously participating organizations. All organizations identified (n ¼ 379 in 2004; n ¼ 421 in 2010) were invited to participate and then screened for eligibility (Table 1) . Appendix 1 (online file) describes the selection of eligible organizations. The response was high e 92% in 2004 and 89.5% in 2010. Organizations that delivered CDP programs in specific populations were labelled 'user' organizations. Those that developed and transferred programs to other organizations were labelled 'resource' organizations. Those with both a 'user' and 'resource' function were labelled 'both'. Data were collected in structured telephone interviews conducted by trained interviewers with one to two key informants per organization depending on whether the organization was 'both' user and resource (n ¼ 35 in 2004; n ¼ 81 in 2010). Key informants were identified by senior managers as persons most knowledgeable about implementation and delivery of CDP programs or transfer of CDP programs to other organizations. Interviews were conducted using separate p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 8 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 7 1 6 e7 2 4 questionnaires for 'user' and 'resource' organizations. Study variables are described in Appendix 2 (online file). Six organizations with more than one unit specializing in CDP programming in 2004, and 13 in 2010, provided more than one interview.
