We searched Medline (1950 to present), EMBASE (1947 to present), Scopus (1823 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present) and Global health (1910 to present). Results were limited to peer-reviewed publications in English. Search terms and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for nosocomial organisms and antibiotic resistance were combined with search and MeSH terms for healthcare settings and mathematical models as follows: Nosocomial infections in general (e.g."healthcareassociated infection$" or "hospital-acquired infection$") OR Nosocomial organisms (e.g. "C. difficile" or "Staphylococcus aureus") OR Antimicrobial resistance AND Nosocomial (e.g. "hospital$" or "healthcare") AND Mathematical modelling or economic evaluation model (e.g. "stochastic" or "deterministic" AND "model") We decided not to use search terms for nosocomial infection types (e.g. surgical site infections or urinary tract infections), since our review focuses on the transmission of infections from one individual to another, which cannot generally be accurately represented without knowing the causative organism. The complete search strategy is provided in the Additional file 1. All databases were search identically, with exception of the MeSH terms, which were altered to the subject-heading dictionary used in each particular database. The final search was conducted on 11 December 2011. Each title and abstract in the search result was independently screened by EvK and at least one of the other authors. Full text evaluation was conducted by EvK and in case of uncertainty, discussion took place with JR.
