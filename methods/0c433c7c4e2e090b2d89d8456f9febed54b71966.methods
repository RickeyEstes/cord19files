Cells. A549 cells were maintained in F12 medium, and 293T, NPTr (Ferrari et al., 2003) and FLN-R cells (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10 % FCS. Primary lung cells from the microbat (M. myotis) were grown in DMEM containing 10 % FCS, penicillin (100 units ml 21 ) and streptomycin (100 mg ml 21 ) and 20 % amnioMAX (Gibco). RACE and IFITM3 cloning. NPTr and microbat cells were transfected with poly(I : C) (Invivogen) at 33 mg ml 21 using Lipofectamine 2000, and 4 h later, total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated (Qiagen AllPrep kit). 59 and 39 IFITM cDNA fragments were generated using a SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) and the following primers: 5Bat: 59-GCCCAGAGCTATGCGTCCACCGCCAAGTGCC-39, and 3Bat: 59-CGTCTGGTCCCTGTTCAACACCCTCTTC-39; and 5Pig: 59-GATGTTCAGGCACTTGGCGGTGGAGGCATAGCTC-39, and 3Pig: 59-TGAACTGGTGCTGCCTGGGCTTCGTGG-39. PCR products were TA cloned and multiple clones were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Non-coding sequences identified by RACE were used to design primers for PCR amplification of full-length IFITM3 (BatIFITM3ncrF: 59-GCATCCACACGCCATCTGCTC-39, and BatIFITM3ncrR: 59-GAACGCCATTGTGCACATGTGC-39; and PigIFITM3ncrF: 59-ACAGCTTCTCCTGGGCACCATG-39, PigIFITM3ncrR: 59-GTATGTGCTGCTGTGAAAGGAG-39).
