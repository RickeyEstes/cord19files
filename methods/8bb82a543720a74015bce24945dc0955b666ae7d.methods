We extracted and estimated confirmed COVID-19 case counts for severe and critical cases from Wuhan and Guangzhou from situation updates from Chinese national and local health commissions. We extracted the number of designated COVID-19 beds and hospitalizations from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission website. A confirmed COVID-19 case was considered severe if the patient experienced at least one of the following: dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to oxygen concentration (FiO2) ratio <300mmHg, and/or a pneumonia patient showing significant progression of lesions infiltrating >50% of the lung field on chest imaging within 24-48 hours. A confirmed patient was considered to be critical if he/she experienced respiratory failure demanding invasive and/or non-invasive ventilation for respiratory support, septic shock, and/or with multiple organ dysfunction/failure demanding intensive care. 6, 7 These definitions have been more detailed with revisions of the Chinese diagnostic and treatment guidelines. In this study, we used the term serious patients to describe severe and critical patients collectively. We estimated the number of prevalent severe and critical cases cross-sectionally per day -allowing for the fact that patients could move in and out of these categories over the course of their disease. We extracted Wuhan city and Hubei province COVID-19 data between January 10 and February 29, including the numbers of confirmed cases, new cures, new deaths, severe cases, critical cases, serious cases (a sum of severe and critical cases), cumulative cures, cumulative deaths, cumulative confirmed cases, and currently confirmed cases (cumulative confirmed cases -deaths -cures). If official sources did not have data for variables on some dates, we calculated the number of cases based on the relationships between variables. Because Wuhan did not systematically report the number of severe and critical cases, we estimated these numbers by assuming that the proportions of serious and critical cases out of all currently confirmed cases was the same in Wuhan as in the rest of Hubei. For the dates when it was not possible to estimate the severe and critical case counts using the above methods (January 18, 25, and 27), we assumed the number of severe and critical cases on those dates were the same as reported for the previous day. For Guangzhou, we extracted the city's case count on the number of confirmed, severe, clinical, and cured cases and deaths for each day between January 24 and February 29.
