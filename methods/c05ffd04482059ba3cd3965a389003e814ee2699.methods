Preparation and fractionation of bovine BBMI~. Vesicles were isolated from fresh bovine kidney by a modification of the MgC12 precipitation method [16] as described in detail elsewhere [17] except that mannitol was replaced by an equal concentration of sucrose in the homogenisation medium. The vesicles were washed and suspended in a medium containing 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM K + Hepes and 0.2 mM CaC12 at pH 7.4 and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -20°C until used. Cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobis(propionimidate) (DTBP). This was a modification of the method of Labb6 et al. [18] . BBMV were centrifuged at 100000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the pellets resuspended in 100 mM triethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.3) at 2/zg protein//~l. Other protein samples were dialysed to remove Tris and resuspended in the above buffer. The cross-linker was made up in triethanolamine buffer at 30 mg/ml and added to the protein mixture to give a final concentration of 0.6 raM. After incubation at room temperature for the appropriate time the reaction was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 100 mM glycine at pH 8. Samples were frozen at -20°C until analysed. Immunoaffinity chromatography. The monoclonal antibody FD19 was prepared as described in a previous paper [19] and was covalently attached to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose. Brush-border membranes were solubilised in the detergent MEGA-10 [20] in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (3 mg detergent/rag protein) and the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 100000 ×g for 30 min at 4°C. Aliquots of the suspension were passed down a column of FD19 attached to Sepharose. After washing with the same medium, the column was eluted with 50 mM dieth-ylamine pH 11 and samples were collected in 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (to give 50 mM Tris-HCl "final concentration). Fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon micro-concentrators. Concanavalin A column chromatography. This was performed as described by Doyle and McGivan [19] . Papain digestion. BBMV (10 mg protein in 1 ml) were digested with 2/xl of 25 mg/ml papain in 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. To remove solubilised APN the suspension was centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the pellet was subsequently dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl/0.5% MEGA-10 (pH 7.4). Preparation of samples for N-terminal sequence analysis. Purified protein samples (typically 10 /.~g) prepared as described above were separated by SDS-PAGE and Electroblotted (LKB Semi-Dry Blotter) on to Pro-Blott membrane (Applied Biosystems). The desired bands were cut out and subjected to automated amino acid sequence analysis on a 477A/120A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the Blott cartridge using standard cycles. Assay of aminopeptidase activity. APN activity was assayed at 37°C in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.4 together with 2 mM L-leucine-p-nitroanilide. The initial rate of increase of absorption at 410 nm was monitored continuously. Gels and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli [21] . Western blotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. [22] except that the nitrocellulose was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 1.5 mM KH2PO 4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO 4) containing 5% skimmed milk powder plus 0.2% Tween 20, and washed with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20. Determinations of molecular weights were made from gels relative to known standards (Bio-Rad Broad-range for gels and Sigma Prestained for blots). Scanning of gels and blots. Dried gels and blots were scanned using a Chromoscan 3 (Joyce Loebl, Tyne and Wear, UK) at 0.5 Absorbance full scale. Blots were scanned on the reflectance setting at the same sensitivity. Protein was assayed as described by Bradford [23] . DMS and DTBP were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset). MEGA-10 was synthesised as described by Hildreth [20] . Peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA).
