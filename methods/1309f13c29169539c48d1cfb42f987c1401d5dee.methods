Earlier methods for side-chain modeling often put less emphasis on the energy or scoring function. The function was usually greatly simplified, and consisted of the empirical rotamer preferences and simple repulsion terms for nonbonded contacts. 151 Nevertheless, these approaches have been justified by their performance. For example, a method based on a rotamer library compared favorably with that based on a molecular mechanics force field, 159 and new methods continue to be based on the rotamer library approach. [160] [161] [162] The various optimization approaches include a Monte Carlo simulation, 163 simulated annealing, 164 a combination of Monte Carlo and simulated annealing, 165 the dead-end elimination theorem, 166, 167 genetic algorithms, 155 neural network with simulated annealing, 168 mean field optimization, 169 and combinatorial searches. 151, 170, 171 Several studies focused on the testing of more sophisticated potential functions for conformational search 171, 172 and development of new scoring functions for side-chain modeling, 173 reporting higher accuracy than earlier studies.
