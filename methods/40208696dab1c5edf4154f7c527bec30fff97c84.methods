Different search strategies were used to retrieve available guidelines including search engines such as Google â and electronic resources such as PubMed â and the Guideline International Network. The search had no limits for the starting date and was extended until June 2008. Keywords used were 'hand hygiene', 'hand washing', 'handwashing', 'hand rubbing', 'handrubbing', 'hand decontamination' and 'guidelines' in various combinations. Requests for hand hygiene guidelines were also made to members of the WHO First Global Patient Safety Challenge core group of experts and its hand hygiene national campaigns network (see WHO website), national representatives of the European Union hospital infection network (Hospital in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance) and WHO regional offices. No language restriction was applied. A grid was prepared to analyse the documents by adapting a tool from the European DG XIIfunded HARMONY (Harmonisation of Antibiotic Resistance measurement, Methods of typing Organisms and ways of using these and other tools to increase the effectiveness of Nosocomial infection control; see HARMONY website) project, developed originally to evaluate antibiotic policies in different hospitals and used in several other infection control-related projects. 7, 8 The main aspects considered in the comparison were: basic information about the guideline (e.g. year of publication, endorsing body, and mode of publication); the guideline development process (e.g. national as opposed to subnational, developers, target population and methods for evidence evaluation and recommendation development); recommendations made and details about indications, technique and products recommended for hand hygiene; and recommended strategies for hand hygiene improvement and guideline implementation. A group of six infection control experts scrutinised the guidelines and inserted information into the grid. Inter-observer accuracy and consistency checks were performed to ensure validity of the method.
