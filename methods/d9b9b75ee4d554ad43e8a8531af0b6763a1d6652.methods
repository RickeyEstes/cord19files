Mice. Mice used in this study, including WT and Ceacam1 -/mice, were maintained on the C57BL/6 genetic background (back-crossed as many as 16 times) and were bred as homozygotes. Ceacam1 -/mice were kindly provided by Prof. Nicole Beauchemin (Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada) 23 . Human CEACAM1 transgenic mice were originally developed and were kindly provided by Prof. J. Shively (Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA) 55 . They were back-crossed eight times into the C57BL/6 background and then crossed eight times with C57BL/6 Ceacam1 -/mice to generate C57BL/6-hCEACAM1 +/+ × msCeacam1 Six-week-old to eight-week-old age-matched and sex-matched mice were used for all experiments. All animals were housed in single ventilated cages. Animal experiments were authorized by the Nordrhein Westfalen Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (Recklinghausen, Germany) and in accordance with the German law for animal protection. Virus and plaque assay. LCMV-WE was originally obtained from F. Lehmann-Grube (Heinrich Pette Institute, Hamburg, Germany) and was propagated on L929 cells (obtained from ATCC, NCTC clone 929). LCMV-Docile was donated by Prof. Dr. R. Zinkernagel (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) and was propagated on L929 cells. Mice were infected intravenously with either 200, 2 × 10 4 , or 2 × 10 6 PFU of LCMV-Docile or LCMV-WE. LCMV viral titers were detected by a plaqueforming assay on MC57 fibroblasts, as previously described 18, 56 . In brief, organs were smashed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS), titrated 1:3 over 12 steps in 96-well round-bottom plates, and plaqued on MC57 cells. After incubation for 3 h at 37°C, the overlay was added (1:1 mixture of methyl cellulose and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium), and the virus preparation was again incubated at 37°C. Plaques were counted 48 h later by LCMV nucleoprotein (NP) staining. For staining, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 1% Triton-X solution in PBS, blocked with 10% FCS in PBS, and stained with rabbit anti-LCMV NP antibody (made in-house). Enhanced chemiluminescenceconjugated anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (from Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as a secondary antibody (diluted 1:400 to the original concentration in distilled water). Plaques were detected by chemiluminescence (0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 + 0.1 M citric acid + 30% H 2 O 2 + o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride; all chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich). Flow cytometry. Tetramers were provided by the Tetramer Facility of the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). Cells were stained with allophycocyanin-labeled GP33 (GP33/H-2Db) and NP396 MHC class I tetramers for 15 min at 37°C. After incubation, the samples were stained with anti-CD8 (53-6.7) (eBioscience) or anti-CEACAM1 antibody (clone CC1, a kind gift from Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA) for 30 min at 4°C . For blood samples, erythrocytes were lysed with 1 ml BD lysing solution (BD Biosciences), washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Absolute number of GP33-specific and NP396specific CD8 + T cells were calculated by FACS analysis using fluorescing beads (BD Biosciences). For measurement of intracellular IFN-γ and TNF, cells were fixed with formaldehyde (2% formaldehyde solution in PBS) for 10 min, permeabilized with saponin (1%) solution, and stained with anti-IFN-γ (XMG 1.1) or TNF (MP6-XT22) antibodies (both from eBioscience). For splenocyte transfer experiments, GP33 + CD8 + T cells were stained as described above; in addition, cells were stained with anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD45.1 (A20), and anti-CD45.2 (104) antibodies (all from eBioscience). Human peripheral blood cells were stained with anti-CD8 (SK1) (eBioscience) and anti-hCEACAM1 (clone 18/20, provided by one of the authors (B.B.S.), made and labeled in-house) or anti-hCEACAM1 (CD66a-B1.1, eBioscience) antibodies, with corresponding isotype anti-IgG1 (labeled in-house) and anti-IFN-γ (4s.B3, eBioscience) antibodies. To check the expression of surface markers, cultured cells were stained with anti-PD-1 (RMP1-30, Invitrogen), anti-LAG-3 (ebioC9B7W, eBioscience), anti-TIM3 (RMT3-23, BioLegend), and anti-CD44 (Pgp-1, Ly-24, eBioscience) antibodies. All antibodies were diluted 1:100 to their original concentration in FACS buffer. For determination of total cell numbers, FACS beads were used (BD Biosciences). All stained cells were analyzed on an LSR II or a FACS Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with the FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). Intracellular cytokine staining. For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), splenic tissue was homogenized, and splenocytes were restimulated with LCMV-GP33specific peptide (PolyPeptide Laboratories, Strasbourg, France) for 6 h. Brefeldin A (BFA) was added 1 h after stimulation, and samples were incubated at 37°C, after which they were incubated with surface and intracellular markers at 4°C, as described above. Human PBMCs were cultured for 10 days in media containing 50 IU ml −1 IL-2 (Roche) and 1 µg ml −1 peptide (Flu, GILGFVFTL; CMV, NLVPMVATV; IBA Lifesciences, Goettingen, Germany) in the presence or absence of anti-hCEACAM1 antibody (40 µg ml −1 , clone 18/20). After 10 days, cells were restimulated with Flu or CMV peptide in the presence of BFA for 6 h, Fig. 4 CEACAM1 is involved in the formation of the immunological synapse. a Immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)-sorted CD8 + T cells from P14 × wild-type (WT) and P14 × Ceacam1 -/mice; cells were cultured with GP33-loaded bone marrow-derived WT dendritic cells (DCs) for 30 minutes at 37°C (n = 3) and then stained for Lck (red) and filamin A (green). Scale bars, 3 µm (main image) or 1 µm (insets). Images have been cropped for purposes of presentation. b Representative immunoblots and quantification of MACS-sorted WT and Ceacam1 -/-T cells after challenge with anti-CD3 in combination with anti-CD28 antibodies at indicated time points at 37°C. Cells were probed with antibodies to phospho-Zap-70 (Syk), Syk, phospo-PLCγ-1, PLCγ-1, phospho-Erk (p-p44/42 MAPK), Erk (p44/42), and GAPDH (n = 5-6). c Immunofluorescence of cultured CD8 + T cells from naïve P14 × WT mice; cells were activated (first line) or exhausted (second, third, and fourth lines) with GP33 peptide for 5 days at 37°C. After 5 days, cells were cultured with GP33-loaded bone marrow-derived WT dendritic cells (DCs) for 30 min at 37°C. One group of exhausted CD8 + T cells was additionally cultured with GP33-loaded bone marrow-derived WT DCs in the presence of isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (mAb; 40 µg ml -1 , second line) or T cell receptor (TCR)-independent stimuli such as anti-CD44 mAb (40 µg ml -1 ; third line) or anti-CEACAM mAb (40 µg ml -1 ; clone CC1, last line) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were stained for Lck (red), filamin A (green), and DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 3 µm. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 (Student's t test) . ns = not significant. One representative blot of five to six (b) blots and four histology images of 4 to 6 (a, c) experiments are shown (mean ± SEM; b). Immunoblot images have been cropped for purposes of presentation. Full-sized images are presented in Supplementary Fig. 5 after which they were subjected to various types of staining for surface and intracellular markers, as described above. Human PBMCs collected from healthy donors were processed from buffy coats obtained at the center for blood donation from the University Hospital Düsseldorf. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital Düsseldorf (study number 3240). These samples were anonymized, and no additional donor information was available. Cell surface staining to determine CTL activity was performed with BD reagents as described 57 . In short, T cell antibodies, anti-CD107a (1D4B), anti-CD43 (1B11), and anti-CD62L (MEL-14, all from BD Biosciences) were used for surface staining. Dead cells (propidium iodide-positive) were excluded from all cell surface analysis. Intracellular granzyme B (GB12, Caltag Laboratories) staining was performed with the Cytofix/Cytoperm Intracellular Staining Kit (BD Biosciences) after a 4-h stimulation of splenocytes with anti-CD3e (500A2) and anti-CD28 (37.51, both from BD Biosciences) antibodies. Splenocyte/lymphocyte transfer. As described above, 1 × 10 4 splenocytes from P14 × WT and P14 × Ceacam1 -/mice expressing CD45.2 as a congenic marker were injected intravenously into CD45.1 (WT) mice or P14 × CD45.1 WT into Generation of BMDCs. Primary DCs were generated by isolating bone marrow cells from femurs and tibias of mice, followed by the elimination of erythrocytes. Bone marrow cells were cultured in very low endotoxin-DMEM (Biochrom) supplemented with 10% (v v −1 ) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free FCS (Biochrom); 1% (v v −1 ) penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific); 0.1% (v v −1 ) 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (Invitrogen); and 10 ng ml −1 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (made in-house). Cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (100 ng ml −1 , Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h on day 6. On day 7 after harvesting, cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and 5 × 10 5 cells were transferred into a 24-well plate containing coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Confocal microscopy. CD8 + T cells were purified with the CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit (MACS; Miltenyi Biotech) according to standard techniques: spleens were homogenized in MACS buffer (1% FCS and 0.8% 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in DPBS). For histologic analysis, coverslips were coated with poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min before DCs were added. Cells were loaded with GP33 peptide (1 µg ml -1 ) by incubation for 2 h at 37°C with intermittent shaking. Cells were then washed with DPBS, after which an equal number of purified CD8 + T cells were added at 37°C. Purified CD8 + T cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% (v v −1 ) LPS-free FCS (Biochrom); 1% (v v −1 ) penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific); and 0.1% (v v −1 ) 50 mM β-ME (Invitrogen). After 30 min of incubation, cells were washed with DPBS and were then fixed (with 2% formaldehyde in DPBS) and permeabilized (with 0.1% Triton-X in DPBS). Nonspecific antigens were blocked with 2% BSA in DPBS for 15 min. Cells were then stained with anti-Lck (3A5, sc-433; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-filamin A (ab11074; Abcam), and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Invitrogen) antibodies. Fluorescently labeled anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and anti-goat (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies were used to detect the signals. Antibodies were diluted 1:250 to their original concentration in blocking solution and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. For in vitro activation and exhaustion of T cells, purified CD8 + T cells were cultured in media as described above. Next, 1 × 10 6 P14 CD8 + T cells were activated by the addition of GP33 peptide (1 µg ml -1 ) on day 0 and were exhausted by the addition of GP33 peptide (1 µg ml -1 ) to the culture media on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Isotype IgG (40 µg ml -1 ), anti-CD44 (40 µg ml -1 , clone IM7; BioLegend), and anti-CEACAM1 (40 µg ml -1 , clone CC1) mAbs were added for 30 min, along with activated and exhausted P14 CD8 + T cells. Images of stained sections were acquired with a confocal microscope (Leica SP8 gSTED; Leica Microsystems) with a ×40 zoom objective. Imaris software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was used for 3D reconstruction. Histology. Histologic analyses of snap-frozen tissue were performed with a mAb to anti-CD45R (B220; RA3-6B2) and anti-CD90.2 (53-2.1) (both from eBioscience). Biotin anti-CD169/SIGLEC1 (MOMA-1) (Acris) antibody was used to stain CD169 macrophages. Sections were washed and stained with streptavidin antibody (eBioscience). In short, sections were fixed with acetone for 10 min, and nonspecific antigen binding was blocked in PBS containing 2% FCS for 15 min, followed by staining with various antibodies for 45 min. All antibodies were diluted 1:100 from their original concentration in blocking solution. Images of stained sections were acquired with a fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE BZ II analyzer; KEYENCE Corporation of America, Itasca, IL, USA). Alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.
