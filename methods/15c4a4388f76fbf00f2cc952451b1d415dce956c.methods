All patients and health care workers with SARS at five hospitals in Hong Kong (Prince of Wales Hospital, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Tai Po Hospital, North District Hospital, and Shatin Hospital) were included in the study. The study period was from February 28 to June 8, 2003. The case definition of SARS by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was used (1). In March 2003, there was a major SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. From March 6 to 11, more than 50 health care workers were infected; subsequently, personal protective equipment was required for all health care workers. We divided the study subjects into three groups: health care workers who were infected because of unprotected exposure (before March 12), health care workers who were infected after implementation of compulsory protective measures, and patients (i.e., non-health care workers). Because we sought to evaluate the disease transmission rate in household members, subjects who were infected in hospital and had not been discharged home, and thus had no close contact with household members, were excluded. All patients and health care workers admitted with SARS were interviewed by a nurse or doctor, and information on personal details and the number of household contacts was collected. We searched the SARS registry (2), a mandatory reporting of SARS cases by the Government of Hong Kong, to determine if any persons living in the same household as infected persons were also diagnosed with SARS.
