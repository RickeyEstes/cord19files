We developed pandemic influenza tabletop exercises that built on the "Day After" methodology developed by Millot, Molander and Wilson [25] and described elsewhere in greater detail [1] . Countries in three different geographic regions participated: Southeast Asia (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam), the Middle East (Israel, Jordan and Palestine) and East Africa (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda). Countries that participated in the exercises were included because they were all part of sub-regional disease surveillance networks established in part through funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Some countries not included in these networks were invited to observe the exercises. Countries ranged in their past experience with preparedness exercises with some countries having extensive past exercise experience (such as Israel, Vietnam, China and Thailand) and other countries having minimal past exercise experience (such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Uganda). Exercises were developed and conducted by exercise planning teams that included external exercise development experts from the RAND Corporation as well as senior health leaders from each of the respective localities and/or countries represented in the exercise. There were three different levels of exercises: sub-national (e.g., one or more provincial areas), national (e.g., one country) and sub-regional (e.g., multiple countries from one geographic region). All exercises were multi-sectorial in nature meaning that they involved representatives from more than one sector of government. Examples of sectors included were health, agriculture, defense and environment. Each exercise focused on three to six different broad topic areas such as surveillance and information sharing, disease control, and communications that were identified in previous exercises as important [2, 12] . Because Thailand had considerable previous experience with exercises, it designed and conducted its sub-national exercise with limited involvement from representatives at RAND. Exercise discussions focused on one topic area at a time each lasting from 30 to 90 minutes. Participants of exercises were selected by the exercise planning team and differed from exercise to exercise, but all exercises included representatives from the health sector of the locality and/or country represented. They also included senior leaders from at least one other non-health sector. In addition to participants, exercises also had "observers" who were invited to watch the exercise but did not directly engage in exercise discussions. All exercises were led by one or two exercise "facilitators" who directed the exercise discussion and probed participants for more information. In general, exercise facilitators can represent a range of disciplines from media professionals to health professionals. In these exercises the facilitators were all health officials or health researchers who were trained in the facilitation of exercises and who had extensive experience facilitating past exercises. Exercises presented participants with a future scenario that involved an unfolding pandemic influenza crisis at different stages. They were required to respond to the scenario with the actions they would take if the scenario were actually occurring. Exercise facilitators were given discussion points and probes to keep the discussion focused and moving forward. Each section of the exercise ended with participants being asked to make concrete decisions for the topic area being discussed before moving on. The exercise concluded with a debriefing in which all participants evaluated their own response in light of what they learned during the exercise. All exercise participants were asked to complete an evaluation form immediately after the exercise, before leaving the room. Typically, they spent about 15 minutes to respond to these questions. Six of the exercises were rated for their quality through five Likert scale questions: the overall quality of the exercise (1 = poor; 5 = excellent); the quality of the exercise discussions (1 = poor; 5 = excellent); the exercise identified important key gaps in preparedness (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree); the exercise helped participants to better understand the roles and responsibilities of agencies and organizations responding to an influenza pandemic (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree); and the exercise generated information that participants planned to use (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). The remaining six exercises asked participants three different qualitative questions: what was the importance of the exercise; what are the most important actions that should be taken based on the exercise; and what suggestions do you have to help improve future exercises. In addition to participant evaluations, detailed After Action Reports (AARs) were developed for each exercise that summarized the exercise discussions and highlighted key aspects of each exercise. In January 2013, health leaders who were involved in the planning of the exercises from a subset of countries participated in brief semistructured face-to-face interviews to discuss how their country followed up with the exercises and the current state of their exercise program. Health leaders included health officials working for the ministry of health in their respective countries. These health leaders were all directors of departments (such as communicable disease) within their ministry.
