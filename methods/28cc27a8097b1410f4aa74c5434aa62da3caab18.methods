4.5.6. Method C. A mixture of freshly crystallized carboxylic acid 14a (1.5 g, 6.27 mmol) and freshly prepared PPA (30 g) was heated at 105 C for 45 min. The reaction mixture was cooled, neutralized with satd NaHCO 3 solution and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3Â30 mL). The combined extracts were washed with H 2 O (3Â30 mL), brine (30 mL), dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude products 15a (0.86 g, 62%) which were purified on a small silica gel column using CH 2 Cl 2 as eluent (0.69 g, 50%). Recrystallization from cyclohexane gave pure 15a (0.56 g, 40.4%); R f ¼0.52 (CH 2 Cl 2 /Acetone, 3/1). [2,3-b] quinolizine -6,10-dione (15b) This product was obtained from 14b (1.5 g, 6.27 mmol) and PPA (30 g) at 110 C for 1.5 h in the same way as for 14a, yield 0.73 g, 52.6% (cyclohexane); R f ¼0.42 (CH 2 Cl 2 /Acetone, 3/1).
