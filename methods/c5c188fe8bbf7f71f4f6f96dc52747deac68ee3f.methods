Clinical specimens. We recruited 46 patients infected with H7N9, 21 patients infected with H1N1 and 6 healthy volunteers. The flowchart of our recruit and their basic clinical characteristics are described previously 11 . This study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Beijing Chao-yang Hospital and China CDC. The Declaration of Helsinki was strictly followed. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Human pharyngeal swabs (or sputum specimens) and peripheral venous blood from all patients were collected in specimen tubes with Hank's buffer on the first day of admission and throughout the course of the illness. The laboratory confirmation of H7N9 virus and H1N1 virus infection were performed using the protocols described previously 2,6,7 . We obtained written informed consent from all of the participants or their guardians.
