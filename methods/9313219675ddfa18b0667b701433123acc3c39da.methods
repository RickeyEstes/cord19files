Mice. WT C57BL/6J were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. TRIM56 KO mice (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities. Male and female mice aged 6-14 weeks were used. Primary bone marrow and peritoneal cavity cells were collected from WT and TRIM56 knockout mice for BMDMs and BMDCs. All experiments were approved and done according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California. Sample sizes were estimated based on previous similar studies for innate immunity. Animal experiments were not randomized or blinded. Reagents, constructs and cell culture. The reagents were purchased from the following companies: HT-DNA and anti-FLAGM2-agarose (Sigma); pdAdT, pdGdC, pI:C (Invivogen); and cGAMP (Biolog, Germany). To clone mouse TRIM56, we purchased an expressing plasmid (Addgene). Mouse TRIM56-V5 constructs were created by subcloning the PCR products into pEF-IRES-puro. Mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR was used to create mouse TRIM56 Mut, which was subcloned into pEF-IRES-puro. Primers used for cloning are presented in Supplementary Table 1 . The constructs were sequenced by Genewiz and were identical to reference TRIM56 sequences except for the defined mutations. HEK293T (ATCC; CRL-3216), L929 WT (ATCC; CCL-1), L929 cGAS knockout 36 , and Vero cells (ATCC; CCL-81) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL) containing 4 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293T, L929, and Vero cells are authenticated by ATCC and were not further validated in our laboratory. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines stably expressing cGAS were generated using a standard selection protocol with 2 µg/ml of puromycin (Invitrogen). Target sequences to generate stable cell lines are presented in Supplementary Table 2 . All cell lines used during these studies tested negative in bi-monthly mycoplasma screening. Mass spectrometry. HEK293T cells were collected 48 h after transfection with cGAS-FLAG and/or TRIM56-V5 and lysed with NP-40 buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [vol/vol] NP-40) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Post centrifugation, supernatants were mixed with a 50% slurry of FLAG M2 beads (Sigma, M8823), and the binding reaction mix was incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Precipitates were washed extensively with lysis buffer. Proteins bound to FLAG M2 beads were eluted and separated in a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). After Coomassie brilliant blue staining, protein bands corresponding to the cGAS-FLAG were excised and separately analyzed by ion-trap mass spectrometry at the Harvard Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility in Boston, MA 50 . SiMPull assay. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated quartz slides with flow chambers were obtained according to previous protocols. A PEG surface was coated with Neutravidin (0.05 mg/ml) followed by anti-GFP or V5 (rabbit, 5 μg/ml) antibody conjugated with biotin (Rockland) and incubated for another 5 min in T50 (10 mM Tris pH 8 and 50 mM NaCl). Enhanced GFP-fused cGAS cell lysates were added to the antibody-coated surface and incubated for 5-10 min. The exposure time was 30 ms and the single-molecule signals were processed with a custom-edited IDL and Matlab program. Dual luciferase assay. HEK293T cells were seeded into 12-well plates. Twentyfour hours later, the cells were transfected with 100 ng of IFNβ luciferase reporter plasmid and 20 ng of TK-renilla luciferase. In addition, 100 ng of plasmid encoding human or mouse cGAS, 50 ng of plasmid encoding STING, or 400 ng TRIM56 was transfected. Forty-eight hours after transfection, whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to the Dual-Glo luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Results are presented with Renilla luciferase levels normalized by the firefly luciferase levels. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were collected in 1% NP-40 buffer and quantified by BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by semi-dry transfer at 25 V for 40 min. All membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBST) and probed overnight with the indicated antibodies, which were diluted in the blocking buffer solution at 4°C. Primary antibodies included mouse FLAG (Sigma, F3165), rabbit V5 (Bethyl Laboratories, A190), and mouse VU-1 (Life-Sensors, VU101). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated on membranes in 5% milk in TBST, and bands were developed with ECL reagent (Thermo Scientific) and imaged using a Fuji LAS-4000 imager. For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested and then lysed in 1% NP-40 buffer supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After preclearing with protein A/G agarose beads for 1 h at 4°C, whole-cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. A 50% slurry of FLAGM2 beads (Sigma, M8823) was added to 1 ml of cell lysates and incubated at 4°C for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted with SDS loading buffer by boiling for 5 min. Full-length uncropped blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 10 . Protein purification. MBP-cGAS (mouse) fusion protein (151-522 AA) and full length were expressed in BL21 (DE3, RIPL strain). Escherichia coli were grown at 37°C until reaching OD 600 = 0.6. The temperature was then shifted to 18°C and grown overnight by adding 1 mM IPTG. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed with 1% NP40 buffer. Clarified lysates were mixed with Ni-NTA agarose (Invitrogen) and washed five times with lysis buffer prior to elution of protein using 150 mM imidazole. The concentrated protein was aliquoted and stored at −80°C for the in vitro cGAS enzyme assay and binding assay. In vitro ubiquitination assay. The in vitro ubiquitination assays using TRIM56 (E3) and MBP-cGAS as substrates were performed using a non-radioactive assay (Enzo Life Sciences). Briefly, assay components (10× Ubiquitinylation buffer, 1PP (100 U/ml), dithiothreitol (DTT) (50 mM), Mg 2 +ATP, EDTA (50 mM), 20 × E1, 10 × E2, TRIM56 E3, cGAS, 20xBt-Ub) were added to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and the tube contents were mixed gently. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The assay was quenched by addition of 50 μl 2× non-reducing gel loading buffer. It proceeded directly to western blot. In vitro cGAS activity assay. For in vitro cGAS enzymatic reactions, 1 μM MBP-cGAS or MBP-cGAS variant was mixed with 250 μM GTP and 10 μCi P 32 alpha phosphate radiolabed ATP in buffer [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT]. After a 1 h incubation at 37°C, the reaction was treated with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Roche) for 30 min to stop the reaction and 1 μl of reaction solution was spotted onto TLC plates (HPTLC silica gel 60 F254, 20 × 10 cm, cat. # 1.50628.001) with the solvent 1:1.5 [v/v] 1 M (NH4) 2 SO 4 and 1.5 M KH 2 PO 4 . To visualize the reaction, the TLC plates were air-dried and imaged using a Fuji Phosphor Imager. Viral plaque assays. HSV-1 strain 17+ were grown in Vero cells propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. BMDM cells were inoculated with virus in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 1 h. After incubation for the indicated times (0, 12, 24, and 36 h), culture medium was harvested and the viral titer was determined. Briefly, culture medium from BMDM cells was serially diluted in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and used to infect 80% confluent monolayers of Vero cells growing in six-well plates. After infection, the monolayers were rinsed and overlaid with 7% methylcellulose. Plaques were counted after 3-5 days. Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using the Prism 5 software (GradphPad Software, Inc). All data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's ttest with a minimum of n = 3. p-Values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data availability.
