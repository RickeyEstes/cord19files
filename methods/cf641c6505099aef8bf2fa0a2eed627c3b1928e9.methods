We proceeded to a complete review of the literature referenced since 1966 using Medline, Webspirs, CAB Abstracts, and Embase without language restrictions. The MeSH terms used were ''stab wound,'' ''injury,'' ''health personnel,'' ''accidental blood disease,'' ''occupational disease,'' ''occupational exposure,'' and ''blood-borne pathogen.'' Reference handbooks were consulted in extenso. The bibliographic references for each article, review, or book chapter were systematically researched. The inocula transmitted by blood transfusion, in the clinical laboratory, during accidental sharps injuries in the health care setting, or during dissection represent situations with rising transmissibility profiles (Fig 1) . When several cases of occupational infection of a given bloodborne pathogen were associated with various types of exposure, we described the case associated with the exposure with the lowest theoretic inoculum order to approximate the pathogen's transmissibility. Cases that occurred following exposure to aerosolized BBF were not included because it was not possible to differentiate between respiratory and mucocutaneous routes for transmission.
