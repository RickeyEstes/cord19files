This retrospective study was conducted at the University of Michigan Health System (Ann Arbor, MI) and Karmanos Cancer Center (Detroit, MI). Approval was granted by the institutional review board at each center. All adult patients ≥18 years of age who underwent UCBT at the 2 study centers between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015 were included in this study. Medical records were reviewed to identify infectious complications from 6 months before UCBT and for 2 years after transplantation; demographic information, underlying hematologic diseases, conditioning regimens, prophylaxis, time to engraftment, episodes of infection, their treatment, and outcomes were collected. Patients who experienced relapse of underlying malignancy after UCBT were excluded from further analysis from the date relapse was documented. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. Infectious episodes were defined as episodes of fever or hemodynamic instability for which antimicrobial therapy was initiated and which were separated by at least 48 hours from previous episodes. Day of episode was counted as the first day of antimicrobial administration. The timing of neutrophil engraftment after UCBT was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days when the absolute neutrophil count was >500/μL. Graft-versushost disease, veno-occlusive disease, and other complications related to the transplant, including infection, were defined in accordance with NCCN Guidelines [14] . Conditioning regimens were classified as either myeloablative or reduced-intensity using criteria proposed by Bacigalupo et al [15] . National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria were used for the definition of invasive fungal infections [16] . Cytomegalovirus infection and end-organ disease were defined by current consensus definitions [17] . Routine screening for CMV viremia was not performed; molecular testing for CMV, HHV-6, and Epstein-Barr virus was performed with febrile episodes. Patients received antibacterial prophylaxis, typically with a fluoroquinolone, starting on the day of transplant and continuing until engraftment; antibacterial prophylaxis was restarted with subsequent neutropenia or GVHD. Antifungal prophylaxis was initiated by day 5 posttransplant and was continued through engraftment. Viral prophylaxis with acyclovir was started on the day of transplant and continued for at least 1 year; routine prophylaxis for CMV was not given. Pneumocystis prophylaxis with either pentamidine or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was started at day 30, provided neutrophil engraftment had occurred. We conducted descriptive data analyses for all variables. Student's t test, Fisher's exact test, and one-way analysis of variance were used to determine differences between groups. All statistical analyses were completed using SPSS software, version 24.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
