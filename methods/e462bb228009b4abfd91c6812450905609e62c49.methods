EI activities are conducted by a team of three epidemiologists in the EIZ team within PHE. More than 100 web-based resources are systematically reviewed by one of the epidemiologists from 07.00 to 17.00, 5 days per week. Certain sources are checked for urgent reports out of hours and at weekends. The on-duty epidemiologist manually navigates through each of the sources, reviewing them for new information. Standard operating procedures (SOP) are followed to ensure consistency in the performance of duties and optimal efficiency (for a summary of the SOP, see https://www.gov. uk/government/publications/emerging-infections-and-zoonosesepidemic-intelligence-scanning-procedures/epidemic-intelligence-scanning-process). Sources include both automated and manual aggregated surveillance systems (e.g., HealthMap and ProMED); informal information sources (e.g., Twitter); Google search terms, Google alerts, and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds (a type of web feed that consolidates information sources in one place and provides updates when a site adds new content). Official sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Official Resources (NOR), such as ministries of health or other government resources, are searched for updates on specific events being monitored. International and local news media (collectively termed 'media') are reviewed for updates on specific events, as well as informal reports of disease outbreaks. The number and types of sources reviewed change reactively. Peer-reviewed journals that publish articles on relevant emerging infections, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, and The Lancet, are monitored using RSS feeds and Table of Contents alerts. Information is occasionally obtained from restricted resources, where the information is not yet in the public domain. When this occurs, a targeted web search is conducted (including use of Twitter and Google search terms) to see if any of the information is publicly available to allow dissemination of the information without compromising the restricted resources. Results from the daily systematic scan are discussed with other EI colleagues as necessary and logged in a Microsoft Access database (Microsoft, 2013) . If an event is reported that appears unusual or worrying (such as an outbreak of an infectious disease with high morbidity or mortality), an informal risk assessment is also conducted to determine whether the event has the potential to quickly become a public health threat to the UK and whether any immediate action is required. The public health significance of incidents is determined using similar questions to the IHR framework for assessment and notification of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2005a). For example, a determination is made as to whether there are unexpectedly high rates of illness or death, and whether there is the potential for spread beyond national borders. Due to the inevitable delay in confirming a diagnosis, disease outbreaks are often initially reported as undiagnosed disease events, thus particular attention is paid to these types of reports. When an initial report of an emerging situation or undiagnosed disease/outbreak is found, a more targeted scan is conducted to determine the validity and significance of the report. Results from the daily scan are used for many purposes, including providing daily updates of ongoing and emerging incidents to senior managers and government stakeholders; advising on current outbreaks and emerging risks, improving situational awareness of decision-makers across government, facilitating risk assessments, and generating briefings on international incidents. A public facing report summarizing ongoing and emerging incidents is produced on a monthly basis (https://www. gov.uk/government/publications/emerging-infections-monthlysummaries). In this study, a descriptive analysis of unique emerging infection events captured by PHE's EI system between January 2013 and December 2017 was conducted, focusing on sources of data (initial and definitive) and the geographic location of events. Initial sources are defined as those that are actively monitored for information and are the source of the first report of an event that is found by the EI system (e.g., a Tweet from a journalist or a Google Alert to a local news site). Initial sources are often neither the original nor conclusive source of intelligence, and information contained may require validation before further reporting. In these cases a definitive source of the quoted information or intelligence is searched for. A definitive source is defined as either the original place the information was published (e.g., ministry of health press release or a media report of a ministry of health press conference where an official release has not been published) or the most authoritative or conclusive resource (e.g., the WHO, ministry of health website, or US CDC). Initial sources of information are recorded to determine the utility of actively monitoring certain resources, and to allow the SOP to be revised as appropriate following review. For the purposes of this study, multiple entries with the same information on the same event/topic were removed. The top five infections in terms of number of entries were analysed to determine the timeliness and effectiveness of PHE's EI surveillance system.
