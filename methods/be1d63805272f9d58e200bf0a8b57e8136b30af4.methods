Our overall aim is to discover aspects of the relationship between a virus and its host. Our approach is to develop a model that is able to predict the host of a virus given its sequence; those features of the sequence that prove most useful are then assumed to have a special biological significance. Hence, an ideal model is one that is parsimonious and easy to interpret, whilst incorporating combinations of biologically relevant features. In addition, the interpretability of the results is improved if we have a simple learning algorithm which can be straightforwardly verified. Formally, for a given virus family, we learn a function g : S?H, where S is the space of viral sequences and H is the space of viral hosts. The space of viral sequences S is generated by an alphabet A where, jAj~4 (genome sequence) or jAj~20 (primary protein sequence). Defining a function on a sequence requires representation of the sequence in some feature space. Below, we specify a representation w : S?X , where a sequence s[S is mapped to a vector of counts of subsequences x[X 5N D 0 . Given this representation, we have the well-posed problem of finding a function f : X ?H built from a space of simple binary-valued functions.
