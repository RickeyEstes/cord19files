To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model (17) to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of 26th January 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between 1st December 2019 and 1st January 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between 29th December 2019 and 23 rd January 2020; proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between 29 th January and 4 th February 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (i.e. top 20 most at risk), by date of confirmation, as of 10th February 2020; data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between 16 th January and 11 th February 2020 (full details in the Appendix). In the model, individuals were divided into four infection classes ( Figure 1 ): susceptible, exposed (but not yet infectious), infectious, and removed (i.e. isolated, recovered or otherwise no longer infectious). The model accounted for delays in symptom onset and reporting, as well as uncertainty in case observation (see Appendix for full model details). The incubation period was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 5.2 days (16) and delay from onset-to-isolation Erlang distributed with mean 2.9 days (2,15). The delay from onset-to-reporting was assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 6.1 days (2). Once exposed to infection, a proportion of individuals travelled internationally and we assumed that the probability of cases being exported from Wuhan to a specific other country depended on the number of cases in Wuhan, the number of outbound travellers (assumed to be 3300 per day before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January 2020 and zero after), the relative connectivity of different countries (18) , and the relative probability of reporting a case outside Wuhan, to account for differences in clinical case definition, detection and reporting within Wuhan and internationally. We considered the 20 countries outside China most at risk of exported cases in the analysis. Transmission was modelled as a geometric random walk process, and we used sequential Monte Carlo to infer the transmission rate over time, as well as the resulting number of cases and the time-varying basic reproduction number, R t , defined here as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual on each day in a full susceptible population. The model had three unknown parameters, which we estimated: magnitude of temporal variability in transmission, proportion of cases that would eventually be detectable, and relative probability of reporting a confirmed case within Wuhan compared to an internationally exported case originated in Wuhan. We assumed the outbreak started with a single infectious case on 22 nd November 2019 and the entire population was initially susceptible. Once we had estimated R t , we used a branching process with a negative binomial offspring distribution to calculate the probability an introduced case would cause a large outbreak.
