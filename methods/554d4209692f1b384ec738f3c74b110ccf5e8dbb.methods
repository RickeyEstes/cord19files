Chemicals and reagents. The following compounds were used: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich), AT7519 (CDK inhibitor, Selleckchem), ulixertinib (MAPK inhibitor, Selleckchem), IPA-3 (PAK1 inhibitor, Selleckchem), Y-27632 (ROCK1 inhibitor, Selleckchem), methyl 5-[2-(5nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-2-furoate (GRK2 inhibitor, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) and paroxetine (GRK2 inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich). For western blotting and immunofluorescence, the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK2 antibody (C-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-562, western blot 1:1000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778, western blot 1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-hEGFR (1005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-03-G, immunofluorescence 1:100 dilution, western blot 1:1000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti HA- Tag Virus infection and titration. For virus infection, cells were washed once with PBS supplemented with 20 μM Mg 2+ , 10 μM Ca 2+ , 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 % (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (infection PBS). In case of HAE cultures, three washes with infection PBS were performed. MOI-adjusted inoculum was subsequently added to the cells, which were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) or for 1 h on ice, in case infection synchronization was needed. After the adsorption time, the inoculum was removed and replaced by an appropriate amount of post-infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 20 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C. Infectious particles in the supernatants of the cells were quantified by plaque assay on MDCK cells. Receptor Tyrosine kinase (RTK) profiling. For the initial analysis included in Supplementary Figure 1a , a Proteome Profiler Human Phospho-RTK Array Kit (R&D Systems) was used. Briefly, A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and serum-starved overnight. The following day, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI = 25 PFU/cell for 5 or 15 min, lysed and 300 μg of each lysate were used according to manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were read using a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-4000 Systems (FujiFilm) and signal intensities were quantified by ImageJ. SILAC labeling and preparation of cell extracts. Five biological replicates of the phosphoproteomic experiment were performed using SILAC-labeled A549 cells. For each replicate, two T150 flasks of cells labeled with each of the following conditions were used: L (light), where A549 cells were grown in normal DMEM; M (medium), where A549 cells were grown in DMEM containing 4,4,5,5-D 4 lysine and 13 C 6 arginine; and H (heavy), where A549 cells were grown in DMEM containing 13 C 6 15 N 2 lysine and 13 C 6 15 N 4 arginine. Incorporation of the different isotopes was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Medium and heavy labeled cells were infected with IAV (A/WSN/1933) at an MOI = 25 PFU/cell for 5 and 15 min, respectively. Virus inoculum was prepared in infection PBS. As a mock-infection control, an equivalent amount of allantoic fluid from non-infected 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs was diluted in infection PBS and added to unlabeled cells (L). After the corresponding incubation time, the cells were directly lysed in SDS-lysis buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.2, 0.1 M DTT, Complete (Roche) and Phos-Stop (Roche)) and the different cell extracts were pooled and sonicated briefly to reduce viscosity. In order to concentrate the samples, proteins were precipitated using four volumes of −20°C acetone and incubated overnight at −20°C. Following centrifugation (11,000 × g, 1 h, 4°C), the precipitated protein pellet was washed three times with −20°C acetone, and then dried for 30 min. Protein pellets were solubilized in a smaller volume of SDS-lysis buffer and the protein concentration of the different replicates was determined using Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). Trypsin digestion and phosphopeptide enrichment. Protein extracts were processed using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) 58 . Briefly, 500 µg of protein were diluted in urea buffer (8 M urea in 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.2) and loaded into Microcon-30kDa Centrifugal Filter Units with Ultracel-30 membranes (Millipore). The proteins were bound to the membrane by centrifugation and alkylated using a 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) solution in urea buffer. After washing three times with urea buffer, the proteins were washed twice with 500 mM NaCl and three times using a 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer pH 8.5. Overnight on-filter digestion was performed with trypsin (Promega) at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) trypsin to protein, in a wet chamber at 37°C. The tryptic peptides were eluted from the filter by centrifugation and a second elution using 50 mM TEAB buffer was performed to increase the yield. A fraction of these peptides was collected for total proteome analysis. Phosphopeptides were enriched by Ti 4+ -immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Ti-IMAC) and TiO 2 affinity chromatography using magnetic microspheres (ReSyn Biosciences) and a magnetic separator (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1 mg of Ti-IMAC or TiO 2 magnetic microspheres were washed twice with 70% (v/v) ethanol and equilibrated once in 1% NH 4 OH and three times in phosphopeptide loading buffer (1 M glycolic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN), 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)). 500 µg of tryptic peptides were diluted in loading buffer, added to 1 mg of equilibrated magnetic microspheres and incubated for 20 min at RT with continuous rotation. After binding of the phosphopeptides, the microspheres were washed once with loading buffer and unbound peptides were removed by three washes with washing buffer (80% (v/v LC-MS/MS and initial data analysis. All data were acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, Ca), which was connected to an Easy-nLC 1000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific). 4 µl of the peptide samples in 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto a frit column (inner diameter 75 µm, length 15 cm) packed with reverse phase material (C18-AQ, particle size 1.9 μm, pore size 120 Å, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany), and separated at a flow rate of 300 nl/per min. Solvent composition of buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B contained 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. For the phosphoenriched samples, the following LC gradient was applied: 0 min: 2% buffer B, 110 min: 30% B, 120 min: 50% B, 122 min: 95% B. Survey scans were recorded in the Orbitrap mass analyzer in the range of m/z 350-1500, with a resolution of 60,000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra were acquired in the ion trap mass analyzer, using a normalized collision energy of 28%. The precursor ion isolation width was set to m/z 2.0, and a maximum injection time of 100 ms and an AGC target value of 3e 4 were applied. Charge state screening was enabled, and charge states 2-7 were included. The threshold for signal intensities was 1e 4 , and precursor masses already selected for MS/MS acquisition were excluded for further selection during 30 s. For total protein samples, the following LC gradient was applied: 0 min: 5% buffer B, 50 min: 25% B, 60 min: 32% B, 70 min: 97% B. Survey scans were recorded in the range of m/z 300-1500, with a resolution of 120,000 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. HCD spectra were acquired in the ion trap, using a normalized collision energy of 28%, an isolation window of m/z 1.6, a maximum injection time of 250 ms and an AGC target value of 1e 2 . The intensity threshold was 5e 3 and the dynamic exclusion duration was 25 s. A first round of peptide identification was conducted in Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) 59 and the phosphoenrichment efficiency and the number of identifications for the different samples was evaluated using Scaffold PTM 3.0. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE 60 partner repository with the data set identifier PXD009999. MaxQuant analysis. Data acquired on the Orbitrap Fusion were analyzed with MaxQuant v1.5.0.30 23 , searching a target-decoy database consisting of human (88,708 forward Uniprot entries) and influenza A virus (A/WSN/33, 9 forward Uniprot entries) sequences. As an additional control, a database containing chicken sequences (43, 340 forward Uniprot entries) was used for the identification of IAVinduced chicken proteins in our egg-grown stock. To identify contaminant proteins, the internal contaminant database of MaxQuant was used. Search parameters were: Cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine as variable modifications; SILAC labeling (Arg10, Lys8, Arg6, Lys4) as heavy labels; enzyme trypsin/P; two missed cleavages were allowed; and a minimum of seven amino acids per identified peptide were required. The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was set to 20 p.p.m. Peptide identifications were accepted until less than 1% of the reverse hits were retained in the list. The protein false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1%. For each phosphopeptide in the data set, the median of the MaxQuant ratios for the different replicates was calculated and the data from both TiO 2 and Ti-IMAC based approaches were combined for further analysis. Kinase prediction. The kinase prediction is derived from high stringency scores calculated using the Group-based Prediction System 3.0 (GPS 3.0, http://gps. biocuckoo.org/online.php) [27] [28] [29] , which ranks the likelihood that a particular kinase or kinase family phosphorylates a given residue considering the amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site. All predictions for the experimentally detected phosphorylation sites were ranked based on the difference between the site threshold and the site prediction score (Supplementary Figure 7) . In order to determine the selection parameters we would use, given that more than one kinase may be responsible for the phosphorylation of a given protein at a given position, we first worked on a subset of entries from Phospho.ELM (v.9.0, April 2015, http:// phospho.elm.eu.org/dataset.html). Briefly, we downloaded all abstracts (n = 1690) associated with all kinase-phosphosite pairs (rentrez 1.0.4) and selected those reported in the context of viral infection (n = 160 unique sites on 51 unique proteins, representing substrates of 12 major kinase groups, Supplementary Figure 2a) . We subsequently ran GPS 3.0 on the full sequences of these proteins and checked for conditions that allowed us to retrieve as many true positives per phosphosite Pi from all predictions for Pi (Supplementary Figure 2b , c) using the most stringent (2% false positive rate for serine/threonine kinases and 4% for tyrosine kinases) prediction threshold. The top five predictions in terms of the GPS-calculated score, which indicates the similarity of a detected phosphosite to a phosphosite in the gold standard Phospho.ELM; or the derived parameter Delta, defined as the difference between the GPS-calculated score and the GPS-provided cutoff per position, were found to include 70% of the true positives in this scenario and was chosen as the cutoff for the kinase-phosphosite pairs that we report. Top predicted kinases for the differentially phosphorylated sites at both 5 and 15 min post infection (log 2 FC ≥ 0.5) were considered as IAV-responsive kinases. The distribution of the top predicted kinases was then compared against the background of the total detected peptide population and enriched hits were identified. To determine if the enrichment for a particular kinase is significant, we performed a 1000-fold random selection of peptides from all peptides detected in our assay, where the number of peptides sampled per randomization is equal to the size of the hyperphosphorylated peptides at 5 or 15 min post infection (log 2 FC > 0.5 wrt mock). We subsequently compared the frequencies at which a top kinase is predicted for detected versus randomized conditions using Fisher's exact test. For a subset of the top predicted kinases (CDK1, CDK5, GRK2 and MAP2K1), significant enrichment cannot be established, given that their higher and more variable scores (µ CDK5,GRK2,CDK1,MAP2K1 = 17.34 + 5.33, µ other = 7.03 + 1.33) ensure their inclusion in the top calls for any phosphosite for which these kinases are predicted (Supplementary Figure 2c) . Others, including PAK1 and CBK1, tend towards enrichment (p value < 0.1 (Fisher's exact test) ) and, consequently, we cannot exclude their potential contribution to viral replication and included them in our analysis. The computer code is available upon request. Phosphorylation site consensus motifs. To find motifs potentially linked to phosphorylated sites associated with a kinase prediction, we first grouped sequences within +7 to +1 amino acids of the detected phosphorylation site (i.e., the phosphorylation site is at position 0); sequences can be included in more than one group based on the assumption that different kinases may be responsible for phosphorylation of a given protein at a given position. Sequences linked to each predicted kinase group were submitted to WebLogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/ logo.cgi) for motif detection (Supplementary Figure 7) . Inhibitor testing with WSN-Ren reporter virus. In order to quantitatively measure the effect of the different chemicals on viral replication, we used a reporter IAV derived from A/WSN/33, in which the coding sequence of the hemagglutinin protein was replaced by that of Renilla luciferase to allow real-time determination of viral replication 62 . The different kinase inhibitors were added to the A549 cells together with the reporter virus at an MOI = 1 PFU/cell. After synchronizing infection by allowing the virus to bind to target cells for 1 h at 4°C, the inoculum was removed and fresh culture medium containing the Renilla luciferase substrate (EnduRen Live Cell Substrate, Promega) and the indicated concentrations of the different inhibitors were added to the cells. The plates were transferred to 37°C and real-time luminescence measurements were performed at the different time-points indicated using an EnVision Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). siRNA transfection and cell viability assay. A549, MRC5 or Wi38 cells were reverse transfected with 30 nM siRNA (Qiagen) diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) using the RNAiMAX reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were either infected or cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). In addition, the CellTiter-Glo kit was used to assess the effect of the different inhibitors on A549 cells in the absence of infection. Western blot. Cell extracts were prepared using Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 350 mM DTT, 0.01% Bromophenol Blue). Samples were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare). Indicated primary antibodies were used with fluorescent secondary antibodies from Li-Cor and images were acquired on a Odissey Fc imaging system. Zn 2+ -Phos-tag SDS PAGE gels. For sample preparation, cells were lysed using a pH neutral buffer (20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.1, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 200 mM NaCl, cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche)) before Laemmli buffer was added. Gels were cast according to manufacturer's protocol (wako-chem) using Phos-tag™ AAL-107 (MW: 595, Wako Cat. No. 304-93525). Samples were run on the Zn 2+ -Phos-tag SDS PAGE gels for 4 h at 60 V and were blotted over night at 4°C onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, GE healthcare). Staining and analysis were done as described for standard SDS-PAGE. For the blots shown in Fig. 3d , e, the uncropped versions of the blots are provided in Supplementary Figure 8 . GRK2 translocation assay. Hep-2 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with HA-GRK2 (a kind gift from Dr. U. Quitterer, ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and pcDNA6A-myc-EGFR (a kind gift from Mien-Chie Hung (Addgene plasmid # 42665 63 )) using ViaFect (Promega) as transfection reagent. After infection with A/WSN/1933 with an MOI = 100 PFU/cell or stimulation with hrEGF (100 ng/ml), cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described below. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. For immunofluorescence staining, A549, Hep-2 or MDCK cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. In the case of HAE cultures, cells were fixed and stained directly on the membrane. After infection cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized using immunofluorescence (IF) buffer (PBS supplemented with 50 mM NH 4 Cl, 0.1% saponin, and 2% BSA). After 30 min in IF buffer, the cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the corresponding primary antibodies diluted in IF buffer. Cells were washed three times with IF buffer and incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in DAPI-containing IF buffer for 1 h at RT. Alexa Fluor-conjugated donkey anti-mouse/rabbit antibodies (catalog no. A-21202, A-21206, A10036, and A10040; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with IF buffer, before the coverslips or membranes were dipped in deionized water and inversely mounted onto glass microscope slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All microscopy images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5). The quantification of the nuclear NP signal was performed using an automated macro in ImageJ. Statistical analysis of the different images was done using PRISM software. For the endosomal colocalization analysis, Imaris software was used with standard co-localization settings and masks. Virus-like particle (BlaM1 VLP) production and infection. A/WSN/33-based VLPs harboring β-lactamase-M1 (BlaM1) fusion proteins were produced essentially as described by Tscherne & Garcìa-Sastre 42 . Briefly, HEK 293 T cells seeded onto poly-L-lysine-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) 6-well plates were transfected in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) with 2 μg BlaM1, 500 ng pCAGGS-WSN-HA, 500 ng pCAGGS-WSN-NA per well using ViaFect (Promega) as the transfection reagent (3 µl ViaFect/µg DNA). Medium was exchanged 6 h post-transfection with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin. VLPs were collected 72 h after transfection and treated with 5 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for efficient HA cleavage. Trypsin was inactivated with 10 μg/mL trypsin inhibitor from Glycine max (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to infection, MDCK cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of the GRK2 inhibitor for 1 h. For infection of MDCK cells in 24-well plates, 200 μl BlaM1 VLPs were added to the cells in the presence of the compound and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and incubated with the florigenic substrate CCF2-AM (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were analyzed on a FACSVerse System (BD) and dead cells excluded by a live/dead staining (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific). Mouse experiments. 9 week old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France) were injected i.p. with 5 mg/kg paroxetine in 5% DMSO in PBS or 5% DMSO in PBS (solvent) 24 h prior to infection. Mice were infected after ketamine (100 mg/kg)/ xylazine (5 mg/kg) anaesthesia (i.p.) with 10 PFU of A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pdmH1N1) (kindly provided by Dr. F. Krammer, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York) or inoculated with PBS via the intranasal route. Paroxetine or solvent treatment was repeated on d0, d1 and d2 pi. The first group of mice was sacrificed on d2 and d4 pi by controlled CO 2 exposure and lungs and snout were removed aseptically. Organs were homogenized in 1 ml sterile PBS using sterile 1/4" steel or ceramic beads in a 2 ml screw cap tube using a BeadBlaster 24 Position Homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific) at 6 m/s for two times 30 s with a 30 s break on ice. Homogenates were precipitated at 10,000 g for 10 min and clear supernatants were analyzed for infectious virus particles using standard plaque assay on MDCK. The second group of mice was monitored daily for weight loss and survival up to d7 when all infected mice reached humane endpoints. All animal procedures were in accordance with federal regulations (Schweizer Bundesamt für Veterenärwesen BVET), controlled by institutional (Direction de l'expérimentation animale d'universite de Geneve) and cantonal authorities (Commission cantonale de Geneve pour les expériences sur les animaux) and approved under license no GE/159/17.
