Excisional biopsy samples (entire lesions) are recommended for large pustules or vesicles that can be damaged by use of a smaller punch biopsy instrument. Deeper excisional biopsy samples are generally necessary for diagnosis of lesions, such as panniculitis, that are deep to the epidermis and dermis. Digital amputation can be required, particularly in dogs, for the diagnosis of claw bed lesions. Electrocautery or laser should not be used for small biopsy samples because the samples can be damaged and rendered nondiagnostic. Tissue forceps (small toothed) should grasp, if at all, only one nonaffected margin, preferably in the subcutis.
