Four algorithm modifi cations, designed to address shortcomings in the C2 algorithm, were tested. The fi rst modifi cation tested was stratifi cation by weekdays versus weekend days. Although many methods have been used to adjust for differing counts by day of week (11) , these methods may require customization to specifi c datasets and a long data history (up to several years). Our simple method is to stratify the baseline days used to calculate μ and s t into weekdays versus weekend days. This stratifi cation is denoted the W2 algorithm. For example, a 7-day W2 baseline for weekdays contains the most recent 7 weekdays. For unstratifi ed and stratifi ed analyses, the 2 days immediately before the index day were excluded from the baseline, a standard practice for C2, to avoid contamination with the upswing of an outbreak. The second modifi cation tested was lengthening the baseline period. Because a 7-day period may provide insuffi cient data for an accurate and stable calculation of μ and s t , we tested baseline periods of 7, 14, and 28 days. However, because we used data from <56 days before the index day, the stratifi ed 28-day baseline will include only ≈16 days for weekend days. The third modifi cation tested was adjustment for total daily visits. For the adjustment procedure, we used a formula in which n 0 = count of visits on the index day for the chosen syndrome (e.g., visits for the respiratory syndrome), and d 0 = the total number of facility visits on the index day, including visits that were both assigned and unassigned to any of the 11 syndromes. Σn i = total syndrome visits summed for all i baseline days. Σd i = total facility visits summed for all i baseline days. The formula for the adjusted expected value was e 0 = d 0 × Σn i /Σd i , which differed considerably from the mean of the n i if d 0 was high or low. Fewer visits for a given syndrome were thus expected on a day when the facility had fewer total visits. The estimated adjusted SD, s 0 , was taken as the mean absolute value of (n i -d i × Σn i /Σd i ) over i baseline days; that is, s 0 = Σ (abs (n i -d i × Σn i /Σd i ))/i. The test statistic adjusted for total visits was (n 0 -e 0 )/s 0 , analogous to the C2 statistic (n 0 -μ)/ s t , where μ and s t are the mean and SD of n i , the counts on baseline days. In the discussion below, we refer to this adjustment as the rate algorithm. The fourth modifi cation tested was increased minimum value for SD. We studied minimum values of 0.2 and 1.0. To test these modifi cations, 2 datasets were used: records of Department of Defense (DoD) facility fi nal diagnoses for September 2004-November 2007 and records of hospital emergency department (ED) chief complaints for March 2006-November 2007. The DoD data consisted primarily of data from outpatient clinics; however, ≈15% of the visits in this evaluation were from patients seen in emergency facilities and cannot currently be differentiated in the BioSense System. We studied the 11 syndrome groups designed to be indicative of infections resulting from exposure to pathogens plausibly used in a bioterrorist attack (4). The DoD data consisted of daily counts of patient visits with International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)-coded diagnoses categorized into the 11 syndrome groups. The hospital ED data consisted of freetext chief complaints, which were fi rst parsed for a specifi ed set of keywords, abbreviations, and misspellings and then categorized into 10 of the syndrome groups (1 syndrome, specifi c infection, was used for diagnosis but not for chief complaint data). Some ICD-9 codes and chief complaints may be included in >2 syndromes. However, counts of different syndromes were analyzed separately, not added together, and therefore are not double-counted in the analyses. For both datasets, we analyzed counts aggregated by facility. We included facility-syndrome combinations that had mean counts >0.5 over all facility-syndrome days in the study period. Many DoD clinics are closed on holidays. Therefore, for the DoD data, 11 days (days on which federal holidays are observed and the day after Thanksgiving) were recoded as weekend days for purposes of stratifi ed algorithm calculations (5) . Because hospital EDs typically are open on these holidays, no recoding for holidays was performed for this dataset. The mean count for each facility syndrome was calculated and categorized as follows: 0.5 to <2, 2 to <4, 4 to <6, 6 to <8, 8 to <10, 10 to <20, 20 to <40, and >40. Empirical distributions of the test statistic (e.g., number of SDs by which the observed count exceeds the expected value) were conducted separately for each dataset, algorithm, and mean count category; the 99th percentile value for each of these distributions was used as the cutoff value to defi ne an alert rate of 1%. For example, for the standard C2 algorithm in DoD data with mean count 4 to <6, a cutoff value of 3.9 was used because 1% of the facility-syndrome days had a test statistic >3.9. Because no attempt was made to fi nd and exclude real outbreaks from the data, these cutoff values defi ne an alert rate rather than a false alert rate, the latter being equivalent to 1-specifi city (12) . At a constant alert rate of 1% for all methods, the sensitivity for detecting additional counts was calculated by performing the following steps: 1) running the algorithm to determine expected values and SDs for each facilitysyndrome-day; 2) fi nding the 99th percentile cutoff value for the test statistic for each dataset-algorithm-mean count category as explained above; 3) for each facility-syndrome day, determining whether the observed count plus additional counts is greater than or equal to the threshold value (threshold value = expected value + SD × 99th percentile cutoff value); and 4) calculating sensitivity as the percentage of days on which the additional counts would exceed the threshold value and therefore be detected. Using this method, a single computer run can calculate sensitivity for detecting single-day additional counts on all days in the dataset; if the additional counts are spread over multiple days, separate computer runs would be needed (7).
