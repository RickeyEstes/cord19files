We performed a desk review of all HIV/AIDS policies issued by the Chinese government since the beginning of the epidemic. We limited our review to nationallevel policies that have been put in place or revoked over the past 10 years. We also reviewed available data relevant to selected policies. Data were collected from government reports and papers published in peer-reviewed journals.
