Surveillance of STD is done through mandatory casereporting from government facilities including STD clinics, designated provincial dermatovenereology centres, gynaecology and genitourinary clinics, maternity and children's hospitals, and other health providers in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and auto nomous regions of the country. Beginning in 2005, syphilis case-reporting moved from paper reports to electronic online submission. For each syphilis case, doctors or their assistants fi lled out a standardised STD reporting card with demographic (age in 10 year intervals, sex, home location, marital status, occupation, and education), clinical (diagnostic evidence, onset of symptoms, stage of syphilis, presence of other STD), and epidemiological information (route of acquisition). According to national guidelines, 13 primary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by one or more chancres and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confi rmation of Treponema pallidum in clinical specimens by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive non-treponemal rapid plasma reagin, or toluidine red unheated serum test and treponemal T pallidum haemagglutination, or particle agglutination assay for antibody to T pallidum; secondary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by maculopapular rash and, in many cases, lymphadenopathy, and laboratory test confi rmation as for primary syphilis; latent syphilis was defi ned as an asymptomatic case with a possible history of infection supported by two consecutive reactive non-treponemal tests (rapid plasma reagin), a reactive treponemal test (particle agglutination assay), and normal cerebrospinal fl uid; and tertiary syphilis was defi ned as a case with a history of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis with clinical manifestations involving the cardiovascular or central nervous system and laboratory confi rmation with reactive non-treponemal tests, or cerebrospinal fl uid abnormalities characterised by higher than normal amounts of white blood cells or protein. A case of congenital syphilis was defi ned as a neonate or child younger than 2 years aff ected by associated signs and symptoms such as rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, with an infected mother, supported by detection of T pallidum in lesions by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive serological test. 14 To increase the accuracy with which STD incidence could be assessed, a network of 16 sentinel surveillance sites was established in 1987 in areas with high rates of STD. This network was subsequently expanded in 1993 to 26 sites in various cities throughout China. A map of these sentinel sites is shown in fi gure 1. Each site has a designated organisational centre from either the dermatovenereology institute or Center for Disease Control hospital networks that coordinates mandated STD reporting from all STD service providers in their jurisdiction, which is in most places a city district or in some an entire city. These sites have strengthened manage ment, standardised diagnosis and treatment protocols, and established laboratory quality assurance measures, for STD surveillance. By comparing the number of STD diagnoses recorded in clinic and laboratory registries at sentinel sites with case reports in the surveillance system, twice-yearly quality control studies indicate that sentinel sites report all but less than 5% of newly diagnosed STD cases. Information from sentinel and non-sentinel sites is collected at the county level and reported quarterly to the next administrative levels until it reaches the National Center for STD Control, where all compiled surveillance data are stored in an electronic database (fi gure 2). EpiInfo (Version 1.1, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to analyse the results in this study. Total syphilis incidence refers to the number of new syphilis cases at any stage per 100 000 people per year. Because reports based on classifi cation of syphilis into primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis were not introduced into surveillance reports until 1996, incidence data before this year refer to total syphilis incidence. The reported incidence of congenital syphilis was calculated by dividing the number of new congenital syphilis cases by the number of livebirths in a specifi ed year. National population and livebirth data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. 15 The average yearly rate of increase in incidence was calculated as a geometric mean by use of the formula: (incidence at time n divided by incidence at time 1)^(1/[n-1])-1, where n is defi ned by the interval number of years.
