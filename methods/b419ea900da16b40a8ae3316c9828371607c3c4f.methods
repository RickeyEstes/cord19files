An exploratory descriptive correlation design was used to examine the level of maternal anxiety and feelings of control during labour among Hong Kong Chinese first-time pregnant women, and to examine the relationship between level of maternal anxiety and feelings of control reported by the women. A convenience sample of primigravid women in their latent phase of labour was recruited from the labour ward of a public teaching hospital in Hong Kong. They were Chinese, aged 18 years or over, could read and speak Cantonese and had not developed complications during pregnancy. Of the 94 women recruited, four were excluded from the study as one required emergency caesarean section because of suspected fetal distress, and three required epidural analgesia for pain control, giving a final sample of 90 (96% response rate). According to Cohen (1992) , this was the recommended minimal sample size to determine study relationships with a medium effect size (r Â¼ 0.3) at 5% level of significance and a power of 0.8. The study was carried out in the obstetric unit of a public teaching hospital in Hong Kong during the period of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) endemic. As a precautionary measure, no visitor was allowed to enter the hospital. The dominant model of care in the unit was medical and supported the active management of labour. This meant that most women had their labour induced or augmented; all women in labour abstained from food and drink, and received continuous electronic fetal monitoring. In addition, each woman was required to have 4-hourly and 2-hourly vaginal examinations, respectively, during the latent and active phases of their labour. The use of continuous fetal monitoring restricted women to a lateral position on the labour ward bed, and to give birth in the lithotomy position. Moreover, episiotomy was routinely carried out for every primigravida. Women at low risk were classified as a midwifery case according to the hospital protocol; this meant that women in labour were cared for by midwives without the involvement of an obstetrician unless a complication was detected. One midwife usually took care of more than one woman in labour at any given time. About 2 hrs after giving birth, women were transferred to a postnatal ward where a new team of midwives took care of them and their babies. The LAS was developed by Hodnett (1982) . It is a self-report scale designed to measure feelings of control during childbirth. The LAS consists of 29 short affirmative statements (e.g. 'I felt confident' and 'I felt tense'). Respondents were asked to rate each statement on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (representing rarely) to 7 (representing almost always). Possible total scores for the LAS range from 29 (indicating feelings of control rarely) to 203 (reflecting feelings of control almost always). The reported internal consistency of the LAS ranges from 0.91 to 0.98 (Hodnett and Abel, 1986) . Hodnett and Simmons-Tropea (1987) claimed that LAS scores remained stable at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months postpartum. In the present study, the Chinese version of LAS (c-LAS) was used, which has demonstrated high internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87, comparable to the previous findings reported by Law (2003) . Women's self-reported levels of anxiety during labour were measured with a 10 cm VAS, with Chinese verbal anchors at either end ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much so). Women indicated their response by adjusting the pointer on the VAS-A ruler. The intensity of anxiety was calculated in centimetres by measuring from zero end of the ruler to the woman's mark. The criterion-related coefficients for measuring anxiety in childbirth are 0.42-0.91 (Guiffre, 1983) . A demographic sheet was used to record the woman's socio-demographic data and information on their attendance at antenatal classes. Obstetric data collected included mode of vaginal delivery, duration of labour, types of analgesia used and medical intervention. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committees of the institutions concerned. A pilot study was conducted with five women in the obstetric unit of the target hospital. Revisions and refinements were made to the instrument and data collection procedure before the main study. Minor corrections were made to the instrument to achieve a better understanding by the women. Women who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Each woman was provided with a consent form along with an information sheet outlining the purpose of the study, the right to refuse or withdraw at any time and assurance of confidentiality of the collected data. Data were collected by the researcher in the labour and postnatal wards between June 2003 and December 2003 on three occasions: (1) during the latent phase of labour when cervical dilatation was within 1-3 cm with effaced cervix (Bennett and Brown, 1999) ; (2) during the active phase of labour when the cervical dilatation was within 4-7 cm (Bennett and Brown, 1999) ; and (3) within 24-48 hrs after the delivery. On the first two occasions, women were asked to rate their anxiety levels at the respective state of labour by adjusting the pointer of the VAS-A ruler when they were able to respond during the period of uterine relaxation. The last set of data was collected in the postpartum ward where women were asked to recall and rate their overall level of anxiety and feelings of control during labour, using the VAS-A ruler and c-LAS, respectively. Women were not asked to rate their anxiety levels during the transitional phase when cervical dilation was within 8-10 cm (Bennett and Brown, 1999) , as they were likely to be suffering from the most intensive pain during this phase and would have found it difficult to respond to the questions attentively (Niven and Murphy-Black, 2000) . Data were analysed using the statistical programme for quantitative data analysis, SPSS for Window version 11.0. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed on variables. Frequencies, means and standard deviations were used to describe the characteristics of samples. Pointbiserial formula was used to correlate c-LAS with dichotomous variables, such as antenatal class attendance, marital status, mode of delivery and obstetric intervention. Interval and ratio data, including maternal age, VAS-A and c-LAS scores, were analysed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficient. The relationship between c-LAS and those ranking data, including educational level and family income, were analysed using Spearman's rho test. All correlation tests were two-tailed, with a value of po0.05 considered significant (Bryman and Cramer, 1994) . Three pairwise comparisons were made by using a paired t-test to determine if women differed in their mean anxiety score in the three time slots, with Bonferroni correction made to the level of significance of 0.017 (0.05/3) (Munro, 2001) .
