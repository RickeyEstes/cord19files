Identification of "Chikui"-related anecdotes If "good fortune" is seen as a way of being "successful in life," the dogma that "suffering a loss is good fortune" would suggest that "suffering a loss" (Chikui) is very likely to be what people need to do to be "successful" and can be identified and defined in behavioral terms. Accordingly, we searched for Chinese and foreign anecdotes of celebrities (successful people) in history, culture, literature, politics, science, and business. Ten psychology graduate students taking a decisionmaking course independently read through anthologies of celebrity anecdotes and identified those "behaviors selected by someone that result in an apparent loss of money, goods, time, health, opportunity, relationship, and even mianzi (face)." Hundreds of anecdotes were considered. Although the final selection of "Chikui"-related anecdotes may not be exhaustive, it can be considered fairly representative. Disagreements in raters' selections were resolved by discussion. The same individuals then independently rated each selected anecdote on two dimensions: item clarity and response appropriateness. Raters were blind to the purpose and predictions of the study. The following numbers of anecdotes were classified as "Chikui"-related: three of the approximately 24 anecdotes in Twenty-Four Filial Deeds (Chen & Smith, 2010) , five of the approximately 66 anecdotes in Li Ka-shing's Complete Biography (Sun, 2010) , 29 of the approximately 200 anecdotes in Stories of World Famous Celebrities (Cui, 2010) , two of the approximately 19 anecdotes in First Families (Y.Z. , and 15 of the approximately 141 anecdotes in Anecdotes of Celebrity (Ma, 2000) . Example anecdotes included those related by Li Ka-shing, Wang Lo Kat, the Rockefeller Family, Loo-Keng Hua, and Mahatma Gandhi in India. Generation and selection of "Chikui"-related scenarios A total of 54 anecdotes were identified as being related to "Chikui." We then rephrased each anecdote into a brief scenario with two options (Option A: the person described in the scenario chooses "Chikui;" Option B: the person described in the scenario does NOT choose "Chikui") for respondents. Fifteen graduate students studying psychology were then asked to choose from the two options for each scenario. According to a binomial distribution, if more than 10 of the 15 evaluators selected Option A, the scenario was retained as satisfying the relevant criteria. Otherwise, the scenario was eliminated from consideration (Siegel, 1956) . Accordingly, 27 scenarios were eliminated. Another three scenarios were also eliminated because a group of four scenarios told a similar story. As a result, a total of 24 scenarios (Appendix S1) were generated by rewriting the anecdotes of celebrities to serve as the items of the CLS. Following the logic of "walking in another person's shoes," we instructed the respondents to respond to each scenario as follows: Please carefully read the following scenarios and, based on your personal experiences, enter values between 0% and 100% to indicate the likelihood that you would act in the same way that is described. A greater value indicates greater likelihood that the respondent chooses "Chikui." The following is an example drawn from the 24 scenarios: Zhang went to a store to purchase some goods. After Zhang paid for the goods and went home, a representative from the store called and told Zhang that one of the 100-yuan bills was a counterfeit note, but the person was unsure whether the bill came from Zhang. Nevertheless, Zhang returned to the store and exchanged the money. Imagine that you were Zhang in this situation. What is the likelihood that you would do the same thing? ( ) Participants A total of three groups of college graduates were sampled. The first group comprised 1-year alumni of Shandong The third group consisted of 75 adults who graduated from university more than 20 years prior (30 women, 40%) and were aged 40 to 74 years (M = 49.56, SD = 8.46). The participants were adult passengers departing from Ji'nan West Railway Station, and the data collection took place in the waiting lounge of the railway station.
