Samples. The performance of the overall workflow or of its individual modules was assessed using a spectrum of different matrices that can be grouped into the five categories liquids, faeces, tissue, vectors, and food. The processed samples were mostly diagnostic specimens representating liquids (serum, cell-culture supernatant, bacterial suspensions, swab samples, tap water, and rumen); faeces (pig, bird and human) as example of a complex Scientific RePoRtS | (2018) 8:13108 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31496-1 inhibitor-rich matrix; organs like brain, heart, liver, lymph nodes, kidney, lung, and intestine to test the efficiency of the protocol on tissue; pools of midges and ticks, respectively, representing arthropod vectors; rocket, mushrooms, ham, meat loaf, pizza, strawberries as examples for different foods. In addition, TissueLyser and cryoPREP disintegrations were compared using goat lymph nodes and intestine from animals infected with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP; lymph nodes and intestine) that was available from an approved (Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments and the Protection of Animals of the State of Thuringia, Germany; Permit Number: 04-002/12) and previously published animal trial carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations 49 . We used samples containing a pre-diagnosed pathogen (see Table 2 ) and samples with unrecognized pathogen content (see Table 3 ). The known pathogens comprised in the samples represented the groups eukaryotic parasites, bacterial pathogens, and viruses. In addition, bacterial suspensions of exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, representing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively, and an endospore suspension of B. subtilis as example of nucleic acids protected by highly resistant envelopes were processed. For selected samples, a sequencing library was generated according to the Supplementary File 1 (Procedure, steps 48-120) and sequenced following the respective manufacturer's instructions. In addition, we sequenced selected consumables used in our workflow to investigate their impact on the final sequencing outcome. The samples are an RNeasy column taken from the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), the DNase (Qiagen) as used for the workflow, and the enzymes from the cDNA synthesis kit (Roche). The latter are the components "vial 2" (AMV RT), "vial 4" (Protector RNase Inhibitor), "vial 10" (2 nd strand enzyme) and "vial 11" (T4 DNA Polymerase). For all samples, we extracted RNA as described and DNA using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and prepared libraries as described in the Supplementary File 1. In addition, as a blank control, an 800-µl water sample (Roth) was processed with the present workflow. Sample processing procedure. Detailed easy-to-follow single protocols (modules) for all steps depicted in Fig. 2A including necessary chemicals and important remarks (reagent setup, troubleshooting, anticipated results) are given as Supplementary File 1. In the following, only procedures supplementing the detailed protocol for comparisons are outlined. Sample disintegration. We compared different sample disintegration techniques, namely the laboratory grinding mill Micro-Dismembrator (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), the TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the cryoPREP impactor (Covaris, Brighton, UK). Sample disintegration using the Micro-Dismembrator was essentially performed as described 27 . Using the TissueLyser, tubes prepared with the sample material, a steel grinding ball and 200-1000 µl AL buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were shaken for 150 s with a frequency of 30 Hz as previously described 50, 51 . With a Micro-Dismembrator (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), the samples were ground frozen in liquid nitrogen for 2 min at 2000 rpm in a 3 ml PTFE shaking flask with a 10 mm stainless steel ball and the frozen homogenate was further processed according to the detailed protocol (Supplementary File 1, from step 9). The cryoPREP protocol is given in detail in Supplementary File 1 (Procedure, steps 1-10). RNA was extracted following the detailed protocol and quality was checked with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using a RNA 6000 pico assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from Mycobacteria containing samples was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified regarding the content of mycobacterial DNA via real-time PCR (insertions element IS900 52 ). Bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic datasets. Obtained raw reads were analysed using the software RIEMS 28 to get an overview of the taxonomic composition of reads.
