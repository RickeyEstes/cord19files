The State of S達o Paulo has a population of more than 41 million inhabitants, with 598,473 live births in 2009, according to data from the Information Department of the Unified Public Health System (DATASUS) of the Ministry of Health. A case-control study was conducted that evaluated pregnant women living in S達o Paulo with confirmed infection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and hospitalized with SARI, defined as: fever and cough and dyspnea or pneumonia or respiratory failure or tachypnea or radiological alterations consistent with pneumonia or oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. The definition of SARI has been adapted from the one stated by the WHO to increase sensitivity in the detection of cases and controls [14] . In 2009, the Ministry of Health of Brazil established the compulsory notification of any hospitalized case of influenza associated with SARI and the inclusion of an epidemiological investigation into the Influenza-web database of the National Disease Notification System (SINAN). All hospitalized pregnant women who were notified with influenza associated with SARI and eventually died during the epidemic period from July 9 th to December 1 st 2009 in S達o Paulo were included in the analysis. For each death (case), four controls were randomly selected from those who recovered. The cases and controls were identified from the SINAN, using the following variables for selection: RT-PCR (positive for influenza A/H1N1pdm09), final classification (confirmed), evolution (recovered or death), hospitalization (yes), date of hospitalization, hospital and residence in the S達o Paulo State. The controls were matched by epidemiological week of admission date of the case to adjust for possible variations in access to treatment and clinical protocols. All pregnant women had a laboratory confirmation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from a sample of respiratory secretions using the RT-PCR method, performed at the Adolfo Lutz Institute, the public health laboratory [15] . For data collection, trained health professionals used two standardized forms: one to collect hospital record information and the second was used for home interviews. For the cases, the interviews were conducted with close family members, and for the controls, the interviews were conducted with the patients themselves. The hospital form included the following variables: pathological history, health care, symptoms on admission, admission to the intensive care unit, antiviral treatment (the Ministry of Health released the antiviral oseltamivir), use of antibiotics, complications, laboratory tests, radiological examinations, evolution, gestational and neonatal outcomes. The home form included the following variables: sociodemographics, history of a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for the influenza episode that resulted in hospitalization (after the onset of symptoms and before hospital admission date), vaccination history and gestational and neonatal outcome. Education level was classified as low (no schooling or incomplete primary), medium (complete primary or incomplete high school) or high (complete high school or university). Occupations were grouped using the occupational risk pyramid for the pandemic in the occupational safety and health Act of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-CDC, which classified the occupation risk for influenza infection as low (professional managers and other university and technical professionals without close contact with the population), medium (professionals in the areas of education, trade, service and administration with close contact with the population), or high and very high risk (doctors, nurses, other health professionals and support staff in the health services) [16] . A pre-test with 10 patients with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was performed to identify and correct any errors. The questionnaires are presented in S1 Data collection form and the complete data used in this study are shown in S1 Database. The study was started during the epidemic to support the actions of epidemiological surveillance, and the use of the data was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of USP (Protocol 2283, OF.COEP/312/11). Data collection complied with the recommendations of the National Health Council for Research in Human Beings, including the signing of a consent form. Clinical and demographic variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges or percentages, Mann-Whitney U or chi-square tests were used for comparisons, as appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate factors associated with death. For the multiple logistic regression, variables were selected with a p of <0.20 in the univariate analysis and those considered important for the adjustment. The initial model included: health plan; previous visit to a healthcare provider; the presence of at least one of the high-risk medical conditions for developing influenza-related complications (adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): asthma, neurological and developmental disorders, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hemoglobinopathies, endocrine disorders, immunosuppressive diseases and obesity, with the absence of these conditions as reference; the use of an antiviral [no use (as reference), 48 hours from the first symptoms, > 48 and 72 hours, > 72 hours], pregnancy trimester [1 st and 2 nd trimesters (as reference) and 3 rd trimester]. The data were controlled for education level and age. The Wald and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to evaluate the significance of the variables and test the fit of the model, respectively. Analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), version 17.0. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
