The scientific peer-reviewed literature on the effects of commonly-used gas-phase and particle phase air cleaners on indoor air pollutants in non-industrial indoor environments was reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of scientists with expertise in medicine, epidemiology, toxicology and engineering. The focus was only on air cleaning techniques for which indoor air flows through a device and is returned to the indoor environment ("fandriven" air cleaners). Technologies like "catalyst in paint" or other passive air purification materials, masks and other personal protective devices were not included. Botanic air cleaners that did not involve flow-through systems were also excluded. Air cleaning devices that are intended only for outdoor air intakes (e.g., filters in mechanical ventilation system) were not considered. Consequently the air cleaners reviewed included only: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA), adsorption, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), thermal catalytic oxidation (TCO), plasma, botanic air cleaners, ion generators, and electrostatic precipitators. The selected air cleaning technologies were reviewed regarding their efficiency to reduce/remove indoor air pollutants including particles, microorganisms, inorganic and organic gases; radon was not included. The effects on health and/or occupant performance were not considered. For example, we did not consider articles which only reported the effects of an air cleaning device on health unless the effects on air pollutants were also reported. The selected articles were limited to those which reported the tests involving pollutant concentrations within an order of magnitude of concentrations reported by the US EPA, WHO, and others to be typical in non-industrial indoor environments. This approach may have excluded some information related to particle filtration because standard test protocols are completed at elevated particle concentrations and there is general consensus that removal efficiency is not affected by standard test concentrations. Only demonstrated changes of concentration of one or more pollutants due to the use of an air cleaning device were considered, where "demonstrated" means that the methodology was validated and other effects such as air leakage and natural decay were considered. Demonstrated changes in odor intensity or perceived indoor air quality were also considered as evidence in this review.
