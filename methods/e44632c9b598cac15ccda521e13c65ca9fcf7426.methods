For complete methods, please refer to Supplemental material. Cohort Recruitment and Sampling. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board and the Rochester General Hospital Clinical Investigation Committee, and approved by the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease. All studies were carried out in accordance with these approved guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects (and their families). Healthy, full term newborns (≥ 37 weeks gestation) were recruited at approximately one month. Nasal samples were obtained after washing, essentially as previously described 5, 11 . For RNA recovery, the swab was immediately placed in RNA stabilizer (RNAprotect, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and stored at 4 °C. Cells were recovered by filtering through a 0.45 uM membrane filter. Cells were lysed, homogenized by passing through a 28 g needle and total RNA was recovered (AbsolutelyRNA Miniprep kit, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Library Preparation and Sequencing. Approximately 1ng of total RNA was amplified using the SMARter Ultra Low amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Libraries were constructed using the NexteraXT library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 to generate ~20 million 1 × 100-bp single end reads per sample. Read Mapping, Data Normalization and Filtering. Sequences were aligned against human genome version of hg19 using TopHat 12 , counted with HTSeq 13 and normalized for total counts (reads per million, RPM). We used a non-specific filtering strategy to remove genes with low expression values indistinguishable from background signal. These data area available in dbGaP; accession number phs001201.v1.p1. Gene Significance Analyses. We calculated a robust measure of expression variance for each gene, based upon the relationship between inter-quartile range and median values. For categorical variables such as gender and delivery method, we used SAMseq to identify genes with significant differences in mean expression (FDR < 0.05). For continuous variables such as gestational age and microbiome derived variables, we used both Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction 14 , to select significant genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05). To better understand the association between gene expression and clinical/demographic variables, we also used Levene's test for equal variance 15 , with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, to select genes that have significantly different variances between groups (adjusted p-value < 0.05). We performed canonical pathway analyses using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen) to identify significant pathways (p-value < 0.05).
