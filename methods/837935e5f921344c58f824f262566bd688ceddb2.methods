Camel serum samples (n = 86) from female dromedary camels aged 3 (n = 43), 7 (n = 25) and 10 and above years (n = 18) were collected between 2015 and 2017 from Bedouin households residing in the southern district of Israel (as part of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) National Control Programme) and were used for determining HEV seroprevalence in the local 1-humped camels. Human serum samples were collected from: Bedouins living in the southern district, in tribes that own dromedary camels (overall 305; 296 tested for the first time in this study and nine added from our previous study [21] ), non-Bedouin Arabs (overall 320; 297 from the present study and 23 from our previous study [21] ) and from Jews (195 samples presented in our previous study [21] ). All human samples were randomly selected using an age-stratified sampling design from the stored sera bank of the Israeli Centre for Disease Control. The samples were selected from those collected between 2009 and 2016, >20 years old who were born in Israel. The selection was enabled by the availability of basic demographic information including age, gender, place of residence (city), birth country and population group (Bedouins; non-Bedouin Arabs; Jews [28] ) for each sample in this sera bank. The socio-economic status was allocated on the basis of the given address using the socio-economic residential classification published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistic [29] . This socio-economic status is based on 14 variables including demographic characteristics, education, lifestyle, etc. and was divided into low (1-5) vs. high (6-10). Sera collection was approved by the Legal Department of the Israeli Ministry of Health.
