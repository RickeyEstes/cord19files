The research herd belonged to an artificial insemination test centre housing up to 330 Norwegian Red bulls under standardized conditions enabling registration of a number of phenotypic traits including weight gain and body conformation. Five times throughout the year, new bulls enter the test centre. At arrival, they are about 3 months old and they stay until a maximum age of 13 months. The bulls' age at arrival is similar to what is common in conventional Norwegian rearing units. The bulls' health is closely monitored by the resident veterinary surgeons. The centre has loose housing pens holding 15-25 animals. The animals are grouped in pens according to their age. There are computer-controlled concentrate feeders dispensing a concentrate formula containing 13.6 % protein and 6624 kJ per kg (Formel Favør 90, Felleskjøpet Agri, Norway). The allotment starts at 2500 g per day, and reaches a maximum of 4000 g at the age of 210 days. The concentrate consumption and body weight of the animal are recorded each time it enters the feeder. Grass silage is supplied ad libitum. The daily weight gain of the bulls in the centre is normally 1300-1400 g per day between 150 and 330 days of age. Starting on 24 January 2011, clinical signs of respiratory disease were observed in the herd. During the outbreak period, approximately three quarters of the bulls showed clinical signs of respiratory disease to some degree. At the time of the outbreak, isolation of the sick animals was not possible. The clinical signs of disease ranged from nasal and ocular discharge, coughing, polypnea (respiratory rate ≥60 movements/minute), fever, depression and anorexia to grunting with open mouth breathing and froth, stretched neck and death. Those showing decreased uptake of concentrate, weight loss, depression and strained respiration were given a standard treatment of 2 days of meloxicam injections and five daily injections of procaine penicillin to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Of the 265 bulls present at the onset of the outbreak, 14 (5.3 %) either died or had to be euthanized because of severe respiratory distress. At the time of the outbreak, about half of the bulls had been vaccinated with a respiratory pathogen vaccine including BRSV (Bovilis Bovipast RSP vet).
