The type II laboratory strain, FIPV 79-1146 (P100), was purchased from ATCC and virus stocks were prepared by infecting subconfluent CrFK cell monolayers at a high m.o.i. Cell culture supernatant containing virus was harvested at 8 h post-infection, centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min and stored at 280 uC. RNA was isolated from the cell culture supernatant using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the eluted RNA was stored at 280 uC. Type I FCoV RNA was extracted at postmortem from the jejunum of a cat with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of FIP. A 0.5 cm 3 cube of jejunum was placed into 2 ml RNAlater solution (Qiagen) and stored at 4 uC overnight. The RNAlater solution was then discarded and the tissue stored at 280 uC. RNA was isolated from the tissue biopsy using a Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin RNA II extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was stored at 280 uC. Amplification of viral RNA. Primers for PCR amplification of the FCoV S genes were designed using the Lasergene-6 Primer Design software (DNASTAR). In order to facilitate cloning of PCR products into the pCAGGS expression vector (Niwa et al., 1991) , the forward and reverse primers were designed to incorporate KpnI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The forward primers were also designed with a preferred Kozak sequence (GCCACCAUG) (Kozak, 1987) incorporating the S gene start codon (see Supplementary Table S1 , available in JGV Online). The FCoV S genes were amplified using a Superscript One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a 50 ml reaction containing RNA, 15 pmol forward primer, 15 pmol reverse primer, 1 ml Superscript II RT/Platinum Taq HiFi DNA polymerase enzyme mix and 16 reaction buffer was incubated at 50 uC for 30 min and 94 uC for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 uC for 15 s, 55 uC for 30 s and 68 uC for 4.75 min. The reaction was held at 72 uC for 7 min and then stored at 4 uC. Primer removal was done using a Qiagen PCR Purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant DNA and sequencing. Recombinant DNA procedures, including gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, modification and ligation of DNA, transformation of chemically competent cells and plasmid DNA isolation followed standard procedures (Ausubel et al., 1987) or were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector DNA (Invitrogen) and DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel using a Qiagen gel purification kit. Thermal cycle sequencing of PCR products and plasmid DNA was done with ABI v3.1 BIG DYE mix (Applied Biosystems) and, following primer removal, the reaction products were analysed with an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer. Sequencing primers were designed from the FIPV 79-1146 and the FCoV C1Je S glycoprotein gene sequences; GenBank accession nos DQ010921 and DQ848678 (Dye & Siddell, 2005) , and published vector sequences (see Supplementary Table S1 , available in JGV Online). Computer-assisted analysis of sequence data was done using the Lasergene-6 Seqman software (DNASTAR). Transfection of HEK 293T cells with plasmid DNA. HEK 293T cells were grown to 50-80 % confluency in six-well culture plates or six-well culture plates containing glass coverslips. Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche) was diluted (3 : 100) in OptiMEM (Invitrogen), mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Following the addition of plasmid DNA (1 mg per 100 ml diluted Fugene-6 reagent), the tube was mixed again and incubated at room temperature for a further 30 min. The Fugene-6/OptiMEM/DNA mixture (100 ml) was added to 5610 5 cells in a drop-wise fashion and the plates were agitated gently to ensure homogeneous mixing. Cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37 uC. Immunofluorescence for the detection of viral S glycoproteins. Transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with PBS containing 4 % methanolstabilized formaldehyde. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated at 4 uC for 1 h with saponin buffer (PBS containing 0.1 % saponin, 0.1 % sodium azide and 10 % FBS). The fixed, permeablized cells were incubated at 4 uC for 1 h with primary antibody (diluted 1 : 100 in saponin buffer), washed three times with saponin buffer and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a secondary antibody (diluted 1 : 10 000 in saponin buffer). After washing three times in saponin buffer, the coverslips were mounted in Vectasheild mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector) and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for the detection of cell surface expressed viral S glycoproteins. Transfected cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium and centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was washed twice in staining buffer (PBS containing 0.1 % sodium azide and 2 % FBS) and the cells were resuspended in primary antibody (diluted 1 : 100 in staining buffer) at 8610 6 cells ml 21 . After a 30 min incubation at 4 uC, the cells were washed with staining buffer and resuspended in secondary antibody (diluted 1 : 10 000 in staining buffer) at 8610 6 cells ml 21 . Cells were incubated in the dark at 4 uC for 20 min and then washed with staining buffer. Cells were resuspended in staining buffer at 8610 5 cells ml 21 and propidium iodide (PI) viability stain was added to a concentration of 50 mg ml 21 . Cell suspensions were placed on ice in the dark and analysed by flow cytometry using the FACScan system. Non-viable PIpositive cells were excluded based on light scatter and the remaining gated cells were analysed for fluorescence. Data were acquired and analysed using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Production of viral pseudotypes. Retroviral pseudotypes were produced using the three plasmid, transient transfection method in which HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with three plasmids expressing the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag/pol genes (pCMVi), the FCoV S glycoprotein (this paper) or vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein genes (pMDG) and an enhanced GFP reporter construct (pCNCG), respectively (Naldini et al., 1996; Towers et al., 2000) . Briefly, HEK 293T cells were grown to 80 % confluency in 25 cm 2 dishes. A mixture of the three plasmid DNA constructs (see Supplementary Table S2 , available in JGV Online) was prepared and added to a Fugene-6/OptiMEM mixture. The Fugene-6/OptiMEM/ DNA mixture was incubated at room temperature and was added to the cells in a drop-wise fashion. Plates were agitated gently to ensure homogeneous mixing and the cells were then incubated at 37 uC in 5 % CO 2 . Supernatant was harvested 48 and 72 h post-transfection, filtered through 0.45 mm filters and stored at 280 uC. Transduction of cultured cell lines with viral pseudotypes. Cell culture supernatant containing viral pseudotypes was supplemented with 160 mg Polybrene (Chemicon) ml 21 and added to subconfluent (50-80 %) cell monolayers [50 ml (ml cell culture medium) 21 ] in a drop-wise fashion. Plates were agitated gently to ensure homogeneous mixing and the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 uC in 5 % CO 2 . The expression of GFP was monitored at 520 nm with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. ELISA for the detection of S glycoprotein on viral pseudotypes. ELISA microtitre plates were coated overnight at 4 uC with cell culture supernatant containing retroviral pseudotypes diluted in coating buffer (100 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 100 mM NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6). Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and residual protein binding was blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20, 1 % BSA) for 1 h at 21 uC. Duplicate twofold dilutions of primary antibody in blocking solution (1 : 10-1 : 2560) were added to antigen-coated and uncoated wells at 21 uC for 1.5 h. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20 and APconjugated secondary antibody diluted 1 : 10 000 in PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 was added. After 1 h at 21 uC, plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 20. ELISAs were developed with Sigma Fast pNPP tablets (1.0 mg pNPP ml 21 , 0.2 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 buffer). Following a 1 h incubation at 37 uC, plates were read at 405 nm. Transduction of feline adherent polymorphonuclear cell cultures with viral pseudotypes. Heparinized whole blood was taken from specific-pathogen-free cats and 15 ml aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium and layered on to 10 ml Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). After centrifugation for 40 min at 400 g, the upper serum layer was removed, the polymorphonuclear cell layer was harvested and then washed four times in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were counted and taken up in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 % FBS, 1000 U penicillin ml 21 and 1000 mg streptomycin ml 21 to give a cell concentration of 2610 6 cells ml 21 . Aliquots of 250 ml were added to wells of a 24-well culture plate. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml fresh medium. This process was repeated daily for 3 days and then twice weekly. Cell culture supernatant containing viral pseudotypes was supplemented with 160 mg Polybrene (Chemicon) ml 21 and added [50 ml (ml cell culture medium) 21 ] in a drop-wise fashion to adherent feline polymorphonuclear cell cultures that had been maintained for 7-14 days. Plates were agitated gently to ensure homogeneous mixing and the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 uC in 5 % CO 2 .
