On the first day of admission, samples were obtained from throat or nasal swabs and immediately sent to the laboratory for RT-PCR. The nucleic acids were extracted using Ribospin TM vRD (GeneAll Biotechnology Co., Seoul, Korea), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were synthesized from the extracted RNAs with the cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea). All samples were tested using the Anyplex II RV16 (Seegene Inc.) kit. Blood tests were also conducted on the first day of admission. The normal ranges for ALT and AST varied with patient sex and age, and were defined as follows: for ALT, less than 40 IU/L for boys younger than 1 month, 32 IU/L for girls younger than 1 month, and 45 IU/L for both boys and girls older than 1 month; for AST, less than 71 IU/L for infants under 1 month, less than 63 IU/L for infants aged between 1 and 12 months, less than 60 IU/L for children aged between 1 and 3 years, less than 50 IU/L for children aged between 3 and 9 years, and less than 40 IU/L for children older than 9 years [1] . To compare the degree of increase in ALT and AST levels, we calculated the proportion of increase above the normal increase rates and defined this as the rates of increase in ALT and AST levels. The patients were divided into those with increased levels of ALT or AST and those with normal levels, to compare the two groups in terms of sex, age, length of hospital stay, white blood cell count, leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin, hema- tocrit, platelet, ALT, AST, protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels. Further, patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with those in the normal group, and blood test results were compared in accordance with the type of respiratory virus. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were analyzed using the unpaired 2-tailed t-test or analysis of variance, and categorical data were analyzed by using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all tests.
