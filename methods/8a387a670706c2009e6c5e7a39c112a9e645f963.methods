At trapping, infection status of the animals was unknown therefore high hygiene standards were applied to avoid accidental transmission. To detect naturally BoDV-1-infected animals, first samples of skin surface were taken directly on first day in husbandry and screened for the presence of BoDV-1 RNA as described below. Non-infected animals were sampled in the same way. In animals caught in 2013 (group 1: female #2, male #5, female #6), after an adaption phase of one month, samples of saliva, lacrimal fluid, skin surface, urine and excrements from the BoDV-1-infected shrews were taken weekly over a period of 4 weeks as necessary veterinary care. Initial veterinary care could be reduced in animals caught in 2014 (#9, #10, #12) and only an initial sampling was performed. As health monitoring, possibility of long lasting virus shedding after at least more than 250 days in the husbandry was investigated and infected shrews (group 2: female #2, male #9, male #10, male #12) were sampled again. Quantitative amplification of BoDV-1 RNA was carried out by real time RT-PCR as described elsewhere [22] by using commercially available kits for RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QIAsymphony RNA Kit, OneStep RT-PCR kit, Qiagen). Qualitative isolation of infectious virus was performed on rabbit embryonic brain cells (REB cells) according to Herzog et al., 1980 [23] . Briefly, cells were incubated with diluted samples from shrews no #2, #5, #6 and virus replication in REB cells was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence test [24] . Viral RNA was extracted from REB cells persistently infected with the isolated BoDV-1 by using commercially available kits for RNA-extraction (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) and was sequenced according to previous protocols [25] . The nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank database. Phylogenetic studies were performed as described elsewhere [25] using the Phylogeny Inference Program package, PHYLIP [26] . Representative sequences of all five regional BoDV-1 subclusters were obtained from GenBank (Group 1A: L27077, AY374524; Group 1B: AY374551, AY374550; Group 2: AY374521, AY374531; Group 3: AY374519, AY374534; Group 4: U04608, AY374522; Borna Disease Virus-2 AJ311524). Firstly, SEQBOOT program was used for testing stability of the trees by bootstrap resampling analysis of 100 replicates. Secondly, genetic distances between each pair of sequences were calculated based on the Kimura two-parameter model, transition/transversion ratio of 2, computed with the DNADIST program. Thirdly, using the neighbour-joining method of the NEIGHBOR program a phylogenetic tree was generated and printed out as a consensus tree by the CONSENSE program. Finally, the phylogenetic tree was displayed using SEAVIEW [27] . Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out using the monoclonal anti-BoDV-1 nucleoprotein (BoDV-1-N) antibody Bo18 as described elsewhere [28, 29] . In-situ hybridization (ISH) to detect genomic RNA and respective mRNA sequences of the BoDV-1-N gene was performed additionally applying established protocols [29] . All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 10 software package (StatSoft, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA). Female shrew #3 was excluded from the statistical analyses of relative body mass trend as it was used for breeding during the observation period and could therefore show changes of body mass due to pregnancy. Relative body mass trend was calculated by ratio of body mass of an individual at time point x to the body mass at day 1 of husbandry. Normality of data was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Lilliefors tests. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to assess significant differences in weekly body mass trend between individuals. We used Mann-Whitney-U test to test for significant differences relative in body mass trend between non-infected and infected shrews within the same week in husbandry. The criterion to accept statistical significance was p < 0.05.
