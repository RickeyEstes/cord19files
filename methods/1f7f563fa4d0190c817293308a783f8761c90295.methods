This was a prospective unblinded study of healthy Chinese volunteers using two different protective devices: a Totobobo mask (Dream Lab One Pte. Ltd, Singapore) and a fitted N95 filtering facepiece respirator (1860 or 1860s or 1862, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA). Approval was obtained from the joint Chinese University of Hong Kong/New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was carried out in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice standards and the Declaration of Helsinki. Twenty-two healthy volunteers who had previously passed a fit test with an 1860, 1860s or 1862 N95 filtering facepiece respirator were recruited. New masks were used for each subject. Prior to testing the N95 mask, the subject adjusted the mask and performed a user seal test. Prior to testing the Totobobo mask the investigator trimmed the mask according to the manufacturer's instructions and following training by the inventor. The investigator also visually checked the fit of both types of mask. Volunteers underwent a standard mask-fitting protocol. In brief, the tests consisted of comparisons of particle counts inside and outside the protective device during a series of activities: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning the head from side to side, flexing and extending the head, talking loudly and bending over followed by normal breathing again. The sampling probe (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, MN, USA) for sampling the mask particle count was inserted through the fabric or plastic of the protective device. Air samples for measuring the ambient particle count were taken from just outside the mask about 3 cm from the sampling probe. A PortaCount Plus (TSI Incorporated) connected to a computer running FitPlus for Windows software (TSI Incorporated) was used to count particles and calculate the ratio of ambient:device particle counts. This device counts all particles sized between 0.02 and 1 mm diameter. It calculates a fit factor, which is the average ratio of atmospheric:device particle concentrations. To ensure an adequate ambient particle count throughout the testing, the 8026 Particle Generator (TSI Incorporated) was used to generate saline particles throughout the testing procedures. All subjects were asked which mask they found more comfortable after completion of testing.
