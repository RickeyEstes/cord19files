In this section, we propose two types of Action Matching Kernels (AMKs) that integrate both BoW and space-time layout. The first type is by means of unary and binary extensions, while the second type is a modification of the successful Pyramid Match Kernel. As shown in Figure 1 , an action can be naturally depicted by a set of local features within a space-time action volume (the green cube illustrated in Figure 1 (a) bottom left), which we also refer to as action volume or simply volume when there is no confusion. In both cases, an input action corresponds to both a BoW model consisting of K codewords, as well as the features' locations in the space-time volume. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/300 Here local features ('+'s) of an action is contained in a space-time volume displayed as a green cube. Besides residing in this local coordinate, each feature also has a descriptor that is further mapped to the histogram of codewords representation using the bag-of-words model. This figure displays two examples of the proposed Type I Kernels. (a) presents a unary extension where the local volume is further partitioned into concentric layers. (b) demonstrates a binary extension scheme that considers the distance and codeword entries of feature pairs. Note other extension schemes are also possible.
