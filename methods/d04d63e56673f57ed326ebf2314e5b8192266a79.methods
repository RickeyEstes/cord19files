In Italy the competent vector for the transmission of CHIKV is Aedes albopictus [1] . CHIKV can spread from human to human through bites of adult female mosquitoes. As the dynamics of the vector depends, among several abiotic factors, on meteorological parameters, a population dynamics model accounting for seasonal temperature variations was used to estimate vector abundance. In particular, temperature plays a very significant role as it affects development and mortality rates of Aedes albopictus [10, 21] , influencing vector abundance and distribution over time [22] . The population dynamics model was then coupled to an epidemic transmission model describing the spread of the epidemic in both humans and mosquitoes (see Fig. 1 ), allowing the estimate of the crucial parameters of the epidemic (e.g. basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, probability that a major outbreak of the disease would occur after the introduction of a single infective host) and the assessment of intervention strategies.
