During the first week of April 2003, the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) formed a 14-member, multidisciplinary NCID/SARS Community Outreach Team as part of its emergency response to the global SARS outbreak. While other NCID/CDC response teams dealt with laboratory investigations, surveillance, communica-tion, and clinical infection control practices, the Community Outreach Team worked to implement rapid public health strategies to document, monitor, and assist in ameliorating specific problems associated with fear, stigmatization, and discrimination attributed to the SARS outbreak in the United States. In creating a rapid public health intervention to mitigate behaviors and practices associated with SARS-related fear, the team recognized the need to address the experiences of persons at greatest risk for experiencing SARS-related fear, stigma, and discrimination. The team monitored stigmatizing ideas and behaviors in the general population and the media, particularly toward Asian Americans, who were disproportionately reporting fear, stigmatization, and discrimination compared to the general public. The team began working with Asian-American communities to develop a culturally tailored intervention that 1) promoted community understanding of the facts related to the transmission and prevention of SARS; 2) contributed to the strengthening of community resiliency and capacity to mitigate fear, stigmatization, and discrimination; and 3) encouraged appropriate health-seeking behaviors for those who may have been exposed to SARS and were experiencing early symptoms. The team also worked to dispel myths; keep the general public better informed; prevent discrimination against SARS-affected communities; and provide guidance for institutions, agencies, and organizations hosting international visitors from SARS-affected countries.
