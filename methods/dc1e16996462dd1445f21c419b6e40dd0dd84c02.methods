Mean-Field theory for the uncorrelated double-layer networks. To derive the mean-field rate equations for the density variables, we consider the probabilities that node A i in layer A and node B i in layer B become infected during the small time interval [t, t 1 dt]. On the communication layer, a susceptible node A i of degree k A can obtain the information in two ways: from its neighbors in the same layer and from its counterpart node in layer B. For the first route, the probability that node A i receives information from one of its neighbors is k A b A H A (t)dt, where H A (t) is the probability that a neighboring node is in the informed state 59 and is given by where k A h i~X kA k A P A k A ð Þ. To model the second scenario, we note that, due to the asymmetric coupling between the two layers, a node in layer A being susceptible requires that its counterpart node in layer B be susceptible, too. A node in the communication layer will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected, which occurs with the probability X . This can occur in two ways. Firstly, it may be infected by a neighboring node in the same layer with the probability k B b B H B (t)dt, where H B (t) is the probability that a neighbor is in the infected state and is given by where k B h i~X kB k B P B k B ð Þ. Secondly, if its counterpart node in layer A has already received the information from one of its neighbors, it will be vaccinated with probability p. The probability for a node in layer B to be vaccinated, taking into account the interaction between the two layers, is p X kA P k A jk B ð Þ s A kA t ð Þb A k A H A t ð Þdt, where P(k A jk B ) denotes the conditional probability that a node of degree k B in layer B is linked to a node of degree k A in layer A, and s A kA t ð Þb A k A H A t ð Þdt is the informed probability for the counterpart node of degree k A in the susceptible state [P(k A jk B ) 5 P A (k A ) for m s 5 0]. The mean-field rate equations of epidemic spreading in layer B are Eqs. (4) - (7) . We note that the second term on the right side of Eq. (4) does not contain the variable s B kB (t) because a node in layer B must be in the susceptible state if its counterpart node in layer A is in the susceptible state. Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The correlation between the layers can be quantified by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient 39, 42 defined as where N is network size and D i denotes the difference between node i's degrees in the two layers. When a node in layer A is matched with a random node in layer B, m s is approximately zero in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, the double-layer network is uncorrelated 39, 42 . When every node has the same rank of degree in both layers, we have m s < 1. In this case, there is a maximally positive inter-layer correlation where, for example, the hub node with the highest degree in layer A is matched with the largest hub in layer B, and the same holds for the nodes with the smallest degree. In the case of maximally negative correlation, the largest hub in one layer is matched with a node having the minimal degree in the other layer, so we have m s < 21. In a double-layer network with the maximally positive correlation, any pair of nodes having the same rank of degree in the respective layers are matched, i.e., D i 5 0 for any pair of nodes A i and B i . We thus have m s 5 1, according to Eq. (16) . After random rematching, a pair of nodes have D i 5 0 with probability 1 2 q and a random difference D' i with probability q. Equation (16) can then be rewritten as When all nodes are randomly rematched, the layers in the network are completely uncorrelated, i.e., m s < 0. In this case, we have Submitting Eq. (18) into Eq. (17), the inter-layer correlation after rematching is given by
