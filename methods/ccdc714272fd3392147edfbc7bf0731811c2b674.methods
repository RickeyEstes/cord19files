This study was divided into two parts: information was collected at the international airport of Kaohsiung (Taiwan), on the physical conditions of passengers who flew from Hong Kong and landed at Kaohsiung from April 10 to 22, 2003. This information was compiled from questionnaires and brief interviews of arriving passengers. In addition, information was gathered from body temperature measurements performed on each arriving passenger who entered Taiwan. Records from at the Emergency Department of E-Da Hospital, in Southern Taiwan, of patients suffering from symptoms of respiratory tract infection who had departed recently from SARS areas from March 19, 2003 onwards were analyzed.
