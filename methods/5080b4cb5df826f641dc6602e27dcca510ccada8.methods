Chemicals. GL, GL dipotassium salt, GA and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). CBX was purchased from Abcam (UK). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO. Enzyme production. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The protocol for all animal experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Fujita Health University. Human KAT1, KAT2 and KAT4 cDNAs were synthesised from human blood peripheral leukocytes total RNA (TaKaRa, Japan) using a ReverTra Ace Kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Mouse KAT2 cDNA was synthesised from total RNA that was extracted from whole brains of mice using a ReverTra Ace Kit. All cDNAs were amplified using polymerase chain reactions with specific primers. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into the pFastBac HTC vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), which was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The pFastBac HTC vector containing the target gene was transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells and a baculovirus transfer vector was transfected into insect Sf9 cells. Recombinant enzymes were expressed by infection of Sf9 cells with a high-titre baculovirus. Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation and were then dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. After sonication, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and recombinant enzymes in supernatants were added to pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Enzyme/ resin complexes were transferred to columns, were washed with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and recombinant enzymes were eluted with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole and 50 mM phosphate (pH 8.0). Enzyme fractions were pooled based on purity, as determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and were then desalted using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare, UK). Recombinant human KAT3 was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (USA). High-throughput screening assays for inhibitors of human KAT2. High-throughput screening assays for inhibitors of human KAT2 were conducted using a microplate fluorescence assay for kynurenine aminotransferase 26 with minor modifications. In these assays, KAT2 enzyme activities were measured in black 384-well untreated plates. The human KAT2 reaction mixture (20 μL) contained 10 ng/μL recombinant human KAT2, 1 mM L-KYN, 1 mM α-ketoglutaric acid, 500 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20 and 150 mM AMP buffer (pH www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 9.5), and was added to 384-well plates containing compounds using a Multidrop dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The compound library comprised about 13,000 compounds from the Drug Discovery Initiative at the University of Tokyo. The compound library includes about 9,600 diverse compounds for pilot screening and about 3,400 known bioactive compounds. All compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO to a final concentration of 10 μM. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and 20 μL aliquots of 300 mM zinc acetate (pH 5.5) were then added directly using a Multidrop dispenser. Fluorescence intensities of KYNA were measured using an ARVO X Multi Label Reader (PerkinElmer, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Assay quality was validated by calculating signal-background and Z' factor. These assays identified approximately 20 candidate KAT2 inhibitors with potent inhibitory activity from about 13,000 compounds. Candidate compounds were validated in quadruplicate KAT2 enzyme activity assays. Enzyme inhibition and kinetics assays. Inhibitory activities of the identified compounds against KAT1 and KAT2 were measured using the enzyme activity assays described above. KAT1 reaction mixtures (20 μL) contained 10 ng/μL recombinant human KAT1, 1 mM L-KYN, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20 and inhibitors at various concentrations in 150 mM 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) buffer (pH 7.4 or 9.5). Human and mouse KAT2 reaction mixtures (20 μL) contained 10 ng/μL recombinant human or mouse KAT2, 1 mM L-KYN, 1 mM α-ketoglutaric acid, 100 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20 and inhibitors at various concentrations in 150 mM AMP buffer (pH 9.5). Following the addition of 20 μL aliquots of 300 mM zinc acetate, fluorescence intensities of KYNA were measured using an ARVO X Multi Label Reader (PerkinElmer, USA). KAT3 and KAT4 enzyme activities were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of reaction products. Briefly, KAT3 reaction mixtures (50 μL) contained 10 ng/μL recombinant human KAT3, 1 mM L-KYN, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20 and inhibitors at various concentrations in 150 mM AMP buffer (pH 9.5). KAT4 reaction mixtures (50 μL) contained recombinant human KAT4, 1 mM L-KYN, 1 mM α-ketoglutaric acid, 100 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20 and inhibitors at various concentrations in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and reactions were then stopped by adding 3% perchloric acid at a ratio of 1:1. KYNA contents of reaction mixtures were then determined using HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) following isocratic elution from a reverse-phase column (TSKgel ODS-100V, 3 μm, 4.6 mm [ID] × 150 mm [L]; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) using a mobile phase containing 10 mM sodium acetate with 2% acetonitrile (pH adjusted to 4.5) at flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. KYNA was detected using a fluorescence detector (RF-20Axs) at an excitation wavelength of 344 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm. To determine steady state kinetic parameters for the substrate L-KYN, 50 μL reaction mixtures containing 10 ng/μL recombinant human KAT2, 1 mM α-KG, 100 μM PLP, 0.005% Tween 20, L-KYN at concentrations of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31 and 0.15 mM and GL, GA or CBX or PF-04859989 at 4.5, 6.0 and 3.5 μM and 300 nM, respectively. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by adding 3% perchloric acid at a 1:1 ratio. KYNA concentrations were measured using the same HPLC method as described above. Double reciprocal plots were used to determine types of inhibition. Competitive inhibition constants (Ki) for GL, GA and CBX were calculated using the global fit formula (GraphPad Prism v6.07) 60 where Vmax inh = maximum enzyme velocity for the concentration of inhibitor. IC 50 values were determined by nonlinear curve fitting using GraphPad Prism v6.07. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v6.07. Docking calculations. Computational docking trials were performed using GOLD 5.6 software under default settings 62 . The three-dimensional (3D) structure of KAT2, which forms a homo-dimer 63, 64 , was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; PDB ID, 2R2N). Because this crystal structure includes the substrate KYN and the coenzyme analogue pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), KYN was removed, and PLP was substituted for PMP before calculations. For this substitution, the PLP structure was optimised using Gaussian16 (Gaussian Inc., Wallingford CT, 2016) with B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p). Missing hydrogen atoms in the PDB structure were computationally added using Hermes (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/). The centre of KYN in 2R2N was defined as the centre of the ligand-binding site, and the binding site radius was set at 10.0 Å. Ligand structures were optimised at the same calculation level as for PLP.
