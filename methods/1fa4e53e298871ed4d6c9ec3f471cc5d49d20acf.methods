This was a retrospective study of all patients who were diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection at our center over the period October 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014. Patients were identified from the microbiology and infection control records. In addition to the medical file review, data were collected from infection control outbreak investigations and the preventive medicine database of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Demographic and clinical details, epidemiological exposures, laboratory investigations, and outcomes were collated. A consultant radiologist reviewed and summarized all radiological investigations. Patients were followed until discharge from the hospital or death. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory tract samples for the MERS-CoV upE, ORF 1b, and N genes. 15 All RT-PCR tests for MERS-CoV were performed at the Saudi Ministry of Health National Laboratories in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee.
