Pairwise and multiple amino acid sequence comparisons were performed with MacVector, using the CLUSTAL-X program [99] . Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) [100] , was performed on HCA plots generated at the RPBS web portal (http://www.mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr), for the prediction of secondary features along the amino acid sequence of seaweed lectins. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was built up from the multiple alignment of jacalin-related lectins using the uncorrected neighbor joining method integrated in MacVector. No bootstrapping was performed. TreeView 1.6.6 [101] , was used to draw the phylogenetic tree of jacalin-related lectins. Homology modelling of seaweed lectins was performed with the YASARA Structure program [102] , using various protein templates from the PDB, depending on the overall structural scaffold to which they belong (e.g., 3OBL of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii for modelling the Agardhiella subulata lectin ASL-1, shown in Figure 1 ). PROCHECK [103] , ANOLEA [104] , and the calculated QMEAN scores [105, 106] , were used to assess the geometric and thermodynamic qualities of the three-dimensional models. For docking experiments, complex glycans were built using the GLYCAM web server [107] , and SWEET II web server [108, 109] . The autodockVINA module of YASARA Structure [110] , was used to dock the carbohydrate ligand (treated as a flexible molecule) to the lectin model (treated as a rigid molecule). Docking experiments were performed at the SwissDock web server (http: //www.swissdock.ch) [111, 112] , as a control for our docking experiments. Molecular cartoons were drawn with Chimera [113] and YASARA.
