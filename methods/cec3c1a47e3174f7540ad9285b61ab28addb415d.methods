A preliminary literature review was conducted through Google Scholar with general topic terms such as 'digital disease' and 'detection' and 'surveillance' and by author to identify scope, previous work, and to aid with keyword generation. Keyword generation was adapted from previous systematic reviews with the addition of supplementary terms from preliminary search results. A list of keywords can be found in Appendix A (in Supplementary material). A literature search was conducted in July 2015 by the author through the databases PUBMED; SCOPUS; and Google Scholar from May 2011 to July 2015. The search was a combination of all the key terms generated by using Boolean functions of 'and' and 'or.' Grey literature results relevant to event-based Internet biosurveillance systems; including mobile applications and participatory systems; was perfomed via Google and Google Scholar (not time restricted); which also included patents. Finally; when a system was mentioned in any of the above capacities; a general Google query with the system's name; or creator of the system; and the first 1000 entries were analysed by relevance in order to further discover details and functionality of systems. The electronic databases were selected based on their relevance to the subject matter and previous reviews. Reference lists from the selected literature were examined to include articles of relevance. Titles were screened first, then abstracts, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Questionable eligibility based on title and abstract would then be read in full and judged for eligibility. Duplicates were eliminated and irrelevant articles were excluded from the review. Process for the article selection and screening can be found in the flowchart, Fig. 2 , which is similar to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram methodology. Extraction criteria were used to collect comparable data on each system. For eligibility, inclusion and exclusion criteria were created. These can be found in Appendix A (in Supplementary material) and were inspired and adapted from Velasco et al. [9, 17] . The publication type included journal articles in addition to conference abstracts and presentations, letters to the editor, commentaries, and patents. The articles were then categorised for classification. These categories are 1) 'background' (which are articles not directly describing an event-based surveillance system, but rather surveillance sys- Velesco et al .

Those placed in 'system' were further distinguished by either 'indicator-based systems' or 'eventbased systems'. 'Event-based systems' was also further subdivided if it was a participatory surveillance system. Participatory surveillance systems enable the public to report directly on diseases through the Internet, such as through crowdsourcing [15] . These systems encourage the regular, voluntary submission of syndromic, health-related information by the general public using technology like computers, tablets, or smartphones [15] .
