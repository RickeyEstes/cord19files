The prioritization process involved a semi-quantitative tool developed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The methods have been described in detail by Rist et al. [12] . An in-country workshop was held that included representatives from the key stakeholder agencies (Table 1) . Although multiple agencies were invited to participate in the workshop, key decisions including selection of criteria, questions to address the criteria, and the final selection of top five zoonotic diseases was made by five pre-selected committee members. The committee members were identified prior to the workshop and included individuals from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), the Ministry of Livestock and Fishery Resources (MoLFR), and the Ethiopian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MEF).
