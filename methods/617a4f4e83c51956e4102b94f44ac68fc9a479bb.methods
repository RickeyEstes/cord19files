This study selects the case study approach. Data are drawn from the message board of Justin's website. The board used was an original one, and lasted from 1 July to 2 November 2003. Another new board was linked to the page of Locus (the publisher mentioned above). To avoid the interference effect, this work only examined the messages on the original board. Visitors browsing the website left some 301 messages reflecting the initial impressions to the site. All of the messages are exhaustively analyzed and categorized. The classification is based on AIDA model in the field of consumer behavior. Careful analysis of holistic messages confirms the substantial effect of the website. Thus the mode is an effective marketing tool. Finally, implications for tourism practitioners are discussed.
