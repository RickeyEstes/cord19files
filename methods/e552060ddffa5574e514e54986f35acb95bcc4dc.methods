The processes for collecting sequences to create protein databases, detecting protein coding regions, identifying start and stop codons, predicting mature peptide cleavage sites, as well as a definition of correct gene prediction and an overview of the program implementation are outlined in an article by Wang et al. (3) . What follows is a discussion of the methods developed to address the gene features of the new viruses.
