Primers. Large fragment Bst DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) was used in amplification reaction. According to the mechanism of CPA, the presence of a cross primer is essential 7 . The two pairs of outer primers, three upstream probes, four downstream probes, and three cross primers were designed for screening the best primer combinations. The primers that target the N gene of PEDV were designed based on a new PEDV sequence (KC189944.1, NT 26716-26873). The optimum primers and probes (Table 1) as template to conduct RT-PCR to amplify the PEDV N gene fragment. The primers N-F/R were used to amplify PEDV N gene fragment (sequences were listed in Table 1 ). The amplicon was cloned into pMD18-T vector(Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) by TA cloning at site 425 and called T-PEDV-N. The concentration of T-PEDV-N was 241.5 μg/mL, with approximately 5.39 × 10 13 copies/mL. CPA-NATS procedure. We conducted a probe hybridization reaction experiment and determined the selected primers that exhibited no reaction during probe hybridization. Subsequently, the CPA tests were conducted with different primer combinations. The initial test system was as follows: CPR(20 μM), 0. 21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41 RT CPA− NATS
