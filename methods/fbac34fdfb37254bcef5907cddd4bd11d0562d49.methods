Following approval from the Korean National Cancer Centre institutional review boards, an experienced Korean polling company was commissioned to implement random-dialed calls made to Seoul and Gyeonggi state numbers. Eligible households were identified by computers, whereas ineligible telephone numbers such as fax numbers and commercial telephone numbers were automatically screened out. Inclusion criteria were being able to communicate in Korean and capable of answering a telephone interview. Within each eligible household, 1 adult aged 18 years or older whose birthday was closest to the survey date was invited to participate in the study. Unanswered household telephone numbers were called at different times and days for up to 4 times before replacement with new numbers. More than 70% of the calls were made after 6:00 p.m. to avoid oversampling of the nonworking population. Respondents agreeing to participate completed a telephone interview based on a standardized questionnaire. Core questions included in the questionnaire were developed based on measures used to survey attitudes toward severe acute respiratory syndrome and novel influenzas in Hong Kong, 4,5 Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behavior. These core measures included perceived susceptibility to (eg, How likely do you think it is that you will contract MERS over the next 1 month?), perceived severity of (eg, How likely do you think you would be seriously ill if you were infected with MERS?), and worry about MERS (eg, agreement on the statement, "I feel worried that I may be infected with MERS"), perceived self-efficacy in preventing MERS (eg, agreement on the statement, "I am confident that I could protect myself from contracting MERS"), trust in government action to control MERS (eg, agreement with the statement, "I trust the government to do what is needed to protect us from contracting MERS"), perceived social norms toward MERS prevention (what others are doing) (eg, agreement on the statement of "Most of my friends took measures to prevent against MERS"), attitudes toward quarantine (eg, agreement on the statement of "quarantine is not very effective to stop the spread of MERS"), and MERS-related anxiety (a 6-item scale). 6, 7 All the above were responded to on 7-point (susceptibility, severity) or 4-point (MERS-related anxiety) or 5-point categorical response scales. Internal consistency (Cronbach's a) for the above core measures was generally acceptable ranging from 0.61 (for perceived social norms in MERS prevention) to 0.90 (for perceived susceptibility to MERS and worry about MERS) ( Table 1 ). The items used to assess each core measure are detailed in Appendix Table S1 . Mean scores and/or proportions of risk perception variables and attitudes toward quarantine were calculated and their variability by age, gender, and educational attainment was assessed using multivariate logistic/linear regression models.
