Transmission electron microscopy imaging. For TEM analysis, the supernatant from Vero cells infected with the horse plasma sample was inactivated and fixed using Karnovsky solution (4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde) for 30 min at 25 °C, which was followed by an additional 30-min incubation at 25 °C 39 . Ten microliters of the inactivated supernatant was applied on 300-mesh carbon-coated copper TEM grids treated previously with 1% alcian blue. The samples were incubated for 10 min, and excess liquid was blotted using Whatman paper. The grids were washed three times with distilled water and stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. After air-drying, the samples were visualized using an FEI Tecnai T12 microscope operated at 120 kV and equipped with a Gatan ES500W Erlangshen camera. Scaling was performed using a standard of known size, which was measured at different magnifications. RNA extraction and purification. RNA was purified from 140 µl of the cell culture supernatant by a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using 60 µl of AVE buffer for elution. As a control, RNA was extracted as mentioned above from noninfected cells. RNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer with the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The concentration of the purified RNA was 6 ng/µl (and 5 ng/µl for the control), which is sufficient for library preparation using the SMARTer Pico RNA Kit. BioAnalyzer (Agilent) analyses utilizing the RNA HS kit did not provide a relevant RNA integrity number (RIN) because the major RNA peak was generated from the carrier RNA, which is added as part of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini purification procedure.
