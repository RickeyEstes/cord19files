We use BEAST 34 to estimate the dated phylogeny and the changing population size, using exponential population change for the coalescent model. We use a fixed value of the strict molecular clock. As a sensitivity analysis, we vary it between 5.0 × 10 −4 and 2.5 × 10 −3 in increments of 10 −4 substitutions per site per year. We use the TN93 substitution model, but consider other models in a sensitivity analysis. We use a coalescent model with an exponentially changing population size. We assume a very broad and symmetric prior for the exponential rate of change, r (prior is normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 100 per year). We assign all other priors to the default values used by BEAST (v1.7.4). Using a fixed clock, convergence of the MCMC chains was excellent. We emphasise that it is not a prior assumption that the infected population is growing, since the population size parameter and the rate of exponential change parameters are independent. Figure S11 shows the estimates dated phylogeny drawn from the posterior distribution (maximum clade credibility), based on the substitution rate of 1.5 × 10 −3 Figure S11 .
