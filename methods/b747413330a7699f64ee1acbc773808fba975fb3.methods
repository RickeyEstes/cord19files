HCGFAA is a 1000-bed tertiary care facility with a 30-bed infectious diseases unit. In response to high demand for emergency medical services among adult patients with acute respiratory complaints, infectious disease specialists implemented an ILI scoring system on April 25, 2009. This scoring system was adapted from a system developed by Hak et al in the United States for hospitalization decision-making among elderly patients with pneumonia or influenza during influenza epidemics [18] . In the emergency room (ER), a questionnaire was used to record patients' demographics, signs and symptoms, history of health care utilization, chronic medical conditions, laboratory, and radiology findings to calculate patients' ILI-scores ( Figure 1 ). Clinicians used an ILI-score $16 (high-risk), their judgment of patients' severity of illness and proximity to the hospital to decided whether to admit the patient and treat them with oseltamivir. Patients with intermediate ILI-scores (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) were discharged from the ER, treated with oseltamivir and followed daily by phone for 10 days. Those with low ILI-scores (#6) were discharged without antiviral treatment, and instructed to return if their symptoms worsened. Nasal and throat swab specimens were collected from all highrisk and intermediate-risk patients. Swabs were combined in phosphate-buffered saline viral transport media and split into aliquots for influenza testing. One aliquot was tested by rapid diagnostic test (QuickVue Influenza Test, Quidel, San Diego, CA) and immunofluorescence at the hospital. A second aliquot was sent frozen at 270uC to the National Public Health (InDRE) laboratory in Mexico City. InDRE tested the samples with realtime RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a multiplex assay and 4 sets of primers (i.e. influenza A, universal swine, 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and a control for human genetic material) [19] . Each hospitalized patient had a chest x-ray and a chest CT scan performed at admission. Clinicians prescribed standard doses of oseltamivir 75 mg BID for five days [17] . Hospitalized patients assessed to have severe illness received 150 mg of oseltamivir PO BID 65 days, amantadine 300 mg PO BID 610 days, broad spectrum antibiotics (e.g. linezolid), and paracetamol. Patients were discharged when afebrile and without dyspnea. Patients' demographics, clinical presentation, treatments, and outcome data were entered into an SPSS database. The ILI-score, treatment, disposition, and virology results of triaged patients were compared by Pearson's X 2 , Fisher's Exact, Student t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde and the final draft for publication was also approved by the research ethics committee of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde. Investigators kept the datasets in password protected systems and presented data without identifiers to protect the anonymity of case-patients.
