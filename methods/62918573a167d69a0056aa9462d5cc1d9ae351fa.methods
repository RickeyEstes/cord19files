Cells, recombinant viruses and plasmids. Cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) and tested for mycoplasma by PCR (e-Myco plus Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit; iNtRON Biotechnology). In addition, the sequenced libraries (L929 cells) were queried for mycoplasma sequences. WT and mutant viruses are based on the EMCV subtype mengovirus cDNA, pMC0, developed by Ann Palmenberg (University of Wisconsin-Madison) 32 . The parental (WT) sequence used is similar to GenBank accession DQ294633.1, but a 55-nt poly(C) tract in the 5 0 UTR is deleted and there are 13 single-nucleotide differences (A2669C, G3044C, C3371T, A4910C, G4991A, C5156T, G5289A, G5314C, G5315A, A5844C, G6266A, G6990A, A6992G; DQ294633.1 coordinates). Excepting the preceding sentence, nucleotide coordinates are given with respect to vMC0. WT, SS and LV-WT viruses were a kind gift from Gary Loughran (University College Cork) 17, 23 . All constructs were prepared by standard PCR mutagenesis and recombinant DNA techniques and subcloned regions altered by mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. All viruses were able to replicate in cell culture. The SS and SL mutations do not alter the polyprotein amino acid sequence. In vitro frameshifting at the EMCV PRF signal. For in vitro frameshifting assays, we cloned a 105-nt sequence containing the G_GUU_UUU shift site flanked by 12 nt upstream and 86 nt downstream, or mutant derivatives, into the dual luciferase plasmid pDluc at the XhoI/BglII sites 33 . The sequence was inserted between the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes so that firefly luciferase expression is dependent on À 1 PRF. For ribosomal pausing analysis, the EMCV shift site flanked by 5 nt upstream and 93 nt downstream, or mutant derivatives, were cloned into pPS0 at the XhoI/PvuII sites 29 . For the expression of recombinant 2A in E. coli, the 2A coding sequence was amplified from pMC0 and cloned into pGEX-6P-2 (GE Healthcare) at the BamHI/XhoI sites. The expressed 2A, following removal of the glutathione-S-transferase moiety by PreScission Protease (a kind gift from Stephen Graham, University of Cambridge), has an additional 4 and 13 vector-derived residues at its N-and C-termini, respectively. In vitro transcription and generation of recombinant virus. RNA was transcribed using the Megascript T7 kit (Ambion) from BamHI-linearized plasmids. Reactions were phenol/chloroform extracted, the RNA desalted by centrifugation through a NucAway Spin Column (Ambion) and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Purified RNAs were used to transfect 35-mm dishes of L929 or BHK-21 cells using 1.2 mg RNA and 4 ml DMRIE-C reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose and 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1-5 days depending upon how rapidly cytopathic effect developed. Cultures were subjected to three rounds of freeze-thawing, cell debris removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000g and the supernatant stored in aliquots at À 80°C. Plaque assays. BHK-21 cells at 90% confluence in six-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of virus stocks. Cells were washed with serum-free medium, overlaid with virus innoculum and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Innocula were removed and replaced with 1.5% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen) containing DMEM plus 2% FBS. After 40 h incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed with formal saline and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Metabolic labelling and calculation of PRF efficiencies. BHK-21 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of B10 in a volume of 150 ml in 24-well plates. After 1 h the inoculum was replaced with 1 ml DMEM containing 1% FBS. At 7 h p.i., cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-and serum-free DMEM, and radiolabelled from 8 to 9 h p.i. with [ 35 S] methionine at 100 mCi ml À 1 (B1,100 Ci mmol À 1 ) in methionine-free medium. Cells were scraped into the medium, pelleted at 13,000g for 1 min, washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted for 2 min at 13,000g. Cell pellets were lysed in 35 ml 4 Â SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to X-ray films or to phosphorimager storage screens. Image analysis was carried out using Image-QuantTL 7.0, and the radioactivity in virus-specific products quantified. The intensity for each WT virus product was measured, normalized by methionine content and then by the mean value for VP0, VP3 and VP1 to control for lane loading. Next, to factor out differences in protein turnover besides unquantified processing intermediates, for each biological replicate the WT values for VP0, VP3, VP1, 2C, 3A þ 3AB, 3C þ 3CD and 3D þ 3CD were normalized by corresponding values for SS mutant virus. Then the normalized values for 2C, 3A þ 3AB, 3C þ 3CD and 3D þ 3CD (i.e. products encoded downstream of the frameshift site) were averaged and divided by the average of the values for VP0, VP3 and VP1 (i.e. products encoded upstream of the frameshift site). This gives an estimate of the fraction of ribosomes that avoid a À 1 PRF (Fig. 4c) . One minus this value estimates the PRF efficiency. Ribosome profiling library preparation. L929 cells in 60-mm dishes were infected at an MOI of B10 in an initial volume of 1.5 ml DMEM with 1% FBS. After 1 h adsorption at 37°C an additional 3.5 ml was added and incubation continued. At the appropriate time points, cells were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich; to 100 mg ml À 1 ; 2 min). Cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s, transferred to dry ice and 400 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mg ml À 1 cycloheximide and 25 U ml À 1 TURBO DNase (Life Technologies)) dripped onto the cells. The cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected and triturated with a 26-G needle 10 times. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000g at 4°C, the supernatants recovered and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysates were subjected to Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq. The methodologies employed were based on the original protocols of Ingolia et al. 19, 34 , except library amplicons were constructed using a small RNA cloning strategy 35 adapted to Illumina smallRNA v2 to allow multiplexing 36 . RiboZero-based rRNA subtraction was used for RNA-Seq libraries (Epicentre, cat. no. RZH1046) while Ribo-Seq libraries were untreated. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the Beijing Genomics Institute (round 1) and the Illumina NextSeq platform at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge (round 2). Sequencing data have been deposited in ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under the accession number E-MTAB-5206. Ribosome profiling data analysis. Adaptor sequences were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit (Hannon lab) and reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded. Trimmed reads were first mapped to Mus musculus databases of rRNA, ncRNA (Ensembl, GRCm38.70, ncRNA) and mRNA (NCBI RefSeq mRNAs) using bowtie version 1 with seed length 23 and default parameters 37 . Remaining reads were mapped to the relevant virus genome (EMCV or mutants thereof). To ascertain that prior mapping to host sequences did not remove viral reads, we also tested mapping reads to the virus genome first, and found that the same set of reads were identified. Supplementary Table 1 shows the composition statistics for each library. Host mRNA RiboSeq phasing distributions ( Supplementary Figs 1c and 4c ) were derived from reads mapping to the 'interior' regions of annotated coding ORFs; specifically, the 5 0 end of the read had to map between the first nucleotide of the initiation codon and 30 nt 5 0 of the last nucleotide of the termination codon, thus, in general, excluding RPFs of initiating or terminating ribosomes. Histograms of inferred approximate P-site positions (5 0 end coordinate þ 12 nt offset) of host mRNA RPFs relative to initiation and termination codons ( Supplementary Figs 1a  and 4a) were derived from reads mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated CDSs X450 nt in length and annotated 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs X60 nt in length. All figures are based on total numbers of mapped reads, rather than weighted sums for highly expressed mRNAs (cf. ref. 19) , because virus-induced shut-off of host cell translation at late time points reduces the efficacy of the latter approach for our data. Read length distributions (Supplementary Figs 1b,4b and 5b ) are based on total mapped reads (to positive-sense host mRNA or EMCV genome, as indicated) without restriction to annotated coding regions. Plots showing RPFs mapped to the EMCV genome (Figs 1d and 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2a) show the positions of the 5 0 ends of RPFs with a þ 12 nt offset to show the approximate P-site, smoothed with a 15-nt running-mean filter. For consistency, RNA-Seq plots ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) also show the positions of the 5 0 ends of reads with a þ 12 nt offset. Read densities are displayed in reads per million reads mapped to the virus positive-sense or host messenger RNA (RPM). To calculate PRF efficiencies from profiling data, Ribo-Seq read densities upstream and downstream of the PRF signal were determined. In this analysis, normalization by RNA-Seq densities was not carried out as the kinetics of RNA synthesis are not synchronous with the kinetics of RNA translation, and, especially late in infection, newly synthesized RNA may be destined for packaging rather than translation. Ribosome density along the virus genome may be affected by the kinetics of translation (as newly synthesized RNA enters the translation pool it takes 10-12 min for ribosomes to reach the 3 0 regions 38 ), variations in translation speed and ribosome pausing between different genomic regions, technical biases (nuclease, PCR, ligation) 39 and potentially ribosome 'drop-off' at other sites along the genome. The SS mutant was used as an appropriate control by which to normalize the WT RPF density for these factors. PRF efficiencies (Figs 1e and 2e) were calculated using RPFs with estimated P-sites mapping within the regions 180 nt after the polyprotein initiation codon to 180 nt upstream of the junction between the 2A and 2B coding regions (upstream density), and 180 nt downstream of the 2B* stop codon to 180 nt upstream of the polyprotein stop codon (downstream density). RPF counts were divided by region lengths to obtain RPF densities. To calculate the fraction of ribosomes that avoid a À 1 PRF, the downstream mean density was divided by the upstream mean density, and this value for WT or mutant viruses was divided by the corresponding value for the SS mutant. One minus this value estimates the PRF efficiency. For phasing histograms (Figs 1f and 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2e ), RPF densities were calculated for each of the three phases (based on RPF 5 0 end position within polyprotein-frame codons), for RPFs with estimated P-sites mapping within each of the three regions: from 30 nt after the polyprotein initiation codon to 30 nt upstream of the junction between the 2A and 2B coding regions (upstream region); from 15 nt downstream of the shift site to 15 nt upstream of the 2B* stop codon (overlap region); and from 30 nt downstream of the 2B* stop codon to 30 nt upstream of the polyprotein stop codon (downstream region). RPF counts were then normalized by the length of the relevant region, and by the total number of counts mapping to all three regions. To estimate the length of pausing at the mutated shift site we compared the SS and SS-SL mutants of Fig. 2b . In the first round ribosomal profiling, the pausing peak extended over four codons starting at the shift site ( Supplementary Fig. 2d ) whereas in the second round ribosomal profiling, it was spread over B20 codons, indicating considerable ribosome run-on during preparation of the latter samples 22 . RPF histograms for SS and SS-SL were first normalized by the total number of RPFs with estimated P-sites mapping within the regions 180 nt after the polyprotein initiation codon to 180 nt upstream of the junction between the 2A and 2B coding regions or 180 nt downstream of the 2B* stop codon to 180 nt upstream of the polyprotein stop codon (Fig. 2c) . Then the RPF density was summed over the 20 codons starting from the shift site. Within these 20 codons, SS-SL had a mean normalized RPF density of 0.80 while SS had a mean normalized RPF density of 5.10. Under the assumption that the SS-SL value reflects the effect of local technical biases (PCR, ligation, nuclease), the excess density in SS is 20 Â (5.10/0.80 À 1) ¼ 107.5, which, assuming a mean translation time of 0.18 s codon À 1 , equates to B20 s. This calculation is approximate as the underlying RPF distributions over these 20 codons differ between SS (mostly run-on of ribosomes initially paused at the shift site) and SS-SL (codon-specific variability in decoding times) so that an attempt to factor out technical biases via the quotient SS/SS-SL is inherently flawed. Further, it is also possible that pausing may be underestimated if the 3 0 -adjacent stem-loop and/or bound 2A inhibits nuclease cleavage at the leading edge of the ribosome and the production of appropriately sized RPFs for some fraction of ribosomes paused on the shift site. Structure probing. Short, 33 P-labelled RNAs (111 nt) containing the EMCV PRF region (shift site plus 32 nt upstream and 72 nt downstream) were prepared by T7 transcription of a PCR product generated using primers flanking the PRF region, with the 5 0 primer containing the T7 polymerase promoter sequence. Transcripts (5 mg) were dephosphorylated with Antarctic phosphatase according to the manufacturer's recommendation (New England BioLabs) and 5 0 end-labelled using polynucleotide kinase at 37°C for 1 h in a reaction containing 20 mCi [g-33 P]ATP (10 mCi ml À 1 stock; PerkinElmer), 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The labelled RNA was loaded onto a 10% acrylamide-urea denaturing gel, full-length RNA eluted from the gel slice in 0.5 M NH 4 OAc, 10 mM MgOAc, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.1% SDS and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. RNA structure probing reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 ml containing B20,000 c.p.m. 5 0 [ 33 P] end-labelled transcript, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mg pig liver rRNA and the relevant enzymatic or chemical probe 40 . Products were analysed on a 10% acrylamide/7 M urea gel. RiboTrap and mass spectrometry. RNA-binding proteins that may associate with the EMCV PRF signal were screened using the RiboTrap method using a commercial kit (RiboCluster Profiler RiboTrap Kit; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Japan) 41 . WT and scrambled EMCV RNA baits were generated by in vitro transcription from plasmid pBKS/EMCV, which contains 126 nt of EMCV sequence beginning immediately 3 0 -adjacent to the G_GUU_UUU shift site. The 145-nt T7 transcript generated from this vector comprises 126 nt of virus sequence flanked by vector sequences at 5 0 (GGGCGAAUUGGAGCU) and 3 0 (AAUU) ends. For the scrambled version, the WT stem-loop sequence CG GCA GTG TCA TCA ATG GCT CAA ACC CTA CTG CCG was changed to GA GAA AAC CGC CAC TTC CGA CGC TCG TGT ATG CTC. For generation of Br-U-labelled RNA transcripts, transcription reactions contained a 2:1 ratio of UTP:Br-UTP. Cell lysates were prepared from 20 T160 flasks of BHK-21 cells infected with EMCV WT at MOI B10, or mock infected. Cells were scraped into the medium, collected by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min at 4°C and washed three times with ice-cold PBS before resuspension in 2,400 ml of RiboTrap CE buffer supplemented with DTT to a final concentration of 1.5 mM. The lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min, 120 ml of RiboTrap Detergent solution added and the tubes inverted gently five times. The lysate was centrifuged immediately for 5 min at 3,000g to precipitate the nuclei. Seventy-two microlitres of RiboTrap High-Salt solution was added to the tube, mixed gently and centrifuged at 12,000g for 3 min at 4°C. The supernatant was retained and used immediately in the RiboTrap assay. RNA-binding proteins associated with the target RNA were analysed by SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% tris-glycine gel. Coomassie blue-stained products were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Peptides were extracted and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Fragment MS/MS spectra were searched with the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) against a protein sequence database composed of expected viral target sequences, cellular proteins and common contaminant proteins. Protein expression and purification. N-terminally glutathione-S-transferasetagged proteins were purified from E. coli BL21/DE3/pLysS cells. Single colonies were picked into Luria-Bertani broth and grown at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (to 0.1 mM) and continued for 2 h at 37°C (or overnight at 22°C) after which cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (1.4 mM -mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02 M Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, DNase 1 U ml À 1 and protease inhibitor 1 U ml À 1 ). Cells with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and DNase (Sigma) were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated to complete lysis. Proteins were purified using glutathione agarose resin (GE Healthcare) according to the standard procedures 42 , then dialysed against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05 mM EDTA and 5% glycerol, quantified by Bradford assay (ThermoFisher Scientific), and stored at À 80°C until required. Immunoblotting. Infected cell lysates or purified proteins were separated on 15% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels (BioRad mini-protean tetra cell apparatus) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 120 min using a mini-protean transblot cell and Tris glycine transfer buffer. Following blocking with 5% non-fat milk, primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 4°C using 1:1,000 diluted anti-2A (rabbit polyclonal raised against the C-terminal 14 aa of 2A by GenScript) or anti-tubulin (rat monoclonal; Abcam, ab6160) antibodies. Secondary antibody was the appropriate IRDye-conjugate (Li-Cor) used at 1:10,000 dilution. All washes employed PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were scanned on a Licor Odyssey infrared scanner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Short, 32 P-labelled template RNAs (64 nt) containing the EMCV PRF region (with slippery sequence precisely at the 5 0 end) were prepared by T7 transcription of a PCR product generated using primers flanking the PRF region, with the 5 0 primer containing the T7 polymerase promoter sequence. Radiolabelled RNAs were mixed with test proteins in 10 ml reactions in EMSA buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM adenosine triphosphate, 5% glycerol, 100 mg ml À 1 porcine tRNA, 10 U RNase inhibitor ml À 1 ). Test proteins were diluted in dilution buffer (DB) (5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol). For competition experiments, unlabelled competitor RNA was incubated with WT 32 P-labelled RNA and 2A (1.8 mM). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 10 min before promptly loading the mix onto 4% acrylamide non-denaturing gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 10:1). Gels were run at 175 V at room temperature until free and bound RNA species were resolved, then fixed for 15 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, dried and exposed to X-ray film and phosphorimager screen. In vitro translation. Frameshift reporter plasmids were linearized with FspI and capped run-off transcripts generated using T7 RNA polymerase 43 . Messenger RNAs were translated in nuclease-treated RRL or WG extracts (Promega) programmed with B50 mg ml À 1 template mRNA. Typical reactions were of 10 ml volume and composed of 90% (v/v) RRL, 20 mM amino acids (lacking methionine) and 0.2 MBq [ 35 S]-methionine. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30°C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 10 mM EDTA, 100 mg ml À 1 RNase A followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and dried gels were exposed to X-ray film or to a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Screen (PerkinElmer). The screen was scanned using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) in storage phosphor autoradiography mode and bands were quantified using ImageQuantTL software (GE Healthcare). PRF efficiencies were calculated as [IFS/MetFS]/[IS/MetS þ IFS/MetFS], where the number of methionines in the stop and frameshift products are denoted by MetS and MetFS, respectively, and the densitometry values for the same products are denoted by IS and IFS, respectively. All frameshifting assays were performed at least three times. Ribosome pausing assays. WG and RRL in vitro translation reactions (30 ml) were supplemented with 1 mM of 2A, 2A-mut or dialysis buffer, and programmed with mRNAs derived from AvaII-cut pPS-EMCV-WT or mutant derivatives. Reactions were incubated at 26°C for 5 min prior to the addition of edeine to 5 mM final concentration. Aliquots (1.5 ml) were subsequently withdrawn at set intervals post-edeine addition, mixed with an equal volume of 100 mg ml À 1 RNase A in 10 mM EDTA and placed on ice. At the end of the time-course, products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The expected size of the ribosomal pause product was marked by translating a control mRNA produced from XhoI-cleaved pPS0.
