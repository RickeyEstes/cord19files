Princess Margaret Hospital is a tertiary care hospital with 1200 beds. It is the designated hospital for infectious diseases in Hong Kong. It was one of the designated hospitals for SARS during the epidemic and managed more than 700 SARS patients. It was also the only designated centre for the management of pregnant women with confirmed or suspected SARS. The Obstetric Department normally handles about 4000 deliveries per year. A few clinical series on SARS have been reported from this hospital including the five infants born to mothers with SARS and the twelve pregnant women with SARS mentioned in the introduction. [5] [6] [7] The outcomes and prognostic factors in 267 patients with SARS were also reported from this hospital. 8 The present study was a retrospective review of all the placentas delivered from women with confirmed SARS during pregnancy. In the clinical paper covering these patients, the pathology of these placentas has been briefly mentioned. 6 A confirmed diagnosis of SARS was based on the combination of clinical features, contact history and laboratory findings. The clinical features included body temperature of 38uC or higher and radiographic evidence of lung infiltrate with or without respiratory symptoms. The history required that there was contact with a patient with SARS or travel history to an endemic area within 10 days of symptom onset. The laboratory findings required a positive result on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serological testing for SARS-CoV. The study period extended from March 2003 to March 2004. This covered the period when SARS was epidemic in Hong Kong (March to June 2003) and the subsequent nine months (July 2003 to March 2004), so that affected mothers could complete their deliveries. All placentas of SARS patients were notified and sent to the pathology department for pathological examination. Placentas from both midtrimester abortion and delivery were included but uterine evacuation specimens from first trimester abortion were excluded. The fresh placentas were delivered to the pathology department with standard precautions after microbiological sampling in the delivery room. The specimens were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 48 h before examination. The placentas were examined by a standard protocol. The first author (WFN) was responsible for the initial or subsequent detailed pathological examination of all the case and control placentas. The placental weight was taken after trimming of the free membrane and cord. Serial sections of the placental disk (1 cm thick were made. Blocks were taken from the membrane, cord, normal and abnormal area of the placental disk. At least two full-thickness blocks were sampled from the normal-appearing central area of the disk. Additional blocks were taken subsequently because of the unexpected findings of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy in two cases. Ten blocks of placental disk were examined for each case placenta (except for the last case, P7, in which four blocks were examined). The H&E sections were examined in detail. Comparisons with a reference set of placentas with known gestation and another control set of placentas were made to assess the morphological maturity of the villi and other microscopic features. Villous maturity that differed by at least 3 weeks from the gestational age was considered significant. The assessment of villous maturity was based on the proportion, size and capillarisation of mature intermediate villi and terminal villi. Because of the lack of a normal reference of placental weight with gestational age for the local Chinese population, the reference graph from Hall 9 was evaluated for the present study. A control set of placentas from non-SARS patients over the study period was collected. This set was chosen from the placentas routinely sent for pathological examination by the obstetrician, based on clinical indications. For each case placenta, two control placentas that matched exactly or within two weeks of the gestational age were chosen. The weights of the case and control placentas were plotted on the reference graph. When significant villous destruction was found, the functional or corrected placental weight was calculated. The percentage of placental destruction (infarct or avascular fibrotic villi) was estimated by combined gross and microscopic assessment of the placental slices. The functional or corrected placental weight was calculated by multiplying the placental weight with the factor of one minus proportion of placenta destroyed. The fetal to placental weight ratio was calculated and compared with the known reference published by Molteni. 10 Hospital records of the mothers and infants were reviewed by the first author (WFN). Correlation of the clinical information with the placental findings was made.
