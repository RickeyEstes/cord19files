A series of studies, using the DA impulse blocker, ~/-BL (750 mg/kg IP, corrected for density, 1.12 g/cc) were done to address the action of cocaine mechanistically. ~-BL is the lactone form of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a naturally occurring CNS compound which has been shown to produce an anesthetic-like state, behavioral depression and EEG central excitation properties (38) . ~/-BL was used because it is quickly converted to GHB in plasma and liver and more uniformly distributed than is GHB (14) . The effect of 7-BL is equivalent to axotomy (36) . The studies were done in unrestrained, freely moving male, Sprague-Dawley rats (390--440 g, Charles River, Kingston, NY). The animals were group housed and were fed Purina Rat Chow and water ad lib before surgery and individually housed (after surgery). A twelve-hour dark-light cycle was maintained both •  I  i  I  m  I  •  I  •  I  i  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  •  I  • subsequent hour (0.05 cc) to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia throughout surgery, i.e., to maintain, e.g., an absence of corneal and pinnal reflexes. Rats were stereotaxically implanted with stearate working electrodes in nucleus accumbens (AP = -2.6, ML= + 2.5, DV =-7.3) (23). Stereotaxic equipment was purchased from Kopf Stereotaxic, Tujunga, CA. Working electrodes were inserted at a rate of 0.5 mm, every five minutes. Body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe and thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Fadem, NJ) and was maintained at 37±0.5°C with an aquamatic K module heating pad (American Hospital Supply, Edison, N J). Ag/AgC1 reference electrodes and stainless steel auxiliary electrodes were placed in contact with cortex. The total time for the surgical procedure was three to four hours. The working, reference and auxiliary microelectrodes were held in place with dental acrylic (Kadon Cavity Liner, Caulk, Becker Parkin Dental Supply Co. Inc., NY). The fabrication of each type of electrode in the in vivo electrochemical (voltammetric) three-electrode assembly is taught in previous publications (5, 7) . Preconcentration steps (conditioning) of the working electrode is also taught in a previous publication (5) and methods to determine the composition of the electrode paste mixture is also taught and previously published (6) . The coulombic efficiency for the detection of DA vis-~t-vis 5-HT with a stearate working electrode is previously described (4) . Precalibration and postcalibration procedures were also done as previously described (7) . Animals recovered in an appropriately bedded Plexiglas cage (dimensions: 12" × 12" × 18") after surgery and before the experimental studies began. Animals were treated with physiological saline (0.5 cc) immediately and for two days after surgery. Each animal was treated with care throughout the surgical procedure and throughout the studies. In vivo voltammetric (semidifferential) studies on conscious rats were begun approximately nine to fourteen days after the aseptic surgical procedures were performed. On each experimental day, an animal was placed in a Plexiglas chamber within a faraday cage (dimensions: 24" x 18"x 23.5"). The three electrode assembly, enclosed within the animal's prosthetic acrylic cap, was connected to a CV37 detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN) by means of a mercury commutator (Brain Research Instruments, Princeton, N J), a flexible cable and a mating connector (BJM Electronics, Staten Island, NY). The CV37 was electrically connected to a Minigard surge suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY) which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. Stable in vivo electrochemical signals for DA and 5-HT were evident before either ~/-BL [750 mg/kg IP, corrected for density (1.12 g/cc)] or cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) were administered. 7-BL was purchased in liquid form from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. Cocaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in deionized (resistance 5 MI~) organic free water. Solutions were made fresh on the day of each study. The effect of ~/-BL on DA and 5-HT neurotransmission without cocaine administration was studied for forty minutes in keeping with its reported maximal effect (36) . The effect of ~/-BL on the action of cocaine on DA and 5-HT was studied for 4 hours after cocaine injection, also in keeping with a previous report (7) . Statistically significant changes after ~/-BL on DA and 5-HT synaptic concentrations in nucleus accumbens were determined by standard repeated measures, analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Statview, Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA). Statistically significant differences between the effects of cocaine on DA and on 5-HT, without impulse flow inhibition by ~/-BL, and those after impulse flow inhibition, were also determined by ANOVA. Confidence Limits (95%) measures were also performed on each point of the time course data following administration of drug. Results are expressed as % of control to minimize between animal variations. Each animal was studied as its own control. Basal DA detection limits, as low as 13 nM and basal 5-HT detection limits, as low as 2 nM are currently possible. Histological placements of working electrodes in nucleus accumbens were confLrrned by the potassium ferrocyanide blue dot method (specifications: current 50 p,A, time in seconds, 30). Virtually no damage to brain tissue occurred.
