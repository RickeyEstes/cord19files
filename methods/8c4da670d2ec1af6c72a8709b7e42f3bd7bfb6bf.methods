Approval for the study was granted by the local institutional review board. Four consultant anaesthetists and 14 anaesthetic trainees participated in this prospective comparative study after giving informed consent. All subjects were staff members of the same large teaching hospital and were selected based on their availability to participate in the study. The presence of learning curves for practical skills in anaesthesia is well recognised and a 90% success rate after 57 attempts has been suggested in a study of anaesthesiologists. 23 Using a mono-exponential model, Smith et al.'s learning curve indicated that after 45 intubations (five halflives) the trainee anaesthesiologist draws close to their 'expert' fibreoptic intubation time. 24 All participants in this study had at least this level of experience. Subjects who had previous experience wearing PPE prior to the commencement of this study or those who had previous opportunities to intubate patients while wearing PPE were excluded from the study. Three weeks before the study, all subjects underwent qualitative fit testing of the N95 face mask. This was performed well before the study to parallel the clinical situation during outbreaks when there is often insufficient time for testing prior to tracheal intubation. For anaesthetists the length of time since obtaining the fellowship was recorded, and for anaesthetic trainees, their level of training was noted. The subjects practised on the manikin using all the airway devices for 30 min immediately prior to their participation in the study to familiarise themselves with the equipment. This aimed to eliminate ''learning phenomena'' during the study because the times for the various procedures might change as a result of familiarity with the equipment. Since the use of PPE during tracheal intubation of patients with infectious respiratory illness is mandatory, the control group wore the basic level of PPE for use in this situation. 2 We had the eye shield group as our control and compared this with the two other types of PPE as described. Subjects applied the PPE in the order control PPE, PPE 1 and then PPE 2 (see Table 1 ). An observer with wide experience in the use of infection control measures and in particular PPE, performed a final inspection after the PPE was applied to ensure that the subjects were dressed in compliance with the above recommendations (Plate 1).
