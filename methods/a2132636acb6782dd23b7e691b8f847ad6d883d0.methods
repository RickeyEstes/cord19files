Study participants were symptomatic military recruits receiving basic training at HMS Raleigh, a large Royal Navy new entry training establishment on the south-west coast of Britain. Recruits were eligible for enrolment into the study upon seeking medical attention with nonspecific influenza-like symptoms, an oral temperature of ‡38°C and either a cough or sore throat. Those recruits meeting the case definition received a written and verbal briefing and were invited to give voluntary and informed consent to participate. The study was designed to enrol subjects over a period of 6 months, from the beginning of November 2000 until the end of April 2001, concurrent with annual epidemics of RSV infections among civilian populations. 8 Bilateral nasopharyngeal swabs and an acute-phase blood sample were collected from participants upon enrolment. In addition, each study participant completed a case report that captured demographic and clinical data. Samples were stored at 2-8°C for up to 48 hours after collection and thereafter nasopharyngeal swabs were stored at )70°C as were serum samples following separation by centrifugation. At 2-4 weeks following initial presentation, participants were recalled and a convalescent serum sample was collected and a follow-up questionnaire regarding the nature, severity and duration of specified symptoms and their effect on training was completed. Virus isolation and identification were performed using standard procedures. 9 Six tissue culture cell lines were used, including, HEp-2 human epithelial cells, primary rhesus monkey kidney cells, MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts, NCI-H292 human lung mucoepidermoid cells, A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and R-Mix [mixed monolayer of mink lung (MvLu1) and A549 cells]. Multiple cell lines were used to facilitate the detection of a variety of respiratory viruses including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2 and 3, adenovirus, enterovirus and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2. Cultures were examined by light microscopy for characteristic viral cytopathic effect. Immunofluorescence using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against each of the respiratory viruses provided viral identification. An ELISA modified from standard methods was used to determine serum IgG antibodies to RSV. 10 Pooled RSV A2 and B virus-infected cell lysates (positive antigens) and mock-infected control cell lysates (negative antigens) were prepared, optimal antigen dilutions were determined, and incubation times, wash conditions and detection conditions were as previously described. 10 Paired acute-and convalescent-phase sera were assayed at two screening dilutions (1:1000 and 1:2000) and subsequently samples demonstrating a 1.5-fold or greater convalescent-to-acute optical density ratio were subsequently assayed over several serial doubling dilutions (1:500-1:64 000). An antibody response to RSV was considered positive when paired samples possessed an acute-phase serum optical density of ‡0.2 and demonstrated a ‡4-fold increase in RSV-specific IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent samples. 10 A highly sensitive, semi-quantitative real-time PCR assay employing a molecular beacon probe was used for the detection of RSV RNA in respiratory secretions derived from nasopharyngeal swab samples. Following RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and nested PCR, molecular beacon real-time PCR and product analysis were performed as previously described. 11 Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate on samples positive for the presence of RSV to determine a mean cycle threshold (C t ) value. Quantification of RSV titre was calculated by interpolation of mean specimen C t values using previously generated standard reference curves.
