We compared two outbreak scenarios: in Scenario A, SARS is able to transmit itself throughout a population without any significant public health interventions. Infected people are isolated and treated as is the standard of care. In Scenario B, quarantine is implemented early on in an attempt to contain the virus, including the quarantine of first-degree contacts of the index case. By comparing these situations, we can investigate whether or not the use of quarantine is justified by being either cost-saving, life saving, or both. All of the costs were calculated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. The transmission rate of SARS is influenced by various factors, the most important being the rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Using educated estimates and data about the effective transmission rate of SARS, the population density of Toronto, the number of contacts a typical person makes in one day, and the incubation period of SARS, we have modeled the spread of SARS throughout a population. The number of contacts a typical person comes in close contact with on any given day varies across individuals and locations. The number of contacts is a constant number, k, which is a function of population density, r, and the number of days a person is infectious, d: The communicability of SARS has proven to be heterogeneous across individuals and the type of contact that people have with infected persons. 6 The transmission rate in a hospital setting, whether the patient encounters healthcare workers, visitors, or other patients, is much higher than in a community setting with casual contact. Similarly, spouses and family members of infected individuals have a higher incidence of disease versus casual contacts. The rate of transmission is also affected by whether or not a SARS patient is a 'super spreader.' This unexplained phenomenon occurs when one infected individual is responsible for spreading the virus to a large number of people. It is impossible to identify super spreaders until observation and contact tracing is done retrospectively, but these individuals were responsible for the large clusters of outbreaks in Toronto. During the Toronto outbreaks, one super spreader infected as many as 32 people. 7 To account for the variability of transmission in our model, we represented the efficiency of transmission as a variable, a. The number of infections at each stage is expressed as Beginning with the index case, the model is as follows: Total number of exposures Z kSðx i Þ The model can be run indefinitely to simulate the spread of infection throughout a population. Preliminary evidence suggests that SARS is most infectious among primary contacts of the index case. The virus appears to lose momentum and become less severe as it is transmitted across contacts. For the sake of simplicity, we assume a constant rate of transmission. Using the above model to estimate the number of exposed and infected individuals, we assessed the economic impact of each scenario by examining the direct and indirect costs associated with each. Because of the relative scarcity of information on SARS, we relied upon data from other researchers, the popular press, and interviews with those involved in the Toronto outbreaks in order to make educated estimates about unknown or uncertain variables.
