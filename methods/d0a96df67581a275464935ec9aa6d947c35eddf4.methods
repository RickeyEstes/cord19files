Melting points were taken in open capillaries and are uncorrected. The progress of the reactions was monitored on silica gel G plates using iodine vapor as visualizing agent. Elisa plate reader was used for measuring absorbance in the visible range. The spectrofuge was used for centrifugation purpose. IR spectra were recorded on Horizon 300 MHz spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 300 MHz instrument. The chemical shifts are expressed in ppm units from an internal TMS standard. All commercially available reagents were used as-received.
