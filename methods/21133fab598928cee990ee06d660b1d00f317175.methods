The protocol for the SARI surveillance system was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the Universities of the Witwatersrand and KwaZulu-Natal. The surveillance data used for the model was deemed non-research by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and did not need human subjects review by that institution. All data that was analyzed was de-identified and consent was obtained from all patients before they were enrolled into surveillance. Information from the surveys used was publically available.
