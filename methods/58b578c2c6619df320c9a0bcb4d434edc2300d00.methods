Ten patients with CFP were drawn from a larger study of acute and recurrent CFP on the Island of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. As previously described (Radke et al., 2013b) , patients were enrolled from the Emergency Department of the Roy Lester Schneider Hospital (the only hospital on St. Thomas), with followups at 3, 6, and 12 months after acute presentation. Seven of the 10 patients had been followed for between 3 and 12 months after acute illness, and had recurrent symptoms. Three patients did not have recurrent symptoms after their initial illness. For one patient, blood was drawn for the current study approximately 4 months from the time of acute illness; the remaining two patients were approximately 2 weeks from the time of their acute episode of illness, and still had residual symptoms. The mean age of ciguatera case patients was 55 years; 4 were male and 6 female. Eight of the 10 patients had an underlying medical diagnosis, including diabetes (2 patients), arthritis (2), hypertension (4), atherosclerotic heart disease (1), thyroid disease (1), and asthma (1). Samples were also collected from 5 control persons: mean age was 35; 4 were male and 1 was female; all lived in Florida; all were in good health; and none had any medical history consistent with CFP. Studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Florida. Whole Blood was collected into a 7.0 mL K3 EDTA vacutainer tube (Becton Dickinson #366450). The whole blood was lysed with Buffer EL (Qiagen #79217) to eliminate red blood cells and isolate the total leukocyte population. For the CFP patient samples only, RNAprotect Cell Reagent (Becton Dickinson #76526) was added to the resultant total leukocyte population to stabilize the cells for subsequent shipment to Florida. The total leukocytes for the CFP and control patients were then processed with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen #74134) to isolate the RNA. Total RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically using the NanoDrop 1000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA quality was assessed using an RNA PicoChip on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Andover, MA). All specimens had RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores greater than 5. Hundred nanograms of total RNA was processed for GeneChip analysis using the GeneChip 1 WT PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) following manufacturer's recommendations. 5.5 m coof resulting cDNA was fragmented, terminally labeled, and targets were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip 1 Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) for 16 h at 45 8C and washed according to Affymetrix fluidics protocols FS450_001. Microarrays were normalized using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) as implemented in Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 (Partek Incorporated, St Louis MO). Only annotated probe sets were used in the subsequent analysis. The resulting 26,831 annotated probe sets represented 25,193 genes. Significant genes (p < 0.001) were identified using the class prediction tool implemented in Biometric Research Branch BRB-ArrayTools version 4.3.0 Stable Release, developed by Richard Simon & BRB-ArrayTools Development Team (http:// linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html). The ability of genes significant at p < 0.001 to distinguish between the classes was determined using leave-one-out-cross-validation studies and Monte Carlo simulations using algorithms implemented in BRB-Array Tools. Gene set analysis was also conducted using BRB ArrayTools.
