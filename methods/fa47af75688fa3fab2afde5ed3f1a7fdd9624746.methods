This was a retrospective study comparing the management of 2 groups of patients in the NNFU program at The Hospital for Sick Children and Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Charts for all infants enrolled in the program during the SARS outbreak (SARS group) were reviewed for the accuracy of developmental assessment for the period before, during and after the SARS containment period. The comparator was patients enrolled in the program two years later who were identified as the non-SARS group. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards at Mount Sinai Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children.
