Expression and purification of CypD K133I. Mutant K133I of human CypD was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown in Luria Broth medium at 37°C up to an optical density (OD) of 0.6 at 600 nm and induced for 2 h with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A, composed of 50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Then, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 30 min and the supernatant was loaded on Q-Sepharose and S-Sepharose columns in series equilibrated with buffer A. The S-Sepharose column was washed with equilibrium buffer and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl. The combined peak fractions were loaded on an S75 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). This two-step purification protocol was sufficient to yield a pure protein. 15 N labelling for the NMR experiments was obtained by growing the bacteria in M9 medium with 15 N-labelled ammonium chloride as sole nitrogen source. The labelled CypD was then purified as described above. Expression and purification of CypA and CypB. CypA and CypB proteins carrying a hexahistidine tag (His-Tag) at their carboxy terminus were expressed in E. coli and purified. Briefly, cultures of C41(DE3) cells were grown at 37°C for 1 h until the culture reached an OD of 0.6 at 600 nm and then induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C (CypA) or overnight at 22°C (CypB). Cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg ml À 1 lysozyme, 0.1 U ml À 1 desoxyribonuclease and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana). The sonicated cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 45 min at 4°C, chromatographed on a Ni-NTA column and washed with a buffer containing 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. The bound protein was eluted in 1 ml fractions with a buffer composed of 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol, monitored by the Bradford colorimetric assay. The purity of each cyclophilin was determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractions enriched in cyclophilin (495% purity) were pooled and dialysed against a buffer containing 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol. PPIase enzyme assay. Cyclophilin PPIase activity was measured at 20°C by using the standard chymotrypsin-coupled assay. The assay buffer (25 mM Hepes and 100 mM NaCl pH 7.8) and the cyclophilin (1,900 nM stock solution) were pre-cooled to 4°C. Then, 5 ml of 50 mg ml À 1 chymotrypsin in 1 mM HCl was added. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 ml of 3.2 mM peptide substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-Cis-Pro-Phe-pNA) in LiCl/TFE solution with rapid inversion. After a delay from the onset of mixing, the absorbance of p-nitroaniline was followed at 390 nm until the reaction was complete (1 min). The final concentration of LiCl in the assay was 20 mM and TFE was present at a concentration of 4% (v/v). Absorbance readings were collected every 1 s by a spectrophotometer. For inhibition assessment, 5 ml of the tested compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the cyclophilin solution in the assay buffer. CsA was used as a positive control in all measurements. The percentage inhibition of cyclophilin PPIase activity was calculated from the slopes and the values obtained represent the mean±s.d. of at least two independent measurements. Fragment library design and docking. Fragments purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium), Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, Missouri), Maybridge (Tintagel, UK) and Chembridge (San Diego, California) were filtered applying a one-dimensional filter (molecular weight o300 g mol À 1 ) based on the 'rule of three' 41 . This virtual library was docked using programme interface LEA3D based on docking programme FlexX 42, 43 . The X-ray coordinates of CypD (PDB-ID 2BIT) were used to dock the fragments. The site for docking was defined to cover the entire active site including the catalytic site and the gatekeeper pocket. No water molecule was included in the binding site. After docking, the top 10% poses of the docking were manually inspected. Compound synthesis. Chemical reagents were obtained from Aldrich Chemical (Saint Louis, Missouri), Acros Organics, abcr GmBh (Karlsruhe, Germany), ACB Blocks (Toronto, Canada) and Chembridge, and were used without further purification. Compound synthesis is described in the Supplementary Methods and their associated comments. NMR experiments. NMR samples used for screening contained 100 mM 15 N-labelled protein, in a buffer consisting of 50 mM KH 2 PO 4 at pH 7.3. 15 N-HSQC experiments were recorded at 298 K in the presence of 5% D 2 O on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Typical acquisition time was 75 min per experiment. Mixtures of ten fragments (cocktails) at an individual concentration of 10 mM were screened. For cocktails soluble in water no DMSO-d 6 was used, whereas 20% DMSO-d 6 was used to solubilize cocktails insoluble in water. The attribution of the 15 N-HSQC spectrum for CypD K133I deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB entry 7310) was used to re-attribute the 15 N-HSQC spectrum of the protein in the presence of 20% DMSO-d 6 . Fragment binding was detected by comparing the 15 N-HSQC spectra in the presence and in the absence of the fragment mixtures. As the fragment cocktails caused significant perturbations in the 15 N-HSQC spectrum for some residues of the active site, one 15 N-HSQC spectrum of 15 N-CypD K133I was recorded in the presence of each individual fragment. All NMR data were processed using Bruker software XwinNMR Version 3.0, and the analyses and comparisons were made with in-house software Cindy for fragment screening. NMR experiments with compounds 22 and 27 were recorded at 25°C on an Inova Agilent 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 1H, 13C and 15 N probe. 1 H-15 N-HSQC spectra were recorded with 50 mM protein, 200 mM compound 27 and 500 mM compound 22. Resonance assignment on ligand binding was checked using three-dimensional nuclear Ö verhauser enhancement spectroscopy-15 N-HSQC spectra with 150 ms mixing time. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 22 and 25-31 are shown in Supplementary Figs 10-25. Crystallization and structure determination of ligand-CypD. Crystals of apo CypD K133I suitable for ligand soaking were obtained by a procedure described by Schlatter et al. 44 . Briefly, CypD K133I was buffer exchanged into 50 mM KH 2 PO 4 at pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM EDTA, and concentrated to 30 mg ml À 1 . Apo CypD K133I crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method at 20°C. Drops were formed by mixing 1 ml of protein with an equal volume of mother liquor containing 25-30% (w/v) PEG 4000 and equilibrated over 500 ml of the same solution. Crystals formed in about one night. The X-ray screening process requires a large amount of reproducible crystals available for soaking. Thus, the crystallization procedure was optimized with the seeding method using the 'Seed Bead' protocol (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California). For fragment soaking, saturated solutions of immersion oil of 1.250 centistokes (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.1 M DMSO stock solutions were made. Crystals were added to the saturated immersion oil for 10 min to 1 day or 0.1 ml DMSO stock solution was added to the growing drop for 10 min to 1 h before flash freezing and data collection. Crystals soaked with a DMSO stock solution were cryoprotected for data collection by brief immersion in oil. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house with an X-Ray generator (RU-200, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) and the Image Plate Detector mar300 (MarResearch, Norderstedt, Germany) or at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, on beamlines BM30, ID14-1, ID14-2, ID14-3, ID14-4 and ID29. Data were integrated and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 suite. The crystals belong to the space group P4 1 2 1 2 (a ¼ b ¼ 57 Å and c ¼ 87 Å) with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using PDB entry 2BIT as the search model. Bound ligands were manually identified and fitted into F o -F c electron density using Coot. The structures were refined by rounds of rebuilding in Coot and refinement using Refmac of the CCP4 suite. Data collection and refinement statistics for crystal structures are presented in Supplementary Tables 4 to 11 . Crystallization and structure determination of ligand-CypA. Crystals of apo CypA suitable for ligand soaking were obtained by means of hanging drop vapour diffusion by mixing 1 ml of CypA 20 mg ml À 1 in 50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl and 1 ml of Hepes 100 mM pH 7.5, 20% PEG 10k (w/v), 5% ethanol at 20°C, equilibrated over 500 ml of the same solution. Crystals formed in about one night. A 0.1 ml DMSO stock solution of compound 22 was added to the growing drop for 10 min before flash freezing and data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house with the X-Ray generator RU-200 and the Image Plate Detector mar300. Data were integrated and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA of the CCP4 suite. The crystals belong to the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 (a ¼ 40.7 Å, b ¼ 52.3 Å and c ¼ 86.9 Å) with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using PDB entry 1CWA as the search model. Bound ligand was manually identified and fitted into F o -F c electron density using Coot. The structures were refined by rounds of rebuilding in Coot and refinement using Refmac of the CCP4 suite. Data collection and refinement statistics for crystal structure are presented in Supplementary Table 8 . Isothermal titration calorimetry. The proteins were dialysed against buffer A containing 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. Twenty to 50 mM of protein was loaded into the MicroCal VP-ITC (Malvern, Orsay, France) isothermal titration calorimeter cell (B2 ml, cell volume B1.4 ml). The titration syringe (250 ml volume) was filled with 1 mM ligand solution in buffer A. Titrations were carried out using 40 injections of 4 ml each, injected at 5 min intervals. Stirring speed was 400 r.p.m. Titrations were carried out at a constant temperature of 25°C. Data were fit to a single site binding model using Origin 5.0 software. Assessment of anti-HCV activity. An HCV genotype 1b bicistronic replicon was transfected in Huh7 cells 45 grown in DMEM medium Glutamax II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU ml À 1 penicillin, 100 mg ml À 1 streptomycin, 0.1 mg ml À 1 fungizone and 600 mg ml geneticin (G418). HCV replicon-harbouring cells were seeded at a low density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the tested compounds in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% DMSO without G418 and cultured for 3 days. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HCV RNA levels were measured by means of a quantitative real-time PCR assay using the Taqman technology with HCV-specific primers (sense 5 0 -CGCCCAAACCAGAATACG A-3 0 and antisense 5 0 -AGATAGTACACCCTTTTGCCAGATG-3 0 ) and probe (5 0 -6-FAM-CAATGTGTCAGTCGCG-TAMRA-3 0 ) on an ABI 7003 device (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). HCV RNA levels were measured by means of a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware). The results were normalized to the GAPDH gene. Each data point represents the average of at least three replicates in cell culture. HCV RNA level reductions after treatment were assessed by comparing the level of HCV RNA in compound-treated cells with that of control cells treated with 1% DMSO. Assessment of anti-HIV activity. Compounds diluted in DMSO (0.4 ml) was added to 40 ml of cell growth medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Hepes) in each well of 384-well assay plates (10 concentrations) in quadruplicate. One-millilitre aliquots of 2 Â 10 6 MT-4 cells were pre-infected for 1 and 3 h, respectively, at 37°C with 25 ml of either cell growth medium or a fresh 1:250 dilution of an HIV-IIIb concentrated ABI stock (0.004 multiplicity of infection). Infected and uninfected cells were diluted in cell growth medium and 35 ml of a suspension of 2,000 cells was added to each well of the assay plates, respectively. The assay plates were then incubated in a 37°C incubator. After 5 days of incubation, 25 ml of twofold concentrated CellTiter-Glo Reagent (Promega Biosciences, Madison, Wisconsin) was added to each well of the assay plates. Cell lysis was carried out by incubating at room temperature for 2-3 min and then chemiluminescence was read using an Envision multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts). Data were converted into percentages of the untreated control and non-linear regression was performed to calculate EC 50 values. For compound cytotoxicity assessment, the protocol was identical except that uninfected cells were used. Assessment of anti-human coronavirus 229E activity. MRC-5 cells (RD-Biotech, Besanc¸on, France) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 50 U ml À 1 penicillin, 50 mg ml À 1 streptomycin and 0.1 mg ml À 1 amphotericin B (Fungizone, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). Twelve hours before infection, MRC-5 cells were seeded at the density of 2 Â 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate. Cells were infected with human coronavirus 229E at the multiplicity of infection of 1 in DMEM containing 2% FCS, 50 U ml À 1 penicillin, 50 mg ml À 1 streptomycin and 0.1 mg ml À 1 amphotericin B for 72 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitors. The viral cytopathic effect was quantified with 'Cytotox-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay' (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). Virusinduced cytotoxicity was calculated as relative light unit signal in infected treated cells minus relative light unit signal in non-infected treated cells. Calcineurin phosphatase assay. The inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity was measured by measuring the dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Csa or compound 31 were incubated in a 1:1 molar ratio with recombinant CypA at room temperature for 30 min, in the presence of 1.32 nM of calcineurin and 50 nM of calmodulin. After p-nitrophenyl phosphate addition, the reaction was run for 35 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by addition of BIOMOL green reagent and OD was measured at 630 nm. The results are the means of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. They are presented as the percentage of calcineurin activity relative to that in the inhibitorfree control. Inhibition of IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells (2 Â 10 5 cells per well) were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with either compound 31 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 20 mM or CsA at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 2 mM. Duplicate evaluations were included for each test concentration. At the end of the pretreatment period, cells were induced with a mixture of phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin at 50 ng ml À 1 and 1.34 mM, respectively. After a 6 h incubation, sample supernatants were collected for measurement of IL-2 production using a commercial kit (Quantikine ELISA, R&D Systems). LogD determination. The octanol/water partitioning (LogD) values of compounds were determined from their retention times during reverse-phase HPLC at pH 7.4 with diode array ultraviolet/visible detection. The LogD values were obtained by interpolation within a standard curve (range LogD: 0.3-5.7) generated with seven standards, with LogD values previously determined using the shake-flask method. Solubility and chemical stability. Kinetic solubility was determined by diluting a DMSO stock of the compound into the test media solutions (PBS pH 7.4 and 0.1 N HCl pH 1.0) to a final concentration of 100 mM with a total DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v) at 37°C. The solutions were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 24 h and were then centrifuged, and the recovered supernatants assayed by HPLC with diode array ultraviolet/visible detection. Solubility values were calculated by comparing the amount (by chromatographic peak area) of compound detected in the defined test solution with an unextracted standard. Relative chemical stabilities of compounds after 24 h incubation in PBS at 37°C were also determined. The solubility and chemical stability of a quality-control compound (amprenavir) were determined in parallel. Caco-2 cell permeability. Permeability and efflux potential were determined using confluent (Z21 day) monolayers of Caco-2 cells grown on transwell filters. Compounds were added to donor wells at a target concentration of 10 mM and rates of appearance in receiver wells (containing 1% BSA to maintain sink conditions) were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Quality controls included transepithelial electrical resistance, lucifer yellow exclusion, low (atenolol) and high (propranolol) permeability controls and the ability to demonstrate polarized efflux of digoxin. Protein binding. The extent of binding to pooled human plasma and to cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was determined by equilibrium dialysis against isotonic phosphate buffer. Equilibrium dialysis was conducted at 37°C with initial concentrations of compounds of 2 mM in the non-buffer matrix. A 3 h dialysis time was used for equilibration. Following dialysis, plasma samples were drained into pre-weighed polypropylene tubes containing buffer and buffer samples were drained into pre-weighed tubes containing blank plasma. Postdialysis plasma and buffer weights were measured and recorded for concentration and recovery calculations. After precipitation and centrifugation, LC-MS/MS assays were used for the analysis of each of the protein/phosphate buffer-mixed matrices. Relative binding to human plasma and cell culture medium was determined in a similar manner, except that the two matrices were dialysed against each other directly and the compound was spiked into both matrices. After equilibration, the plasma sample was diluted with blank cell culture medium and the cell culture medium diluted with blank plasma. Stability with hepatic microsomal fractions. The compounds (3 mM) were incubated in duplicate for up to 1 h in the presence of human hepatic microsomal fractions (0.5 mg protein ml À 1 final) at 37°C. The addition of cofactor solution (NADPH generating system) initiated the reaction and aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after the start. The concentrations of the compounds in each sample were determined using specific LC-MS/MS assays. The half-life for the disappearance of each was determined by fitting the concentration-time data with a monophasic exponential model. A control compound (verapamil) was run in parallel to test the enzymatic integrity of the microsomal fractions. Metabolism by recombinant human cytochrome P450. Five micromoles of compound was incubated with individual bacterially expressed recombinant human cytochromes P450 co-expressed with human NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. The reduction in substrate concentration was monitored over 45 min using specific LC-MS/MS assays and the in vitro half-life calculated in the same manner as that described for hepatic microsomal stability. Enzyme-selective positive control substrates were tested in parallel. Cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition assays. Up to 25 mM of compounds 29 and 30 was incubated with human hepatic microsomal fractions and NADPH in the presence of individual probe substrates. All assays were designed so that conditions were linear with respect to time and protein concentration. Substrates were present at concentrations equal to or lower than their respective Km values. Enzyme selective products were determined by fluorometry (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase) or by specific LC-MS/MS assays. Relative enzyme activities were determined by comparison with those assayed with DMSO vehicle instead of inhibitor. IC 50 values were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting using a sigmoidal model. Positive control inhibitors for each enzyme were tested in parallel.
