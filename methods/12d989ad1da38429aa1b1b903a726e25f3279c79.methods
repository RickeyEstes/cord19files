This was a systematic review of articles published during the period 1930 to 2008. The inclusion criteria for the retrieved articles were the presence of an accidental viral infection in workers or students in research laboratories or hospitals and the presence of respective case reports. Exclusion criteria were the absence of the casuistics in the above thematic, the absence of the determination of the viral etiology, or the lack of at least a probable mode of infection. The following academic Internet search systems were used: PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scirus, and Scielo. They were searched with the keywords ''virus laboratory infec-tion'', ''virus hospital infection'', ''accidental virus infection'', ''accidental infection by virus'', and their translations in Portuguese, German and Spanish. The references of the articles obtained were also used as sources. Previous articles available to the authors that met the inclusion criteria and were not eliminated by the exclusion criteria were also analyzed. Percentages of infections by virus or virus groups respective to the various modes of infection were calculated and summary tables were produced.
