The study utilized publicly available data recorded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since the emergence of MERS in September 2012, the WHO has received notification of confirmed MERS-CoV cases from 27 countries (WHO, 2017) . MERS-CoV continues to be reported to the WHO from countries of the Middle East. The data are publicly available at http://www.who.int/csr/ don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/. As at April 26, 2017, the WHO had recorded 1938 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS globally (WHO, 2017) . The data were extracted by a research assistant and reviewed for quality by the study author. The extracted data were compared to the data that are publicly reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health. The study included MERS patients from Saudi Arabia reported between January 5, 2015 and the most recent report on April 3, 2017. The author reviewed data from January 5, 2015, as this is the date that the WHO began using standardized case presentations and also started reporting cases by the country in which they were identified. The study included only symptomatic patients, patients who had an available date of symptom onset, and patients who had an available date of diagnosis. A total of 537 symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection with available date of symptom onset and diagnosis were identified. The author retrieved patient data and clinical information including sex, age, and region in Saudi Arabia, along with comorbidities, whether the patient was a healthcare worker, the severity of the illness, whether the patient died, and the source of the infection. The date of final laboratory diagnosis and the date of symptom onset were also collected. The primary outcome was the time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis, defined as the number of days after developing symptoms until diagnosis.
