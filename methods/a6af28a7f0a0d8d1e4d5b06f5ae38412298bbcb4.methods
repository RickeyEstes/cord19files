Data are derived from sampling performed between October 2016 and April 2018 as part of the Virome project, a proactive sampling of respiratory virus infection rates, associated symptom reports and rates of seeking clinical care. We enrolled 214 healthy individuals from multiple locations in the Manhattan borough of NYC. Cohort composition is described in Galanti et al. (3, 4) and includes: children attending two daycares, along with their siblings and parents; teenagers and teachers from a high school; adults working at two emergency departments (a pediatric and an adult hospital); and adults working at a university medical center. The cohort was obtained using convenience sampling, and all participants were younger than 65 years. While the study period spanned two years from October 2016 to April 2018, some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu season (October -April) and others for the entire study period. Participants (or their guardians, if minors) provided informed consent after reading a detailed description of the study (CUMC IRB AAAQ4358). Nasopharyngeal samples were collected by study coordinators once a week irrespective of participant symptoms. Samples were screened using the GenMark eSensor RVP system for 18 different respiratory viruses, including coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Sample collection and extraction followed the same protocol as in Shaman et al. (5) . In addition, participants completed daily self-reports rating nine respiratory illnessrelated symptoms (fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, chest pain) each of which was recorded on a Likert scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The daily self-report also documented whether participants had sought medical attention, stayed home or taken cold and flu-related medications (both over-the-counter and prescription) as a consequence of their listed symptoms (see (4) for further survey details). Table 1 . Definitions of symptomatic infections. All symptom definitions are described in reference to a -3 to +7-day window around the date of the initial positive swab for an infection episode. Note, Definition 4 is relative to an individual's long-term average total symptom score. Definition 1 At least one day with a daily score >3 Definition 2 Minimum two individual symptoms >0 and at least one symptom >1 Definition 3 Total symptom score >9 Definition 4 Total symptom score greater than twice the weekly average for the infected individual Definition 5 Total symptom score >0 (i.e. any reported symptom) We defined an infection (or viral) episode as a group of consecutive weekly specimens from a given individual that were positive for the same virus (allowing for a one-week gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding). Medically attended illness, sick days at home and medicine uptake were defined as episodes in which the participants reported seeking care, staying home or taking medicines due to respiratory symptoms. We classified all infection episodes as symptomatic or asymptomatic according to individual symptom scores in the days surrounding the date of the first positive swab of an episode. We used multiple definitions as a standard for symptomatic infection does not exist (Table 1) . These symptom definitions are described in reference .

Daily score is defined as the sum of the 9 individual symptoms (range: 0-27). Total symptom score is the daily symptom score summed over the -3 to +7-day window. Table 2 presents the findings for seasonal CoV from this proactive sampling effort. 135 CoV infection episodes were identified. CoV-OC43 infection was most frequent (n=61), and CoV-NL63 infection was least frequent (n=15). Note that co-infections occurred; hence, the sum of the type infections is greater than the total reported in the final column of Table 2 . Adults (20+ years old) constituted 64% of the cohort, provided 67% of collected swab specimens, and experienced 50% of all CoV infection episodes.
