Sequence of Genomes. We downloaded the protein, and mRNA sequences of five ebolaviruses: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV) (Accession Number FJ217161), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) strain Pennsylvania (Accession number AF522874), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) strain Gulu (Accession Number AF086833), Tai Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) (Accession Number FJ217162), and Ebola virus -Mayinga, Zaire, 1976 (EBOV-May) (Accession Number AF086833) from the NCBI 22, 23 . These genomes have sizes between 18-19 kb with 40-42% GC content. There are seven genes present in EBOV with two variants of glycoproteins (GP) gene in RESTV and SUDV, while three splice variants have been annotated in other species. Following are the splice variants of GP; i) GP is the spike protein, ii) sGP: (soluble GP) is the default 7A variant and iii) ssGP: (small soluble GP) is a -1A(6A) variant. The alignment file for each protein/mRNA across the different species was generated using ClustalW 24 . Viral-specific conserved patterns. In order to investigate virus-specific conserved patterns, overlapping patterns of 9 amino acids (9mer) were generated, from proteins of above-mentioned five ebolaviruses. There were 43 proteins in total (including different splice variants of GP gene) from the five ebolaviruses. Further, all the possible 9mer peptides from each protein were predicted for their immunological potential. One of the challenges in vaccine development is to avoid self-tolerance as the body's immune system rarely acts against self-antigens. Thus, all those 9mers that are available in the human body (or human genome) were removed. In order to achieve this goal, we removed all those viral patterns that are 100% identical to any pattern found in human thousand proteomes. Human thousand proteomes were created by using 1000 Genomes data and translating it to proteins sequences 25, 26 . This led us to the 9mer peptide/pattern that is found in this virus but absent in human proteomes. In order to develop an effective vaccine against a wide range of species, it is important to identify conserved patterns across the different species of Ebola. Therefore, this study involves the identification of unique patterns of 9mer peptides along with the frequency of their occurrence across different ebolaviruses. Also, a high priority was given to a pattern, which was common in the most number of ebolaviruses, which led to patterns/peptides of size of 9 residues that were conserved among ebolaviruses. Pipeline for epitope prediction. After the exploration of 9mer peptides which were found to be conserved in different ebolaviruses but absent in human proteomes, our next goal was to identify peptides that could activate the human immune system in order to generate memory cells against Ebola virus. In order to understand the immunomodulatory or stimulatory effect of these peptides, we computed different types of epitopes as described below: B-cell epitope prediction. In this study, we have used the recently developed method LBtope 27 for predicting linear B-cell epitopes among the aforementioned conserved patterns. LBtope is a highly accurate method trained on a large dataset that contains experimentally validated B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes. We applied the LBtope model with default threshold of 60% probability cut-off. Similarly, conformational B-cell epitopes have been predicted in the above conserved peptides using CBTOPE 28 . CBTOPE is a unique method that predicts conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its amino acid sequence as opposed to previous methods, which required the structure of the antigen to predict the same. The CBTOPE results were obtained on the default threshold of − 0.3 cut-off and implemented on our website. MHC alleles binding peptides. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of cell surface molecules that plays a vital role in the human immune system. The major role of the MHC is to bind to antigenic regions (or peptides) and present these peptides on the cell surface, where appropriate T-cells recognize these peptides. Thus, it is important to predict MHC binders, as these binders have the ability to activate the T-cells of the immune system. In this study, we have used ProPred1 with top 4% cutoff (default) for predicting MHC Class I binders 29 . ProPred1 is a matrix-based program, which predicts the peptide binding potential for 47 MHC Class I alleles. These binders may activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), so we may call these binders as potential CTL epitopes, which were predicted using CTLPred with default parameters. Similarly, to predict potential T-helper epitopes, we predicted MHC Class II binders in the above conserved peptides. The prediction of MHC Class II binders was performed using ProPred 30 with top 3% threshold as suggested by the authors of ProPred. It is a quantitative/virtual matrix-based method that allows the users to predict promiscuous MHC Class II binders for 51 alleles. T-cell response prediction. In addition to the prediction of MHC binders which are potential T-cell epitopes, we also predicted CTL epitopes using a direct method, CTLPred 31 . CTLPred is a direct method that predicts T-cell epitopes (CTL) from a primary sequence of the antigen instead of using the intermediate step where MHC Class I binders are predicted. CTLPred has a number of modules (e.g., ANN, SVM) for predicting CTL epitopes; in this study we have used SVM-based module with default parameters. In the past, numerous methods have been Scientific RepoRts | 6:24782 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24782 developed for predicting MHC Class II binders but none of them has been able to predict the type of interleukins released by these binders. In this study, we have used a method, IFNepitope with a default threshold of 0.0 to predict the antigenic region or MHC binders that can activate Th1 cells (T-helper cell type I) 32 responsible for releasing interferon-gamma (IFN-γ ). In brief, we predicted IFN-γ inducing peptides in Ebola antigens using IFNepitope. Similarly, we also predicted antigenic regions that can activate Th2 cells responsible for releasing of cytokine, interleukin-4 (IL4). In this study, we used IL4pred, at a default threshold of 0.2, for predicting the IL4-inducing antigenic regions or peptides in Ebola antigens 33 .
