GA combining A* is used as method of the decision support system in this research. The framework of the decision support system involves four major processes as shown in Figure 2 : (1) Condition assessment, assess the sustainability level of the hospital building based on the criteria; (2) System operation, calculate the varied refurbishment solutions; (3) Methods, provide renovation actions by adopting a hybrid approach algorithm that analyses the trade-off between the user's preferred budget and expected improvement level; and (4) Solution, compare the renovation solution actions of a real project and decisions suggested by the system.
