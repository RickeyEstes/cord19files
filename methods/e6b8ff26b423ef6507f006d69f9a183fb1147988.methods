Two separate telephone surveys were conducted in the province of Alberta, Canada. The first survey was administered between October 2004 and January 2005, and was designed to examine public information seeking and perceptions of the 2003 SARS epidemic. During October 2010 a second survey was conducted to better understand public information seeking and perceptions of pandemic H1N1, and how this compared to the SARS survey results. The responses of Albertans are considered to be generally representative of the Canadian response for both occurrences. As shown in Table 1 , SARS was centred primarily in the Toronto area, and Ontario residents would thus be expected to have a unique and atypical response; Albertans were affected in a minor way similar to other provinces across Canada, and are likely more generally characteristic of the response of the majority of Canadians residing outside of Ontario. The H1N1 outbreak affected Canadians on a wider and more uniform scale, with Albertans again likely to respond similarly to the general Canadian population ( Table 2 ). A representative sample of Albertans was accessed through the Population Research Laboratory at the University of Alberta. The target population were those 18 years and older who, at the time of the survey, were living in Alberta and could be contacted by landline household telephones. From this population, three samples were drawn: the Edmonton metropolitan area (SARS survey n = 403; H1N1 survey n = 401), the Calgary metropolitan area (SARS survey n = 403; H1N1 survey n = 400), and the rest of the province (SARS survey n = 403; H1N1 survey n = 402), for a total of 1,209 Albertans completing the SARS survey and 1,203 Albertans completing the H1N1 survey. These sample sizes are generally representative of the provincial demographic distribution [40] . Participants were recruited using a Random-Digit Dialling (RDD) approach to ensure that residents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. A respondent within each household was selected on the basis of gender to ensure an equal selection of male and female participants. If contact was not made on the first call, a maximum of 10 call-back attempts were made before declaring a residential telephone number as "no contact." Ten percent of the respondents were randomly selected and recontacted by the survey telephone supervisors for interviewing validation. The overall response rate was 47% for the SARS survey and 21% for the H1N1 survey. Ethical approval for was obtained from the University of Alberta Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Home Economics Research Ethics Board (SARS survey) and the Faculties of Arts, Law and Science Research Ethics Board (H1N1 survey). As authorized by these Research Ethics Board, participants provided oral consent after being read an explanation of the survey, their rights as participants (that their participation was entirely voluntary, they did not need to answer a question, and they could terminate the interview at any time), and an assurance of confidentiality (that the information provided would be used only for the indicated purpose in conformity with the Alberta Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the information would be stored in a secured database and used only for study purposes, the results would be analyzed only in group format and no single person would be identifiable). Participants were also provided with a name and toll free number to contact if they required further information. As is customary for telephone surveys involving no more than minimal risk and not involving procedures for which written consent is required outside the research context, the requirement for written consent was deemed to be unfeasible and waived. Oral consent was recorded as part of the overall telephone interview. The surveys were designed with similar questions to effectively compare and contrast information seeking and information source perceptions of both outbreaks. In both the SARS and H1N1 surveys, respondents were asked how much information about SARS/H1N1 they got from nine sources: newspapers; television; radio; Internet; call lines (e.g. Health Link Alberta, a toll-free telephone service offered by Alberta Health Services that provides health advice and information); their doctor; other health professionals they know; other health professionals they don't know; and friends and relatives who are not health professionals. An additional information source, social networking sites, was added to the H1N1 survey. Response options were based on a five point Likert scale ranging from 1 = "very little" to 5 = "a great deal", with the option of answering "none" if the medium was not used. Respondents were also asked to rank the same information sources based on usefulness and perceived credibility of the information, again using a five point scale. During the 2004 SARS survey, respondents were asked about preferred information sources for future outbreaks. The data was tabulated and analysed using SPSS for Windows statistical package version 18 (a product of SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Averages and frequencies were calculated for questions utilizing Likert scales, and are reported as both the percentage of people using the information source, and 'mean scores' reflecting the average along the 5-point scale. Results from the SARS and H1N1 surveys are reported separately to illustrate information seeking preferences during each pandemic, and to compare any changes between time periods and outbreaks. To ensure comparability of results and to account for major demographic differences between the two surveys in age and education distribution, the H1N1 data for these two demographic characteristics were weighted against the SARS data. Weighting factors range from 0.40 to 3.77. Unweighted, the mean value of the weighting factor is approximately equal to 1. A Chisquare Goodness-of-Fit test was used to compare the age, education and income respondents distributions of the two surveys against the appropriate census distributions for both Canada and the province of Alberta.
