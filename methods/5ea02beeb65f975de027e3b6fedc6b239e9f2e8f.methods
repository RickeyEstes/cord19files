Materials. Vendors for specific chemicals are listed below. In general, restriction enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs, and cell culture products were purchased from Gibco/Invitrogen. Chimera composed of aptamer targeting PSMA and siRNA targeting GFP. ssDNA of the PSMA aptamer (39 nucleotides, 59-GGGAGGACGATGCGGATCA-GCCATGTTTACGTCACTCCT-39) was chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and used as the template to generate one strand of the siRNA-aptamer chimera. For amplification, PCR was performed with 39 primer containing the anti-sense strand of GFP siRNA (underlined) and 59 primer containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter site (bolded). The PCR primer sequences are: 39 primer: 59-GGCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCTTTTAGGAGTGACGTA-AAC-39 59 primer: 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGACGATGCGG-39 The 81 bp PCR product was put into T-A cloning pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). After sequencing, positive plasmids were selected and used as the template for PCR. The resulting PCR product was separated with 2% agarose gel and recovered with QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was used as the template for in vitro transcription with MEGAscriptT7 Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instruction. 29 fluoro-modified pyrimidines (TriLink, San Diego) were added to replace CTP and UTP. RNA molecules generated by the transcription reaction were annealed with the sense strand of GFP siRNA (chemically synthesized with or without 59-Cy3 or FAM by IDT). The sequence is 59-(Cy3 or FAM)-CAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCUU-39. For annealing, the transcripted RNA and the synthetic siRNA sense strand were mixed at molar ratio 151 in duplex buffer (IDT) and incubated at 94uC for 3 min followed by slow cooling to 25uC in 1 hour. The final chimera was store at 280uC. The constructs were cloned into PET28a (1) expression vector (Novagen). The constructs for dsRBD-His 6 and dsRBD-His 18 were obtained using full-length PKR gene (clone ID 8068981) as PCR template, and the dsRBD-His 24 and dsRBD-His 30 constructs were made by grafting additional histidines to the dsRBD-His 18 plasmid using PCR. The restriction enzyme sites for BamH1 and Xho1 were introduced in the PCR primers for cloning. dsRBD-His 6 construct was introduced with two stop codons (TAA and TGA) before the Xho1 site. For the other three constructs, the reading frames cover the His 6 sequence in the vector at the C-terminal end before the stop codon. The PCR products and PET28a (1) Single colonies were selected and grown at 37uC for 12 h in Circlegrow medium containing 30 mg/ml kanamycin. Overnight cultures were diluted at 15100 (v/v) into fresh medium and incubated at 37uC until the OD 600 values reach 0.5-1.0. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM), and cell growth was continued for another 4-5 hour at 30uC. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-10 rotor) at 10,000 g for 10 min and stored at 220uC. Cells were suspended in Bug-Buster Mix (Novagen) with 5 ml reagent per gram of wet cell paste. Bug Buster Mix was added with protease inhibitor EDTA-free cocktail (Pierce), 10% glycerol, and 1.0 mM THP (Novagen). The cell suspensions were incubated on a shaker platform for 30 min at room temperature. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (Beckman TL120) at 20,0003 g for 20 min at 4uC. The soluble extracts were loaded onto affinity columns with Ni-charged His Bind Resin (Novagen). Following washing with binding buffer and washing buffer, the desired proteins were eluted with 6 volume elution buffer (Novagen). The eluted proteins were dialyzed with PBS containing 10% glycerol and 0.1% (v/v) b-mercaptoethanol for 24 hours. Purified proteins were probed using 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Functional characterization of siRNA-aptamer chimera. To test the functionality of the siRNA block, the chimera described above and GFP siRNA control (Qiagen) at a final concentration of 50 nM were transfected into C4-2 prostate cancer cells stably expressing GFP using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. To evaluate the targeting specificity of the aptamer block, PSMA-positive LNCaP cells and PSMA-negative PC3 cells were treated with complex of chimera and dsRBD-His 18 (chimera/protein tag molar ratio at 152, 100 nM chimera) in serum free medium for 2 hours, followed by incubation in complete medium for another 12 h. DAPI (30 nM) was added to stain cell nuclei. Fluorescent images were captured on an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope equipped with 5 long-pass filters and a colored CCD camera. Characterization of RNA binding capability of the four protein tags. The binding capabilities of the four polyhistidine modified dsRBD proteins were evaluated by native agarose gel. The chimera was labeled with FAM at the 59 end of siRNA's sense strand (IDT). To prepare chimera/dsRBD complex, chimera (5 mM, 10 ml) was incubated with the protein tags at protein/chimera molar ratios of 1, 2, or 4 for 1 h at 4uC. Bound chimera and unbound chimera were quantified on 1% agarose gel using a Macro imaging system (Lightools Research, CA). Evaluation of endosomal escape. PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells were seeded on 35 mm glass-bottom petri dishes (MatTeck Corp) at a density of 5 3 10 4 cells/well for 24 hours in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Complexes of chimera labeled with Cy3 (IDT) and protein tags (His 6 and His 18 ) were added to LNCaP cells in serum-free medium for 2 hours, followed by incubation in complete medium for 12 hours. LysoTrackerH Green DND-26 (80 nM, Invitrogen) was then added for 4 hours at 37uC. Images were captured on a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Microscopy and flow cytometry studies of gene knockdown efficacy. C4-2 prostate cancer cells expressing GFP were seeded into 35 mM glass-bottom petri dishes for confocal imaging or 6-well plates for flow cytometry. Cells were treated with chimera & dsRBD-His 18 and compared with five control groups including no treatment, treated with GFP-siRNA alone, chimera alone, a random sequenced siRNA with the protein tag (His 18 ), and chimera with protein tag (His 6 ) for 2 h in serum free media and then incubated in complete media for 60 h. Confocal images were again obtained with LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with argon (488 nm) and HeNe (543 nm) lasers; and quantitative flow cytometry investigation was done on a BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer. Cytotoxicity assay. LNCaP cells were seeded in 96-well plate at 4 3 10 3 /well for 24 hours, and then treated with different concentrations of dsRBD-His 18 protein tag for 72 hours. CellTiter-Blue reagent (20 ml) was added into each well. After 4 h incubation at 37uC, cell viability was assessed by fluorescence intensity at 590 nm (excitation 570 nm) on a TECAN infinite M200 microplate reader.
