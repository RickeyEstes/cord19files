The English translation of the full questionnaire is available as Supplementary material. The surveyed population consisted of HCWs from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Prof. Dr. Matei Balș'. The questionnaire was distributed to all medical staff through division chiefs, and no category of HCWs was specifically excluded from the survey. The study protocol, informed consent form and questionnaire were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Prof. Dr. Matei Balș' (approval no. 3426 from 01 June 2016) before study initiation. The questionnaire was administered once during 1e30 June 2016 to all HCWs who gave their informed consent to participate. The statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For continuous non-normally distributed variables, we report medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), along with the results of the ManneWhitney U test and effect size and Spearman's rank-order correlation. For categorical variables, we report the results of the c 2 test with its 4 or Cramer's V effect and relative risk (RR) along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for risk estimates. For comparing categorical characteristics of study respondents and non-respondents, we applied the two-sided z test for two population proportions. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict continuous outcome variables based on respondent characteristics.
