In vitro analysis of FCoV-infected cells TCID50 of the FCoV strain FIPV 79-1146 (ATCC® VR2202) [22] was determined using endpoint dilution assay. Virus infectivity was confirmed by RT-PCR (Bioline, UK) detecting the FCoV conserved 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) [23] . To prepare a sufficient amount of infected cells at different time points, two confluent 75 cm 2 flasks of CRFK cells (ATCC® CCL-94™) were inoculated at each time point with 3 ml TCID 50 /ml (MOI = 0.1) of FIPV 79-1146 and the virus inoculum was left in the culture. At 3, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi), the cells were trypsinized and cell pellets were collected upon centrifugation. The uninfected flask was designated as 0 hpi. The cell pellets were stored at −80°C until further use for virus and immune mediator detection by real-time PCR and multiplex bead-based immunoassay.
