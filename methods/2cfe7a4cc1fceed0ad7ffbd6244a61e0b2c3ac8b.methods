Policy review using government websites and shortage analysis using mathematical modelling based days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. .

The number of new cases is expected to decline after the epidemic peak, but the viral transmission is still possible and the need for facemask will not decrease immediately. Therefore, our analysis covered the period from 31 Dec 2019 to 30 Apr 2020 (121 days in total). To simulate the facemask availability in China, we used a mathematical model based on data and assumptions on the production, import, and need. We considered three scenarios in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in 1) Wuhan city (the epicenter); 2) Hubei province (the province/state where the epicenter is located); and 3) the whole of China (the entire country).
