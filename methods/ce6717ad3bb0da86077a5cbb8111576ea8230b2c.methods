The analysis used administrative data, obtained from regional routine flows, such as hospital discharge records related to 2013-2018 period. The data were extracted from administrative healthcare data routinely collect data about ED accesses, hospitalizations, outpatient visits, diagnostic tests, treatments and medical fee exemptions financed by public health funding. They are transmitted by the Ligurian Local Health Agencies (LHAs) and hospitals to A.Li.Sa, where the completeness and quality of data is verified, and then sent to the national Ministry of Health. Healthcare data routinely collected by the public funded LHAs and hospitals were used to assess the impact, in terms of health demand, production and passive mobility, for the pre and post institution period of the Breast Unit. An ad hoc analysis was carried out in order to assess if the adoption of a centralized model leads to significant improvements for the regional health system. VE was estimated using the Maximum Likelihood framework and the Bayesian approach. VC in Apulia was estimated from the 16 birthcohorts targeted by the two-dose vaccination programme (age group 7-22 years in 2018). Confirmed cases derived from measles outbreaks occurred from October 2018 to March 2019. We conducted a matched case-control study in Apulia region (about 397,000 children < 10 years of age), where since 2009 MMRV replaced MMR and monovalent varicella vaccines in toddlers, with a second dose given at 5-6 years and a catch-up dose at 11-12 years of age. Vaccination coverage for varicella progressively increased up to 91.7% for one dose and to 85.9% for two doses of MMRV/monovalent-V vaccine in the birth cohorts 2015 and 2010, respectively. Cases of varicella were obtained from the notifiable diseases surveillance system and the hospital discharge registry. Three controls were randomly selected from the population registration system database and matched to cases on the basis of date of birth and residence. Cases and controls vaccination status was retrieved from the Apulian Immunization Information System. Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. VE was calculated as (1-OR) x100. To identify preterm infants, we extracted the hospital discharge records of infants born between January-June 2017, using the ICD-9-CM codes. We included in the study all preterm infants with a positive crossmatching with records included in the Apulian Immunization Information System. To investigate adverse events (AEs) after the first dose, we interviewed via phone the parents of preterm infants vaccinated with at least one dose of the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine. AEs frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated and compared to those reported for term-born infants in the Summary of Product Characteristics. We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to analyze the available evidence from peer-reviewed studies on the effect of email-based interventions applied to immunization programs. We included any measure of vaccine uptake or immunization coverage, in any target population and settings. We recruited 380 newly-diagnosed incident cases of cutaneous melanoma and 719 sex-and age-matched population controls in four North Italian provinces (Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Bologna) of Emilia-Romagna Region. We estimated their dietary habits using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and we evaluated melanoma risk by computing the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) according to quintile distribution of cadmium intake. We used a conditional logistic regression model to compute ORs, matching by sex, age and province of residence, and adjusting also for phototype, non-alcoholic energy intake, body mass index, and Italian Mediterranean Diet Index. Also a spline regression model was used in order to evaluated possible dose-response relation.  One hundred people aged 35-74 years, resident in Reggio Calabria (South of Italy), were interviewed (face-to-face) following consecutive access to the HES. The 4 Likert-type responses were grouped in 2 classes: 0 (zero) for fairly difficult/very difficult and 1 for fairly easy/ very easy. According to the HLS-EU-Q16 sum score (range: 0-16), three levels of HL were defined: inadequate (0-8), problematic (9-12), sufficient (13-16). Socio-demographics conditions, lifestyles, risk factors were measured and collected. HL mean score and standard deviation-SD were elaborated together with prevalence of the three HL levels. Sociodemographics conditions, lifestyles, risk factors were measured during the HES. Using the Google Analytics dataset, we investigated the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the connections to the "VaccinarSì" website from May 2013 to May 2019. Descriptive analysis of the connections to the national VaccinarSì portal and of the regional portals were made. The demographic indications were obtained through heuristic investigations based on data extrapolated from Google Analytics since November 2015. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 349 women from Southern Italy, with no history of severe diseases. Dietary patterns were derived by Food Frequency Questionnaire and Principal Component Analysis. LI-NE-1 methylation of leukocyte DNA was assessed by pyrosequencing. An anonymous questionnaire was filled by 315 healthcare students (71.4% women, mean age 20.1 ± 3.3) from the Catholic University "Our Lady of Good Counsel" in Tirana (Albania). The questionnaire included demographic information; vaccination status; opinion about vaccine's safety; questions concerning knowledge about measles disease and vaccination. An overall score was generated for each respondent (one point for correct response, maximum score 9). Data were extracted and analyzed using SPSS v.21. The study is embedded in Generation R, a prospective population-based cohort. Final sample included 4653 children aged 10 years. EO was assessed with the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and RE with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Mothers reported the occurrence of 24 adverse events in their offspring's childhood. Regression analyses were conducted, both unadjusted and adjusted for gender, ethnicity, and parental education and psychopathology. A case-cohort design nested in the Moli-sani cohort study was used. A subcohort of 1,146 subjects (mean ± SD age 55.3 ± 11.7 years; men 47.7%) was randomly selected from the whole study population (n = 24,325; recruitment years 2005-2010, Molise Region). All CVD events occurred during a median follow-up of 4.3 years (n = 534 validated myocardial infarctions or strokes; 5.1:1,000 person-years), were selected as case group. Biobank samples were used to genotype 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes NMU (encoding for Neuromedin U), NMUR1 and NMUR2 (receptors) and NMS (Neuromedin S). Methylation levels at 17 CpG sites of two NMU regions (promoter and intergenic) were measured using pyrosequencing. The laboratory analyses are on-going. The associations between SNPs (codominant model) or methylation sites (z-scores) and fatal or non-fatal CVD events were calculated (hazard ratios -HR, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, glucose, lipid levels and CVD history) using SAS software. Multivariate analyses (backward elimination) were performed and a score was computed using beta estimates of risk variants associated with the events at p < 0.1. We analyzed the glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol parameters before the earthquake, after 3-6 months and after two years. Being the diabetic therapy, an important factor influencing our results, we decided to analyze how each patient's therapy changed during the study period, if it was modified in any way (increase/decrease of the dose) or if it remained the same. It was carried out an observational retrospective, monocentre study. 503 women with a diagnosis of cervical dysplasia and treated with a LEEP intervention between January 2012 and October 2018 were consecutively enrolled in the University Hospital of Sassari, Italy. Only 285 were considered for the current analysis owing to a follow-up of at least 24 months. HPV vaccination was offered to patients following the recommendations of the national immunization program.  Researchers investigated the association between the participants' dietary information and their physical performance using the sixminute walking test and the distance walked in meters (6MWD) as main outcome measure. Information on dietary intake was collected using the validated European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ). Then, daily intake of energy and macronutrients were estimated by means of the NAF software (Nutritional Analysis of FFQ). Linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between vegetable, animal and total protein intakes and the 6MWD. The models were adjusted for sociodemographic features, total fats and available carbohydrate intakes. A pooled analysis of cohort studies participating to the INHANCE Consortium was conducted. Descriptive analysis has been conducted to describe the population included in the analysis. Survival was considered as overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS). The impact of BMI on HNC-survival was calculated using the Cox's proportional hazards model both in the univariate and in multivariate analysis.  The search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, in December 2017, following the PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy included 4 types of keywords: parents, vaccine hesitancy/acceptance, immunization and survey. Only English and Italian original papers were included. 17 reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Only the included articles were downloaded in full and, after a second screening, data were extracted and recorded in an ad hoc spreadsheet. This study had a qualitative design: we obtained information about the implementation process through interviews with relevant stakeholders involved in the planning or implementation of vaccination programme at different levels. Data generated were transcribed verbatim and analysed in four steps: familiarization, indexing/coding, charting and mapping/ interpretation. The EUVIS project is coordinated by the School of Public Health of the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. It consists of two parts: the conduction of a systematic review (part I) and the conduction of large-scale surveys among EU Member States (part II). The systematic review is aimed at retrieving and pooling all available evidence on the effectiveness of different ICT-based interventions to promote immunization; the survey is aimed at assessing the use of ICT by EU health authorities in the context of life-course immunization programs, as well as the application of ICT to community-based and providers-based interventions to increase vaccine acceptance in different age groups and populations. ORs environmental data have been collected since July 2018 at IRCCS San Martino Hospital in Genoa, Italy (5 800 personnel, 1 327 beds, 350 000 m 2 surface, 55 buildings, 48 ORs). We adopted case definitions for HAI as reported in ECDC's Point Prevalence Survey protocol (version 5.3), considering an HAI, when not specified, related with the surgery when arose in the first 48h after the surgery. Patients will be retrospectively followed both in the post-operative stay and in eventual outpatient accesses for 30 (90 in case of implant) days after the surgery. Hospital and demographic data will be obtained through the hospital's informatics systems. Air particulate and air microorganisms sampling are carried out respectively with AeroTrak Portable Particle Counter (model 9500) and SAS Super 180 Microbial Air Sampler. The presence of other possible risk factors for OR associated HAI insurgence (such as the nature of the surgery or the operating team's behaviour) will be also indicated. We used data from 2,124 participants of the Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study. Depressive symptoms were assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at baseline and annually in a follow-up questionnaire over 4 years of follow-up. Clinically relevant depressive symptoms were defined as PHQ-9 score ≥ 10. PA and ST were objectively measured with the activPAL3 activity monitor. The association between hourly PA and ST data and depression was assessed with multivariate regression models adjusted for age, sex, level of education, diabetes status, BMI, alcohol, smoking, energy intake, and mobility limitation. We studied the GMPs of the different Regulatory Agencies (EMA, CFDA, COFEPRIS, FDA, Health Canada, ANVISA, CDSCO, PIC/S, and WHO) in order to assess which Authorities allow CM for the production of the following categories of drugs: hormones, immunosuppressants, cytotoxic agents, API, biological preparations, steroids, antibiotics, cephalosporins, penicillin, carbapenems, beta-lactam derivatives. A rapid review of the literature was conducted to assess the evidence supporting health promotion programs. A promotion intervention was scheduled in a population at high risk of sleep problems.
