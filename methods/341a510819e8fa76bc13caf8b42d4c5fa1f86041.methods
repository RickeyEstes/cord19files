After management of 2 cases with MIRAGE syndrome, additional cases were identified by literature search and peer consultations. For inclusion, patients were required to have a confirmed heterozygous mutation in the SAMD9 or SAMD9L gene and a minimum of 1-year follow-up post-transplant. Deidentified data for each case were collected by using a standardized questionnaire. All studies involving human subjects were performed in accordance with site-specific protocols approved by the institutional review board and in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. The primary study endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival. Safety and tolerability of HCT and impact of pretransplant comorbidities were evaluated by occurrence and severity of post-transplant complications, need for life support measures, and risk of transplant-related mortality. Transplant outcomes were defined using Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research criteria [15] . Grading of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and diagnosis of chronic GVHD were based on standard criteria [16] . Surviving patients were censored at last follow-up. Continuous variables were summarized as median and range of values and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using the GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
