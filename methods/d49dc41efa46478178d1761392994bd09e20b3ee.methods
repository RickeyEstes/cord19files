This is a population based cross-sectional descriptive study. The target study population included non-institutionalized persons aged !18 years living in South Korea. The survey was conducted by Gallup Korea Ã¢ , a professional research company, and face-to-face interviews were performed by 80 trained professional interviewers from 19 to 29 April 2005. In order to represent the total population, multistratified random sampling according to the principle of proportionate probability sampling was adopted to select the subjects. South Korea is divided into eight provinces and seven cities and each province or city is further subdivided and stratified into 4e5 units. The number of households to be interviewed in each administrative district was calculated and decided proportionately according to the location and sizes of the district, age and gender. The statistics of 2005 from the National Statistical Office was used for the calculation. 16 If the selected household could not be surveyed, an alternative household was chosen in the same manner. Before the interview, the interviewer explained the purpose of the study to all the subjects and verbal informed consent was obtained by respondents who agreed to participate. The questionnaire contained 22 questions. Data on demographics such as age, gender, level of education, and level of income were obtained. Questions about drinking, smoking and exercise habits and comorbid conditions were asked. The interview continued with asking whether or not the respondent was vaccinated in the season 2004e2005 and 2003e2004. If the respondent was vaccinated in the season 2004e2005, further questions on the reason of vaccination was asked. Thirteen reasons were presented, and respondents were to choose as many as they wish. For non-vaccinated respondent, the reasons of non-vaccination were asked in a form of multiple choice questions with 15 reasons. Six yes-or-no questions on opinions about influenza vaccine were presented to all respondents. Further 11 yes-or-no questions about opinions on influenza and influenza vaccination were presented to high risk group. All respondents were asked whether they intended to have vaccinated in the following season. Regular exercise was defined as performing exercise more than once a week, smoker as currently smoking, and regular alcohol consumer as drinking alcohol more than twice a week. High risk group was defined as either age ! 65 years or having comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions included cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction, diabetes, lung diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, and malignancy. Univariate analysis of factors associated with vaccination/non-vaccination was performed using c 2 test and Fischer's exact test. To describe statistical significance, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed. In logistic regression, gender, presence of comorbid conditions, age (!65), level of education, size of dwelling town, monthly income, smoking habit, drinking habit, exercise habit, vaccination in previous season, history of influenza-like illness and six opinions about influenza were included.
