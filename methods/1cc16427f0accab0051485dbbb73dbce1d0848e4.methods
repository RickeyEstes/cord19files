We conducted a systematic review of studies published prior to 31st December 2018 reporting measures of seroprevalence or prevalence of hCoV-EMC or MERS-CoV RNA in dromedary populations by searching EMBASE (Elsevier, 2018) , MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, 2018) and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, 2018b) using the search strategy in Fig. 1 . The search and the data extraction were conducted by a single author and no publication date restrictions were imposed. For a full list of search terms used, corresponding PRISMA flowchart and checklist see supplementary material S1-3 respectively. Records were excluded if they met the following criteria established prior to the search: opinion pieces, or reviews reporting no new data, studies investigating an aspect of MERS-CoV or another pathogen that did not involve dromedary samples or involved experimentally infecting dromedaries with MERS-CoV, and studies not available in English. Remaining studies were categorised as longitudinal or crosssectional for qualitative synthesis. To address potential bias, we consider studies investigating dromedary populations epidemiologically linked to human MERS-CoV infection separately from those aiming for random sampling. When available, we took the results of neutralisation-based testing over methods that determined seropositivity based on antibody screening tests alone. Neutralising antibody tests are more specific and are the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recommended method for confirming MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedaries (OIE, World Organisation for Animal Health, 2017). We extracted RNA prevalence values determined by RT-PCR of nasal swabs, ignoring any additional samples taken. Use of RT-PCR to test for the presence of at least two of the established genomic regions unique to MERS-CoV is the OIE standard for detection of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries (OIE, World Organisation for Animal Health, 2017) and viral RNA is most frequently and abundantly present in nasal swabs compared to other non-invasive samples (Mohran et al., 2016) . Throughout this review, we use 'calf' to refer to animals under oneyear-old, 'juvenile' â‰¤2 years old, and 'adult' > 2 years old.
