For identifying and comparison of different groups of patients in three clinics, k-means algorithm as a clustering technique was used. Also decision tree, na√Øve base and neural network as classification techniques were applied for the churn prediction and finding the behavioral tendency of current patients based on R, F, M, L attributes. RapidMiner data analysis software was used for preprocessing data records, attribute selection and finally applying proper algorithms, which is the world-leading open-source system for data mining. The result showed that all three classification algorithms had a similar performance on the data records.
