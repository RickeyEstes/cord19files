Lentiviral pseudoparticles using the TRIP lentiviral backbone were generated as previously described 1 . Stable cell lines were generated using the SCRPSY lentiviral backbone as described previously 5 . When stated, p24 ELISA (Clontech) was used per manufacturer's instructions to normalize lentiviral input. Transductions, infections, and plaque assays. One day before transduction 7 × 10 4 cells were plated into 24-well plates. The next day, cells were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles by spinoculation at 800 × g, for 45 min at 37°C in DMEM or RPMI containing 3% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/20 mM HEPES/4 μg/mL polybrene. Six hours after transduction, media was changed to 10% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/RPMI or DMEM. THP-1 cells were transduced with RPMI containing 3% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/20 mM HEPES/10 μg/mL polybrene and media was changed immediately after transduction to 10% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/RPMI. Forty-eight hours post transduction SCRPSY stable cell lines were pooled in a 10 cm dish and allowed to reach confluency prior to addition of puromycin (titrated for each cell line, between 2-8 μg/mL). For transient transductions with TRIP construct lentiviruses, cells were split 1:3 (7-10 × 10 4 cells) for infection approximately 48 h post-transduction and infected the following day. Infections were carried out in a minimum volume of RPMI or DMEM with 1% FBS for 1 h (all viruses except IAV, MV, ONNV), followed by aspiration of virus and addition of 10% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/RPMI or DMEM. Infection with IAV was carried out in a minimum volume of 0.3% BSA/0.1% FBS/PBS++ for 1 h, followed by aspiration of virus and addition of 0.3% BSA/0.1% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/1 μg/mL TPCK/RPMI or DMEM. Infections with MV were carried out for 2 h in 1% FBS/ media, followed by addition of complete media. Infections with ONNV were carried out for 1 h in 1% FBS/media followed by addition of complete media. Adherent cells (all but THP-1) were dissociated with 200 μL Accumax (Sigma, diluted 1:4 in PBS for some STAT1 −/− fibroblast infections) and transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were pelleted at 800 × g for 2 min at 4°C and resuspended in 1% PFA for 10 min at room temperature or 30 min at 4°C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 3% FBS/PBS and kept at 4°C until FACS analysis. IAV-infected and ZIKV-infected cells were permeabilized and respectively stained with a primary antibody reactive to IAV NP (1:500-1:1000 anti-NP, MAB8251, Millipore) or with a primary antibody reactive to flavivirus E protein (1:1000 anti-E, D1-4G2-4-15, Millipore) and a goat anti-mouse secondary IgG antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor488 using Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD Bioscience) per protocol.

For YFV plaque assays, STAT1 -/fibroblasts were infected with YFV-17D for 1 h. Viral supernatant was then removed and cells were washed twice with serumfree RPMI. A total of 500 μL complete medium was added to wells and harvested 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection and stored at −80°C. Collected supernatants were thawed and diluted, then used to infect BHK-21J cells. After 1 h infection with viral supernatants, 3 mL of overlay medium (0.1% NaHCO 3 /4% FBS/10 mM HEPES/ 1.3% Avicel/1000 U/mL penicillin/1000 μg/mL streptomycin/1X DMEM) was added to infected cells and allowed to incubate for 4 days at 37°C. After 4 days, 37% PFA was added to overlay medium/viral supernatant to fix cells. The supernatant was then aspirated and wells were stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. A similar method was used for titering concentrated IAV preps. In brief, confluent layers of MDCK were infected with concentrated IAV diluted tenfold for 1 h at 37°C. Viral supernatant was aspirated and 3 mL of flu overlay medium (0.1% NaHCO 3 /0.3% BSA/1% Avicel/1000 U/mL penicillin/1000 μg/mL streptomycin/2 μg/mL TPCK/1X DMEM) was added to infected cells and allowed to incubate for 2 days at 37°C.

Renilla luciferase activity was quantified per protocol using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and LUMIstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH). YFV electroporation assay. STAT1 -/fibroblast cell lines expressing LY6E or vector control were pelleted, washed twice with ice cold 1X PBS, counted, and diluted to 1.5 × 10 7 cells/mL in ice cold 1X PBS. Cells (6 × 10 6 ) were electroporated (BTX-Harvard Apparatus ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator) with 5 pulses of 860 V, at 99 us, 1.1 s intervals with 7.5 μg YFV-17D or YFV-17D-Venus RNA.

Bafilomycin A1 at a final concentration of 5 nM was also added as a control when indicated. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for M1 (1:25 HB64, a kind gift from Andrew Pekosz, Johns Hopkins University) with an AlexaFluor488 secondary. The percentage of M1positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry. IAV NP/nucleus co-localization by ImageStream. Stable STAT1 -/fibroblasts were plated at 7.2 x 10 5 cells per well on six-well plates that had been previously coated overnight with poly-lysine (10 mg/mL). Plates were equilibrated to 4°C on ice for 5 min prior to addition of 25 MOI concentrated IAV in 0.3% BSA/0.1% FBS/PBS++. Cells were incubated on ice with virus for 40 min. After the incubation, virus was aspirated and complete media (10% FBS/0.1 mM NEAA/RPMI) was added back and cells were shifted to 37°C. Bafilomycin A1 was added to a final concentration of 5 nM at indicated time points. After 2 h at 37°C, cells were trypsinized and stained for NP-AlexaFluor488 as described above. The day of analysis, nuclei were stained with DRAQ5 (Life Technologies) at 20 µM final concentration. A minimum of 1 x 10 4 in focus cells were collected per sample using Amnis ImageStreamX (Millipore). Analysis of this data was carried out using IDEAS Software (Millpore). To calculate nuclear localization of NP, the mask function was first used to define nuclei based on DRAQ5 staining. We applied the similarity feature, which is the log transformed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, to measure the degree to which DRAQ5 staining and NP-AF488 signal are linearly correlated pixel by pixel within the masked nuclear region. The resulting similarity value is the NP/nuclear localization score. Transferrin uptake assay. LY6E KO and WT U2OS were plated on a six-well plate at 2 x 10 5 per well.

Cells were harvested on ice and percentage of dextran-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Molecular phylogenetic analysis. LY6/uPAR ortholog sequences were selected based on similarity to LY6E, presence of a predicted GPI anchor, and possession of a single three-finger protein motif. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model 64 . The tree with the highest log likelihood (−3984.60) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 11 amino acid sequences. There were a total of 212 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 65 . Determining amino acid sequence identity and similarity.
