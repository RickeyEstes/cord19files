Two parallel literature reviews were conducted to explore 1) theoretical and research trends of PHLP in developed countries, as well as in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and 2) the application of PHLP during the recent Ebola crisis. The reviews were conducted from September to December 2014 and encompassed peerreviewed articles published in English as well as reports, theses, and position papers. The study search encompassed eight electronic databases: Cochrane, LexisNexis, Proquest, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Social Science Research Network, and Web of Science; the Google Scholar search engine was also employed.
