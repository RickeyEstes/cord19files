We collected data from external WHO sources (8-10; WHO, unpub. data) and a 2013 retrospective questionnaire that gathered information about capacity indicators from countries that began the program during 2004-2009. Analysis of the questionnaire indicators enabled systematic analysis of information unavailable from WHO sources, including partners' perspectives of the program. All countries that transitioned from capacity-building to the 5-year sustainability cooperative agreement and returned the completed questionnaire were included in our analysis.
