Viral discovery and sequencing of the UK isolate. MmelPyV1 was first discovered in a cell culture supernatant, derived from the apical lobe of a badger lung in Cornwall, England, in 1996 (Banks et al., 2002 . The culture was established using the mink cell line NBL-7 (ATC CCL 64) by Banks et al. (2002) . The clarified supernatant of this cell culture had been stored at 280 uC since 1997 (the '1997 supernatant'). The 1997 supernatant was enriched using a sucrose cushion according to published methods (Wang et al., 2006) and DNA was subsequently extracted. Randomly primed amplification (REPLI-g UltraFast reagents; Qiagen) was used to amplify all sample DNA. This method provides robust amplification of all DNA in preparation for deep sequencing, but also works particularly well at amplifying small circular templates such as the polyomavirus through rolling circle replication (reviewed by Johne et al., 2009) . This material was sheared using a Covaris sonicator, and standard Illumina paired-end libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. The short read sequence data (1610 7 , 149 nt reads) were filtered to remove lowquality reads using QUASR (Watson et al., 2013) and reads mapping to mink repetitive sequences. De novo assembly with Velvet version 1.2.7 and VelvetOptimizer-2.2.0 was used to assemble larger sequence contigs (Zerbino, 2010; Zerbino & Birney, 2008) . The resulting contigs were processed using SLIM, an iterative BLAST algorithm (Cotten et al., 2014) to identify viral sequences. The 1997 supernatant from which the MmelPyV UK isolate was discovered was recultured to increase virus stock using mink cell line NBL-7. Following lysis by freeze/thawing to release any remaining cell-associated virus, a new supernatant (henceforth called 'MusHV1') was produced by centrifugation. To establish whether the polyomavirus was of badger or mink cell line origin, cells from the mink cell line NBL-7 were cultured in minimum essential medium (10 % FCS/1 % penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine), and were either infected with MusHV1 or mock infected. Infection was allowed to proceed until extensive cytopathic effect of the MusHV1-infected sample. Cells and supernatant were harvested, centrifuged (1200 r.p.m., 5 min) and the cell pellet was resuspended. DNA was extracted using a Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue kit, with lysates being passed through a QiaShredder column to reduce viscosity prior to loading onto the DNA binding columns. DNA was amplified using Invitrogen Accuprime Taq and primers listed in Table S4 . The following reaction conditions were used: 94 uC for 5 min; 35 cycles of denaturation (94 uC, 30 s), annealing (58 uC, 30 s) and elongation (68 uC, 5 min); final elongation at 68 uC for 10 min. DNA products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. DNA was extracted from blood samples using QIAamp kits (Qiagen). Tissue samples were extracted according to published methods (Courcoul et al., 2014; HÃ©nault et al., 2006) . Diagnostic PCRs targeting VP1 and the NCCR were performed in eight sample types from 11 different badgers (Tables S1 and S2). A template of 250 ng Identification of a novel badger polyomavirus organ or whole-blood DNA, or 5 ml DNA extracted from faeces, was added to the PCR master mix (AmpliTaq Gold reagents; Applied Biosystems) (primers listed in Table S4 ). PCRs were completed under the following conditions: 95 uC for 12 min; 45 cycles of denaturation (95 uC, 30 s), annealing (60 uC, 30 s) and elongation (72 uC, 2 min); final elongation at 72 uC for 10 min. All PCR products of expected sizes were purified and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on a 377 Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Bases were called using Sequencing Analysis version 5.4 (Applied Biosystems) software and the resulting files analysed using Geneious version 7.1.4 (Geneious). One of the DNA samples positive for both the NCCR and VP1 (salivary gland of badger 6) was chosen for genome amplification. Long-distance nested PCR was performed using the TaKaRa-EX PCR system (TaKaRa Bio) and the primers listed in Table S4 . The amplicons were sequenced and analysed as above, producing a fulllength genome. To validate the genome, independent overlapping PCRs were completed and the new amplicons resequenced (Table S4 ). EMBOSS was used to search for tandem repeats and palindromes in the NCCR (Rice et al., 2000) . Settings were: palindromes, minimum length 10 and 20 (one and three mismatches, respectively); tandem repeats, maximum repeat size 600, threshold score 12. Phylogenetic analyses. To construct an alignment of polyomaviruses, 63 whole-genome polyomavirus sequences were obtained from GenBank (accessed August 2014), including reference sequences from all known mammalian polyomavirus species and putative novel mammalian polyomavirus species. Avian polyomaviruses were too divergent to be aligned at the whole-genome level and were excluded. The two MmelPyV1 isolates were nearly identical, varying at 35 sites (0.67 % of the genome), so only the UK isolate was included in the phylogenetic study. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Muscle version 3.8.31 with default parameters (Edgar, 2004) , which generated a comparatively poor-quality alignment that required manual editing using Se-Al (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/). Regions where the alignment was highly uncertain (including non-coding regions) were removed, resulting in a 'genome-wide' alignment of 3534 bp that covered~70 % of the MmelPyV1 polyomavirus genome length (regions retained are shown in Fig. 2 ). Two further alignments were derived from the genome-wide alignment: (i) an 'early-gene' alignment (2034 nt) and (ii) a 'late-gene' alignment (1500 nt). Third codon positions were found to be significantly saturated using the test of Xia et al. (2003) as implemented in DAMBE (Xia & Lemey, 2009; Xia & Xie, 2001; Xia et al., 2003) and were removed. MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) was used to test nucleotide substitution models. For both early and late regions, the best-fit model was a general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution, with gamma (C)-distributed among-site rate heterogeneity and a category of invariant sites (GTR+C+I). Phylogenetic trees were estimated using maximum-likelihood as implemented in Garli-2.01 (Zwickl, 2006) from the genome-wide, early-gene and late-gene alignments outlined above. Ten heuristic searches for the maximum-likelihood tree were repeated for each alignment and the tree with highest likelihood retained. One thousand maximum-likelihood bootstrap replicates were performed and the support for each node annotated onto the maximum-likelihood tree using the SumTrees functionality of DendroPy version 3.12.0 (Sukumaran & Holder, 2010) . MrBayes version 3.2.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003) was used to generate a posterior sample of trees from the genome-wide alignment, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo of 3610 6 steps. The first 25 % of trees were discarded as 'burn-in'. Trait values that represented the taxonomic group of the host species of each viral sequence were assigned to the phylogenetic tree tips (Table S3 ). The program BaTS was used (with 200 randomizations of assigned trait values performed to define a null distribution) to statistically test whether viruses found in taxonomically related hosts clustered in the virus phylogeny (Parker et al., 2008) . To assess the presence of phylogenetic signal for recombination amongst polyomaviruses, the genome-wide alignment was divided into 12 overlapping subgenomic partitions. Starting from position 1, each partition was 600 nt long with a neighbouring partition overlap of 200 nt. Phylogenetic trees were estimated from each partition using the maximum-likelihood approach detailed above (except that two heuristic searches and 200 bootstrap replicates were performed for each partition). Visual inspection of these trees revealed phylogenetic inconsistencies between genome regions. Subsequently, one species was chosen randomly from every monophyletic clade that was present in all 12 partition phylogenies. Sixteen clades that were well supported in the whole-genome phylogeny were identified (15 clades supported by bootstrap support values of 100 % and one clade by 91 %). Ten species that did not belong to any clade were also included in the analysis, resulting in a reduced alignment of 26 polyomavirus species. These 26 taxa were analysed using Recco (Maydt & Lengauer, 2006) to seek evidence of recombination. Recco attempts to find the minimum cost of reconstructing each sequence in an alignment from a combination of recombination and mutation of the other sequences, where recombination and mutation have a cost penalty (Maydt & Lengauer, 2006) . Probable recombination breakpoints were generated based on the minimum-cost solutions. To further investigate potential recombinants, putative recombination breakpoints were used to define new genomic partitions and maximum-likelihood phylogenies were again estimated from each partition. To determine the divergence of the MmelPyV1 isolate genomes (UK and French), we created a whole-genome alignment containing only the two isolates plus the closest related viral species (CSLPyV1) as an outgroup. All three genome positions and almost all regions except the NCCR could be retained (4812 sites). Pairwise genetic distances were calculated using MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) . The date of divergence of the UK and French MmelPyV1 isolates was estimated using previous estimates of polyomavirus substitution rates (Firth et al., 2010) .
