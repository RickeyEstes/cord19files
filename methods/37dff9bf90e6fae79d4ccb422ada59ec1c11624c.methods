Two phases were included in CCHH study. Phase I, is acrosssectional questionnaire survey of children 1e8 years old during 2010e2012. The questionnaire included the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) [37] core health questions and additional questions regarding housing, life habits and outdoor environment. The related diseases or symptoms of children covered asthma, pneumonia, rhinitis, eczema, common cold and so on. For the dampness related exposure, the Dampness in Buildings and Health (DBH) study [38] in Sweden was for the reference. The questions were discussed and repeatedly improved by the research group and the uniform questionnaire was used in China [36] . The questionnaire could also be seen in supplemental materials Table S1 . Similarly, the analysis method was uniform in CCHH group all over the country. After Phase I, the main risk factors and the sequence of risk factors were obtained. Then the Phase II was a case-control study with measurements of pollutants in sampled air, dust and urine (2013e2014). The objectives of the CCHH research project are to investigate and compare indoor environmental aspects of sick and healthy children's homes; to study associations between children's health and indoor environmental factors [36, 39] . During this phase, the parameters of indoor environment, such as the concentration of dust mite, fungi, temperature and relative humidity (refer to dampness exposures), were recorded or tested. However, the methodology adopted in this part was totally different from that in Phase I. Moreover, the associations between indoor environmental parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity, and the pollutants, like the dust mite, fungi and VOCs and so on, would be evaluated further, as well as the interaction effects between them on children's health. This paper focused on the results from Phase I-Across sectional survey. The field tests in Phase II were not included. Shanghai, located in the Yangtze River estuary, had a population of more than 23 million in 2011 [40] and 24 million in 2015, including 1.07 million preschool children (<6 years old) [41] . Shanghai is a subtropical humid monsoon climate, four distinct seasons, full sunshine and abundant rainfall. The average temperature is around 16 C. In Shanghai, a total of 17,898 parents or guardians of children from 72 kindergartens were surveyed in one time for each child by on-site (in urban districts) or by post (in suburban districts). The samples of preschool children were reported by their parents during April 2011eApril 2012. The survey reported from Yangpu district in Downtown were taken as the preresearch results and were excluded. Details of the recruitment and survey process have been previously described. The distribution of these kindergartens is displayed as Fig. 1 [42] . The CCHH study was approved by the ethical committee of the School of Public Health, Fudan University in Shanghai, China.
