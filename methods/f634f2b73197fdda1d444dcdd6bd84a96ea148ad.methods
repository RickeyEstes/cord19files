Virus genotypes and plant inoculations. The infectious clone pMTEV contains a full copy of the genome of a WT TEV strain isolated from tobacco ( Fig. 1A ; GenBank accession DQ986288) 69 . Six TEV mutant genotypes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis starting from template plasmid pMTEV as described in ref. 70 (mutants AS13, CLA2 and CLA11) and ref. 32 (mutants PC48, PC55 and PC95). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the seven genotypes used in the study.

RNA extraction from 100 mg of fresh tissue per plant was performed using Agilent Plant RNA Isolation Mini Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of total plant RNA extract was adjusted to 50 ng/µL for each sample. Each RNA sample was re-sequenced again at this stage to ensure the constancy of the genotypes as described above. Fitness evaluations. Total RNA was extracted and virus accumulation quantified by RT-qPCR as described above and detailed previously 72 . Virus accumulation (expressed as genomes/ng of total RNA) was quantified 8 dpi for all genotypes with the exception of AS13, that was quantified 15 dpi. These sampling times assure that viral populations were at a quasi-stationary plateau in N. tabacum. These values were then used to compute the fitness of the mutant genotypes relative to that of the WT genotype using the expression W = (R t ⁄R 0 ) 1/t , where R 0 and R t are the ratios of accumulations estimated for the mutant and WT viruses at inoculation and after t days of growth, respectively 32 . Relative fitness data were fitted to a generalized linear model (GLM) with Normal distribution and an identity link function. Virus genotypes and plant replicates were treated as random factors, with the second factor nested within the first one. Three technical replicates of the RT-qPCR were used to evaluate the magnitude of the error term in the model. This statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 23. Microarray hybridizations. Total RNA was isolated as described above and its integrity assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent) before and after hybridization. The RNA samples An additional criterion of at least two-fold change in mean expression, i.e. |log 2 (fold change)| > 1, was imposed to discard genes presenting minimal increases or decreases. Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), up-or down-regulated, provided in Supplementary Dataset S2. Thirdly, ANOVA tests were performed to identify genes that vary across all conditions (with FDR as above, adjusted P < 0.05). To identify the genes shown in Fig. 3A , the test was done over all samples, including the control. By contrast, to identify the genes shown in Fig. 6A , the test was done over all samples corresponding to infections with distinct TEV genotypes. An additional criterion of significant Spearman's correlation between mean fitness and mean expression (P < 0.05) was imposed in this latter case. Lists of genes whose expressions correlate with viral fitness, either positive or negative, provided in Supplementary Dataset S4.

Sequences not returning a significant BLAST hit were removed from the output. A total of 40,430 annotated probes were generated. In 2,673 cases, more than one probe pointed to the same N. tabacum gene (e.g., probes A_95_P217927 and A_95_P046006 were both complementary to gene EB438730), and in those cases the target appeared twice in the output. Each one of the hits could be associated to an alternatively spliced mature mRNA in the SGN database. We then proceeded to generate the list of N. tabacum orthologous genes in the A. In addition, with the lists of genes whose expression correlates with viral fitness, we calculated the pie charts associated to i) biological function and ii) molecular function in the PANTHER webserver 81 . Validation of gene expression through RT-qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of fresh tissue of plants infected with each one of the seven TEV genotypes as described above. The concentration of total plant RNA was adjusted to 50 ng/µL. Nine candidate genes were selected to validate the effect of infection with each TEV genotype on their expression. Specific primers were designed for each gene that amplified the matured version of their corresponding mRNAs. Primers were designed using OLIGO Primer Analysis Software version 7 (www.oligo.net).
