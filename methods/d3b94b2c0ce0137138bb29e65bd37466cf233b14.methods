This literature review has used systematic principles (Cochrane, 2009 , Khan, 2001 to search for mixed methods studies within healthcare research. The first search was conducted in September 2009 in the data bases CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO on papers published in English language between 1999 and 2009. To identify mixed methods studies, the search terms (used as keywords and where possible as MeSH terms) were: ''mixed methods'', ''mixed research methods'', ''mixed research'', ''triangulation'', ''complementary methods'', ''concurrent mixed analysis'' and ''multi-strategy research.'' These terms were searched individually and then combined (with OR). This resulted in 1896 hits in CINAHL, 1177 in Medline and 1943 in PsycINFO. To focus on studies within, or relevant to, a healthcare context the following search terms were used (as keywords or as MeSH terms and combined with OR): ''health care research''; ''health services research''; and ''health''. These limits applied to the initial search (terms combined with AND) resulted in 205 hits in Medline and 100 hits in PsycINFO. Since this combination in CINAHL only limited the search results to 1017; a similar search was conducted but without using the search term triangulation to capture mixed methods papers; resulting in 237 hits. In CINAHL the search result on 1017 papers was further limited by (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) using ''interventions'' as a keyword resulting in 160 papers also selected to be reviewed. Moreover; in Medline the mixed methods data set was limited by the MeSH term ''research'' resulting in 218 hits and in PsycINFO with ''intervention'' as keyword or MeSH term resulting in 178 hits. When duplicates were removed the total numbers of papers identified were 843. The abstracts were then reviewed by each author and those identified as relevant to the review were selected to be retrieved and reviewed in full text. Papers were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: empirical studies; published in peer review journals; healthcare research (for the purpose of this paper defined as any study focussing on participants in receipt, or involved in the delivery, of healthcare or a study conducted within a healthcare setting, e.g. different kinds of care, health economics, decision making, and professionals' role development); and using mixed methods (defined as a study in which both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed (Halcomb et al., 2009b) . To maintain rigour, a random sample (10%) of the full text papers was reviewed jointly by two authors. Any disagreements or uncertainties that arose between the reviewers regarding their inclusion or in determining the type of analytic approach used were resolved through discussion between the authors. In addition to the criteria outlined above, papers were excluded if the qualitative element constituted a few openended questions in a questionnaire, as we would agree with previous authors who have argued such studies do not strictly constitute a mixed methods design (Kroll and Neri, 2009) . Papers were also excluded if they could not be retrieved in full text via the library services at the University of Edinburgh, Glasgow Caledonian University or the Karolinska Institutet, or did not adequately or clearly describe their analytic strategy, for example, failing to report how the qualitative and quantitative data sets were analysed individually and, where relevant, how these were integrated. See Table 1 for reasons for the exclusion of subsequent papers. A second search was conducted within the databases of Medline, PsychInfo and Cinahl to identify studies which have specifically used Erzberger and Kelle's (2003) triangulation metaphor to frame the description and interpretation of their findings. The term 'triangulation metaphor' (as keywords) and author searches on 'Christian Erzberger' and 'Udo Kelle' were conducted. Three papers, published by Christian Erzberger and Udo Kelle, were identified in the PsychInfo databases but none of these were relevant to the purpose of this review. There were no other relevant papers identified in the other two databases. 168 Papers were included in the final review and reviewed to determine the type of mixed analysis approach used, i.e. parallel, concurrent, or sequential mixed analysis. Four of these papers (identified from the first search on mixed methods studies and healthcare research) were also used to exemplify the use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) . Data was extracted from included papers accordingly in relation to these purposes.
