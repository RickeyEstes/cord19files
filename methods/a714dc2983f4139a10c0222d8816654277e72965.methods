This study is a cross-sectional observation in assessment of attitudes among consumers and live-poultry workers toward the CSLPP, conducted from October to November, 2015. Live-poultry workers are sub-grouped into livepoultry traders and poultry farm workers. Stratified threestage random sampling and online/field recruitment were employed in sampling of participants (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The 21 prefectural-level cities in Guangdong were stratified into cities that are located in the Pearl River Delta region and those that are not. A total of 15 cities were randomly selected using the random number method in the first stage. Live-poultry markets and livepoultry farms were randomly selected using the random number method in the second stage. Participants were then randomly selected in the final stage. We designed different questionnaires to survey attitudes toward the CSLPP among consumers and the two sub-groups of live-poultry workers. Interviewers were recruited and trained to comply with uniform survey protocol so that the quality of the survey was ensured. We followed the guidelines of the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) Statement in this paper.
