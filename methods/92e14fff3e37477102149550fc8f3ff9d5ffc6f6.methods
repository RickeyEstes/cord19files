The microarray data used in this study were collected in T. Pan's laboratory, following an experimental protocol previously described in detail (Pavon-Eternod et al. 2010) . In brief, tRNAs packaged in HIV-1 virions and in Gag viral-like particles (GagVLP) were quantified by microarray. GagVLP particles are HIV-1 mutant particles deficient in the frameshift required to translate Gag-Pol. The tRNA content of HEK293T cells was also measured, as cellular tRNAs are the source of tRNAs packaged into HIV-1. Ratios of viral tRNAs compared with cellular tRNA content were profiled to identify tRNAs that are concentrated in HIV-1 viral particles relative to normal host cells. The subtype B HXB2 reference genome for HIV-1 (NC_001802) was downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Coding sequences were extracted, and the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was computed using DAMBE (Xia 2001; Xia and Xie 2001) . RSCU is a normalized index of codon usage bias (Sharp and Li 1987) . It has a value of zero for unused synonymous codons, a value of one for equally used synonymous codons and a maximum of n, where n is the number of synonymous codons in the codon family. Codon families read by only one codon (AUG for Met and UGG for Trp) always have a value of 1 and were therefore excluded from analyses. Stop codons were also excluded from RSCU analyses. Codon adaptation index or codon adaptive index (CAI) (Sharp and Li 1987) was computed by the improved implementation in DAMBE (Xia 2007) , using the codon usage table of highly expressed human genes compiled in the file Ehuman.cut in the EMBOSS package (Rice et al. 2000) . Both Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins are translated from the full-length HIV-1 RNA genome, with Gag-Pol translated with a À1 ribosomal slippage at the slippery sequence UUUUUUA starting at position 1631 in the HXB2 reference genome. The two polyproteins therefore share the N-terminal portion but differ in the C-terminal portion. ''Pol'' in this manuscript refers to the C-terminal portion of Gag-Pol that differs from Gag to avoid data dependence, that is, it starts from position 1637 in the HXB2 reference genome. Based on the tRNA data collected and RSCU values calculated, we defined two indices for viral codon usage and tRNA packaging:  where i indicates sense codons (excluding AUG and UGG codon) in equation (1) and their corresponding tRNA in equation (2). The ratio tRNA i.HIV-1 /tRNA i.GagVLP for the calculation of I tRNA.i is obtained as the ratio of the two relative tRNA abundances, tRNA i.HIV-1 /tRNA i.Cell over tRNA i.GagVLP /tRNA i.Cell , quantified in the microarray experiment (Pavon-Eternod et al. 2010). I codon.i is a measure of the requirement of specific tRNAs by HIV-1 to translate codon i. For example, a large I codon.AUA suggests a strong need for HIV-1 to have AUA-decoding tRNAs. I tRNA measures the degree of enrichment of each tRNA in HIV-1 relative to that in GagVLP whose packaged tRNA is similar to that of the uninfected host cell (Pavon-Eternod et al. 2010). Because HIV-1 genes are expressed in a temporal manner, the codon usage in early (tat, rev, and nef ) and late genes (gag, pol, env, vif, vpu, and vpr) in HIV-1 (Cullen 1991 ) was examined for differential codon adaptation. Because the early genes are short and RSCU is not meaningful with few codons per codon family, we set a threshold to include codon families with at least 14 codons (so as not to exclude the Ile codon family). Excluding rarely used codon families should lead to little loss of information because selection for optimal codon usage would be weak for such codon families in any case (Duret 2000) . The simian immunodeficiency virus genome (SIV, M58410) was downloaded from NCBI as well as reference HIV-1 sequences for subtypes A1 (AB253421), A2 (AF286237), C (U52953), and J (EF614151) from the Los Alamos National Database. The human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1, NC_001436), another retrovirus, was also obtained from NCBI for comparative purposes. For HTLV-1, early genes are rex and tax, and late genes are gag, pol, and van Weringh et al. · doi:10.1093/molbev/msr005 MBE pro (Yoshida 2005) . For SIV, early genes are tat, rev, and nef, and late genes are gag, pol, vif, vpx, and env. When normality or linearity assumptions were violated, we provide output from both parametric and nonparametric methods. All statistical tests are two tailed and were carried out in SAS (SAS Institute Inc. 1989).
