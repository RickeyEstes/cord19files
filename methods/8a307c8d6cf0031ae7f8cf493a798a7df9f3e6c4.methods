The study commenced in December 2010, lasted six months, and included two groups of preschool children aged between two and five years old. The first group consisted of children attending six day-care centers in the low air pollution, rural prefecture of Viotia, whereas the second group consisted of children attending four day-care centers in the densely populated and heavily air-polluted metropolitan city of Athens. All day-care centers were public institutions with about 20 children in each class. Children were eligible to be enrolled in the study, as long as they attended for five days per week and did not suffer from any serious chronic disorder. The authors' institution ethics committee approved the study and nasopharyngeal samples were collected after informed consent was obtained from children's parents. Additionally, parents answered a brief questionnaire for the collection of demographic data. Nasal-pharyngeal swabs were collected four consecutive times in each child, during the school year. Samples were taken at enrolment, and then every six to eight weeks. The sampling periods were 7---21 December 2010, 24 January to 19 February 2011, 15---28 March 2011, and 11 May to 8 June 2011. The frequent absences of children due to the common viral illnesses necessitated long sampling periods and repeated visits in each day-care center, during each period, in order to ensure sampling from all of the participating children. Children were generally well during the sampling, with only some of them having mild nasal congestion, but no other symptoms of common cold. The sample collection was taken from the posterior nasopharyngeal wall, with the use of a special swab tip made from nylon fibers. The inoculation was performed in Universal Transport Medium (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA), a reliable system for transport, maintenance, and long-term freeze storage of viruses. All samples were processed with a RT-PCR DNA/RNA microarray system (CLART Pneumovir; Genomica, Coslada, Madrid, Spain) for the detection of INFL types A, B, and C; PIV types 1, 2, 3 and 4 (subtypes A and B); RSV type A and B; RV; HMPV subtypes A and B; enterovirus (echovirus); ADV; HCoV subtype 229E; RV; HBoV. The method has been previously described elsewhere. 12 Cotinine (the main metabolite of nicotine) was measured in urine samples twice, i.e., at the beginning of the study and two months later, and the mean of these two values was used as an index of second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Urine cotinine (UC) was assessed through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis based on previously reported methods. 13 Samples after collection were allocated into vials and stored at −20 • C until the analysis. For data presentation, continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or as medians with 25th---75th percentile (p25---p75) depending on whether they were normally distributed or not. In statistical analysis, Shapiro---Wilk W test and Fisher exact test, t-test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for normality testing and univariate analysis, respectively. In order to investigate the statistical associations between viruses we used sequential longitudinal logistic regression models. Longitudinal models account for the correlation of samples from the same child and therefore provide more accurate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Each of the five most prevalent viruses (HBoV, RV, RSV, INFL, and ADV) was sequentially used as the dependent variable whereas the rest of the viruses served as independent variables. In all models, we controlled for area of living, and levels of UC.
