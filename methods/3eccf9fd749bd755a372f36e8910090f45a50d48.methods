Nurses registered as members of the Hong Kong Nurses General Union, the Nurses Branch, and the Enrolled Nurses Branch of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association were invited to participate in a self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey on infection control practices relating to influenza prevention that has been conducted every 1-2 years since 2006. 14, 15 The 2009 questionnaire, constructed in Chinese, together with an introductory letter explaining the purpose and nature of the study, was delivered to each individual member's postal address. The content was developed after discussions with nurses in the field, followed by pilot testing before administration. Approval was obtained from the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire was divided into 4 parts. Part A assessed the respondent's vaccination status in terms of seasonal influenza in the preceding year and his or her willingness to receive vaccination against seasonal influenza and H1N1 in the coming season. The reasons for receiving or rejecting vaccination (eg, perceptions regarding protection of themselves, relatives, and patients, mandatory requirement, circumstances of the outbreak) were also assessed. The respondent was asked to select and rank 9 reasons that might have affected the decision for vaccination using a scale of 1 (most important) to 9 (least important). Part B assessed the respondent's exposure to H1N1 in the workplace or family. Part C assessed the respondent's agreement with government policies for preventing H1N1 and the perceived severity of H1N1 compared with H5N1 (avian) or seasonal influenza. The responses were evaluated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (most disagreed) to 6 (most agreed). Part D consisted of questions on demographics and work nature in terms of clinical exposure. Data entry was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Nonparametric tests were used to analyze ordinal data. Dichotomous data were further analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis for odds ratio (OR) calculation, with statistical significance defined as P , .05.
