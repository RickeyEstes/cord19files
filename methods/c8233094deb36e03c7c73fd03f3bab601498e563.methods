The experimental designs reported here include longitudinal (i.e. time course), dose response, and genetic modification of both virus and host strain comparisons. The intent of these designs was to assemble a unified view of the virulence mechanisms and replication strategies resulting from viral regulation of host cellular processes. For the present experiments, either transcriptomic (using gene expression microarrays) or proteomic (using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) methodologies were used to collect the reported data. The materials used, sample preparation protocols, validation procedures, data processing, and hypothesis testing that were performed are described below. Throughout the Methods section, Study IDs are appended to indicate which studies used a given method. A summary of the overall experiment workflow and the experiment factor conditions that were compared is presented in Fig. 1 . The relationship between the experiment workflow and the experimental metadata, analysis metadata, primary assay results, and derived data is also presented. Study designs for all experiments, including relevant repository identifiers, are summarized in Table 1 Table 2 (available online only) and individual protein experiment samples detailed in Table 3 (available online only). Sample tracking from animal subjects to experiment samples is given in Table 4 (available online only).
