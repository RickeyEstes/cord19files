In this paper we seek to improve our understanding of the instantiation of a Global Crisis Networks. Case study research is appropriate when (a) the topic is broad and highly complex, (b) there is limited theory available, and (3) "context" of a topic is very important [26] . We selected the SARS case as it illustrates the complex and dynamic nature of GCNs. It represents a unique type of a GCN because of its global impact, its success to contain the spread of the corona virus, and the use of the Internet to inform the public and to facilitate worldwide cooperation between experts. Moreover, the SARS outbreak caused a 'breakdown' of the existing international and national systems and procedures for responding to epidemic diseases. From a methodological point of view, breakdowns are interesting episodes to investigate as they reveal the current nature of practices, tools and equipment, customs [90] . The instantiation of the GCN to fight the SARS virus should be understood against the background of existing response and alert systems and procedures. The routines of the current systems that broke down provide the contextual backdrop for the SARS outbreak [62] . The SARS case is presented here as an embedded case study, which allows for analyzing different (embedded) units, processes and levels within the larger case [91] . In the paper we focus on the pivotal role of the World Health Organization which coordinated the network, and on two 'extreme cases' China and Canada. In the Canada case we review the preparedness aspects, in the China case we focus on collaboration processes, and in our analysis of the role of the WHO we pay special attention to response and coordination at the network level. The embedded case study design fits the multi-level framework that is developed in this paper as it allows for analyzing both the country and global network level. For our research we collected data from different sourcesscientific research, public documents, case stories, reviews and websites. Our analysis of this collected information followed an iterative process common to qualitative studies [37] . It revealed the multi-level nature of the crisis network that was instantiated during the SARS outbreak. Moreover, we examined the first steps of a major transition from national oriented health systems towards a global alert and response system, accompanied with the need for global information sharing.
