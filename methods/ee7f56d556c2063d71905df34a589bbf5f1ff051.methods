We modify a model that was developed earlier for similar aims in another context. 4 The stochastic model describes an epidemic in its early phase as a branching process. Starting from a small set of initially infected individuals, the model calculates the numbers of latently infected persons, infectious persons, and persons that are diagnosed and isolated in time steps of one day. Latent infection, infectivity during the infectious period, and daily contact rates are quantified using distributions taken from published literature ( Table 1) . We distinguish between household contacts and non-household contacts, which differ in the risk of infection and the delay and effectiveness of tracing and isolation. Intervention effectiveness is determined by the daily probability of being diagnosed during the infectious period, which can differ between cases occurring before the first diagnosis has taken place, and later cases (Table 2) . Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on the delays in tracing household and non-household contacts, respectively, and which proportions of contacts can be found and isolated. We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons cannot transmit any longer. The model is described by a set of difference equations, and allows for explicit computation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the effective reproduction number under interventions Re . The model was coded in Mathematica 11.2.
