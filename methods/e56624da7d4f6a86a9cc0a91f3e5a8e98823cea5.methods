Cells and viruses. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Geese embryo fibroblast (GEF), DF-1 and pcDNA-env_DF1 cells 18 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The ALV-J strain (JS09GY07) was isolated from layer chickens with both hemangioma and myeloid leukosis. And the virus was titrated in DF1 cells to determine the TCID 50 by the Reed and Muench method 32 . Construction and purification of fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc. The gp85 coding region including the signal peptide was amplified by PCR from the isolate JS09GY07. And the IgGFc heavy chain of rabbit was obtained with RT-PCR from the RNA of rabbit blood cells. The SU fragment and the IgGFc heavy chain were ligated with BamHI restriction enzyme site and the fusion fragment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 for sequencing. After that, we cloned SUJ-IgGFc into adenovirus vector for expressing fusion protein in adenovirus expression system according to the manufacture's instruction. As expected, a recombinant adenovirus plasmid pAD-SUJ-rIgGFc containing a 1.8-kilobase (kb) fragment which fused ALV-J SU gene and the Fc region of rabbit IgG was constructed, and was transfected into 293T cell to generate recombinant adenovirus rAd-SUJ-rIgGFc which expressed fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc, and it was purified with protein A agarose for subsequent protein precipitation. Preparation of membrane extracts. pcDNA-env_DF1 cells and DF1 cells in 100 mm dishes were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and homogenised with NP-40 lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol (pH7.4) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Intact cells and nuclei in the resulting extract were sedimented by centrifugation at 4uC for 5 min at 6000 g. The membrane proteins in the supernatant were sedimented by an additional spin at 13200 g for 1 h at 4uC and resuspended in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer. All extracts were stored at 280uC until use. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. The membrane proteins from the pcDNA-env_DF1 cells were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody JE9, which is specific to ALV-J Env and Resin A (Thermo Scientific). The membrane proteins from the DF1 cells were precipitated with the purified protein SUJ-rIgGFc and protein A agarose (Beyotime, China). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with a Silver Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific) and analysed with mass spectrometry. In Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid pcDNA3.1-EnvJ, and chANXA2 for 48 h, and then lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb JE9 at 4uC overnight, and then incubated with protein A agarose for 1 hr. After three washes in lysis buffer, the lysates were analyzed using JE9 and antibody against chANXA2 in western blot. Antibody blocking assay. The DF1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of anti-ANXA2 (C-16, Santa Cruz) for 2 h and then the cells were infected with ALV-J or ALV-A at an MOI of 5. The cells were maintained in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum and different concentrations of antibodies. Normal goat-IgG was used as the isotype control antibody in the blocking assay. The replication of ALV-J in the treated cells was analysed with IFA, real-time PCR, TCID 50 and western blot. siRNA against chANXA2 in DF1 cells. Three siRNA (535, 105 and 299) against chANXA2 were synthesized (Invitrogen). The sequences of these siRNA were listed in Table 1 . DF1 cells were transfected with siRNA (50 pmol) against chANXA2 or control siRNA for 6 hours, and then the cells were infected with ALV-J at a MOI of 1 for 72 h. The siRNA effects on chANXA2 was detected with Real-time PCR, and the replication of ALV-J in DF1 cells transfected with siRNA was analyzed through western blot using mAb JE9. The primers of Real-time PCR for chANXA2 were listed in Table 1 . Infection of chANXA2-transfected cells. 293T or geese embryo fibroblasts (GEF) cells were transfected with chANXA2 for 48 h. Then, the transfected cells were infected with ALV-J at an MOI of 5 (5 TCID 50 /cell based on the titer obtained from DF1 cells) for 2 h followed by three washes with PBS and treatment with acid glycine (pH 3.0) for 1 min. After further three washes with PBS, the 293T and GEF cells were maintained in DMEM with 1% FBS for 48 h. For the 293T cells, the replication of ALV-J was analysed with IFA and real-time PCR at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h postinfection. For the GEF cells, the cells and supernatants were homogenised and inoculated into the DF1 cells, and viral replication in the DF1 cells was analysed with IFA with JE9 at day 7 post-inoculation. Real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from the cell lysates using the Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was reversetranscribed using PrimerScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara) with primers that are specific to the ALV-J gp37 and ANXA2 gene according to the manufacturer's instruction. Chicken 18S and human b-actin were used as an internal control in this assay. The primers of Real-time PCR for ALV-J gp37, ANXA2 and chicken 18S and human bactin were listed in Table 1 . Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blot analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) were performed on the 293T and DF1 cells. The monoclonal antibody JE9, which is specific to the Env of ALV-J, was used as the primary antibody 19 . FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Western blot analyses were performed on cell lysates. JE9 or anti-b-actin or anti-chANXA2 antibody was used as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat was used as the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz).
