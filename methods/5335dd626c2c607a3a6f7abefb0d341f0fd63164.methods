For genomic data, loci annotated as alternative loci were ignored, as well as readthrough genes. A few instances appeared with isoforms labeled as separate genes; these were manually reduced to one longest isoform. Ortholog Search. First, we found orthologs between all species using only the genomic datasets, where syntenic evidence helps confirm orthology rather than paralogy (see below). The first step was all-vs.-all BLAST-ing, filtered for e values no higher than 10 −5 . Reciprocal BLAST hits (for limitations, see ref. 96 ) were considered as tentative ortholog predictions (43) . Tentative predictions were further filtered by including evidence from public ortholog annotation in Biomart and, where available, syntenic evidence (see below). The resulting ortholog prediction graphs for each gene were filtered to remove any connected components with paths connecting two genes from the same species. Next, we added orthologs from the transcriptomes. First, genomic transcripts were translated to amino acid sequence, and blastx-tblastn reciprocal BLAST hits were found between all genomic high-quality orthologous genes and all transcriptome assemblies, again using an e-value cutoff of 10 −5 . We then created HMMER models of each of the genomic orthologous gene sets and searched within the reciprocal BLAST hit contigs for the best HMMER hit for each gene, filtering for those hits with e value below 10 −10 , extracting only the portion of each contig specified in the HMMER hit. We then filtered all transcripts which differed in length from the median genomic sequence length by more than 25%. Syntenic Evidence. Whole-genome alignments were performed following a procedure described on the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Browser wiki, which for our purposes only required aligning, chaining, and netting. Alignment was performed using Lastz (97) , while chaining and netting were performed with kentUtils (45) . Tentative orthologs are considered to have evidence of synteny if they are in syntenic regions, as defined by the top-level nodes of the net. The algorithm used for determining gene-proximity evidence of synteny is a simple extension of the algorithm in Jarvis et al. (44) . Let species A and species B have genes a 1 and b 1 , respectively, which are tentatively orthologs. Then let a 2 be the nearest gene to a 1 on the same chromosome which has a tentative ortholog in species B, b 2 . If the number of genes between a 1 and a 2 and the number of genes between b 1 and b 2 are both less than 5, then we consider the ortholog pair a 1 -b 1 to have syntenic evidence. If there are at least five genes in each direction, but the above is not true, then there is evidence against synteny. In the case of not enough genes to either side, it is undetermined. Multiple Sequence Alignments and Best Genomic Isoforms. Multiple sequence alignments were generated on amino acid sequences with MAFFT L-INS-i, the slower but more accurate version of the popular MAFFT alignment software (98) . Manual inspection revealed that while the HMMER models had quite consistently found the same isoform from all of the transcriptomic datasets, the genomic data were slightly less consistent. This is not surprising, as different species can have different annotated longest isoforms. So, for each gene in each species with genomic data, we went back and found the isoform most similar to the consensus isoform. The algorithm for finding best splice variant for a gene g in a given orthologous set S is as follows. First, find the consensus sequence of S from the MAFFT L-INS-i alignment. The consensus sequence is the identity in each column of the amino acid which is found in a majority of transcripts, or X if no single value is the majority. Next, align all splice variants of gene g against the consensus sequence, again using MAFFT L-INS-i, and score each by the number of nongap, non-X positions in agreement with the consensus. Select the splice variant with the highest score. This resulted in improved selection of 3,444 splice variants. Finally, we realigned for final gene alignments. Corresponding CDS alignments were created using pal2nal (99) .
