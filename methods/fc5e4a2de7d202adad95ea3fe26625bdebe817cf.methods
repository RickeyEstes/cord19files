Purification of recombinant USP14 proteins. We transformed pGEX-2T, pGEX-2T-USP14, and pGEX-2T-USP14(C114A) into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). We purified USP14 and USP14(C114A) and their glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated counterparts [GST-USP14 and GST-USP14(C114A), respectively] using previously described methods 7 , with some modifications. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C, and when the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) was 0.6-0.8, we added IPTG to each culture (final concentration of 1 mM), and allowed cultures to incubate overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor cocktails and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation, lysates were filtered and supernatants incubated with GST sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, GST-USP14 was eluted using 10 mM reduced glutathione (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). The GST tag was removed by incubating protein fractions with thrombin in a cleavage buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 , and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol] for 3 h at room temperature (RT). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with benzamidine sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) to remove any residual thrombin. Purified GST (data not shown), GST-USP14, GST-USP14(C114A), USP14, and USP14(C114A) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) to determine the size and purity of proteins (Fig. 1A) . In vitro selection of RNA aptamers. A random RNA library was generated as previously described 21 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), T7 in vitro transcription, and a DNA template (109 bp) containing 40 random nucleotides. Briefly, the aptamer library template DNA (5′ -GGG TTC ACT GCA GAC TTG ACG AAG CTT -40 N-A ATG GAT CCA CAT CAT CTA CGA ATT C-3′ ) was generated by PCR using a forward primer (5′ -GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3′ ) containing the T7 promoter sequence (underlined) and a reverse primer (5′ -TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′ ) (Fig. 1B) . The RNA aptamer library was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM NTPs) at 37 °C for 4 h. Products were treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C for 30 min, subjected to 12% denaturing urea PAGE using, and purified from gels. A 6-μ g aliquot of each generated RNA pool was incubated with 100 μ L of GST sepharose 4B resin in binding buffer [30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)] for 30 min at RT with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were transferred to porous centrifuge columns (Pierce), and RNA pools that were unbound to sepharose resin were collected by centrifugation. The same procedure was performed using 2 μ g of GST proteins to remove RNAs that were nonspecifically bound to GST or glutathione resin. During each round of selection, GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 6 μ g of pre-cleared RNA pools in 100 μ L of binding buffer for 30 min at RT, and then with 100 μ L of GST sepharose 4B resin for an additional 30 min at RT. The quantity of GST-tagged proteins was gradually decreased (2 μ g, rounds 2-8; 1 μ g, round 9; 0.5 μ g, rounds 10-11; 0.25 μ g, rounds 12-13; and 0.125 μ g, rounds 14-15) to achieve more stringent conditions. The RNA-GST-USP14 complexes were then washed three times with PBS, and eluted with 20 mM glutathione in binding buffer. Eluted RNAs were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reverse-transcribed with AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer), and amplified by PCR. The amplified cDNA was purified using the AccuPrep Gel purification kit (Bioneer) and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase for the next round of selection (Fig. 1C) . (4) USP14-RNA complexes were dissociated with elution buffer containing excess imidazole. (5) RNAs bound to USP14 were prepared by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recovered RNAs were reverse transcribed, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro transcribed. (6) Following 15 rounds of selection, the resultant cDNA was amplified and cloned into pcDNA 3.1. (D) Human proteasomes (PTSM) were purified from β 4-tagged HEK293 cell lines. Some of the proteasomes were treated with 1 μ M ubiquitin-vinylmethylester (Ub-vme) to yield vme-PTSMs. PTSMs (1 μ g) and vme-PTSMs (1 μ g) were separated on 12% gradient gels and stained with CBB. (E) Western blotting analysis of USP14 and proteasome subunit α 3. Approximately 250 ng of PTSMs or vme-PTSMs were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cropped gels/blots are used in (E). Cloning and sequencing. After 15 rounds of selection, the resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified using forward (5′ -GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3′ ) and reverse (5′ -TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′ ) primers. Amplicons were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The secondary structure of selected RNA aptamers was predicted by the Mfold program based on the Zuker algorithm (http:\\mfold. rna.albany.edu). For subsequent activity testing and inhibition assays, individual RNA aptamers were amplified by PCR using forward (5′ -ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG G-3′ ) and reverse (5′ -TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3′ ) primers, and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. We used 40-nt sequences that were irrelevant to USP14 aptamers as controls (UUU GUC UAG CGC GUA GUG GGG AGA UGU UGU GAU ACU GGG G). Measurement of RNA aptamer binding to USP14. We loaded and immobilized 2 pmol of GST-USP14 or GST onto a GST sepharose 4B resin, and then added 20 pmol of RNA aptamers. The RNA eluted from the resin was reverse-transcribed and the resulting cDNA subjected to PCR. Agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by ethidium bromide staining, was carried out to visualize protein-bound RNA in 2% (w/v) agarose gels. For cloning, we used primers USP14-1 mutant (5′ -GCA GTG ATG TGC TTC TAA AAA ACA ACC TAA AAA AAT TGC C-3′ ), USP14-2 mutant, (5′ -CTG AAA AAA AGT TAG TTT CGC TGG TTT AAA ATC GGT GCG G-3′ ), and USP14-3 mutant (5′ -AAA AAA AAG GCT CGT TTG GCC TGC CGA AAA AAG GCC GGG A-3′ ). The USP14 aptamer mutants were generated by insertion of corresponding oligonucleotides into the pcDNA 3.1 vector, amplified by PCR using the same forward and reverse primers, and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase as described above.
