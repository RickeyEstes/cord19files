We have enrolled lung transplant recipients into the UCLA lung transplant outcomes registry and biorepository study since 2001. Lung recipients at UCLA undergo surveillance bronchoscopy at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant and when clinically indicated. We collected and banked any leftover BAL fluid from all surveillance and "for cause" bronchoscopies. The BAL procedure was performed according to a standardized protocol using three 60-ml aliquots of isotonic saline instilled into a sub-segmental bronchus of either the right middle lobe or left lingula. Retrieved BAL fluid was pooled and then split into a 15-ml clinical specimen and a research specimen with the remaining volume. The research samples were immediately placed on ice for transport to the lab and were processed within 6 hours of collection. BAL fluid was filtered through sterile gauze, and cells were separated from fluid by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). TBBX specimens were graded for ACR by experienced thoracic pathologists according to the standard International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria. 2, 9, 10 Briefly, peri-vascular (A-grade) infiltrates were scored 0−4. However, before 2008, our pathologists only graded peri-airway infiltrates (LB or B-grade) as absent (B0) or present (B1). In 2008, our center adopted the revised nomenclature for B-grade rejection (B0, B1R, and B2R). Because the specimens used in this study span this change in nomenclature, we could only consider LB as present or absent. Biopsy results were based upon chart review of clinical read only. Slides were not re-reviewed. Agrade ACR episodes were also categorized as either spirometrically significant (SSAR) or non-SSAR based on a ≥10% decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) from the baseline, defined as the highest of the 2 preceding FEV 1 measurements, as described by Davis et al. 11 A-grade ACR episodes without a paired FEV 1 measurement between 0 and 14 days before the biopsy could not be classified as SSAR or non-SSAR. CLAD was defined as a sustained drop in FEV 1 by at least 20% from the average of the 2 best post-transplant measurements, consistent with published criteria. 12 For each potential CLAD case, we reviewed available clinical data to exclude alternative causes of FEV 1 decline other than CLAD. We searched our biorepository for BAL CP samples, collected before a diagnosis of CLAD or from patients who never developed CLAD, who were paired with a TBBX graded for both A-and B-grade rejection scores. Out of 1,548 pre-CLAD samples in our repository, 660 did not have a paired TBBX and were excluded. An additional 178 samples were excluded because the paired biopsy was not gradable for A-grade (AX) (n = 12) or not gradable for B-grade (BX) (n = 166) rejection. We identified a total of 710 eligible BAL samples from 310 patients. Samples were then categorized into the following groups: (1) healthy (n = 286) without Agrade ACR, LB, or infection; (2) A-grade ACR (n = 114) defined as A-grade of A1 or greater, with or without concurrent LB, and without infection; (3) LB (n = 100) defined as the presence of small airway inflammation without concurrent A-grade ACR or infection; and (4) infection (n = 210) defined as a positive culture for a potential pathogen. Blinded to CLAD and mortality outcomes, we then selected 65 samples each from the healthy, A-grade ACR, and LB categories and 45 additional samples from the infection group for RNA isolation. In addition, samples were selected to achieve relative balance across the following post-transplant time-frame windows: 1 month (16−60 days post-transplant), 3 months (61 −135 days post-transplant), 6 months (136−270 days post-transplant), and 1 year or later (>271 days post-transplant). No more than 1 sample per patient was included. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol/chloroform extraction, resuspended in RNase-free water, and purified using the miR-Neasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). RNA samples were then bio-analyzed with the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and samples were excluded if RNA quantity was too low (<100 ng) or if the RNA integrity number indicated severe degradation (<3.0). This excluded 21 samples (6 healthy, 4 infection, 7 LB, and 4 A-grade ACR) for insufficient quantity (n = 16) or for degraded RNA (n = 5). RNA sequencing (RNASeq) libraries were prepared with Clontech SMARTer Stranded Total RNASeq (Pico) Kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). The key steps include first-strand synthesis, template switching, adapter ligation, cleavage of ribosomal complementary DNA, and polymerase chain reaction amplification. The library qualities were evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer and then sequenced using Illumina Hiseq3000 (SR 1 £ 50 run) (Illumina, San Diego, CA). After demultiplexing with Illumina Bcl2fastq2 v 2.17 and initial data quality check with Illumina SAV, the raw reads were mapped to the latest UCSC transcript set using Bowtie2 version 2.1.0, and the gene expression level was estimated using RSEM v1.2.15.
