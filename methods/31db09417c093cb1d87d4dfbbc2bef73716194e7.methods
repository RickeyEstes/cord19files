Eighteen patients referred from outside hospitals to Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital for ECMO treatment utilized our interhospital ECMO transport system from December 2011 to September 2015. We retrospectively analyzed the indications for ECMO, patient status prior to and during transport, and patient outcomes after transport based on the patients' medical records. The institutional review board of Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital approved this study (IRB no. 05-2016-130) and waived the need for informed consent. 1) Transport extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines (1) Selection and preparation of transport candidates and equipment used for transport: Target pa-tients were selected from those patients referred from other hospitals based on the determination of a need for ECMO treatment for acute respiratory failure and heart failure. Transport was implemented only after 2 or more intensive care specialists and thoracic surgeons verified the indications for ECMO and ruled out any contraindications to ECMO (Table 1) . We devised a short-distance transport program for patients in Busan and South Gyeongsang province. Helicopter transport, which was not feasible at night and required takeoff and landing areas, was deemed impractical. Ambulance transport is the primary transportation mode for the emergency medical system in South Korea. The transport range was determined as the area where interhospital transport was feasible within 4 hours, the duration of capacity for the electrical power supply of available ambulances and the loading capacity of O 2 tanks. Since our hospital neither owned nor operated an ambulance, we designed our transport system to utilize the 119 existing EMS or private ambulance services (Fig. 1) . The transport team consisted of specialists capable of solving mechanical problems pertinent to ECMO, as well as treating episodes of cardiac arrest that can occur during emergency transport. The team included 2 thoracic surgeons, 2 clinical perfusionists with nursing experience, and 1 ambulance driver. The equipment system used during transport consisted of the ECMO machine and circuit, cannulas in a variety of sizes, a bag-valve mask (Ambu Mark IV-Reusable Resuscitator; Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve, an O 2 line, a portable vital sign monitoring system (IntelliVue MMS X2; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands), an infusion pump, and a portable blood gas analyzer (I-stat; Abbott, Lake Bluff, IL, USA), all transported in a single-use bag. The stock equipment of the ambulance was used for any other requirements during transport. (2) Types and methods of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation insertion: Veno-venous (VV) ECMO was typically performed for the transport of patients with respiratory failure, and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO was performed for the transport of patients with heart failure. For patients with respiratory failure and hypotension, VA ECMO or veno-veno-arterial ECMO was performed. In VV ECMO, the right femoral vein was used for venous drainage and the right internal jugular vein was used for venous return. In VA ECMO, the right femoral vein and left femoral artery were utilized. Cannulation was performed using the Seldinger technique under ultrasonic guidance. The most commonly used cannulas were the FEM-FLEX2 femoral cannula (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and the DLP femoral cannula (Medtronic, Fridley, MN, USA). The EBS Emergency Bypass System ECMO machine (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used in 7 patients and the Quadrox PLS ECMO machine (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) was used in the other 11 patients. The cannulas were tightly fixed to the patient's body to prevent decannulation during transport. Once ECMO was initiated, ECMO flow and O 2 flow were adjusted to determine the ECMO support flow required for transport. Ventilator settings were gradually lowered over 1 hour to maintain a partial pressure of O2 (PaO2) ＞70 mm Hg, partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2 ) ＜50 mm Hg, and a saturation of peripheral O 2 (SpO 2 ) ＞95% at a fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) of 0.4, PEEP of 5 mm Hg, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Once a stable ECMO flow was established, transport was deemed feasible. (3) Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport: After transport was deemed feasible, the patient's status was confirmed by verifying the vital signs and the results of a blood gas analysis after ECMO support at 100% O 2 and 10 L/min application of an Ambu-bag (Ambu Mark IV-Reusable Resuscitator, Ambu A/S) for 15 minutes. At that point, the charge status of the ECMO machine was checked and the gas flow line was connected to a portable O2 tank. The patient's arterial blood pressure, SpO 2 , and heart rate were monitored with a portable vital sign monitor, and the patient was transported from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the ambulance on the ambulance bed. Upon arriving in the ambulance, the ECMO machine was connected to the power inside the vehicle and the O 2 line was connected to the ambulance O 2 tank flow line. The patient's status was observed constantly by monitoring vital signs and by visually verifying the blood color in the inflow and outflow lines. If the SpO 2 dropped below 90%, the O 2 tank level in the ambulance was verified and the endotracheal tube status was checked. The SpO 2 was maintained above 90% by adjusting the ECMO and O2 inhalation flow. When the SpO2 of patients was lower than 90%, the PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , and pH were checked by arterial blood gas analysis using the I-stat (Abbott). When the ambulance arrived at the hospital, the patient was transported to the ICU in the same manner as during the departure, and mechanical ventilation was begun immediately. In addition, the patient continued to be monitored for hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Any necessary X-ray examinations or laboratory tests were conducted and all problems were addressed accordingly.
