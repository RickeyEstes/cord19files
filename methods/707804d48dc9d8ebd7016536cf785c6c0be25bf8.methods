This study utilizes case-study analysis to examine four heterosexual HIV-positive people's reconstruction of their identities in a socio-cultural context where a deep sense of shame follows an HIV diagnosis. Case study is an appropriate method as it draws on the ability of the qualitative researcher, i.e. the first author, a frontline medical social worker who has specialized in HIV care for 20 years, to extract depth and meaning in context (Padgett, 2017) . In addition, case-study analysis examines the data closely both at a surface and at a deep level to explain the phenomena (Zainal, 2007) ; that is, the construction of liveable identities adopted by people with HIV. Such holistic analysis of cases on construction methods adopted by an individual participant can give access not only to how the methods are used but also to how they relate to other reconstruction strategies.
