A PubMed search was performed on 9/7/2016 with the term "infection" in combination with each sport: rafting, whitewater, surfing, (surfer* or windsurf*), (caves or caving or spelunking), (triathlon or trekking) or (hiking or adventure race), bicycling, backpacking, (mountain climb* or bouldering), horseback riding, orienteering, trekking, and skiing. Medline and Scopus were then searched using the same terms. If additional articles were found during review of other articles these were also included. Search methodology is displayed in Fig. 1 . Those that were associated with infection were: whitewater sports, surfing/windsurfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, spelunking, mountain climbing, adventure/ endurance racing, cycling, mountain biking, horseback riding, orienteering and trekking. Results were screened for papers that dealt with infections temporally related to the specific activity. Articles dealing with traumatic injuries and subsequent infections were excluded as were articles not in English or translated to English.
