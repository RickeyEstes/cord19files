Wasps were stored in 100% ethanol at 4°C until genomic DNA could be extracted. Specimens were identiWed by JBW to genus, and to species where possible, using morphological characters and often also host data. Taxa from which sequences were obtained are listed in Table 1 . Because we had few sequences from Apanteles canarsiae we pooled sequences for A. canarsiae with A. galleriae and the resulting "chimera" is labelled Apanteles sp. in the phylogenies. Whole wasps were macerated using mini-mortar and pestles and the DNA extracted using Qiagen DNeasy tissue extraction kits. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out with an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermocycler. PCR consisted of 2.5 L of Hotmaster buVer (Eppendorf), 1.2 L of dNTPs (8 mM), 2.5 L of each primer (2.5 M), 0.125 L Hotmaster Taq (5 units/ L, Eppendorf), 0.8 L of DNA and 15.375 L water. PCRs consisted of an initial denaturing step of 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 20 s at the temperatures listed in Table 2 , 65°C for 40 to 60 s depending on the size of the target region, and a Wnal step of 65°C for 5 min Primer sequences are listed in Table 2 . A negative control was incorporated in each ampliWcation round using water rather than DNA. PCR products were puriWed using Qiagen QIAquick kits. Sequencing was carried out on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer.
