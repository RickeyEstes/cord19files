Data were derived from patients included in two independent, multicentre, observational cohorts that enrolled consecutive patients from 2004 to 2005 and from 2008 to 2010 in a network of intensive care units (see online supplementary appendix), under the Spanish Initiative for Epidemiology, Stratification and Therapies of ARDS (SIESTA) Program, as described previously. 9 11 Study participants Patients meeting criteria for ARDS using the AECC definition 7 were considered for enrolment in the parent studies. 9 11 Since all patients were on PEEP≥5 at study entry, they also met the recent Berlin criteria for moderate and severe ARDS. 10 Although patient care was not strictly protocolised, physicians were asked to follow current standards for critical care management. For ventilatory management, it was recommended that patients be ventilated with a tidal volume (VT) of 5-8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW), at a ventilatory rate to maintain PaCO 2 at 35-50 mm Hg, a plateau pressure <30 cm H 2 O, and PEEP and FiO 2 combinations to maintain PaO 2 >60 mm Hg or SpO 2 >90%. During the enrolment period, none of the patients were included in any other clinical trial or managed with prone ventilation, high frequency ventilation or extracorporeal life support. For the present study, onset of ARDS was defined as the day and time in which the patient first met ARDS criteria. Demographics, arterial blood gases, radiographic, haemodynamic and ventilator data were collected at study entry, at 24 h, at days 3, 7, 14 and last day of MV. ALI severity score 12 and ventilator-free days (VFDs), were calculated and recorded. Total number of extrapulmonary organ failures included in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale 13 was documented daily. Patients were followed-up until hospital death or discharge. Approximately 24 h after meeting moderate/ severe ARDS criteria, oxygenation was assessed under the following standardised ventilator settings (SVS): VT=7 mL/kg PBW, PEEP=10 cm H 2 O and FiO 2 =0.5. When patients required PEEP>10 or FiO 2 >0.5 and could not tolerate a decrease in PEEP or FiO 2 for maintaining the oxygenation target, a set of rules for setting PEEP and FiO 2 were applied only during the SVS assessment (table 1) . At other times, the PEEP and FiO 2 levels were up to the discretion of the managing clinician. Blood gases were obtained 30 min after the setting adjustment. Based on the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at study entry, patients were categorised as moderate or severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. Based on PaO 2 /FiO 2 values at 24 h, patients were reclassified into four groups: severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤100 mm Hg), moderate ARDS (100<PaO 2 / FiO 2 ≤200), mild ARDS (200<PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤300) and non-ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300).
