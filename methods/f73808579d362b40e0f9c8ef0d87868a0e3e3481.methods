The RNA secondary structure folds itself by forming hydrogen bonds between G-C, A-U, and G-U. Therefore, the prediction of all hydrogen connections among the primary structure of the sequence become the first in predicting RNA secondary structure. Many components can be identified in the secondary structure, such as stem, hairpin loop, multi-branched loop or multi-loops, bulge loop, internal loop, and pseudoknot, as shown in Fig. 1 .
