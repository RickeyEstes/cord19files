Cell lines and cell culture. HeLa, U2OS, THP-1, HEK293, HEK293 Flp-In T-REx-GFP-Artd8-macro2-3 and HeLa Flp-In T-REx-ARTD10 and -ARTD10-G888W cells 55 were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) or in RPMI with 10% FCS (THP-1) at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cells were transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO-Artd8-macro2-3 or a plasmid containing the respective binding dead mutant (Artd8-macro2-G1055E-macro3-G1268E) and pOG44 (Invitrogen) and selected using 5 μ g/mL Blasticidin S (Invivogen) and 200 μ g/mL Hygromycin B (Invivogen). Reagents and antibodies. The following reagents were used: β -NAD + (Sigma), 32 Reporter gene assay. To measure ARTD10 promoter activity U2OS cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with the pGL3basic-ARTD10 promoter reporter gene construct. To normalize transfection efficiency a β -galactosidase expressing plasmid was co-transfected. 24 h after transfection cells were stimulated with IFNα for 16 h and subsequently harvested using extraction buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.8; 0.4 mM EDTA; 2% glycerol; 0.2% Triton X-100; 10 mM DTT). Luciferase activities were normalized to β -galactosidase activities. Quantitative real-time PCR and Immunoblot analysis. HeLa or U2OS cells were stimulated with IFNα (180 U/mL). THP-1 cells were differentiated with PMA (200 ng/mL) for 24 h before stimulation with LPS (100 ng/ml). Total RNA was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μ g of RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). ARTD8 and ARTD10 expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using QuantiTect Primer Assays (QIAGEN). In each experiment, mRNA expression of the gene of interest was normalized to GUS (QuantiTect Primer Assays, QIAGEN). For protein analysis cells were treated as above and harvested in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40; 1% DOC; 0.1% SDS; PIC). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 25 min at 4 °C. Lysates were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cloning and mutagenesis. The cDNA encoding a 1048 bp long fragment of the human ARTD10 promoter (− 532 to + 491, relative to the start of transcription) was generated from HeLa DNA using sequence specific primers harboring restriction sites for HindIII and NcoI. The fragment was cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene into the pGL3basic reporter gene construct. GST-fusion proteins of ARTD10cat have been described previously 2 . The cDNAs encoding for the catalytic domains of ARTD7 (N459 -A656) and ARTD8 (K1600-K1800) as well as ARTD8-macro1-3 were generated from plasmids obtained from H. Schüler (Stockholm) and cloned into pGEX-4T1 or pEGFP-C1 using the gateway cloning strategy. Bacterial expression constructs for His 6 -tagged fusion proteins of the viral macrodomains of CHIKV, FIPV, VEEV, HEV-XDA4 and HEV-XDD12 were obtained from B. Coutard (Marseille). Plasmids encoding the viral macrodomains of SINV and ONNV were generated by LIC and cloned into pNIC-Bsa4. Clones expressing viral macrodomains, CHIKV-nsP3 and mutants thereof were generated by gateway cloning. Mutants were generated using standard mutagenesis procedures and confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3-HA-ARTD1 was a kind gift from M. Hottiger (Zürich). Purification of His-and GST-tagged fusion proteins. His 6 -and GST-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL-21 except for HEV-XDA4 and HEV-XDD12 macrodomains, which were expressed in E. coli XL-10. Purification of the recombinant proteins was achieved using affinity chromatography on either glutathione-sepharose for GST-fusion proteins or TALON metal affinity resin for His 6 -fusion proteins according to standard protocols. Hydrolase assay with immunoprecipitated ARTD1. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-ARTD1. The cells were harvested in TAP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1% NP-40; 1 mM DTT; PIC) and the lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 25 min. HA-ARTD1 was immunoprecipitated with 10 μ l of anti-HA (3F10 or Covance) antibodies and protein G beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Thereafter the beads were washed in TAP lysis buffer and in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0; 0.2 mM TCEP; 4 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.2% NP-40). ADP-ribosylation was carried out in 30 μ l reaction buffer supplemented with 50-500 μ M β -NAD + , depending on the age of the 32 P-NAD + , and 5 pmol annealed double stranded oligomers (5′ -CACCGTGTCAGGACCACTAGCCTCT-3′ ) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by washing in reaction buffer. Then 1 μ g of the respective purified His 6 -tagged vMD was added and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For endogenous ARTD1 PARylation HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-ARTD1. Prior to harvesting cells were treated with 1 mM H 2 O 2 for 7 min to promote PARylation. For control cells were incubated with 10 μ M Olaparib for 2 h.
