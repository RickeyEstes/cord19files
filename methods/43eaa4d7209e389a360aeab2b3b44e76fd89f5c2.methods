CHSE-214 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1681), whereas RTS11 was developed by the middle author [16] (University of Waterloo, Canada). The routine growth of these cell lines has been described previously [17, 18] . Briefly, CHSE-214 cultures were maintained at 17°C in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 15 mM HEPES and 5% FBS (Gibco). RTS11 cultures were maintained at 20°C in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS. The cultures were free of mycoplasma, as determined by qualitative PCR. Piscirickettsia salmonis type strain LF89 ATCC VR 1361 was grown in the cell line CHSE-214 as described previously [19] . Bacteria obtained from the culture supernatant of 15 days post-infection CHSE-214 cells were used to inoculate CHSE-214 and RTS11 cultures in 25 cm 2 plastic tissue culture flasks (Orange) at a concentration of 4.0 × 10 5 cells/ml. Prior to inoculation, 1 ml aliquots from infected CHSE-214 culture were centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × g at 4°C to remove debris. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and centrifuged for 30 min at maximal speed at 4°C to concentrate the bacteria. After the supernatants had been discarded, bacteria pellets were resuspended in the medium appropriate for each cell line. The titre of P. salmonis used in inoculums was 1 × 10 6.8 ml -1 . This titre was determined on CHSE-214 cells and calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [20] . For expression studies, cells were harvested at 2, 5 and 9 days postinfection. Experiments with IPNV were performed using the Chilean strain VR299. The virus was propagated by inoculating CHSE-214 cell monolayers at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to 1 PFU/cell in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and antibiotics. Infected cultures were incubated at 17°C and monitored until CPE was evident and the clarified supernatants were divided into aliquots that were stored at -20°C. Aliquots were titrated in a plaque formation assay as described previously [21] . For expression studies, both CHSE-214 and RTS11 cultures were inoculated at a MOI of 1×, and cells were harvested at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h post-infection. All experiments were carried out using three biological replicates, i.e. three independent tissue culture bottles for each time point and assayed independently. Controls were done alike. Times for harvesting P. salmonis-and IPNV-infected cultures were chosen as CPE advanced, but making sure that no significant cell death and lysis were taking place. Total RNA extraction from cell cultures was carried out using Trizol® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer instructions. A NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer was employed to analyze RNA concentration and purity. All samples were DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase, Promega) to remove any contaminating DNA. For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using oligo(dT) primer and the AffinityScript™ QPCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene). CHSE-214 and RTS11 cultures were monitored for infection by phase contrast microscopy (Olympus IMT-2 microscope). P. salmonis PCR confirmation was carried out by using the primer pair RTS1/RTS4 against the ITS region of the bacterial 16S rRNA operon as described previously [22] . IPNV infections were confirmed by using 1 step RT-PCR procedure (Brilliant QRT-PCR Master Mix Kit 1-Step, Stratagene) with primer set VP2SNP-F/VP2SNP-R (Santi, unpublished) against to the VP2 fragment sequence. Reverse transcription was performed by incubating at 50°C for 55 min followed by PCR amplification (95°C for 10 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C and 30 s at 72°C, and 72°C for 10 min). Mycoplasma contamination was absent as tested by amplifying with the primer set MyF1/MyR1 (PCR Mycoplasma Detection Set -TaKaRa Biomedicals Takara Shuzo). Five reference genes (ACTB, UBQ, EF1A, GAPDH and TUBA), belonging to different functional classes, were selected to reduce the chance of their co-regulation ( Table 1 ). All primers were designed on conserved regions so that they could amplify each gene in both species under study: O. mykiss and O. tschawitcha. Primers were evaluated with the OligoCalc application [23] to check annealing temperatures and self-complementarity. The specificity of the primers was tested using BLAST analysis against the nr NCBI database. Primer specifications are summarised on Additional file 1. The desired amplicon length (182 -204 base pairs) was chosen to be similar among all genes to avoid significant differences in PCR efficiencies due to amplicon length. PCR products were cloned into TOPO vector (pCR 2.1, Invitrogen) and submitted to sequencing for verification. Partial O. tschawitcha sequences were deposited into GenBank accession numbers: FJ890356 (EF1A), FJ890357 (ACTB), FJ890359 (UBQ) and FJ890358 (TUBA). qRT-PCR was carried out using a MJ Research realtime cycler. Each reaction for amplification of housekeeping candidates contained: 10 μl of the Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), 100 nM of forward and reverse primers and 2 μl of 10-fold diluted cDNA, to a final volume of 20 μl. PCR was achieved with 10 min activation and denaturation step at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at the specific annealing temperature (see Additional file 1), 30 s at 72°C and 2 s at 74°C for fluorescence measurement. Following the final cycle, melting curve analysis were performed to examine the specificity in each reaction tube (absence of primer dimers and other non-specific products) by heating the samples from 60 to 90°C in 0.2°C increments with a dwell time at each temperature of 5 s while continuously monitoring the fluorescence. PCR efficiencies were calculated for each tissue culture cell line using a relative standard curve derived from a pooled cDNA mixture (a ten-fold dilution series with five measuring points). The pooled cDNA was obtained from control and infected samples from both CHSE-214 and RTS11 cell cultures, respectively, using the same RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis protocols as described above. The real-time PCR efficiencies were calculated from the slope according to the established equation E = 10 (-1/slope) [4] . Real-time PCR were assayed on every biological replicate and each sample was run in duplicate. Each PCR reaction included reverse transcriptase negative controls for testing genomic DNA contamination and a non template negative control to check for primer dimer. To minimize experimental variation, each gene was quantified on the same batch of cDNA and the same gene was tested on the different samples in the same PCR run. The threshold cycle (Ct) values of the Opticon Monitor 2 software version 2.03 were transformed to relative quantities for analysis with the geNorm 3.5 software as described by Vandesompele et al. [3] . For the conversion of the Ct values to relative quantities [24] , reaction efficiencies were used. Relative gene expression for GAPDH, TUBA and EF1A were calculated using the geometric mean of the three most stable genes of each assay as normalization factors and the 2d (in P. salmonis assays) and the 6 h (in IPNV assays) controls as calibrators, respectively. A Mann-Whitney test was used to determine significant differences in gene expression between groups and the calibrator samples. Significance was set at P < 0.05. These last statistical analyses were done using the SPSS 13.0 statistic package.
