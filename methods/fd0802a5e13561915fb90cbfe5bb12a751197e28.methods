Molecular target prediction for TCDD. The three dimensional structure file for TCDD was downloaded from the Pubchem database (PubChem CID: 15625), a database resource to analyze the bioactivity of small molecules 53, 54 . Target receptors for TCDD was predicted using PharmMapper 29 , a web based server for identifying the potential targets of a given molecule, and SwissTargetPrediction 30 , a knowledge-based approach to predict new targets of an uncharacterized molecule or secondary targets for a known molecule, computationally. PharmMapper identifies the potential targets for a given molecule using reverse pharmacophore mapping approach where target proteins with highest fit scores between corresponding pharmacophore models and query compounds are predicted as potential targets 33 . SwissTargetPrediction predicts the targets for bioactive molecules based on combination of 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands. The predictions can be carried out in five different organisms including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos Taurus and Equus caballus 30 . Homology modeling, structure refinement and validation. Three-dimensional structure for mVEGFR1 is not available. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1), was downloaded from the Uniprot database 55 (UniProtKB entry: P35969) and subjected to homology modeling. Amino acid residues from 797-1158 were used for model generation. To model the mVEGFR1 structure, the crystal structure of the human VEGFR1 in complex with N-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-((pyridin-4-ylmethyl)amino)benzamide (PDB ID: 3 HNG) was chosen as a template structure which shared a sequence identity of 92% (the sequence identity was calculated by the NCBI blastp-suite (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) 56 with the target sequence. To generate homology models for mVEGFR1, MODELLER 9.14 57 program was used. The quality of the generated mVEGFR1 homology models were assessed using RAM-PAGE sever 58 for stereo chemical geometry and ProSA web server 59 for energy assessment. RMSD between the model and the template was calculated using the CLICK web server (http://mspc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/minhn/click.html) 60 . The amino acid environment of modelled structure was evaluated using ERRAT program plots 26 , which assess the distribution of different types of atoms with respect to one another in the protein model and determines the false statistics of bad non-bonded interactions. The validated model was subjected to energy minimization using NOMADRef server 61 with conjugate gradient method and chosen for further study. For human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1), crystal structure of placental growth factor in complex with domain 2 of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(PDB ID: 1RV6) 31 downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB) 22 was used for further study.
