Following Imai et al.'s (2020), we assumed number of cases (n) exported from Iran follows a Binomial distribution (Bin) with size N and probability p. Here, N represents total number of cases infected in Iran, and p is the probability that one case .

We approximated p by the ratio of daily outbound passengers of Iran (D) over total size of population (M) that those airports serve and multiplying the mean duration (t) from exposure to detection. Thus, p = Dt / M. We set t at 10 days according to (Imai et al., 2020) . We assumed that the catchment population is the total population of Iran. We calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran (Î») by fitting model to the number of confirmed cases with Binomial-distributed likelihood framework. As shown in Eqn (1), represents the total log-likelihood and k is the total number of countries we selected. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated by using the profile likelihood estimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile. To explore more alternative scenarios, we also considered a smaller catchment population (60,000,000) and a shorter detection window (8 days). We considered a baseline scenario with 100% attendance rate for each aircraft as well as other alternative scenarios. In addition, we tested the situation that 90% and 70% attendance rate for each aircraft, keeping other situation as baseline scenario.
