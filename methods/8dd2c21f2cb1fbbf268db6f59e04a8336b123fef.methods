An independent GLP-compliant facility, Microchem Laboratory (Round Rock, Texas), performed efficacy tests in accordance with test methods established by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), as outlined in Table 1 . Another independent GLPcompliant facility, Toxikon Corporation (Bedford, Massachusetts), performed skin irritation studies in accordance with test methods established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The same batches of commercially produced chlorine disinfectants were tested with or without the addition of the Highlight ® color additive to directly compare efficacy and skin safety results. Detailed test methods used in these studies are detailed in Appendix 1. Efficacy test against S. aureus using AOAC method 961.02 This study was conducted using a previously described protocol, AOAC 961.02. [12] [13] [14] Three lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite were tested against S. aureus (ATCC 6538) at the contact time of 10 minutes, based on the label claims of a common household bleach. 15 First, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite was prepared by diluting regular bleach (Clorox, Oakland, California) in sterile AOAC hard water. This study was repeated using 3 lots of the color additive mixed into the same lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution immediately before testing. Next, 60 carriers inoculated with dried S. aureus were sprayed with the test substance and left undisturbed for a contact time of 10 minutes ± 5 seconds. After neutralization, the carriers were transferred into tubes and assessed for growth.
