Our basic approach is to start with an empirical contact network and fit edge-triangle type and ERGM type network models from which we simulate a number of networks. We then simulate SIR epidemics on both the empirical network and simulated networks. We compare simulated networks with the empirical network, and SIR results from using the simulated networks and the empirical network. A schematic representation of the study method is shown in Fig 1.
