A gene is a stretch of DNA that codes for a single polypeptide chain [43] . A gene sequence is a succession of four symbols {A, C, G, T}. Because the similarity between the genes of two species indicates their evolutionary relationship, it is used in many clustering algorithms. The goal of sequence clustering is to partition biological sequences into meaningful/functional groups according to the similarity information, which is calculated using either an alignment-based method or an alignment-free method. The traditional approach for clustering DNA sequences requires all-by-all comparisons from alignment [44] [45] [46] . Given two sequences: S 1 = AGCACACA and S 2 = ACACAGTA, S 1 P and S 2 P are used to represent the p th characters in S 1 and S 2 , respectively. The alignment score [45] for (S 1 , S 2 ) is given by where E is the cost of an alignment operation: deletion, substitution, or insertion. However this distance measure relies on sequence alignment. Since sequence alignment suffers in computational aspect with regard to large biological databases, clustering methods relying on sequence alignment have difficulties in dealing with the large gene data. An alignment-free similarity measure helps avoid the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment for similarity computation. In this paper we propose a new alignment-free similarity measure, DMk, based on which we developed mBKM to cluster gene sequences. In the follows, we will present DMk first, and then describe mBKM algorithms.
