The European Network for Infectious Diseases (EUNID) comprises 30 national representatives and experts from 16 European member states and is funded by the European commission, within its Public Health and Risk Assessment Programme. 24 It was created to exchange information, share best practices, develop training, and improve the connection between national and regional Review infectious disease experts. This network of clinicians, public health epidemiologists, microbiologists, infectioncontrol and critical-care clinicians, who are experienced in the management of HID, represent national or regional infectious diseases units designated to care for patients with HID. One of EUNID's agreed tasks was to develop a consensus statement on the design and operation of high-level isolation units (HLIU) in Europe. 25 An HID is transmissible from person to person, causes life-threatening illness, presents a serious hazard in health-care settings and the community, and therefore requires specifi c control measures. 25 An HLIU is defi ned as a health-care facility that is specifi cally designed to provide safe, secure, high-quality and appropriate care, with optimum infection containment, infection prevention, and control procedures for a single patient or a small number of patients who have, or who may have, an HID. These units have also been described as biocontainment units by US experts. 26 We defi ne an isolation room as a single-bed room with negative pressure. Our task was to develop a consensus statement for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in HID patients admitted to an HLIU. To assess this task, an expert (PB) was co-opted and charged by EUNID to do an extensive review and draft recommendations on infection control in the situations mentioned above. The draft recommendations were amended by the coordination team, and further refi ned jointly by the 27 partners from 15 European member states and the coordination team. The fi nal consensus was reached and validated during two consecutive meetings in Rome in May and October, 2007. The draft manuscript was then shared within the network by e-mail and revised to incorporate comments and additional evidence provided by participants until a fi nal version was reached.
