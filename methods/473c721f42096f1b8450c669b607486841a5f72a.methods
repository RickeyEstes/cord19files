A prospective contact pattern survey of HCWs was conducted from three public sector tertiary care hospitals in Singapore: Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), National University Hospital (NUH), and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH). This was then compared with data similarly collected from working adults recruited from the community (henceforth referred to as community-based working adults). In both surveys, a significant contact was defined as an interaction between two persons, either physical (involving skin-to-skin contact such as handshake, hug, kiss or contact sports) or non-physical (involving a two-way conversation with three or more words in the physical presence of another person, but no skin-to-skin contact). The surveys of HCWs and community-based working adults were approved by the ethics review boards of the National Healthcare Group and National University of Singapore respectively.
