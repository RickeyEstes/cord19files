Concerning the objective, the study has entailed a qualitative research approach to examine the aftermath of the Syrian crisis on the population in the form of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. erefore, the review approach has been considered appropriate, concerning the nature of the study for in-depth analysis. 6.5 million Syrians have been displaced due to the ongoing three-year civil war [1] , which left thousands of people killed or wounded by violence. It has developed a vacuum in the common infrastructures that may influence the regions throughout the years to come in future. erefore, it is essential to review the war and its impact on the health of Syrian refugees after the conflict in Syria, causes of morbidities, and the emerging infectious diseases prevailing in Jordan and other countries. e review included the information about viruses, bacteria, and parasites as provided in the reports from the WHO and Ministry of Health, Jordan. It mainly targeted the studies based on the outcomes of infectious disease in Jordan that also included the occurrence of infections in the state. e influx of Syrian refugees was also studied and correlated as it has presumed to be the main cause behind the prevailing rates of infectious diseases in Jordan. e study has explored peer-reviewed articles and reports generated by the World Health Organization in the context of infectious diseases, obtained from the web libraries of PubMed (January 2012 to November 2016), ScienceDirect (January 2014 to November 2016), and Elsevier (January 2013 to November 2016). irty-six peer-reviewed articles were searched on the basis of selected search terminologies. Different keywords have been utilized to search the most relevant articles. On the basis of abstract reading, some of the articles have been eliminated. Precisely, twenty-eight articles did not prove to be relevant to the specific systematic review study. Subsequently, eight of the total articles were chosen to be examined and evaluated. e inclusion of the research content was entirely based on the quantitative and qualitative literature as well as the cross-sectional studies, related to the assigned keywords. e process of study selection included the processing of literature by initially reviewing the abstracts of the studies. Furthermore, the studies that presented with the significant information were selected for the analysis.
