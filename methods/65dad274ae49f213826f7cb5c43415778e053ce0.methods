All the methods were carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. All of the experimental protocols were approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources (UCAR). Animals. Male C57BL/6J (C57) and BMAL1 knockout (KO: B6.129-Arntl tm1Bra /J) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6J and BMAL1 KO mice were housed under a 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycle with lights on at 6 a.m. and fed with a regular diet and water ad libitum unless otherwise indicated. For chronic (6 months) CS exposure, mice were kept in a standard 12:12 L:D cycle with lights on from 6 am-6 pm throughout the experiment. Data from animals exposed to air/CS for 6 months from a previous study were included here for comparison 30 . Tobacco/cigarette smoke exposure and influenza A virus infection. Eight week-old mice were used for tobacco/CS exposure as previously described 30, 74, 75 . We used chronic (6 mo. exposure which causes pulmonary emphysema) CS exposure mouse models to determine the effect and mechanism of chronic CS exposure followed by influenza virus infection on circadian clock function and lung inflammation. Mice were exposed to CS using an environmental side-stream delivering Teague TE-10 smoking machine (Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA) for 6 months CS exposure in the Inhalation Facility at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The smoke was generated from 3R4F research cigarettes containing 11.0 mg of total particulate matter (TPM), 9.4 mg of tar and 0.73 mg of nicotine per cigarette (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The total particulate matter (TPM) in per cubic meter of air in exposure chamber was monitored in real-time with a MicroDust Pro-aerosol monitor (Casella CEL, Bedford, UK), and verified daily by gravimetric sampling 30, 74, 75 . Control mice were exposed to filtered air in an identical chamber according to the same protocol described for CS exposure. For chronic 6 months CS exposures, 3R4F cigarettes were used to generate a mixture of sidestream smoke (89%) and mainstream smoke (11%) at a concentration of ,100 mg/m 3 TPM, so as to avoid the possible toxicity to mice at a high concentration of long-term CS exposure 30, 74 according to the Federal Trade Commission protocol (1 puff/min of 2 second duration and 35 ml volume). Each smoldering cigarette was puffed for 2 seconds, once every minute for a total of 5 puffs, at a flow rate of 1.05 L/min, to provide a standard puff of 35 cm 3 . Mice received 5-hour exposures per day, 5 days/week for the duration of exposure and were sacrificed at 6-hour intervals 24h after the last CS exposure. After 6 months chronic Air/CS exposure, mice were intranasally infected under anesthesia (Avertin; 2,2,2-tribromoethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) with 120 hemagglutination units (HAU) of influenza A virus (IAV), strain HKx31 (x31; H3N2) in 25 ml sterile PBS as previously described 32, 76 . Mock-infected control group mice received 25 ml of sterile PBS alone. After infection, survival and body weight of all the experimental groups were monitored and recorded daily until post-infection day 9. Mice were euthanized post-infection day 9 at 6 hour intervals for 24 hours (5 time points: ZT0, ZT6, ZT12, ZT18 and ZT24). The 6-hr sampling interval was based on prior studies on circadian gene expression in mice 30, 37 . Schematic for chronic CS exposure combined with IAV infection and IAV infection in BMAL1 KO and wildtype littermates including parameters measured from these experiments are included in the Supporting information (see Supplementary Fig. 1a-b) . Locomotor activity recording. Mice were individually housed and allowed free access to food and water. Locomotor activity was measured using the Photobeam Activity System (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA), a computerized system that measures the frequency of photobeam breaks along the side of the cage. Total cage activity (photobeam break) activity was recorded in 1-min intervals and analyzed using ClockLab software (Actimetrics, Evanston IL) as previously described 30 . Circadian periodicity of locomotor activity in L:D was calculated during days 1-8 post IAV infection with a x 2 periodogram analysis (tau range 20-28 h). Real-Time Luminescence recording. Adult male Period2::luciferase knock-in (PER2::LUC) mice 77 were euthanized three hours before lights-off (Zeitgeber Time 9-12, lights off5ZT12) by excess CO 2 exposure. Portions of the lung were removed and collected in cold sterile Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS). Small 5 mm 3 fragments of lung tissue were isolated. Lung tissues were placed in 35mm culture dishes with 1.2 ml of culture medium [DMEM supplemented with B27 (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, 352.5 mg/ml NaHCO3, 3.5 mg/ml D-glucose, 25 U/ml penicillin, 25 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.1 mM luciferin (Promega)]. Cultures were prepared with clean media as described above (control) or the same media containing cigarette smoke extract (CSE 0.1%), media containing 300 HAU influenza A virus ( and sealed with sterile vacuum grease and a glass coverslip. Sealed cultures were maintained at 35 uC in a light-tight incubator and luminescence was continuously recorded (counts/ sec) with an automated luminometer (LumiCycle, Actimetrics). Raw luminescence data were detrended (24 h moving average) and smoothed (2 h moving average; Origin Pro 8.5, OriginLabs, Northampton, MA) as previously described 30 . Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Mice were anesthetized at 24 h after the last exposure or on day 9 post-infection by an intraperitoneal injection with 100 mg/kg (BW) of pentobarbital sodium (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and sacrificed by exsanguination. The heart and lungs were removed en bloc, and the lungs were lavaged three times with 0.6 ml of saline (0.9% sodium chloride) via a cannula inserted into the trachea as described previously 75, 78 . The lavaged fluid was centrifuged, and the cell-free supernatants were frozen at 280uC for later analysis. The BAL inflammatory cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml saline and the total cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Cytospin slides (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) were prepared using 50,000 cells per slide, and differential cell counts (,500 cells/slide) were performed on cytospin-prepared slides stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Newark, DE). Proinflammatory mediators analysis. The levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as CCL2/monocyte chemotatic protein 1 (MCP-1), CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and TGF-b1 in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using respective duo-antibody kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were expressed in the samples as pg/ml. www.nature.com/scientificreports Histological analysis, Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, immunohistochemistry and trichrome staining. Fixed tissues were H&E stained for inflammation scoring and mean linear intercept analysis. Histological analysis of H&E stained slides were used to determine bronchial inflammation using a semiquantitative method. Briefly, the intensity of bronchial inflammation was scored on a scale of 1 to 9. 0, for no inflammation; 1-3 for scant cells but not forming a defined layer; 4-6, for one to three layers of cells surrounding the vessels; 7-9, for four or greater layers of cells surrounding the vessel or bronchial area. For each treatment multiple lung lobes from n54-5 slide/group were scored and average values were presented as bronchial inflammation scores. Similarly airway mucus was identified by the Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and PAS positive cells were quantified by a semiquantitative method with slight modification as previously described 61 . In brief, airways were examined under light microscopy and assigned a score between 0 and 3 based on the following criteria: 0, for no staining; 1, for PAS staining ,25% of airway perimeter; 2, for PAS staining 25 to ,50% of airway perimeter; and 3, for PAS staining .50% of airway perimeter. Mucus scores were obtained by scoring 3-4 different areas per slide from n54-5 slide/group. The average from all the areas scored per each treatment group was used to calculate the percentage of PAS positive cells. Immunostaining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue. Paraffin sections (4 mm thick) were deparaffinized and then rehydrated through series of xylene and graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating in citrate buffer (10 mM Citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). Primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4uC with rabbit anti-CCSP polyclonal antibody (Seven Hills Bioreagents, Cincinnati, OH) and mouse anti a-smooth muscle actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibodies 32, 74, 76, 79 . Appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (FITC-or Texas red-conjugated 2u antibodies) were used to detect the immune complexes before tissues sections were counterstained with 4',d-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi). Gomori's trichrome staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). The nuclei stains black, cytoplasm and muscle fibers in red and the collagen deposition stains blue. Both double immunostaining and trichrome stained tissue sections were visualized with Nikon Eclipse Ni-U fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) and images were captured with a SPOT-RT3 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Quantification of fibrosis was done using the Ashcroft scoring system 80 . Lung morphometry. Mouse lungs (which had not been lavaged) were inflated by 1% low-melting point agarose at a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O, and then fixed with 4% neutral buffered formalin 74, 75 . Fixed lung tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned (4 mm) using a rotary microtome (MICROM International GmbH). Lung sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by passing through a series of xylene and graded ethanol, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Alveolar size was estimated from the mean linear intercept (Lm) of the airspace, which is a measure of airspace enlargement/emphysema using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) as previously described 30, 74, 75 . Lm was calculated for each sample based on 10 random fields per slide observed at a magnification of 3200. The airway and vascular structures were eliminated from the analysis. Measurements of lung mechanical properties. Lung mechanical properties in mouse lung were determined using Scireq Flexivent apparatus (Montreal, Canada) as described previously 30, 74, 75 . Briefly, lung compliance (C), lung resistance (R), and tissue elastance (E) were measured in mice, anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg BW, intraperitoneally). A tracheotomy was performed, and an 18-gauge cannula was inserted 3 mm into an anterior nick in the exposed trachea and connected to a computer controlled rodent ventilator (FlexiVent; SCIREQ). Initially, the mice were ventilated with room air (150 breaths/min) at a volume of 10 ml/kg body mass. After 3 min of ventilation, measurement of lung mechanical properties was initiated by a computer-generated program to measure quasi-static compliance, lung resistance, and tissue elastance at 3 cm H 2 O positive end expiratory pressure obtained by fitting a model to each impedance spectrum. The calibration procedure removed the impedance of the equipment and tracheal tube within this system 81 . These measurements were repeated three times for each animal using Scireq FlexiVent apparatus (Montreal, Canada) as described previously 30, 74, 75, 79 . RNA isolation and quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated from non-lavaged lung tissue specimens (stored in RNAlater, Ambion, Austin, TX) using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA yields were determined by UV absorbance using a Nanodrop instrument (ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, NanoDrop Technologies). cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 mg of total RNA using the RT 2 First Strand Kit (SABioscience, Frederick, MD). To validate the expression of diverse genes in lung tissue by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Bio-Rad CXF-96 real-time system) using the SYBR Green qPCR Master mix from SABioscience. In chronic Air/CS exposed mice infected with or without influenza A virus, this includes qPCR data from circadian genes at ZT0-ZT24 time point (n53-4 mice/group) in all datasets. All the specific primers were purchased from SABioscience. Expression of genes was normalized to RPL13 (60S ribosomal protein L13 gene) levels. The samples from chronic air-and CS-exposed mice represented in this study were obtained from our previous study that was conducted in parallel with the chronic air and CS combined with influenza A virus infection 30 . In chronic air exposure group, qPCR data gathered from circadian gene expression at the ZT24 time point (n52/air group) in all qPCR datasets. Relative RNA abundance was quantified by the comparative 2 -DDCt methods. Significant rhythms of gene expression were verified using CircWave software (Version 1.4). In addition, the center of gravity (COG) or peak phase was determined for each rhythm using CircWave as previously described 30, 82 . Statistical analysis. The period of PER2::LUC expression in each tissue explant was determined using a chi-squared periodogram analysis (LumiCycle Analysis Software, Actimetrics). A minimum of 5 days of data were used to calculate the period of PER2::LUC expression in each explant of lung tissue. Period data from lung tissue were analyzed with two-factor ANOVA. Data are representative of mean 6 SEM. For statistical analysis of qPCR data, CircWave software (Version 1.4) was employed. In addition to multiple non-linear regression analyses to determine if the data conform to a significant rhythm, CircWave also calculates the peak of gene expression or Center of Gravity (COG). The software determines a peak of gene expression even if the qPCR data do not conform to a significant circadian rhythm (P , 0.05). In addition to CircWave analysis, statistical significance between air-exposed, Air1Virus and CS1Virus groups was calculated by Fisher's multiple comparisons using two-way ANOVA. To emphasize the waveform of the data, percentage of daily activity (light and dark phase) was subjected to nonlinear regression analysis with a 6 th order polynomial using GraphPad (Prism 6). Statistical analysis of significance was calculated using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test for multi-group comparisons using StatView software. Mortality was evaluated by comparison of survival curves and analyzed for significance by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using GraphPad (Prism 6). P , 0.05 was considered as significant.
