A total of 979 viral and 212 phage genome records were downloaded from GenBank release 141.0 [20] . Each record corresponds to a genome or a genomic segment. The corresponding RefSeq annotations for these genomes were downloaded before July 20, 2004 [21] . For all of the viral and phage genomes, the predicted results of the Gen-eMark VIOLIN database [22] were also downloaded before July 20, 2004. The present gene-finding method consists of the four steps: (1) Extracting the seed ORF for the analyzed genome In the present algorithm, only one seed ORF is required for a viral genome. This seed ORF is selected using a simple approach. It is found that an ORF with the largest length among all others in a genome is very likely to be a protein-coding gene. This ORF is called the 'Maximum ORF' in this paper. After carefully investigating over 100 viral genomes that have annotated genes, the deduction that the 'Maximum ORF' is a gene is valid accurately. For the two very small viral genomes, cereal yellow dwarf virus -RPV satellite RNA (NC_003533) and arabis mosaic virus small satellite RNA (NC_001546), there are no genes at al, indicating that the seed ORF so obtained is meaningless for these two genomes. If the 'Maximum ORF' is larger than 400 bp, it is directly regarded as a seed ORF (gene). However, if the 'Maximum ORF' is less than 400 bp, it is regarded as a seed ORF only if the base composition at the second codon position meets the following equation: G 2 < (A 2 + C 2 + T 2 )/3 + 0.1, where A 2 , C 2 , G 2 and T 2 are the occurrence frequencies of bases at the second position of an ORF. This equation approximately reflects the fact that bases at the second codon position lack guanine to some degree [23] . If a seed ORF is found, then it will be used as a training sample to calculate the related parameters. Otherwise, if there is no seed ORF found, it means that the analyzed viral genome contains no functional genes. (2) Training the parameter used to describe the coding potential The methodology adopted here is based on the Z curve [12] , which is another representation of DNA sequence. Here the algorithm is presented briefly as follows. The frequencies of bases A, C, G and T occurring in an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence with bases at positions 1, 4, 7, ...; 2, 5, 8, ..., and 3, 6, 9, ..., are denoted by a 1 , c 1 , g 1 , t 1 , a 2 , c 2 , g 2 , t 2 , a 3 , c 3 , g 3 , t 3 respectively. They are actually the frequencies of bases at the 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd codon positions. Based on the Z curve (12), a i , c i , g i , t i are mapped onto a point P i in a 3-dimensinal space V i , i = 1, 2, 3. The coordinates of P i , denoted by x i , y i , z i , are determined by the Ztransform of DNA sequence [12] . The Z-transform of DNA sequence transforms the four frequencies of DNA bases into the coordinates of a point in a 3-dimensional space. In addition to the frequencies of codon-position-dependent single nucleotides, we need to consider the frequencies of phase-specific dinucleotides. Let the frequencies of the 16 dinucleotides AA, AC, ..., and TT occurring at the codon positions1-2 and 2-3 of an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence be denoted by p 12 (AA), p 12 (AC), ...,p 12 (TT); p 12 (AA), p 12 (AC), ... and p 12 (TT) respectively. Using the Z-transform [12] , we find where , and are the coordinates, X = A, C, G, T (5) for the seed ORF, which corresponds to a point O in the 33dimensional space. These 33 parameters will be used to differentiate coding/non-coding ORFs.
