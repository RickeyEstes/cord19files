In this randomized, open-label study conducted from March until August 2011, we compared the effects of Symbicort ® (at the strength of 160/4.5 mcg per inhalation) and nebulized salbutamol as the initial reliever in acute exacerbation of mild to moderate bronchial asthma in the Emergency Department, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM). We defined mild and moderate asthmatic attack according to the guidelines outlined in the Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA) report on a global strategy for asthma management and prevention. Adult patients aged 18 years old and above who came to the Emergency Department of HUSM with mild to moderate asthmatic attacks were included in the study. We excluded patients referred from district hospitals or other health facilities (who may have been given reliever treatment prior to arrival), pregnancy, patients who are already started on any LABA medications as well as patients with persistent poor inhalational techniques despite being taught the proper technique in the Emergency Department. This study was approved by the hospital's ethics and research committee. Patients who consented to participate in this study were randomized to receive either two puffs of Symbicort ® or nebulized salbutamol. Patients randomized to receive Symbicort ® were given proper instruction on the inhalational technique using the dummy turbuhaler devices supplied by AstraZeneca (Malaysia). Initial objective parameters obtained include the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The patients were then reassessed after 15 min. Objective and subjective variables related to the study were then recorded. Subjective parameters related to patients' perception of symptomatic relief were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the 5-point Likert scale of breathlessness. VAS is a widely used measurement scale for many symptoms including pain and breathlessness at a specific point in time. We recorded two readings (pre-and postintervention) on a 10-cm scale with the spectrum of completely asymptomatic on one end and the most severe asthmatic symptoms ever experienced on the other end. In this study, we adopted the finding from a previous study where a change of 2.2 cm is defined as the minimal clinically significant improvement of asthma management in the emergency departments [12] . For the 5-point Likert scale, during reassessment of the patient 15 min after giving the allocated treatment, the patients were asked to describe their symptom relief on a 5-point scale of 1, much worse; 2, a little worse; 3, no change; 4, a little better; 5, much better Subsequent management after the initial treatment and the decision for patient disposition were decided according to the discretion of the treating doctor based on the clinical improvement of the patient concerned. Patients who need admission are admitted accordingly, and patients with the nebulized salbutamol deemed fit for discharge are discharged with inhaled budesonide (Pulmicort ® 100 mcg per inhalation, AstraZeneca) at a dose of two inhalations twice daily besides inhaled salbutamol on an as-needed basis for 30 days. Patients in the Symbicort ® arm are discharged with two inhalations of Symbicort ® as maintenance besides additional doses on an as-needed basis for up to eight doses for 30 days. All patients are given an appointment to attend a follow-up visit after 30 days to assess symptom progression. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS ® ) Statistics software version 19.0.0. For categorical analysis, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used. For numerical analysis, dependent and independent Student's t-tests were used for parametric data, and Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Mann-Whitney test were used for nonparametric dependent and independent data, respectively. The block randomization process used in this study was generated using software available from the web [13] .
