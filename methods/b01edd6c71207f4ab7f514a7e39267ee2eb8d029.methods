Three provinces in the western part of Java Island in Indonesia participated in the study: Jakarta, Banten, and West Java (Figure) . Eighteen districts in these provinces were selected on the basis of their proximity to the laboratory, high levels of avian infl uenza activity in farmed birds (Ministry of Agriculture, unpub. data), and high number of LBMs available for study (n = 300). The required sample size was 73 markets based on an estimated disease prevalence of 50% and a maximum error of 10% at 95% confi dence. We based our assumption that 50% of LBMs would be contaminated with AIV (H5N1) on results from a previous study in US LBMs in 2001 (12) . This study found that 60% of markets tested positive for AIV (H7N2) virus in areas in which the virus was endemic. To account for nonresponse, we increased the total sample size to 83 LBMs. We selected markets for inclusion in the study using systematic sampling. On the basis of a sampling frame of 300 markets, every fourth market (the sampling interval) was selected from a list of all the markets. A random numbers table was used to determine the starting point for selection of the 83 markets from the list. Diagnostic specimens and data were collected during October 2007-March 2008. These months have high rainfall and high AIV transmission according to data gathered during 2005-2007 about AIV (H5N1) outbreaks in farmed birds (Ministry of Agriculture, unpub. data). A structured questionnaire containing 42 questions to assess risk factors for AIV (H5N1) contamination was developed. Responses to questions were obtained through visual inspection of each LBM and through an interview with the manager of the participating LBM. The questions sought information about volume of poultry in the LBM and the infrastructure in the delivery, holding, slaughter, sale, and waste-disposal zones of the market. These 5 zones refl ect general demarcation of work fl ow and activities relating to poultry in LBMs (13) . Questions about the sanitation and slaughtering practices were also included. Questionnaire validation was conducted by members of a study advisory team. The team comprised 2 food safety/environmental health offi cers from the Ministry of Health, a communicable disease epidemiologist from the World Health Organization, a veterinary epidemiologist from the Food and Agriculture Organization, and 2 virologists from the Ministry of Agriculture in Indonesia. The questionnaire was tested in 3 LBMs in West Java province to ensure coherence, appropriate use of terminology, and high face validity. The same markets were also inspected to ensure that the questionnaire addressed all aspects of the poultry-related work fl ow in the 5 poultry zones and relevant infrastructure. Members of the study advisory team trained 3 study data collection teams in questionnaire administration and sample collection procedures. To select the environmental sites to be sampled in each LBM, the study advisory team visually inspected 3 markets and reviewed the literature to identify LBM sites commonly contaminated with AIVs or similar pathogens. Sites sampled in previous studies for AIV included fl oors, drains, and water troughs (8, 11, 12) . In this study, 27 sites were selected for environmental sampling ( Table 1) . The sites represented different poultry-related work activities: 3 sites related to delivery of birds into LBMs, 7 in the birdholding zone, 9 in the slaughter zone, 6 in the sale zone, and 2 in the waste-disposal zone. Because of variation in LBM infrastructure and processes, each LBM did not necessarily have all 27 sites. Samples were collected from as many of the 27 sites as were available in each LBM. For each of the 27 sites, 6 swab specimens were collected and pooled. Each pool (vial) consisted of a maximum of 3 swabs. The data collection teams were instructed to increase the representativeness of the samples by swabbing different locations for each environmental site. For example, if the market had 6 poultry stalls, each with its own scale for weighing poultry, then teams collected 1 swab from each scale and pooled them into 2 pools of 3 swabs each. Swab specimens were pooled in the market, and swabs remained inside the vials until testing. The data collection teams were instructed to focus on visibly dirty, moist, or diffi cult-to-clean surfaces in an effort to increase the sensitivity of the sampling. Sample collection, pooling, transportation, and storage were based on techniques used in previous studies (10, 12) . Each data collection team comprised 3 persons, 2 of whom collected samples and 1 administered the questionnaire. To reduce the risk for cross-contamination during sample collection, teams changed disposable gloves and shoe covers between each of the 5 LBM poultry zones. Sterile cottontipped swabs were used to collect all samples, and samples were placed in viral transport media and transported immediately back to the laboratory on frozen gel packs. The viral transport media consisted of Dulbecco modifi ed Eagle medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 1,000 IU penicillin and gentamicin, and 1% fetal buffer serum (14) . Samples were stored in the laboratory at -70°C until tested. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were used as described (15) . Virus isolation methods have also been described (16) but in general involved supernatants from a 1,000-μL sample homogenized by vortex and centrifuged at 2,500-3,000 rpm into 9-to 10-day-old specifi c pathogen-free eggs. Those positive in the hemagglutination assay were tested by hemagglutination-inhibition test with reference antiserum (A/chicken/West Java/Hamd/2006). The degree of association between AIV (H5N1) positivity in the 5 LBM poultry zones was determined by using Spearman rank correlation. To assess risk factors for environmental virus (H5N1) contamination, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) using multivariable logistic regression analyses, where variables with p<0.1 from the univariate analyses were included in the initial model. A backward stepwise variable-selection strategy was used to construct a fi nal model with a signifi cance level of p<0.05. The Hosmer and Lemeshow test and the residual χ 2 goodness-of-fi t test were used to assess model stability.
