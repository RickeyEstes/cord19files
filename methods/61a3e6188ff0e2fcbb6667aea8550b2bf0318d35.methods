Sequence and structure analyses. The sequences of D. melanogaster proteins CG2145 and CG3303 were downloaded from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProt IDs: Q9VF14_DROME and ENDOU_DROME, respectively) 25 . Searches for homologues were performed using the program PSI-BLAST 26 (up to five iterations) at the NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A multiple sequence alignment comprising all the matched sequences was produced using a local version of ClustalW 27 (http://www.clustal.org/). This alignment was edited using the Bioedit 7.2.5 package (http://www. mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) to retain only sequences where the three XendoU residues whose point mutation abolished catalysis (i.e., H162, H178, K224) are present. The alignment shown in Supplementary Table 1 was edited by hand to minimize the number of deletions occurring within secondary structure elements. Predictions of protein features such as occurrence of signal peptides, disordered segments, trans-membrane regions, and secondary structure elements were obtained from several available servers including: Pfam 28 ; SMART 29 ; PSIPRED 30 ; TMHMM 31 ; SignalP 32 and GeneSilico MetaDisorder Service 33 . In vitro translation of CG2145 and CG3303. Total RNA was purified from whole larvae and adults by tissue homogenization and Qiazol reagent extraction. CG2145 and CG3303 ORFs were amplified, through the oligonucleotides A (5′ -ATGCGCTGCCTGGCATTGAGC-3′ ), B (5′ -TCAAATCTCCGGATAGGCGCTGCC-3′ ) and C (5′ -ATGGACGCAGTGCAGCAGCAAAC-3′ ), D (5′ -CTAGGAGCTGTCCGGATAGAC-3′ ), respectively, and cloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector, between the EcoRI and NotI sites. CG2145 and CG3303 [ 35 S] methionine-labeled proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation reactions using the TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System kit (Promega), according to manifacturer's instructions. In vitro processing assay. Oligoribonucleotides P1 (5′ -GGAAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG-3′ ) or P2 (5′ -GGAAACGUAUCCUUGGGAGG-3′ ) were 5′ -end labeled with [γ -32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) treatment. Processing reactions were carried out in the conditions already described 1 , by incubating 3 × 10 4 cpm of 32 P-labeled substrate together with 5-10 μ l of CG2145-or CG3303-expressing reticulocyte lysates, in the presence of 5 mM MnCl 2 (or other cations, for ion dependence determination experiments). Cleavage products were phenol-extracted and analysed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels. The RNA ladder derived from incubation of P1 oligo (200,000 cpm) in 500 mM NaHCO 3 at 90 °C 2-tailed unpaired t-tests. Tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). P value, ****p < 0.0001. (d) Diagram showing viability in D42-G4 > dendoU RNAi flies. Median lifespan in experimental flies (grey squares) was 21.53 ± 0.50d and it was 31.38 ± 0.26d in control flies (black circles). The log rank test showed that the two curves were significantly different (P < 0.001). (e) Locomotor deficit in 5-day-old flies interfered for dendoU in motor neurons. The climbing performance in D42-G4 > dendoU RNAi flies (grey bar) was significantly lower compared to control flies (black bar). Statistics as in panel c. P values, **p = 0.0015. (f) Western blot of dTDP-43 in head and thoracic-abdominal ganglia (H + TAG) dissected from pan-neuronal dendoU interfered pupae. Giotto was used as internal control. Result was expressed as means for at least three independent biological replicates. (g) qRT-PCR analysis of dendoU and dTDP-43 mRNAs (grey bars) in the same samples as in (f). Expression levels in control samples are set as 1 (black bar). Data are presented as mean ± SD in triplicates (***P < 0.001, Paired T-test). The full-length versions of the cropped blots are shown in Supplementary Figure 7b . Scientific RepoRts | 7:41559 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41559 for 20 min. Densitometric analysis was performed by Typhoon Trio Imager (Amersham Bioscience), using the ImageQuant 5.0 Software. For each cleavage assay, band intensities were expressed as percentages, relative to the major cleavage product set as 100. Analysis of cleavage product 3′-ends. Specific reaction products obtained by incubation of unlabeled P1 oligonucleotide with CG2145-or CG3303-expressing reticulocyte lysates were gel-purified after acrylamide fractionation, phenol-purified and redissolved in 30 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mM MgCl 2 . The mixture was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1.5 units/μ l of T4 polynucleotide kinase to remove the 2′ -3′ -cyclic phosphate 34 . RNA was treated with kinase buffer or with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) as negative controls. Extracted RNA was then labeled by T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 5 h at 16 °C, in the presence of 5′ -[32 P] cytidine 3′ ,5′ -bisphosphate (Perkin Elmer Life Science) and analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel.

RNAi lines, w 1118 ; P{GD3933}v9916 (v9916), P{KK115483}VIE-260B (v109080) and P{KK108354}VIE260B (v104401) were obtained from Vienna Stock Center. In vivo RNAi experiments were performed at 25 °C and 29 °C. Expression profile and western blot analyses. mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and semi-quantitative PCR analysis (RT-PCR) or by Western blot assay, respectively. For qRT-PCR, RNA extracted from specific samples (developmental stages or tissues) by Qiazol reagent (Qiagen) was used to generate cDNA using SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen). The qRT-PCR was performed using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) or miScript SYBR-Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) through a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystem), using the oligonucletides listed below. The reaction mixtures were kept at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Fluorescence output results were captured and analyzed using 7300 System SDS v1.4 Software (Applied Biosystems), and the threshold cycle (Ct) was used for assessing relative levels of target transcripts versus rp49 transcripts. For RT-PCR, amplicons were fractionated along a 2% agarose gel and revealed by ChemiDoc XRS + Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Gapdh mRNA was used as loading control. ImageJ was used for intensity band quantification. For protein level determination, Western blots were carried out using custom antibodies against CG2145 (PRIMM) (1:1000) and dTDP-43 18 (1:1000), or antibodies against Giotto (provided by G. Cestra) (1:5000). Walking, climbing and survival assays. The assays were performed according to earlier established protocol 18 . For the walking assay, we examined the behaviour of freely walking upright adult flies on a flat horizontal surface. Newly eclosed female and males were transferred in batches of 15 to fresh vials and aged for 3-4 days. The flies were transferred, without anaesthesia, to the centre of 200 mm Petri dish to allow for video recordings using a Nikon D5000 mounted on a WILD M3B (Wild Heerbrugg) stereomicroscope. For the climbing assay we used an apparatus consisting of two empty polystyrene vials vertically joined by tape facing each other. For the lower vial, a vertical distance of 8 cm above the bottom surface was measured and marked by drawing a circle around the entire circumference of the vial. For the climbing assay, a group of 10 male flies were transferred into the lower vial and allowed to acclimatize to the new setting for 1 minute. The climbing assay involved gently tapping the flies down to the bottom of the vial and measuring the number of flies per group that can climb above the 8 cm mark by 15 seconds after the tap, recorded as the percentage success rate. Nine trials were performed for each group and n ≥ 100 flies were assayed for each genotype. Experiments were performed during daylight to minimize potential effects of circadian oscillation. All average data are presented as mean ± SEM and compared with 2-tailed unpaired t-tests. Statistical tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For survival assay, homozygous virgins bearing GAL4 were crossed to homozygous UAS-dendoU RNAi transgene and Scientific RepoRts | 7:41559 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41559 control Ore-R males. The progeny from these crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal-sucrose-yeast-agar diet at 29 °C. Every 2-3 days, flies were passed into new vials and dead flies were counted. The survival rate was calculated by the percentage of total flies surviving. Survival curves were analysed by the log-rank method using GraphPad Prism (n ≥ 500 flies for all genotypes except for D42-G4 > dendoU RNAi (n ≥ 200)).
