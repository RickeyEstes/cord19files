The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of SARS-CoV RNA extraction based on the use of the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with protocols adapted for the MagNA Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The former protocol is a manual column-based method based on silica-adsorption. On the other hand, the MagNA Pure LC instrument extracts nucleic acids from biological specimens based on magnetic bead separation. The principle and general setup of the instrument had been previously described [7] . The main objective of this study was to compare the resultant analytical sensitivity and quantitative performance of the serum SARS-CoV RNA test when either the manual or automated extraction protocol was used.
