All viral genomes were downloaded from NCBI before May. 24th, 2005. There are two available data sets of virus complete genomes. Those in GenBank [53] are the original data submitted by their authors. Those at the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) [54] are reference genomes curated by NCBI staff. Since the latter represents the approach of one and the same group using the same set of tools, it may provide a more consistent background for comparison. Therefore, we used all the translated amino acid sequences (the .faa files with NC_accession numbers) from NCBI. There are 1489 viral genomes, including 248 phages. Under the assumption that small DNA viruses (genome size < 10 k) probably have a different evolutionary history than large DNA viruses [9, 11] , and their mutation rate approaches that of RNA viruses (the order of substitutions per site per year, [55] ), only large DNA viruses (total length of all coding proteins > 4 k) were used in the phylogenetic analysis, which included 124 viruses (phages have been excluded). Among the 124 dsDNA viruses there are seven viruses that are classified to certain families but their lower taxonomy states remain unknown, and two viruses are tentative species, and one virus that is only recognized as a dsDNA virus. The Additional file 1 lists the dsDNA viruses used, their abbreviations, and the NCBI accession numbers [see Additional file 1: 124 large dsDNA virus names, abbreviations, and NCBI accession numbers]. The main steps of the method are (see [28] for details): First, collect all amino acid sequences of a species. Second, calculate the frequency of appearance of overlapping oligopeptides of length K. A random background needs to be subtracted from these frequencies by using a Markov model of order (K -2) in order to diminish the influence of random neutral mutations at the molecular level and to highlight the shaping role of selective evolution. Some strings that contribute mostly to apomorphic characters become more significant after the subtraction. The subtraction procedure is an essential step in our method. Third, putting these "normalized" frequencies in a fixed order, a composition vector of dimension 20 K is obtained for each species. Fourth, the correlation C(A, B) between two species A and B is determined by taking projection of one normalized vector on another, i.e., taking the cosine of the angle between them. Lastly, the normalized distance between the two species is defined to be D = (1 -C)/ 2. Once a distance matrix has been calculated it is straightforward to construct phylogenetic trees by following the standard neighbor-joining method in the Phylip package [56] . The best choice of K is related to the uniqueness of sequence reconstruction from its K-word components and is determined basically by the length of the sequence at hand. According to so-called "sequencing by hybridization" [57] , for dsDNA viral genomes with length around 4,000 a.a., the minimal K is estimated to be 5. Only large genome viruses are used in our analysis to avoid the problem of small sample size when using CV method whose subtraction procedure is based on statistics. The CV method avoids the problems caused by HGT on the application of prokaryotic phylogeny by using whole genome sequences, because the extent of lateral transfer has been increasingly restricted to smaller and smaller gene pools of closer and closer related species as time goes by [58] . However, its application on classification of small DNA viruses may be affected by HGT because of relative shorter genome length, that's one of the reasons only large DNA viruses are used.
