We collect time series of reported COVID-19 cases in Republic of Korea from 20 January to 1 March 2020 and cases in Italy from 5 February to 5 March 2020. Following [2, 3] , we assumed that number of secondary cases associated with a primary COVID-19 case follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution, with means R0 and dispersion parameter k [3] . Here, the R0 is the basic reproduction number of COVID-19. The k measures the likelihood of occurrence of super-spreading events (or other factors) which could vary the growth rate. If k is smaller than 1, these data indicate occurrence of super-spreading events (larger proportion of 'super-spreaders' or 'dead-ends' in infected individuals) or some other factors which could vary the growth rate; otherwise if k is larger than 1, these data do not indicate occurrence of super-spreading events [4] . The onset date of each secondary case is the summation of the onset date of the primary case (t) plus the serial interval (SI). In this work, the SI was assumed as a .
