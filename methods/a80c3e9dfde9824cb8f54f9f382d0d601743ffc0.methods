The study was approved by the ethics committee of the United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong. We entered on a predesigned database the daily clinical findings based on history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We collected nasopharyngeal aspirates and clotted blood for virological studies from all patients at presentation and on day 14 after the onset of illnesses. Anteroposterior chest radiography was done daily for each patient. All chest radiographs were jointly reported by specialist radiologists and respiratory physicians. We did high-resolution CT of the thorax for patients who had apparently normal, equivocal, or atypical chest radiographs. For patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) less than 26·6 kPa, 11 and recorded acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. 12 From 20 patients in whom SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR in the initial nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, we collected further nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and faecal samples every 3 days. In 14 of these patients, quantitative PCR was done on the nasopharyngeal aspirates collected on days 5, 10, and 15 after onset of symptoms. The nasopharyngeal aspirates on admission were assessed by rapid immunofluorescent antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus, and were cultured for conventional respiratory pathogens on Mardin Darby Canine Kidney, LLC-Mk2, RDE, Hep-2, MRC-5, and fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cell lines. RT-PCR for SARS coronavirus was done directly on all clinical samples. Briefly, total RNA from clinical samples was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and cDNA was amplified with primers 5ЈTACACACCTCAGCGTTG-3Ј and 5Ј-CACGAAC GTGACGAAT-3Ј. 3 For real-time quantitative PCR assays, cDNA was amplified in an SYBR Green I fluorescence reactions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as described. 13 Briefly, 20 L reaction mixtures containing 2 L cDNA, 3·5 mmol/L magnesium chloride, and 0·25 mol/L of the same forward and reversed primers as the reaction mixtures were thermal-cycled by a Light cycler (Roche, Mannheim; 95ºC, 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95ºC, 10 min; 57ºC, 5 s; 72ºC, 9 s). Plasmids with the target sequence were used to generate the standard curve. At the end of the assay, PCR products (182 bp) were subjected to a melting curve analysis (65-95ºC, 0·1ºC/s) to find out the specificity of the assay. The acute and convalescent sera were tested in parallel for SARS-associated coronavirus IgG, with SARS-associatedcoronavirus-infected Vero cells fixed in acetone in an indirect immunofluorescent format. We investigated blood, sputum or endotracheal aspirates, and urine bacteriologically, as clinically indicated. All patients had sepsis work up on admission and if fever recurred. Stools were sent for routine bacteriological culture, Clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay, and examined for parasites in selected patients. All patients were treated with 1·2 g intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate every 8 h, and 500 mg oral azithromycin daily. In patients with a known penicillin allergy, we administered 500 mg oral levofloxacin every 24 h. As soon as the diagnosis of SARS was established, 8 mg/kg intravenous ribavirin every 8 h for 14 days, and a tailing regimen of hydrocortisone (starting dose 200 mg intravenously every 8 h) over 10 days, followed by oral prednisolone for 11 days (1 mg/kg for 5 days, 0·5 mg/kg for 3 days, and 0·25 mg/kg for 3 days) were given. We used pulses of methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously daily for two or three doses if patients worsened, with increasing shortness of breath, oxygen desaturation, and radiological worsening. All HBsAg-positive patients were given 100 mg oral lamivudine daily while taking corticosteroids.
