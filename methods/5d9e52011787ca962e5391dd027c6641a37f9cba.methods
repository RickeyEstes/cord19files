Dignitas International (DI), a Canadian non-governmental organization, has worked in partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) since 2004 to support delivery of comprehensive HIV/AIDS care in the Zomba District, one of the most densely populated districts in Malawi (population: 670,500). District HIV prevalence is approximately 14.5 % although estimates within the district vary by location and population group [33] . DI supported the Malawi MOH to establish a tertiary referral HIV clinic at Zomba Central Hospital in 2004, and since 2006 has also supported the Zomba District Health Office to integrate HIV-related services into existing primary health services at decentralized health centres throughout the district [34] . As per Malawian MOH guidelines, each patient who starts ART is given a unique treatment unit ART registration number. This number is written on a paper-based patient card called a Master Card and put into the electronic ART register for staff's use. All baseline registration data is entered at the time of ART initiation. At each follow-up (FU) visit, patient data is documented on the Master Card. Following initiation, patients are asked to return 2 weeks later and then monthly for the first 6 months. After 6 months, patients may be asked to return every 2-3 months depending primarily upon provider assessments and drug availability [34, 35] . Patients are therefore given a 2-week, 4-week, 8-week or 12-week supply of ART depending on their expected frequency of visits. Data collection on MOH standardized registers and Master Cards are completed by clinicians and health staff at baseline initiation and at each subsequent FU visit. For each follow-up visit, a 'days late' value was determined. The expected return date was calculated by using the value for ART supply (in weeks) given at each FU visit. A patient's actual return date was compared to their expected return date. A patient was considered late if they did not return at least 7 days after they were expected for a FU visit. This definition is consistent with the 7-days late value used to generate adherence proportions in the Malawi treatment guidelines [35] . As well, discussion with the clinical team in Zomba (personal communication Gabriel Mateyu and Dr. Kevin Bezanson, Dignitas International, Zomba Malawi November 29, 2012) supported use of this definition of Late. Building on the work of Chi et al. described above [3] , we sought to determine a clinical management LTFU cutoff. Individuals 15 years of age and over who initiated ART with Dignitas International (DI) supported sites including the Central hospital and various health centres in rural areas in Zomba, Malawi between 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2010 were eligible for inclusion. The analysis was limited to all follow-up visits where the patient was ≥1 week late. Similar to Chi et al., lateness was categorized using 1-week cut-offs from ≥1 week to ≥26 weeks late [3] . Therefore, this analysis was based on patients who were at least ≥1 week late and likely to have run out of ART, and thus at a high risk of becoming LTFU. Further, patients were excluded if they were known to have transferred out, stopped ART or died, based on the limited successful tracing completed [36] . Note we considered including known deaths as a competing event although we did not feel confident that we could accurately ascertain deaths given incomplete tracing data. Furthermore, only 70 deaths ascertained through tracing were available for this analyses and the median time from a last known visit date and death ascertainment date (through tracing) was 299.5 days. As in Chi et al., we limited our analyses to patients who started ART and had a FU visit scheduled at least 12 months prior to the end of the study period [3] . This helped to ensure that patients had adequate time to return to the clinic [37] . Furthermore, given that the risk of death is often highest in the first few months of treatment [38] [39] [40] [41] , allowed us to minimize the inclusion of patients who did not return to the clinic because they had died. As we could not ascertain deaths in our dataset, we may have overestimated LTFU estimates. The DI main dataset, available and maintained in Microsoft ACCESS, is composed of 21 separate tables. Several queries were run in order to construct a single flat file dataset that contained all relevant data (baseline and FU visits) on patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Similar to previous studies utilizing this method [42] the data was presented over a wide range of cut-offs. At each 1-week cut-off, the proportion of patients who returned for a subsequent follow-up visit was identified along with 95 % confidence intervals. The confidence intervals were constructed using the variance of the survival function. Plots were generated in Microsoft Excel 2007 (See Additional files 1 and 2). The data used in this study was extracted from routine monitoring and evaluation data gathered as part of the DI/Malawi MOH ART program in Zomba, Malawi, using standardized national Master Cards and registers. As all analyses were performed with deidentified data that was extracted from routine programmatic information, patients did not provide individual written or verbal consent to participate in the study. Ethical approval for data use was obtained from the University of Toronto HIV Research Ethics Board and the National Health Sciences Research Committee in Malawi.
