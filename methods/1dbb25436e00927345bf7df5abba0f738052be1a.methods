LARS was approved by the ethics commission of the University of Leipzig. Informed consent by parents was obtained. A total of 475 children with allergic risk factors and/or with lower birth weight were selected from the entire number of newborns (n 3540) within the area of Leipzig between March, 1995 and March, 1996 . All of the 186 children for whom cord-blood-IgE measurements had been recorded and for whom questionnaires had been filled out at each of the three time periods ± birth, twelve months and 24 months ± were selected for this longitudinal study (Tab. 1). At birth, cord blood IgE level was measured with the Pharmacia CAP system (Upjohn GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Children with cord-blood-IgE > 0.9 kU/l are probably at risk for atopy (Croner et al. 1982) . Each mother answered a questionnaire developed by the MAS (Multicenter Atopy Study) study group (Bergmann et al. 1993) regarding atopic diseases of the parents and siblings of the newborn. Newborns with two atopic family members (both parents or one parent and a sibling with hay fever, asthma or atopic dermatitis) were selected to participate in the study. Children with low birth weight (1500 ± 2500 g) were also integrated in the study because they are risk children concerning airway diseases like asthma or obstructive bronchitis. The parents of the 186 study participants completed a more detailed questionnaire at birth in interview and further self-administrated questionnaires at the time of first and second birthday of their children. The questionnaires contained items on respiratory symptoms (wheezing, breathlessness, diagnosis of croup by physician) of the children during the first and second year of life. In this study obstructive bronchitis was defined to be characterized by the symptoms ™one or more wheezing incidents∫ or ™one or more attacks of breathlessness∫ during the first or second year of the infant's life. This definition of obstructive bronchitis based on results of the LARS-working-group, published by Meusel (2002) . A high correlation had been calculated between clinical diagnosed obstructive bronchitis and these items from questionnaires (96.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Children with the medical diagnosis of croup as an illness of the upper airways were excluded and not evaluated to be cases of obstructive bronchitis. Furthermore, the questionnaires included a question about redecoration of the apartment during pregnancy, the first, and the second year of the infant's life, such as: ™Have you redecorated your apartment during the last year (including painting, new wall-to-wall carpeting or new furniture)?∫ Accordingly, information about overall redecoration exists for three time periods. All the separate redecoration events were requested from the mothers only about pregnancy. Information about laying out new wall-to-wall carpets was available for the 1 st and 2 nd year of life, too. Some other influencing factors were also recorded, including: ™Is there smoking in your apartment?∫; ™Do you currently have a pet?∫; ™Is there any water damage in your apartment?∫ The corresponding yes/no answers were also taken as parameters in the model of logistic regression.
