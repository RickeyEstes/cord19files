Viruses and cells. All virus stocks were propagated in Vero-E6 cells as described in 58 . All virus work was performed in a biological safety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Construction of SARS plasmids and viruses. TRN3-based plasmids were constructed in 13 . TRN7 mutations were introduced into SARS plasmids A and F using cassettes generated by BioBasic. To generate SARS-F plasmids containing both TRN mutations and the mouse-adapted mutation at nt 2663, the mouse-adapted mutation was cloned into the F TRN plasmids via a PCR and restriction digestion strategy. To generate SARS-F plasmids containing both TRN mutations and the mouse-adapted mutation at nt 2663, the mouse-adapted mutation was cloned into the F TRN plasmids via a PCR and restriction digestion strategy. The plasmids F-BstZ (5′-GGAGGCGCAATTTTTGTACCTCTATGCCTTG-3′), R-MAmut (5′-AGCTATCGTCTCCGCTTCTCAACGGTAATAGTACCGTTGTCTG-3′), F-MAmut (5′-AGCTATCGTCTCCAAGCTTAAACAACTCCTGGAACAA TGGAAC-3′), and R-Msc (5′-GTGGCTTAGCTACTTCGTTGCTTCCTT CAGGC-3′) were used to generate 2 amplicons. The resulting amplicons were restriction-digested with BsmB I, ligated, and purified, after which the ligated amplicons and the parent vectors were restriction-digested with BstZ17 I and Msc I and ligated. Ligated vectors were transformed into TopTen E. coli cells, and the resulting colonies were screened and sequence-verified. Viruses were then constructed as described in ref. 58 . Northern blot analysis. Intracellular RNA was isolated using RiboPure reagents (Ambion, Austin, TX) 12 h post-infection 13 . The mRNA was then isolated using a Qiagen Oligotex mRNA isolation kit, treated with glyoxal, and separated an agarose gel using NorthernMax-Gly (Ambion). The RNA was then transferred to BrightStar-Plus membrane (Ambion) for 5 h, cross-linked using UV light, prehybridized, and probed with an N gene-specific oligonucleotide probe (5′-CTTGACTGCCGCCTCTGCT b T b CCCT b CT b GC b -3′; biotinylated nucleotides are denoted with a superscripted "b"). The blot was hybridized overnight and washed with low-and high-stringency buffers and was then incubated with phosphataseconjugated streptavidin. The blot was then incubated with CDP-STAR, overlaid with film, and developed. Mouse infections with SARS-CoV and mutants. All experimental protocols involving mice were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. The following mice were used: 10-week-old female BALB/c (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) and 14-month-old female BALB/c (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Mice were lightly anesthetized and infected intranasally with varying doses (10 2 -10 6 PFU, depending on the experiment) of SARS-CoV, MA15, or TRN mutants. Mice were weighed daily, and on certain days specified in each experiment, mouse lungs were harvested for virus titer and/or RNA. Serial passages were inoculated as above for passage 1; subsequent passages were inoculated with 50 μL of clarified lung homogenate (lungs were homogenized in 1 mL of PBS) from the previous passage. All experiments used a minimum of n = 5 mice per virus per dosage/condition (if applicable) per timepoint. For infection-challenge studies, mice were infected with 10 2 -10 3 PFU of the indicated vaccine virus, weighed for the 7 days following initial infection, and then challenged with a lethal dose (10 6 PFU) of MA15 for the challenge infection. Determination of virus titer in infected mouse lungs. Lungs harvested for virus titer were weighed and homogenized in 1.0 mL of PBS at 6000 rpm for 60 s in a MagnaLyser (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Determination of viral neutralization antibody titers. Mouse sera were heatinactivated for 30 min at 55°C and were then serially diluted to 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, 1:800, and 1:1600 in PBS to a volume of 125 μL. Next, 125 μL of PBS containing low-concentration SARS-CoV MA15 (40 PFU) or high-concentration SARS-CoV MA15 (240 PFU) was added to each serum dilution. The virus-serum mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Following incubation, virus titers of the mixtures were determined by plaque assay. Finally, we calculated the 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT 50 ) values, the serum dilutions at which plaque formation was reduced by 50% relative to that of virus stock not treated with serum. Viral genome sequencing. To determine the sequences of viral genomes present in mouse lungs after passage, plaques were isolated from lung samples as described above. Briefly, individual viral plaques were harvested by collecting the agarose plugs above them using a 200-μL pipette tip. Each agarose plug was dropped in 0.5 mL PBS, allowed to diffuse for 24 h at 4°C, and then applied to~70% confluent monolayers of Vero-E6 cells in T25 flasks and incubated for 48 h at 37°C. Infected cell monolayers were then harvested in 1 mL of TRIzol. First-strand cDNA was generated as described in ref. 59 . Amplicons of the viral genomes were generated as described in ref. 1 . Sequence results were analyzed using Geneious R11 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) and Serial Cloner 2.6.1 (SerialBasics, http://serialbasics. free.fr/Home/Home.html). Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The tests run depended on the experimental design and are specified in the text. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
