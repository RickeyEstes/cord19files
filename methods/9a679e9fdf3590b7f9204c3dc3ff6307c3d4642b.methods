Publications used in this analysis were extracted from the Scopus database developed by Elsevier in the Netherlands. Scopus is a relatively large database compared to PubMed and Web of Science [30] which contains information for publications published in more than 21,500 titles of which 20,000 are peer-reviewed journals from more than 5,000 international publishers [31] . Selected publications included "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus" or "MERS-CoV" or "Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center/2012" or "HCoV-EMC/2012" as a part of its title, abstract, or keyword from 2012 till the date of December 31, 2015 All of these terms are used in one query. Publications as errata or publications which their scope was not related to MERS-CoV, and publications from 2016 were excluded from the study. Research indicators for the assessment of MERS-CoV research output were determined according to the methods used previously in similar bibliometric studies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Analysis parameters include date (year) of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor (IF), h-index, language, and times cited. International collaborations were considered when the paper affiliation contained different countries. To measure the impact and/or productivity of the research published in the field of MERS-CoV, h-index and IF were used as bibliometric indicators for this evaluation. The h-index was introduced in literature in 2005 by Hirsch for the assessment of individual academic attainment [38] . The h-index can more truthfully represent the author's or country's achievement; a higher hindex shows that the publication s larger influential power. The IF of the journals as reported in Journal Citation ReportsÂ® (JCR) 2014 was used [39] . Only the ten top-ranked journals were considered and they were shown in descending order from 1st to 10th using the standard competition ranking (SCR), with the highest absolute number of publications ranked 1, as obtained on the day of data collection (March 4, 2016). Data collection and analysis were performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. Parameters with the same number of publications were given the same rank number.
