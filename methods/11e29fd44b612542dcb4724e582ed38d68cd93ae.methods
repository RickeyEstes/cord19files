The GBD 2010 was a systematic scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of loss of health for 187 countries from 1990 to 2010. The GBD 2010 covered 291 diseases and injuries, 1,160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors for various diseases or injuries (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . GBD 2010 estimates the burden of disease and injury by age, sex, and country for 1990, 2005, and 2010 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Loss of health was assessed on the basis of a systemic analysis of all the available data by using the following metrics: mortality, causes of death, years of life lost attributable to premature mortality (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs provide a summary measure of premature mortality and time spent in less than ideal health (12) . YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs measure loss of health in terms of time (12) . DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs (12) . YLLs are the number of deaths attributed to a disease multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death in years (12) . YLD is the prevalence of each disease or injury sequela multiplied by the associated disability weight for that sequela and the duration until the person with the disease dies or the disease goes into remission (12) .
