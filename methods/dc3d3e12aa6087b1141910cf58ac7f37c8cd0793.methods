All experimental protocols requiring biosafety were approved by Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBC) of Chonbuk National University. Animals. C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice (4-6 weeks old) were purchased from Samtako (O-San, Korea). CD11c-DTR transgenic (Tg) mice (B6.FVB-Tg Itgax-DTR/EGFP 57Lan/J [DTR]) and CCR2 knockout (KO) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), and CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO mice were generated by crossing CD11c-DTR Tg mice with CCR2 KO mice. All mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of Chonbuk National University. Cells, viruses, antibodies, and reagents. The JEV Beijing-1 strain was propagated in a mosquito cell line (C6/36) using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml) 47 . The virus stocks were titrated by conventional plaque assay using BHK-21 cells (CCL-10; American Type Culture Collection), and stored in aliquots at − 80 °C until use. The mAbs used for the flow cytometric analysis and other experiments were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) or BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA) ( Quantification of viral burden and cytokine expression. Viral burden and expression of cytokines (IL-1β , IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β , and TNF-α ), and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL2, and CXCL10) in inflammatory and lymphoid tissues were determined by quantitative SYBR Green-based real-time RT-PCR (real-time qRT-PCR). Mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with JEV (1.5 × 10 7 PFU) and tissues including brain, spinal cord, and spleen were harvested at 2, 4, and 6 dpi. Total RNAs extracted from tissues using easyBLUE (iNtRON, INC., Daejeon, Korea) were employed in real-time qRT-PCR using a CFX96 TM Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Following reverse transcription of total RNAs with High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), the reaction mixture contained 2 μ l of template cDNA, 10 μ l of 2× SYBR Primix Ex Taq, and 200 nM primers in a final volume of 20 μ l. The reactions were denatured at 95 °C for 30 s and then subjected to 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, and 60 °C for 20 s. After the reaction cycle was completed the temperature was increased from 65 °C to 95 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/15 s, and the fluorescence was measured every 5 s to construct a melting curve. A control sample that contained no template DNA was run with each assay, and all determinations were performed at least in duplicate to ensure reproducibility. The authenticity of the amplified product was determined by melting curve analysis. Viral RNA burden in the infected samples was expressed as viral RNA copies per microgram of RNA, and the relative ratios of cytokines and chemokines in infected samples to uninfected samples were determined. All data were analyzed using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager, version 2.1 analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). ELISA for cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic factors. Sandwich ELISA was used to determine the serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α cytokines. Flt3-L level was determined by commercialized ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). GM-CSF, CCL2, and CXCL1 were measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) technique (eBioscience), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Leukocyte isolation and CD11b + Ly-6C hi sorting from the CNS. Mice infected with JEV were perfused with 30 ml of HBSS containing heparin on day 3 or 5 pi via cardiac puncture of the left ventricle. Brains were then harvested and homogenized by gently pressing them through a 100-mesh tissue sieve and digested with 25 μ g/ml of collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochem, Freehold, NJ, USA), 0.1 μ g/ ml trypsin inhibitor Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μ g/ml DNase I (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA), and 10 mM HEPE in HBSS for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were separated by using Optiprep density gradient (18/10/5%) centrifugation at 800 × g for 30 min (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway), after which the cells were collected from the 18% to 10% interface and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then counted and stained for CD11b, Gr-1, Ly-6G, Ly-6C, CD3ε , CD4, and CD8α with directly conjugated antibodies (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were fixed with 10% buffered formaldehyde. Data collection and analysis were performed with FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickson Medical Systems, Sharon, MA, USA) and FlowJo (ver. 7.6.5; Tree Star, San Carlos, CA, USA) software. In some experiments, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were purified from brain leukocytes and splenocytes by applying cells to a FACS Aria sorter (Becton Dickson Medical Systems). Purified CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes showed > 95% purity. Cytospin, histology, and confocal microscopy. To cytospin CD11b + Ly-6C hi and CD11b + Ly-6G hi cells on Cytoslide (Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC, USA), sorted cells were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 10 min using a CytoSpin 4 Cytocentrifuge (Thermo Scientific), and were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For histological examination of the brain, brain derived from mock and JEV-infected mice were embedded in paraffin and 10-μ m sections were prepared and stained with H&E by the Pathology Lab (College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea). Sections were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For confocal microscopy of brain tissue, brains were collected and frozen in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) following vigorous heart perfusion with HBSS. Sections of 6-7 μ m thick were cut, air-dried, and fixed in cold solution (1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol) for 15 min at − 20 °C. Non-specific binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Staining was performed by incubating sections overnight in a moist chamber at 4 °C with antibodies to JEV (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), MAP-2 (microtubule-associated protein 2; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), as well as biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (BD Biosciences) antibody. Primary antibodies were detected with secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, FITC-conjugated streptavidin, and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the fluorescence was observed by confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Zena, Germany). Proliferation analysis of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. Proliferation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes in the splenocytes incubated with sera was assessed by incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) using the Click-iT EdU imaging kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proliferated monocytes were determined by flow cytometric analysis after gated on CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes. Scientific RepoRts | 5:17548 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17548 Generation of BM chimeric mice. C57BL/6 mice (6-7 weeks old) protected by head shielding were γ -irradiated with one dose of 950 rads. Within 12 h, mice were reconstituted with 10 7 donor BM cells derived from CD11c-DTR, CCR2 KO, or CD11c-DTR·CCR2 KO mice. The recipient mice were given sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in drinking water for 10 days after irradiation. 4-6 weeks after irradiation, mice were infected with JEV after adoptive transfer of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes (1.5 × 10 6 cells/mouse). Trafficking analysis of sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice in the CNS and lymphoid tissues. Differential labeling of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes was used to evaluate trafficking of sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from vehicle-or DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice into the CNS and lymphoid tissues. After injection of DT or vehicle 2 times at a 1-day interval, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were purified by FACS Aria sorter following enrichment of CD11b + cells by PE-labeled MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes were resuspended at 10 7 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 complete medium (containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). CMFDA Cell Tracker Green (Invitrogen) for sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Veh CMFDA ) or CMTMR Cell Tracker Orange (Invitrogen) for sorted CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes from DT-treated CD11c-DTR mice (DT CMTMR ) were added for final concentrations of 5 μ M and 10 μ M, respectively, and incubated in a water bath at 37 o C for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with cold RPMI 1640 complete medium and resuspended in sterile PBS at a 1:1 ratio (Input cell). A total of 5.0 × 10 6 CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes (2 doses, each 2.5 × 10 6 cells) were injected intravenously into JEV-infected CCR2 KO mice at 4 dpi. Brain, BM, and spleen tissues as well as blood were harvested 20 h after injection of donor cells and the infiltrated cells were analyzed for the presence of labeled cells by FACS. To analyze brain leukocytes, vigorous heart perfusion was performed before harvesting brain tissue. Cell distribution of labeled donor cells was calculated based on the ratio detected in the output organ (CNS, blood, BM, and spleen) compared with the initial input ratio of labeled cells at the time of cell transfer (DT CMTMR :Veh CMFDA ).
