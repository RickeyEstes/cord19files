Specimen collection and handling. During February 27 to March 6 of 2011, twentythree primary school children under the age of 12 (Dongguan; Guangdong Province) presented with flu-like symptoms, including fever, pharyngalgia, and coughing as well as other indications of ARD. Two were hospitalized with severe symptoms. Eleven throat swab specimens were collected into 2-ml viral transport media; transported at 2uC-8uC; and preserved at 280uC for virus isolation and nucleic acids extraction. This study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province (Guangdong CDC) and was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. The guardians of all under-aged participants gave signed informed consent for participation in the study. Data records of the samples and sample collection are de-identified and completely anonymous. Detection of respiratory pathogens. Total nucleic acids were extracted from the specimens using the QIAamp minElute virus spin kit (Qiagen; Hombrechtikon, Germany). Human adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E were detected by real-time PCR as described earlier 63 . For HAdV identification, type-specific primers were used to characterize the type by PCR, as described in an earlier report 60 . Adenovirus isolation and genomic DNA extraction. Adenovirus-positive throat swab specimens, identified by PCR analysis, were inoculated into A549 cell cultures, and grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 100 IU penicillin ml 21 , 100 mg streptomycin ml 21 , and 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, at an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored for at least ten days. Viral genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells for genomic analysis, as described by Le, et al. 64 . Genome sequencing and annotation. The genome of HAdV strain DG01_2011 was sequenced using a Sanger chemistry-based, primer-walking method by PCRamplification, with overlapping regions sequenced 39, 65 . Both 59-and 39-ends (including both inverted terminal repeats) were sequenced directly by primers Ad7-LTRS1A (59-GCCTCTTGACGGAACTCG-39) and Ad14-LTRS2 (59-GGTCCCTCTAAATACACATACA-39), respectively, using genomic DNA as template; this ensured the accurate determination of the end sequences 39, 65 . The sequence data, collected with an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer, provided an average genome coverage of 3-to 5-fold, with both strands represented. Gaps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using different primers and resequenced. These sequencing ladders were assembled with the SeqMan Pro software 7.0.1 (DNASTAR, Inc.; Madison, WI. USA). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL and BLAST software. The genome sequence was annotated based on the previous annotation of HAdV-7 prototype strain (Gomen) 55 and deposited into GenBank with the accession number KC440171. In silico restriction endonuclease analysis (REA). The specific adenovirus genome type was determined using in silico REA analysis of the whole-genome sequences in accordance with the in vitro protocol described by Li, et al 20 . This was performed using the software Vector NTI Advance 11.5 (Invitrogen Corp.; San Diego, CA. USA). Twelve restriction enzymes were used for this analysis, as performed by Li, et al. 20 : BamHI, BclI, Bgll, BglII, BstEII, HindIII, HpaI, SmaI, EcoRI, SalI, XbaI, and XhoI. Phylogenetic analyses of HAdV-7 hexon genes and the whole genome sequences. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 5.1.0 software was used for phylogenetic analyses of the HAdV-7 hexon genes and the whole genomes, with additional sequences retrieved from GenBank database, as described previously 66, 67 . Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees with 1,000 boot-strap replicates were constructed using a maximum-composite-likelihood method with default parameters. Bootstrap numbers shown at the nodes indicate the percentages of 1,000 replications producing the clade, with a value of 80 noted as robust and significant. Archived HAdV-7 genome sequences from GenBank were used for phylogenetic analysis. These are as follows (for reference, the names include the corresponding GenBank accession number, country of isolation, strain name, year of isolation (if available), and genome type (if available)): AY594255_Gomen_1952_7p, JX625134_CHN_CQ1198_2010_7d, JF800905_CHN_0901HZ/ShX_2009_7d, JX423388_USA_ak40_1997_7b, JX423386_USA_ARG/ak38_2003_7h, JX423387_USA_ak39_1997_7d2, JX423383_USA_ak35_2006_7d2, JN860677_USA_FS2154_2009_7d2, JN860679_JPN_Takeuchi_317_1958, JN860676_AR_87-922_1987_7h, GQ478341_CHN_GZ08_2008, HQ659699_CHN_GZ07_2007, AY594256_USA_vaccine_1962, AY495969_CHN_vaccine, AY601634_USA_NHRC_1315_1997, and KC440171_CHN_DG01_2011_7d.

For the recombination analysis, MAFFT software was used first to align the HAdV-B species sequences using default parameters (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). Default parameter settings for the Simplot software were used for analyzing the whole genomes, along with the following input: window size (2000 nucleotides [nt]), step size (200 nt), replicates used (n 100), gap stripping (on), distance model (Kimura), and tree model (neighbor-joining). The following genomic sequences of HAdV-B members were used: HAdV-B7p (AY594255), HAdV-B3 (AY599834), HAdV-B16 (AY601636), HAdV-B21 (AY601633), HAdV-B50 (AY737798), HAdV-B11 (AY163756), HAdV-B34 (AY737797), HAdV-B35 (AY271307), HAdV-B14 (AY803294), and HAdV-B55 (FJ643676). Substitution Rate analysis of the hexon, penton base and fiber genes in HAdV-7. The numbers of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitutions per site from between sequences were noted and the Ka/Ks ratios were calculated. This www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 : 7365 | DOI: 10.1038/srep07365 HAdV-7 analysis was conducted using the Nei-Gojobori model 68 , and included nucleotide sequences from 33 hexon genes, 57 fiber genes, and 19 penton base genes available from GenBank. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated automatically. Evolutionary analyses were performed with MEGA 5.1.0 66 . The HAdV-7 complete hexon, penton base and fiber gene sequences available in GenBank were achieved for analysis. The HAdV-7 complete hexon gene sequences used for this analysis are same with previous those in phylogenetic analysis. The following HAdV-7 complete fiber gene sequences were used: AY495969, AY594255,
