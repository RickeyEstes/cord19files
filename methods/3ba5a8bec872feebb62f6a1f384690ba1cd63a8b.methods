Cells. Vero (ATCC CCL-81), 293 T (ATCC CRL-3216), B16-F10 (ATCC CRL-6475), CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61), and CT26 (ATCC CRL-2638) cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured as described before 16, 59 for no longer than 6 months after thawing of the original stock. Transgenic B16-mCLDN6/ hCD46 cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX with 10% FBS, hygromycin B (0.4 mg/ml; Invitrogen), and puromycin (1.5 μg/ml; Invivogen, Toulouse, France). CHO-hCLDN6 or CHO-hCLDN9 cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% FBS and hygromycin B (1.5 mg/ml) or blasticidine (10 μg/ml), respectively. Plasmids. The murine CLDN6 (mCLDN6) gene was synthesized (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany) and inserted into pENTR1A (Invitrogen) to yield pE-mmCldn6. pE-mmCldn6 or pET-15B-Ova 60 were used to amplify cldn6 and ova open reading frames (ORFs) by PCR. cldn6 was flanked with MluI/AatII sites and sequenced after cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO that yielded pCR2.1-mCLDN6. To obtain membrane-associated Ovalbumin, ova was amplified by PCR without STOP, flanked with BglII/SacII sites, and sequenced after cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO to yield pCR2.1-OvaBgl/Sac. The ova fragment was introduced via BglII/SacII into pDis-mod encoding for PDGFR-TM. pDis-mod is a modification of pDisplay (Invitrogen), with MluI and AatII sites 5′ of the SP and 3′ of the PDGFR-TM-sequence, respectively. mCLDN6 or DisOva were inserted into p(+)MV vac2 -ATU(P) 61 via AatII/MluI to yield p(+)MV vac2 -mCLDN6(P) or p(+)MV vac2 -DisOva(P), respectively. A CMV promoter cassette 62 was inserted via NotI/SbfI to generate p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -mCLDN6(P) or p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -DisOva(P). To generate genomes of VLP-encoding MV, the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag gene was amplified and equipped with flanking MluI/AatII sites by PCR and cloned into p(+)MV vac2 -GFP(NR0), derived from pB(+)MVvac2 61 with an ATU encoding GFP in pre-N to yield p(+)MV vac2 -MLVgag(N). p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -MLVgag(N) was constructed by inserting the promoter cassette from p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -MERS-S(H) 16 into p(+)-MV vac2 -MLVgag(N) via PsrI. The fragment with CMV promoter and gag gene cassettes were transferred via NotI/SbfI into p(+) MV vac2 -mCLDN6(P) or p(+)MV vac2 -pDisOva(P) to obtain p(+)PolII-MV vac2 -MLVgag(N)-mCLDN6(P) or p(+) PolII-MV vac2 -MLVgag(N)-DisOva(P), respectively. Details on primers and PCR protocols are available upon request. A lentiviral transfer vector encoding mCLDN6 controlled by hEF1α promoter was generated by shuttling mcldn6 ORF into pLenti6.4/R4R2/V5-DEST together with the EF1α promoter cassette of pENTR5′ using Gateway ® cloning (Invitrogen). Using conventional cloning techniques, the vector was further modified to encode a hygromycin-T2A-GFP fusion protein downstream of the hPGL promoter to yield pL64B42E(EF1α-mCldn6) Hygromycin-T2A-GFP. Likewise, the PCR-amplified ORF of hCD46 BC1 was cloned together with an IRES-puro R cassette into pSEW 63 to yield pSEW-hCD46-IRES-puro. Production of lentiviral vectors. Lentiviral vectors (LVs) were produced and titered via flow cytometry in 293 T cells using a third generation LV vector system 64 with transfer vector plasmids pL64B42E(EF1α-mCldn6) Hygromycin-T2A-GFP or pSEW-CD46-IRES-Puro and widely established protocols as described, before 65 .
