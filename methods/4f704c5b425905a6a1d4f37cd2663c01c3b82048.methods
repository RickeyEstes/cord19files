In this section some mathematical preliminaries on dynamical systems and the PF operator are introduced. Following the mathematical preliminaries, the sensor placement algorithm is described. Finally methods for including sensor accuracy, sensor location constraints, and sensor sensing constraints into the sensor placement algorithm are explained.
