This study consisted of a survey administered to US school nurses between May and July 2011 through the online program Qualtrics. Subjects were recruited from a variety of sources, including state school nurse associations, state departments of education, and individual school Web sites for school nurse contact information. Twentyfive school nurse organizations agreed to assist by sending out a recruitment e-mail to their members/contacts or posting a recruitment statement on their organization's Web site. (A list of participating organizations/agencies is available on request.) A modified Dillman total design method was used to maximize response rates. 21 Two recruitment e-mails (sent 2-4 weeks apart) were distributed to school nurses for whom an e-mail address was available. The Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board approved this study.
