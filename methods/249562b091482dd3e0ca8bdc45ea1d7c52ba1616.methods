Patients who underwent a first allogeneic HSCT in our center from December 2006 to August 2010 and were regularly followed in our center were eligible to be included in this study. Clinical and biological data were extracted from our local database completed by chart review. During the study period (December 2006 to June 2011), patients with respiratory symptoms possibly related to a respiratory virus had nasopharyngeal aspirates for PCR multiplex viral analysis [4] designed to detect RSV types A and B; AdV; HRV; human MPV; HCoV 229E, OC43, and NL63; PIV-1 to -4; influenza virus types A and B; and 4 different bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis). Bacterial and fungal infections were documented by usual methods including bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with a suspicion of pneumonia. Viruses were divided into 3 groups. HRV and HCoV share a more benign symptomatology of the common cold and low direct mortality rates and were thus compiled in one group [5] . Given their worse and on occasion fatal outcomes in the post-transplant setting, RSV, MPV, PIV, and influenza virus infections were gathered into a second flu-like group [1, 6, 7] . AdV was allocated to a separate third group because it can disseminate [8] . Patients were analyzed based on their first episode of VRI according to the virus species or group. Death was considered as a competing event for VRI. Cumulative incidence of VRI was estimated using usual methodology for the first VRI of any virus and then for the first VRI by each of the 3 groups of viruses. The association of baseline characteristics with the risk of VRI was analyzed using Cox proportional cause-specific hazards model. For models involving all VRIs by different virus groups for a patient (whether at the same time or not), a robust sandwich estimator of the variance of the parameters was used to account for potential correlation at the patient level. Given patients' follow-up, all time-to-event data were censored at 36 months after transplant. Analyses were performed using the R statistical software version 2.15.2.
