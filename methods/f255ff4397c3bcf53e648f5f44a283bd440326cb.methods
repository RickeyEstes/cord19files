We recruited a convenience sample of health care personnel nationwide by referral. Participants chosen to complete the survey included clinicians, public health professionals, and allied health personnel. Data were collected using a self-administered, Webbased survey between August and October 2005. Information collected included: job category (eg, nurse, physician), years in the profession, type of facility, degree of involvement in ''hands-on'' patient care duties, knowledge of hand hygiene recommendations, knowledge of CDC-recommended isolation categories, timing and type of previous infection control training, and perceived infection control training needs. We then assessed participants' ability to apply their knowledge of isolation precautions to the care of patients presenting with specific clinical syndromes/conditions by asking them to identify the appropriate category of precautions (Standard, Contact, Droplet, Airborne) and the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used with each precaution. Internet-based data files containing participants' anonymous responses were downloaded into an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) database and analyzed.
