The genomes and the combination of genome and protein sequences were used to develop a phylogenetic tree and phylogenetic profiling, respectively. The dataset of the genomes of the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily was collected from the Refseq database using the Orthocoronavirinae NCBI taxonomy ID (txid2501931). This dataset contains representative complete genomes from each species of that subfamily. (Pruitt et al., 2007; Federhen, 2012) (Supplementary  Table 1 ). Additionally, we collected genome sequences from Bat SARSlike coronavirus (MG772934 and MG772933) from NCBI and BetaCoV/ bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 (EPI_ISL_402131) from GISAID (http:// www.GISAID.org). One species of the Okanivirinae subfamily, the yellow head virus, was also collected as an outgroup (Supplementary Table 1 ). The genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program provided at the XSEDE portal in the CIPRES Science Gateway with an automatic selection strategy (Miller et al., 2012; Katoh and Standley, 2013) . A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method with RAxML-HPC BlackBox in the CIPRES Science Gateway (Stamatakis, 2006) . The analysis used an automatic bootstrapping option using a general timereversible substitution model with a gamma-shape parameter (GTR+ G). The model was selected as the best-fit model under the Akaike information criterion using ModelTest-NG (Darriba et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic trees were viewed using FigTree v1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/ software/figtree/). The annotated protein sequences of 2019-nCoV were collected from the data of one representative genome from NCBI (MN996527). We built a BLAST database with the retrieved genome sequences data using BLAST+ version 2.2.30 (Camacho et al., 2009) . We then determined the presence and absence of homolog proteins of one representative set of annotated 2019-nCoV proteins against other genome sequences in a database using tblastn with a threshold of > 50 and > 25 bits score for protein sequences > 50 amino acids (aa) and < 50 aa in length, respectively. The results of the presence and absence of homolog proteins were converted into a binary matrix and used to build a clustering tree using ward hierarchical clustering method (Ward Jr, 1963) (Supplementary Table 2 ). Nonstructural protein (NS) 7b and NS8 local alignments were only positive in the Sarbecovirus subgenus sample, excluding the SARS coronavirus. Additionally, we predicted the structural properties of the 2019-nCoV NS7b protein, including the secondary structure and order-disorder propensity, using Jpred4 and DICHOT, respectively (Fukuchi et al., 2014; Drozdetskiy et al., 2015) . We also predicted the structure using the contact assisted protein structure prediction (C-I TASSER) composite approach (Zhang et al., 2018) . Additionally, we specifically collected the sequences that produced significant alignments of NS7b using the MEGA X software (Kumar et al., 2018) .
