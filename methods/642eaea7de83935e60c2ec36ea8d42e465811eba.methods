Where methods are concerned, the development of RNA amplification techniques may enable ''RNA-challenged'' A letter was forwarded electronically to 76 journals that publish microarray data. Responses from the 31 journals covered by replies (in some cases, policies of multiple journals were included in one response) are reported. a Reported guidelines governing submission of microarray data. MIAME requires that submitted data conform to MIAME requirements; CBC requires completeness of data submission information evaluated by reviewers on a case-by-case basis. b Reported guidelines governing postarray corroboration of microarray data. COR requires that corroboration be performed on at least some arrayidentified genes; CBC requires that any corroborative data are evaluated by journal reviewers on a case-by-case basis. c Not e-polled (literature search). investigators to rest more easily. It has been shown that reproducible data can be obtained from a microarray starting with as little as 10 ng of RNA or less ( [39, 40] , G.M. Hellmann, unpublished observations). This provides a mechanism for those with limited amounts of total RNA (e.g., <1 Ag) to conduct both microarray and confirmatory qRT-PCR studies. The caveat, however, is that while such amplification systems (e.g., Clontech's SMART system and Ambion's MessageAmp aRNA Kit) may facilitate such an approach, there still remains a degree of skepticism concerning the faithfulness of the final representation of amplified mRNA compared to the original sample. Additionally, this adds yet another step(s) to the overall process and therefore opportunity for the introduction of yet more measurement error. There is justifiable concern that amplification procedures may provide skewed representation of the original RNA population. In fact, these concerns constitute a valid argument for conducting mandatory corroborative studies when amplified samples are used. Many researchers who use microarrays do not necessarily have expertise in designing probes for real-time PCR confirmatory studies. At least one company has seen that this is an underserved market segment just waiting to be exploited. In response to the burgeoning demand for realtime PCR primers, perhaps brought on in part by the need to corroborate microarray data, Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI; Foster City, CA, USA), has developed a product line called ''assays-on-demand.'' This is a collection of optimized gene-specific TaqMan reaction sets (primers and probes) for human and mouse genes. These currently consist of over 18,000 and 9000 reaction sets, respectively [41] . Whether intentional or not, it appears that this product line may facilitate the introduction of an element of standardization into the confirmatory studies process, assuming of course that ABI can persuade a high enough number of researchers to use it on a regular basis. Even if competitors develop similar products, as long as the number of companies offering them remains small it will surely serve to reduce the variability that can only ensue when multitudes of researchers design their own custom primer/probe sets. A third and somewhat more provocative methodological consideration is whether it is in fact reasonable at all to validate oligomicroarrays using PCR-based methods. As alarming as this might sound to many microarray users for whom this has become the norm, there is in fact justifiable concern that this is not necessarily the best approach. As Chuaqui et al. pointed out [36] , it appears that a subset of target cDNAs will hybridize strongly, not only to their intended probe on the array, but also to other probes that have no discernable sequence homology. Thus, it may be prudent to perform corroborative studies using techniques that are not hybridization-based (which PCR-based methods are). Chuaqui et al. suggest contrasting array-based results in silico with data from sequencing-based expression studies, e.g., serial analysis of gene expression, that do not rely on hybridization methods. Alternatively, Northern blotting enables hybridization specificity to be evaluated also on the basis of transcript size. The call for these alternative RNA quantitation techniques is an acknowledgment that all techniques used to analyze biological systems suffer some kind of bias. For example, real-time PCR is rapidly becoming the ''gold standard'' for quantifying RNA in samples and is thus often used to corroborate microarray data. However, a gold standard technique usually earns this accolade not necessarily because it provides the most accurate representation of biological reality, but because it is widely used and accepted. In the case of real-time PCR, most researchers would be hard pressed to provide evidence that this technique accurately counts transcripts in a sample. Furthermore, unless and until complete sequence and annotation data of all genes are available, it is impossible to determine whether a particular real-time PCR is amplifying multiple splice forms and/or closely related gene sequences.
