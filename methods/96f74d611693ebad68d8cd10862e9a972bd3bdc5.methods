All other truncated and domain-swapping mutants were synthesized with PCR, using a full-length Spike template (Fig. 1a) and cloned into the sequence-confirmed VRC8400 plasmid. Proteins were expressed by transfection with vectors encoding corresponding genes in the Expi293 cell line. Transfected cell culture supernatants were collected and purified through HisTrap HP Hiload 16/60 Superdex columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). We synthesized cDNAs encoding Spike using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) and introduced divergent amino acids into the parental Spike strain (England1) predicted from translated sequences of other strains Batin1, GenBank ID KF600628, Bisha1, GenBank ID: KF600620, Buraidah1, GenBank ID: KF600630, EMC, GenBank ID: AFS88936, Hasa14b, GenBank ID: KF600643, JordanN3, GenBank ID: KC776174 and Munich, GenBank ID: KF192507. All constructs were confirmed using sequencing. Cell lines and pseudovirus production. HEK 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), and Huh7.5 cells were provided by Dr Deborah R. Taylor of the US FDA. Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% BSA, 2 mM glutamine and 1 Â penicillin/streptomycin (D10) in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO 2 . Overall, 15 Â 10 6 HEK 293T cells were aliquoted into a 15-cm plate and co-transfected with three plasmids (17.5 mg of packaging plasmid pCMVDR8.2, 17.5 mg of transducing plasmid pHR' CMV-Luc and 1 mg of CMV/R-MERS-CoV S plasmid) and calcium phosphate transfection reagent (Invitrogen) 21, 22 . After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh D10. Forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were collected, filtered, aliquoted and frozen at À 80°C. Pseudovirus was titrated by first plating 1 Â 10 4 Huh7.5 cells per well in a 96-well white/black Isoplate (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and culturing overnight. The medium was removed and twofold serial dilutions of pseudovirus were added to the cells. After 2 h of incubation, 100 ml of fresh media was added. Cells were lysed 72 h later and 50 ml of luciferase substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Luciferase activity was measured according to relative luciferase unit (CPS, count per second) using the Microbeta luminescence counter (PerkinElmer). Phylogenetic analysis. Full-length amino-acid sequences of Spike from MERS-CoV strains England1, Munich, EMC, Buraidah1, Bisha1, Batin1, Hasa14b and JordanN3 were aligned using MAFFT L-INS-i (version 6.8.6.4, http://trex. uqam.ca). A phylogenetic tree was generated by the average linkage (UPGMA) method. The phylogenetic tree was drawn on an iTOL server (http://itol.embl.de). Mouse immunizations. Female BALB/cJ mice aged 6-8 weeks (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized according to several regimens: (i) 3 Â S DNA, (ii) 2 Â S DNA-S1 protein and (iii) 2 Â S1 protein. Within the DNA-only category (i) three groups of mice were injected with plasmid DNA encoding either MERS-CoV full-length Spike (group 1), Spike with a deleted transmembrane unit (S-DTM; group 2) or S1 (group 3) intramuscularly, followed by electroporation (manufacturer-recommended setting) with the AgilePulse System (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at weeks 0, 3 and 6. The DNA-protein groups (ii) were injected twice with plasmid DNA either encoding MERS-CoV full-length Spike (group 4), S-DTM (group 5) or S1 (group 6) at weeks 0 and 3 as described and boosted with either MERS-CoV S-DTM (group 5) or S1 (groups 4 and 6) protein plus Ribi adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at week 6. The protein-only groups (iii) were injected twice with MERS-CoV S-DTM (group 7) or S1 protein (group 8) plus Ribi adjuvant at weeks 0 and 4. Twenty micrograms of plasmid DNA in a total volume of 100 ml of PBS 10 mg of protein in 50 ml PBS mixed with an equal volume of Ribi adjuvant comprised the DNA and protein immunizations, respectively. Two weeks after each injection, sera were collected for measurement of antibody responses. NHP immunizations. Eighteen (6 female and 12 male) Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that weighed between 3.2 and 4.8 kg and had a mean age of 4.4 years were randomly assigned to the three groups according to sex and weight and were immunized according to one of the three different vaccine regimens: 3 Â S DNA, 2 Â S DNA-S1 protein or 2 Â S1 protein. Sample size was based on convention. In the DNA-only group, six NHPs were injected with 1 mg of plasmid DNA encoding MERS-CoV full-length Spike at weeks 0, 4 and 8. Six NHPs in the S DNA-S1 protein group were injected with 1 mg of plasmid DNA encoding MERS-CoV full-length Spike at weeks 0 and 4 and were boosted with 100 mg of MERS-CoV S1 protein and AlPO 4 adjuvant (Brenntag Biosector, Frederikssund, Denmark) at week 8. Six NHPs in the protein-only group were injected with 100 mg of MERS-CoV S1 protein and AlPO 4 adjuvant at weeks 0 and 8. Plasmid DNA was given intramuscularly, followed by electroporation, and protein was injected intramuscularly. Sera were collected 2 weeks after each injection and every 2-4 weeks thereafter through week 18. NHP challenge. Eighteen Indian rhesus macaques-six unvaccinated, six vaccinated with the S DNA/S1 protein and six vaccinated with the S1/S1 protein-were challenged with the JordanN3 strain of MERS-CoV (GenBank ID: KC776174.1) in an approved high-containment facility 19 weeks after the last immunization. NHPs were inoculated intratracheally with 1 ml of 5 Â 10 6 p.f.u. via laryngoscope and lubricated catheter. Virus challenge inoculum was assayed to determine delivered dose. Delivered doses were 3.1 Â 10 6 , 3.6 Â 10 6 and 3.4 Â 10 6 p.f.u. for cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. All NHPs were monitored by clinical, laboratory and radiologic parameters at days 3, 6, 9 and 14 post-challenge. On day 28, all NHPs underwent necropsy. NHP radiologic assessment. Before and after virus challenge, NHPs underwent chest CT, with the PET/CT Gemini TOF imager (Philips, Andover, MA). CT images were evaluated and analysed by two blinded, board-certified radiologists. Lung pathology was assessed longitudinally using a published pulmonary imaging analysis technique 31 . An image segmentation method was used to determine the lung region of interest, followed by a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), that assessed the tissue class (that is, normal or abnormal) for each pixel within the region of interest and that quantified disease severity based on quantitative total lung capacity, pathology volume (if present) and proportion (ratio of pathology volume to total lung volume). The Random Forest algorithm was tuned according to ground glass opacity and consolidation patterns as these two patterns have constituted pathological formations in previous experiments. Pseudovirus neutralization assay. Huh7.5 cells (10,000 cells per well) were plated into 96-well white/black Isoplates (PerkinElmer) the day before infection. Serum serial dilutions were mixed with different strains of titrated pseudovirus, incubated for 30 min (min) at room temperature and added to Huh7.5 cells in triplicate. Following 2 h of incubation, wells were replenished with 100 ml of fresh media. Cells were lysed 72 h later and luciferase activity was measured. IC 90 neutralization titres were calculated for each individual mouse serum sample. Microneutralization assay. Twofold dilutions of heat-inactivated, grouped sera were tested for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 Â TCID 50 of MERS-CoV JordanN3 strain in Vero cell monolayers, using four wells per dilution in a 96-well plate. Viral cytopathic effect was read on days 3 and 4. The serum dilution that completely prevented cytopathic effect in 50% of the wells was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula 45 . Cell-surface binding using FACS. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing MERS-CoV full-length S, RBD-HATM (Spike RBD with an influenza haemagglutinin transmembrane domain), S1-TM and S2-TM. Twenty-four hours later, cells were detached with 4 mM EDTA in PBS and stained with Vivid viability dye (Invitrogen). Cells were then stained with mouse sera (1:200 dilution). Cells were subsequently stained with goat anti-mouse IgG-Phycoerythrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and sorted with an LSR (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were analysed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). ELISA measurement of IgG response. ELISA plates were coated with the MERS-CoV S1 protein at 1 mg ml À 1 in PBS at 4°C overnight. After standard washes and blocks, plates were incubated with serial dilutions of mouse sera. Anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Jackson Laboratory) were used as secondary antibodies, and 3,5,3 0 5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as the substrate to detect MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG1 or IgG2a antibody responses. End point titres were calculated as the highest serum dilution that gave an optical density exceeding five times the background reading. Microscopy. Sixty per cent confluent WHO-Vero cells on glass coverslips were infected with MERS-CoV at 1 p.f.u. per cell. At 24 hours post infection, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol at À 20 o C. These steps occurred under BSL3 conditions using protocols approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of Vanderbilt University and the CDC. Cells were rehydrated in PBS, blocked in PBS and 5% BSA and rinsed with IF wash (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Cells were incubated in primary antibodies at indicated dilutions for 45 min and then rinsed with IF wash for 3 Â 5 min and incubated with secondary antibodies (Goat a-mouse-AlexaFluor 546 (1:1,500), Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Cells were washed for 3 Â 5 min in IF wash, 1 Â with PBS and then 1 Â with distilled water. Coverslips were mounted with Aquapolymount (Polysciences) and visualized using IF microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000S wide-field fluorescent microscope using Â 40 oil-immersion through differential interference contrast, Cy3 and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filters. Images were merged and assembled using Nikon Elements, ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS2. Infected and mock-infected cells were processed in parallel. Hybridoma generation. Mice in groups 1 and 4 were boosted intravenously with an additional 20 mg of S1. Three days later, splenocytes were harvested and fused with Sp2/0 myeloma cells (ATCC) using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1450 (50% (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich) according to the standard methods. Cells were cultured and screened in RPMI complete medium that contained 20% FCS and 1 Â 100 mM hypoxanthine, 0.4 mM aminopterin and 16 mM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Supernatants from resulting hybridomas were screened for binding, using ELISA, to MERS S1, RBD or S-DTM as well as for neutralizing activity. Subclones were generated by limiting dilution. After three rounds of screening and subcloning, stable antibody-producing clones were isolated and adapted to hybridoma-serum-free medium (Life Technologies Corp., Grand Island, NY, USA). Supernatants were collected from selected hybridoma clones and purified through a protein A-sepharose column (GE Healthcare). mAbs were isotyped with the Pierce rapid isotyping kit. Binding studies of mAbs using biolayer interferometry. Binding kinetics of MERS-CoV molecules to antibodies were carried out using a FortéBio Octet Red384 instrument. Assays with agitation set to 1,000 r.p.m. in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% BSA (40-50 ml per well) were performed at 30°C in solid black, tilted-bottom 384-well plates (Geiger Bio-One). Mouse antibodies (40-50 mg ml À 1 ) were used to load anti-mouse IgG Fc capture probes for 300 s (s) to capture levels of 1 À 1.5 nm. Biosensor tips were then equilibrated for 180 s in PBS-1% BSA buffer before binding assessment of MERS-CoV molecules for 300 s followed by dissociation for 300 s. A human-Fc-MERS-CoV S2 chimeric molecule (S2-hFc) was used to load anti-human IgG Fc capture probes for 300 s, and binding to G4 Fab was assessed. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out with the Octet software, v 8.0. X-ray crystallography. A construct encoding the RBD (residues 367-606) with a c-terminal HRV-3c cleavage site and His 6 purification tag was produced in GnTi À cells. Protein was purified using NiNTA affinity chromatography. The D12 Fab was prepared using the Pierce Mouse IgG1 Fab kit. The RBD molecule was mixed with the D12 Fab in a 1:1.5 molar ratio and was allowed to sit for 30 min at room temperature. All proteins were purified using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200) and concentrated to B5-8 mg ml À 1 . Crystallization screening was carried out using a Mosquito crystallization robot, using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method at 20 o C by mixing 0.1 ml of protein complex with 0.1 ml of reservoir solution followed by manual optimization. RBD England1 crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 10% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 29% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1,500. Crystal form 1 of the D12 Fab:RBD England1 complex was grown in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, 50 mM sodium chloride, 10% PEG 400 and 11% PEG 8,000. Both crystals were cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen using mother liquor containing 20-22% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Crystal form 2 of D12 Fab:RBD England1 was grown in 0.1 M sodium Cacodylate pH 6.5, 80 mM magnesium acetate, 14.5% PEG 8,000 using 15% 2R-3R butanediol as a cryoprotectant. Data were collected at a wavelength of 1.00 Å at SER-CAT beamlines ID-22 and BM-22 (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). All diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 suite 46 , structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER 47 and iterative model building and refinement were performed in COOT 48 and BUSTER-TNT 49 A cross-validation test set using 5% of the data was used to assess the model refinement process with structure model validation carried out using MolProbity 52, 53 . The RBD England1 model was refined to a final R factor value of 22.1% and R free value of 25%. The D12: RBD England1 crystal form 1 gave a structure model with a final Rfactor value of 18.5% and Rfree value of 24.8%. The D12: RBD England1 crystal form 2 gave a structure model with a final Rfactor of 22.5% and Rfree value of 26.7%. All structures had 99% residues in the favoured region of the Ramachandran plot. MERS-CoV mAb escape mutations. WHO-Vero or Vero81 cells (Vero) were provided by Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 7% FBS, supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B. MERS-CoV EMC strain generated from an infectious clone (from Ralph Baric 54 ) was propagated and assessed using plaque assay on Vero cells. All cell and virus incubations were at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . All viral studies were performed in certified BSL3 laboratories and exclusively within biological safety cabinets using protocols for safe study, maintenance and transfer that have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees of the Vanderbilt University. Plaque reduction neutralization assay. Starting at a concentration of 10 mg ml À 1 , mAbs were serially diluted fivefold and mixed with an equal amount of virus for a total of six times. Virus-mAb mixtures were incubated at 37 o C for 30 min, and then 200 ml of each mixture was used to inoculate Vero cell monolayers in six-well plates in duplicate. Following 1-h incubation, cells were overlaid with complete media plus 1% agar. Plaques were visualized and counted between 48 and 52 h post infection. Amount of infectious virus in the presence of each mAb concentration was calculated and graphed. Passage for antibody escape. mAb was added to each 25-cm 2 flask of Vero cells in 3 ml DMEM containing 3.5% serum, followed by MERS-CoV at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1 p.f.u. ml À 1 . Two days later, mAb and 10 ml of the supernatant from the previous infection was added to new flasks of Vero cells. Three separate lineages were carried in parallel, with increasing amounts of mAb at each passage. Following the fifth passage, the supernatant was removed, aliquoted and frozen, and then thawed and titred using plaque assay in the presence and absence of mAb. Ten plaques from wells with mAb from each lineage were picked, and then used to inoculate a 25-cm 2 flask for 2 days. The supernatant was removed, aliquoted and frozen. Cells were lysed using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and frozen. Sanger (dideoxy) sequence analysis of the Spike glycoprotein. Total cellular RNA was extracted from lysates infected with mAb-resistant plaque clones and then subjected to RT-PCR, and the MERS-CoV Spike gene was amplified in two overlapping amplicons using primers 5 0 -CCTCATCTGAAGGATTCC-3 0 ; 5 0 -AAT CATTGTCCTGCTGGC-3 0 ; 5 0 -CACCAATAGTGTTTGCCC-3 0 ; 5 0 -CATACCAGG TTTTGGAGG-3 0 ; 5 0 -GATGGTCCTACCGAACAT-3 0 ; 5 0 -TATACGCAGAGCT ATAGACT-3 0 . Each amplicon was sequenced to give complete gene coverage. The resulting sequences were assembled and compared with the expected, theoretical sequence for MERS-CoV Spike. Statistical analysis. We calculated GMT and 95% confidence intervals for all antibody titres. The means and s.e.'s were calculated for all other data. P values were calculated with a two-tailed, unpaired, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test using the Prism software (Version 6.04, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Statistically significant differences met a threshold (a) of 0.05. Statistical variation within each data set is represented as the standard error in each of the figures. Pearson correlation coefficients and associated P values were calculated using the Prism software. Variances were generally similar to justify the use of nonparametric statistical tests.
