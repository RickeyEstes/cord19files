Inspirotec Samplers and accompanying electrode cartridges were provided by Inspirotec LLC (Glenview, IL). A commercial air cleaner was modified to achieve a unidirectional flow. The disposable capture cartridges were designed to optimize capture of aerosol particles and for easy release into extraction tubes. They were made by 3D printing at Exact Prototyping, Joliet, IL, and stainless steel electrode strips by Lakeshore Cutting Solutions, Zeeland, MI. Electrodes were finished by Able Electropolishing, Chicago, IL. Cartridges were washed with 70 % isopropanol and air dried, and electrodes were washed with isopropanol and dried in a vacuum oven for 30 min at 180°C. Assembled cartridges and electrodes were heatsealed into polyethylene bags until use. Once the electrodes have been released, they cannot be re-used. There is no potentially non-sterile surface that physically contacts the electrodes between removal from the bag and release into the collection tube. An updated version of the Inspirotec Sampler has a block of honeycomb-structured MnO 2 catalyst covering the outlet. This modification removes traces of ozone from the effluent air but does not affect performance. Samplers and cartridges can be purchased by sending an email to the senior author with heading "research request." The sampler will have a lower cost than any alternative system. Flow rates were measured with a hot wire anemometer by averaging measured flow velocities across the width of a duct placed over the outlet [45] . Individual samplers' flow rates varied by 130 ± 13 lpm. Capture efficiency (determined by AlburtyLabs, Inc., Drexel, MO) as judged by capture of 1 μm Fluoresbrite® YG carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) in a controlled environment chamber, compared with capture by a reference sampler consisting of a 0.22-μM polycarbonate filter, was (23 ± 5)% based on 16 determinations. Fluorescence of captured microspheres was with a Turner Quantech fluorometer. The reference samplers were run at 14 lpm. Thus, the capture efficiency is more than compensated by the higher volumes of air sampled. Following their standard isolation procedure, captured mold spores were determined by qPCR for the 23 most common mold species by EMLab P&K, Marlton, NJ. Primers and probes and amplification conditions used are in [41] . Electrodes were released into 15 ml Falcon tubes and shipped overnight for analysis. They were extracted by vortex mixing intermittently over 10 min with 0.05 % Tween 20, and spores were centrifuged down and extracted by bead-beating [46] . Results were computed as spore equivalents [46] [47] [48] [49] . These publications show that standard deviations of spore equivalent counts may be ±1 log or more. Amplicon sequencing: each cartridge holds two electrodes. Left and right electrodes were processed separately, and so were effective duplicates. Individual electrodes were placed into sterile 15-ml conical tubes with 1 ml of sterile water. Samples were extracted for 1 min on a Vortex Genie (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Their standard PowerSoil extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol with the addition of a 20-min incubation at 65°C after addition of solution C1, as suggested by the Earth Microbiome Project. Genomic DNA was amplified using the Earth Microbiome Project barcoded primer set, adapted for MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) by adding nine extra bases in the adapter region of the forward amplification primer that support paired-end sequencing. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (515F-806R) was amplified with region-specific primers that included the Illumina flow cell adapter sequences. The reverse amplification primer also contained a 12-base barcode sequence that supports pooling of up to 2167 different samples in each lane. Each 25-μl PCR reaction contains 12 μl of MO BIO PCR water (certified DNA-free), 10 μl of 5 Prime HotMasterMix (5 μM concentration), 1 μl of forward primer (5 μM concentration, 200 pM final), 1 μl Golay barcode-tagged reverse primer (5 μM concentration, 200 pM final), and 1 μl of template DNA. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 94°C for 3 min to denature the DNA, with 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 60s, and 72°C for 90s; and with a final extension of 10 min at 72°C to ensure complete amplification. PCR amplifications were completed in triplicate and then pooled. Following pooling, amplicons were quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader. Once quantified, different volumes of each of the products were pooled into a single tube so that each amplicon was represented equally. This pool was then cleaned using the UltraClean® PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO) and quantified using Qubit (Invitrogen). Sequencing of the prepared library was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform, using the sequencing primers and procedures described in the supplementary methods of Caporaso et al. [50] . For the atomic force microscopy, a sampler was run for 6 days in the clean bathroom location of Table 1 . It was examined with atomic force microscopy with a Bruker dimension Icon system which has the capability of providing sub-nanometer resolution. Imaging was done in tapping mode with super sharp silicon probes. Results were analyzed with the Bruker analysis software.
