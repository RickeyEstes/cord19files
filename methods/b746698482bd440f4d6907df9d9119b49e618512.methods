Authorization from WHO and the ethical committee of Urmia University of Medical Sciences authorities was obtained. By census method, data related to laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases between September 23, 2012, and November 11, 2016, were extracted from the Disease Outbreak News on MERS-CoV section of the WHO website. From September 23, 2012, to November 11, 2016, the occurrence of 1,879 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 659 deaths, was reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Points of 27 countries in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, the United States of America, and Asia. Due to the small number of cases in 2012 (n=9), to avoid random bias, we merged 2012 occurred cases with 2013. Details for 1,094 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS, including 421 related deaths, were recorded in the disease outbreak news section of the WHO website for this time. Extracted data comprised demographic information, such as age, gender, nationality; and country of origin; clinical data on the year of morbidity, day/month of the onset of symptom; day/month of admission to the hospital and ICU or negative pressure isolation room; potentially hazardous contacts, including background of contact with morbid cases at home or hospital and health care facilities 1-14 days prior to the onset of symptoms and background of direct or indirect contact with a camel; and consumption of raw camel products. Other probable risk factors included travel history, initial or secondary case, and comorbidity. The authors would like to confirm that all data of MERS-CoV cases retrieved on the WHO website were anonymous or de-identified.
