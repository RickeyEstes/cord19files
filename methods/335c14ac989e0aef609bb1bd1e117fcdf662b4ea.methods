High-touch environmental surfaces were sampled once a day, from November 12-26, 2016, in the same highly used classroom of a university in Florida. Samplings were performed between classroom sessions or on weekends, when students were not present in the classroom, typically between 6-7 PM. The classroom's hightouch surfaces were cleaned Monday through Friday between 6-7 AM with a commercial cleaning solution consisting of nonionic surfactant (alcohol ethoxylates) mixed with an anionic surfactant (sodium xylene sulfonate) by janitorial staff. Surfaces chosen for sampling in this study were (1) seat-backs made of hard polyvinylchloride, (2) laminate desktops, (3) a wooden podium, and (4) a stainless steel doorknob. Swab samples were collected using flocked nylon swabs that were inserted into 1 mL of Universal Transport Medium (no. 360C; Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). 3 Virus isolation was attempted in monolayers of 6 ATCC (Manassas, VA) cell lines: A549 (CCL-185), MDCK (NBL-2) (CCL-34), HeLa (CCL-2), LLC-MK2 (CCL-7), VERO E6 (CRL-1586), and MRC-5 (CCL-171). 4 Replicate sets of cells were inoculated with 50 μL aliquots from the Universal Transport Medium tubes, with one set incubated at 33°C and the other at 37°C (some human respiratory viruses preferentially grow at 33°C, others at 37°C), and observed over 21 days for development of virus-specific cytopathic effects. Nucleic acids extracted from the spent cell growth media were subsequently analyzed using a GenMark multiplex PCR eSensor XT-8 Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) for virus identification. One human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E) isolate was thereafter completely sequenced essentially as described by Farsani et al. 5 Separately, the stability of a well-studied CoV-229E strain (VR-740; ATCC) was assessed on 3 different hard surfaces held at 24°C and 50% relative humidity with fluorescent lights on for 14 h/d (simulating the university classroom ambient light, temperature, and humidity conditions). Briefly, 20 μL aliquots (3 replicates per day, over a 7-day testing period) containing 2 × 10 4 plaque forming units of virus were spotted and spread over the surface of sterile 1 cm 2 hard plastic, glass, and stainless steel coupons. Virus survival was monitored, with viable counts of viruses extruded off the different surfaces determined by plaque assay.
