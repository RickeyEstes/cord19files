Subjects. We enrolled and retrospectively analyzed data from 3938 children who were admitted to the Cheil General Hospital and Women's Healthcare Center at the Dankook University College of Medicine for various respiratory tract infections between March, 2011, and February, 2014. This study design and the use of patient information stored in the hospital database were approved by the Institutional Review Board and the research ethics committee of Cheil General Hospital and Women's Health Care Center. We were given an exemption from the requirement for informed consent because our study was retrospective, personal identifiers were completely removed, and the data were analyzed anonymously. Our study was conducted according to the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Laboratory and radiologic investigations. Clinical data such as age, sex, and duration of hospitalization were collected. Laboratory data acquired at admission included complete blood cell counts, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and tCO 2 ), renal function testing (BUN and creatinine), and liver function testing (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase). Follow-up electrolyte examinations were carried out in cases with abnormal electrolytes at admission. A chest X-ray was performed in all patients and was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist. Definitions. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium concentration (Na + ) <135 mEq/L. Serum sodium levels were analyzed using a blood test on admission. The patients were classified into 5 disease categories according to their symptoms and chest X-ray findings. 1. Upper respiratory tract infection: It is defined as an acute infection which involves the upper respiratory tract including the nose, sinuses, pharynx or larynx. We defined upper respiratory infection as diseases including nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold but the chest X-ray showed normal findings 34 . 2. Acute bronchiolitis: The diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis is typically made by clinical examination 35 . The bronchiolitis is blockage of the small airway in the lungs due to a viral infection It usually only occurs in children less than two years of age 36 . We defined acute bronchiolitis as a disease in which an infant under two years of age develops cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath over one or two days and the chest X-ray showed peribronchial thickening with or without hyperaeration. 3. Acute bronchitis: Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs. Symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort 37 . We defined bronchitis as when patients have symptoms of bronchitis and the chest X-ray signs having bronchial wall thickening with increased bronchovascular markings, enlarged vessels without parenchymal lung infection. 4. Interstitial pneumonia: the chest X-ray showed involvement of the areas between the alveoli. Interstitial pneumonia involves the areas in between the alveoli. 5. Segmental or lobar pneumonia: It was defined when the chest X-ray showed the involvement of a single lobe or segment of the lung.
