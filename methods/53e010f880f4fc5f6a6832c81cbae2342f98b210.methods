The Richards model is logistic and is described by a single differential equation. The equation is given below, where I(t) is the cumulative number of infected cases at time t in days: (1) The solution is: During initial stages of the outbreak, when I(t) is small compared to K, the growth rate r is approximated by or roughly the number of cases on day t over the cumulative case number through that day. We can show mathematically that t i is the only inflection point (or turning point denoting deceleration after acceleration) of the epidemic curve obtained from this model. Moreover, t m = t i + (lna)/r is equal to the inflection point t i when a = 1 and approximates t i when a is close to 1 The model parameters are as follows: K is the carrying capacity or total case number, r is the per capita growth rate of the infected population, and a is the exponent of deviation from the standard logistic curve. Because the Richards model typically exhibits a single S-shaped curve, it is not suitable for the SARS epidemic in Canada illustrated in Figure 1 . To rectify this situation, we proposed a multistage Richards model, 1 stage for each of the S-shaped segments resulting from multiple waves of infection during this outbreak. Stages are distinguished by turning points (or inflection points), denoting acceleration after deceleration at the end of each S-shaped segment, the local minima of the corresponding incidence curves. For an n-phase epidemic outbreak, n -1 local minima separate the n phases. For illustration, the incidence curve for Toronto given in Figure  2 contains 2 peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and 1 valley (local minimum or turning point of second type). The multistage Richards model procedure requires 5 steps. First, fit the Richards model to cumulative cases on successive days by using a standard least-square routine. For single-phase outbreaks, parameter estimates (a, r, t i , K) will converge as the trajectory approaches carrying capacity K, as demonstrated in the Taiwan and Hong Kong SARS outbreaks (7, 9) . Second, if estimated parameters remain convergent until no more new cases are detected, the outbreak has only 1 phase. However, if the estimates begin to diverge from heretofore fixed values, one knows that a turning point denoting the start of a second phase has occurred. Third, locate the turning point, t min , separating 2 S-shaped phases of the epidemic as the local minimum of the incidence curve ( Figure 2 ). This is the curve for Sâ€²(t) given in the equation (1) . Fourth, fit the Richards model to the cumulative case curve again, but starting from t min + 1, the day after the start of second phase. The estimated parameters (a, r, t i , K) will again converge as the curve approaches the carrying capacity K for the second phase. Finally, repeat steps 2-4 in the event more phases occur until the outbreak ends. By considering successive S-shaped segments of the epidemic curve separately, one can estimate the maximum case number, K, and locate the turning points, thus providing an estimate for the cumulative number of cases during each phase.
