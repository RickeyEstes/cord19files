The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of RSV among ILI episodes. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI in the study population and occurrence of coinfection of RSV with other respiratory viruses in ILI were also estimated. Samples were obtained from an efficacy trial of 2 pandemic influenza H1N1 vaccines (NCT01051661 sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.) [9] .
