We conducted a year-long exploratory study of fever syndrome among patients ! 1 year if age, presenting to clinical settings with an axillary temperature of !37.5ËšC and symptomatic onset of 5 days. Blood and naso-pharyngeal/oral-pharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected and analyzed, respectively, using AFI and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) for multi-pathogen detection of 57 potential causative agents. Furthermore, we examined numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness, and conducted demographic, clinical, and behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression to statistically establish associations with agent detection.
