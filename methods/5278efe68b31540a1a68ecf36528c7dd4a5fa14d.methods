Names of ribosomal proteins. Throughout the manuscript we used a short version of the Uniprot entries for ribosomal proteins. Although the nomenclature for ribosomal proteins suggested by Ban et al. 61 has been adopted in most recent structural studies, the frequent use of database searching in Uniprot in this manuscript prevented us from using this naming system. Purification of ribosomal particles. E. coli 70S ribosomes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Chloroplastic 70S ribosomes were purified as previously described in detail by Bieri et al. 14 . In brief, chloroplasts were extracted from fresh leaves of spinach (S. oleracea) and lysed by gentle stirring in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, 2 mM spermidine, 0.05 mM spermine, 2% (w/v) Triton X-100). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (25,350 × g, 30 min, 4°C) using a Beckman Type 45Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The supernatant was loaded onto 50% (w/v) sucrose cushion and centrifuged (101,390 × g, 15 h, 4°C) using a Beckman Type 45Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The ribosome pellets were dissolved in monosome buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 25 mM MgOAc 2 , 2 mM DTT, 2 mM spermidine, 0.05 mM spermine), layered onto 10-40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged (51,610 × g, 15 h, 4°C) using a Beckman Type SW-32Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The fractions containing the chloroplastic 70S ribosomes were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units with 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (Merck Millipore). Aliquots of the So70S sample were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped for MS analysis by a dry shipper (Taylor-Wharton). Human 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits were purified similarly to previously described protocols to isolate human 80S ribosomes 37 and human 40S ribosomal subunits 62 . In brief,~8.5 × 10 9 frozen HEK293-6E cells (Yves Durocher, Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada, 6100 Royalmount Avenue, Montreal, QC, Canada, H4P 2R2) were thawed and lysed by gentle stirring in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgAc 2 , 0.5% (w/v) NP-40, 5 µM E-64, 20 µM Leupeptin, 20 µM Bestatin, 5 µM Pepstatin A, 1 mM PMSF, and 2 mM DTT). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (45,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C) using a SS-34 rotor (Sorvall). The supernatant was loaded onto 60% (w/v) sucrose cushion and centrifuged (257,000 × g, 20 h, 4°C) using a Beckman Type 70Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The ribosome pellets were dissolved in resuspension buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 6 mM MgAc 2 , 2 mM DTT), layered onto 12-48% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared with dissociation buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, 6 mM MgAc 2 , 2 mM DTT) and centrifuged (78,000 × g, 18.5 h, 4°C) using a Beckman Type SW-32Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter). The bands containing the human 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits were extracted using a syringe and the fractions from several gradients were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units with 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (Merck Millipore). Aliquots of the Hs40S and Hs60S ribosome samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped for MS analysis by a dry shipper (Taylor-Wharton). Purification of IRES RNA sequences. The CrPV IRES RNA and the HCV IRES RNA were obtained similarly as previously described by Quade et al. 37 . In brief, the IRES RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription of a linearized plasmid containing the CrPV IRES and HCV IRES sequence, respectively, followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The IRES RNAs were extracted from the gel and the urea containing buffer was exchanged to water using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (Merck Millipore). Aliquots of the IRES RNA samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped for MS analysis by a dry shipper (Taylor-Wharton). Sample preparation for bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis. Hs40S, Hs60S, and So70S ribosome preparations were reduced with 5 mM DTT at 56°C for 30 min and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The excess of iodoacetamide was quenched by adding 5 mM DTT. Digestion of intact proteins was performed at 37°C with Lys-C for 4 h followed by overnight digestion with trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein-ratio of 1:100 (w/w). All proteolytic NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04853-x ARTICLE digests were desalted, dried and dissolved in 40 µL of 0.1% FA prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis. Separation of digested protein samples was performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn. Germany). Samples were loaded on a 100 µm × 20 mm trap column (in-house packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 3 µm) (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) coupled to a 50 µm × 500 mm analytical column (in-house packed with Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7 µm) (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). A 2 µL sample of peptides was used, corresponding to~0.1 µg of material. The LC-MS/MS run time was set to 60 min with flow rate of 300 nL/min. Mobile phases A (water/0.1% formic acid) and B (80% ACN/0.1% formic acid) were used for 45 min gradient elution: 13-40% B for 35 min, and 40 to 100% B over 3 min. Samples were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive™ HF quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument. Nano-electrospray ionization was achieved using a coated fused silica emitter (New Objective, Cambridge, MA) biased to 2 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode and the spectra were acquired in the data-dependent acquisition mode. Full MS scans were acquired with 60,000 resolution (at 200 m/z) and at a scan mass range of 375 to 1600 m/z. 63 . Briefly, to vigorously shaken ribosomal particles, magnesium acetate was added to around 100 mM. Immediately afterwards 2 volumes of glacial acetic acid were added. This solution was left shaking at 4°C for 60 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was moved to a new vial and the pellet was washed with 66% glacial acetic acid containing 100 mM magnesium acetate. After repeating the centrifuge step the two supernatants were combined and the buffer was exchanged to buffer A (0.1% v/v formic acid in water). Top down LC-MS/MS analysis. Chromatographic separation of intact protein samples was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system equipped with MAbPac RP 2.1 mm × 50 mm column. Around 0.5-5 µg of material was loaded on the column heated to 80°C. LC-MS/MS runtime was set to 40 or 70 min with flow rate of 250 µL/min. Gradient elution was performed using mobile phases A (water/0.1% formic acid) and B (ACN/0.1% formic acid): 10-50% B for 30 or 60 min, and 50-80% B over additional 4 min. All top-down MS experiments were performed on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X instrument 27 . The instrument provides an array of new features facilitating top-down analysis of complex samples. Among them, Advanced Peak Detection (APD) algorithms, that allow for on-the-fly deconvolution of monoisotopic or average masses with improved charge detection. Along with extended charge state range (up to z = 100+) for calculation of optimum HCD collision energy, APD provides more efficient peak picking and fragmentation of highly charged ions of intact proteins. Improved ion optics at the front-end of the instrument results in a brighter ion source as compared with other instruments of the Q Exactive series, which provides means for less sample loads. Additionally, transmission of higher molecular weight ions (i.e., intact proteins) is improved through modified electronics and gas regime in the back-end of the instrument. LC-MS/MS data were collected with instruments set to the Intact Protein Mode. For analysis of intact proteins two primary methods were employed, Medium-High and High-High. The former method implies switching of resolution parameter from 7500 (at 200 m/z) for full MS scan to 120,000 (at 200 m/z) for dd-MS/MS. The High-High approach defines the resolution parameter at 120,000 (at 200 m/z) for both full MS and dd-MS/MS. Full MS scans in both methods were acquired for the range of 400-2000 m/z with AGC target set to 3e6. Maximum of injection time was defined at 250 ms with 5 µscans recorded in High-High approach and at 50 ms with 10 µscans-in Medium-High. Data-dependent strategy was focused on the three most intense proteoforms defined in full MS scan by APD algorithms. Shortly, masses corresponding to charge states of the same proteoform were deconvoluted with only the single most intense charge state selected for isolation/fragmentation in dd-MS/MS and all other charge states excluded from candidate list for user-defined exclusion time, which was optimized for each sample individually. Selected ions were isolated with 2 Th window. Collision energy applied in dd-MS/MS was normalized for the m/z and charge state of selected ion with final setting of 30-35%. All the dd-MS/MS scans were recorded at the mass range of 200-2000 m/z with AGC target set to 3e6 and maximum of injection time defined at 250 ms. A total of 5 µscans was recorded per scan. Preparation of IRES bound human 40S ribosomal particles. Folding of IRES RNA fragments and formation of complexes with Hs40S ribosomal particles was performed according to Quade et al. 37 . Briefly, IRES RNA fragments of hepatitis C virus and cricket paralysis virus were diluted to 5 µM in folding buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate and 250 µM spermidine) and folded by two cycles of heating to 95°C and cooling on ice for 1 min each. Human 40S ribosomal particles were buffer exchange into binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM DTT) through two cycles of concentration and dilution using a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifuge filter. Hs40S particles were mixed with a two-fold molar access of IRES RNA in binding buffer and incubated for 5 min at 37°C and stored on ice for further use. Preparation of ribosomes and IRES RNA for native MS. Hs40S, Hs40S-IRES, and So30S particles were prepared for native mass spectrometry by buffer exchanging into native MS buffer using cycles of concentration and dilution with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifuge filter. For Hs40S particles, 1 M ammonium acetate pH 7.6 with 0.5 mM magnesium acetate was used. For So30S and Hs40S-IRES particles, 150 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.6 with 0.5 mM magnesium acetate was used. Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer at a concentration of 100 nM after dilution with native MS buffer which contained 25 mM triethylammonium acetate pH 7.6 for the Hs40S and Hs40S-IRES particles. Folded IRES RNA fragments were buffer exchanged to 150 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.6 using a 6 kDa Bio-Rad micro Bio-Spin column and introduced into the mass spectrometer at a concentration of 0.5 µM. Native MS analysis using a QE-UHMR mass spectrometer. Samples were introduced into the Q Exactive mass spectrometer with Ultra High Mass Range detection capability (QE-UHMR) mass spectrometer with gold-coated borosilicate capillaries prepared in house 26, 44 . The following mass spectrometer settings were typically used. Capillary voltage: 1350 V in positive ion mode. Collision gas: Xenon. Automatic gain control (AGC) mode: Fixed. Noise level parameter: 2. Ion transfer optics (injection flatapole, inter-flatapole lens, bent flatapole, transfer multipole and C-trap entrance lens) and voltage gradients throughout the instrument were tuned for every analyte specifically. Instrument calibration was performed using cesium iodide clusters up to 11,000 m/z. For Hs40S and Hs40S-IRES complexes, HCD voltage was between 250 and 300 V. For IRES-RNA fragments, HCD voltage was between 80 and 120 V. For the detection of stalk complexes of So70S ribosomes, the in-source-trapping activation voltage was optimized for maximal release and transmission of the stalks without fragmenting them further. Spectra were viewed in Xcalibur QualBrowser software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Masses were determined manually by minimization of the error over the charge-state envelope from different charge-state assignments. Additionally, raw native mass spectra of Hs40S, Ec30S, and So30S subunits were deconvoluted with UniDec 64 in order to obtain zero-charged mass distributions. The theoretical mass of the Hs40S particle was calculated by extracting the protein sequences from UniProtKB database (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) and the rRNA sequences from NCBI. Data analysis for bottom-up LC-MS/MS. Raw LC-MS/MS data were interpreted with the Byonic software suite (Protein Metrics Inc.) 65 . The following parameters were used for data searches: precursor ion mass tolerance, 10 ppm; product ion mass tolerance, 20 ppm; fixed modification: Cys carbamidomethyl; variable modification: Met oxidation. Enzymatic specificity was set to trypsin. Searches were made against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human and spinach proteome sequence databases. Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values were obtained with MaxQuant software (version 1.5.6.0) 66 . Database generation for top-down LC-MS/MS analysis. Database searching for top-down LC-MS/MS analysis of Ec70S, Hs40S and Hs60S was performed using the Escherichia coli (strain K12) and Human XML format proteomes from UniProtKB. Database searching for So70S ribosomal proteins was performed using a custom database assembled by combining sequences from Spinacia oleracea in UniProtKB and the BvSeq resource (http://bvseq.molgen.mpg.de). The sequences were combined in FASTA format without processing of the transit peptides. Databases imported from XML format files in ProsightPC (Ec70S, Hs40S, and Hs60S) were treated as follows. Initiator methionine removal and N-terminal acetylation was allowed as well as other PTMs, up to 13 features or 70 kDa of features in mass per sequence. For Spinacia oleracea databases, no PTMs or other modifications were included in the search space. Data analysis for top-down LC-MS/MS. Isotopically resolved and unresolved spectra obtained in top-down LC-MS/MS experiments of intact ribosomal proteins were deconvoluted using Xtract 67 or ReSpect algorithms (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), respectively. Automatic searches were made in Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.2.0.388) with use of ProSightPD nodes for Medium-High and High-High experimental workflows. Parameters for Medium-High method were set as follows. ReSpect parameters: precursor m/z tolerance-0.2 Th; relative abundance threshold-10%; precursor mass range-5-100 kDa; precursor mass tolerance-30 ppm; charge state range-5-100. Xtract parameters: signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold-3; m/z range-200-2000 Th. Absolute mass search parameters: precursor mass tolerance-500 Da; fragment mass tolerance-10 ppm. In order to detect sequence variants in the So70S sample, the precursor tolerance window was initially extended up to 5 kDa. For High-High searches ReSpect parameters were not defined, instead Xtract with identical parameters was used to deconvolute spectra in both full MS and dd-MS/MS scans. For validation of novel PTMs, HCD-MS/MS scans of the same proteoform were manually combined and fragments were assigned using in-house built fragment matching software. Intensities of assigned fragments were z-scored, where mean intensity was subtracted from each fragment's intensity and resulting value was divided by standard deviation of the population. The same approach was employed to characterize ribosomal proteins not detected with automated database searches. Data visualization was conducted in R extended with ggplot2 package 68 . For proteoform overview plots, monoisotopic or average masses of proteins were extracted from the precursor mass lists in automated database searches and matched with deconvoluted mass lists from MS only LC-MS experiments (with a mass tolerance window of 1 Da). Mass differences, observed mass-backbone mass (derived from UniProt sequences), were used to represent proteoforms of ribosomal proteins. Proteoform intensity was normalized on sum of proteoform intensities for each protein. False discovery rates in top-down LC-MS/MS database searches. In order to estimate false discovery rates (FDR) in Ec70S, Hs40S, and Hs60S ribosomal particles, parallel searches were performed against both normal and shuffled proteome databases of E. coli (strain K12) and Homo sapiens, respectively. For So70S a normal and shuffled customized database including 77 proteoforms was used. In the cases of Ec70S and Hs40S ribosomal particles there were no protein spectral matches (PrSMs) observed when searched against reshuffled databases. For Hs60S and So70S there were 4 and 2 false-positive PrSMs detected against reshuffled databases, respectively. Further analysis showed the false discovery rate to be below 0.25% ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Data availability.
