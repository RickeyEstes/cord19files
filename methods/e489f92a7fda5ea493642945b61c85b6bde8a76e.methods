Care for patients with viral respiratory infections was observed at an acute care hospital (465 beds) from March 2017 to June 2017 and from September 2017 to April 2018. Eligibility, recruitment, and consent of HCWs and patient participants have been described elsewhere [10] . Patients having viral respiratory infections were identified through the hospital MedMined surveillance system. Patients were eligible to participate if they were adults, fluent in English or Spanish, and had a positive respiratory pathogen panel test within 3 days prior to the day of observation. Eligible patient participants were recruited in the patient room and provided written informed consent and authorization to use and disclose health information for the study. This study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board (protocol number 2015-0990). Researchers performed observations inside the patient room during a 3-hour period, typically from 8 am to 12 pm. One trained observer recorded contacts with fomites in the environment and self-contacts of the HCW participant while another observer recorded fomite contacts by the patient participant during the encounter using predefined checklists (Supplementary Materials). Observations included only encounters by consented HCWs, and did not include visitor encounters or short interactions between HCWs and patients such as food delivery/tray removal. In addition, we did not observe patient contact with the environment when a HCW was not present or when patients were in the bathroom to respect patient privacy. If >1 HCW was in the room at the same time, only the contacts of 1 consented HCW were recorded. A contact was defined as any contact made by a gloved or bare hand with a fomite. For example, 1 bedrail contact and 1 patient contact were counted if the HCW touched the patient then moved his/her hand to the bed rail. However, 1 patient contact was counted if the HCW touched the patient multiple times without moving hands to another fomite in between patient contacts. Herein we focus on (1) fomite contacts by HCWs; (2) fomite contacts by patients; and (3) self-contacts by HCWs. Fomite contacts were summarized based on the proximity to the patient. Fomites in the near-patient zone included bed surface, bed rail, call button, chair, phone, tray table, and bedside table. Fomites in the far-patient zone included light switch, room door, curtain, computer station, trash can, intravenous (IV) pole, IV monitor, isolation stethoscope, sink, toilet, sharps container, vitals machine, blood pressure cuff, medication scanner, blood glucose monitor, thermometer, pulse oximeter, and respiratory supplies. Self-contact locations by HCWs included mask (if used), head area other than mask, torso, hand, lower body, and personal stethoscope (if used). We did not include the personal stethoscope contact in the total self-contact count because not all HCWs used a personal stethoscope during the patient encounters. We grouped observations by HCW job roles: (1) provider, including attending physicians, resident physicians, nurse practitioners, and medical students (n = 41); (2) nurse, including nurses and nursing students (n = 69); (3) nurse technicians (n = 37); (4) respiratory therapists (n = 9); and (5) others, including physical therapists, environmental service workers, and dieticians (n = 8). Observations were performed across 9 units in the hospital, organized into 4 groups: (1) intensive care units (ICU) including the neurological ICU, medical ICU, and the step-down unit (n = 35); (2) clinical decision unit (CDU) (n = 51); (3) non-ICUs including the rehabilitation/orthopedics unit, general medical-surgical unit, and liver/gastroenterology unit (n = 48); and (4) specialty units including the bone marrow transplant and hematology-oncology units (n = 30). We have described data management for this study elsewhere [10] . All data analysis was performed with the R Project for Statistical Computing (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). The maximum likelihood method was used to fit the log-normal, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions to the number of fomite contacts using the function gofstat of package "fitdistrplus, " and the best-fit distribution was selected using the Akaike information criterion [11] . Differences of contacts among groups were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis test (KW), followed by pairwise Wilcoxon test (W) to compare 2 groups, with P values adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Observations of HCWs were treated as independent because the small number of HCWs who participated repeatedly performed different care activities and the number of replicates was small. To evaluate the potential effect of different observers, total environmental fomite contacts and self-contacts by HCWs were compared between observers using the KW test.
