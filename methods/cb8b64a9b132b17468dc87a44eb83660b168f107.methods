A bacteriophage tracer FX174 was used to mimic fomite-tofomite transmission of human viruses on EMS vehicles and equipment during real-time emergency calls. Bacteriophage FX174 is a coliphage DNA virus that only infects the K-12 strain of Escherichia coli. 8 The inability of the tracer to infect human cells is important because it was used during actual EMS calls and patients were of unknown immune status. The University of Arizona Office for Human Research Protections, which oversees the institutional review board, approved the study as exempt. This study was conducted within a fire station of the Northwest Fire District in Tucson, Arizona, using both engines and rescue trucks. Researchers accompanied firefighters on EMS calls prior to design of the study and recorded behavioral observations to select high frequency touch surfaces for subsequent bacteriophage seeding and to select postcall surfaces to sample.
