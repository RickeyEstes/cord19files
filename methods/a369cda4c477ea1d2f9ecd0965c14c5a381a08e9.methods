The paper aims to investigate the impact of severity of epidemic diseases on the performance of immunization algorithms in networks with different structures. To achieve this goal, we simulate the SIR model with different transmission rates in various real and model immunized networks (see Table 2 ) and measure the number of infected individuals. The settings of SIR model and datasets are elaborated in the following subsections.
