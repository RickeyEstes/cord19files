A survey ( Table 2 ) was carried out, using a questionnaire, among the PD patients and control groups regarding the frequency of colds or fever requiring bed rest, in the preand post-onset period of PD or CVD. The results were analyzed statistically using unpaired t-tests. The normal control group was asked about the conditions during the pre-and post-onset period of PD in their spouses.
