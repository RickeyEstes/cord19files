The full prediction pipeline of the DeepTracer includes many different steps. In this section we will look at the major ones and explain how they create a protein structure based of a density map. We begin by looking at the 3D U-Net which predicts confidence maps that show where e.g. atoms might be or where which secondary structure is likely to be present. Next, we will examine how the DeepTracer uses this information to place the actual amino acids, as well as how it connects them into chains to form the protein structure. Finally, we discuss how secondary structure information can be used to refine predicted Î±-helices.
