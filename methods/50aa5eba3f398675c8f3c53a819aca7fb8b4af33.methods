The data in this study were synthesized using Scopus database which has many important features that facilitate bibliometric analysis as in previous similar studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Such features include citation analysis, country and author contribution as well as source titles and productivity per year. Scopus is produced by Elsevier and covers more than 20,000 journals that have 100 % Medline coverage. Scopus is larger than Web of Science and more accurate than Google Scholar [16] . The study period was set from January 01, 1994 to December 31, 2014. All subject areas in Scopus search engine (life sciences, social sciences, health and physical sciences) were chosen. The date for the study was set up to 2014 because data for 2015 and 2016 are not yet complete in Scopus since some journal may require 1-2 years to transfer its content to databases. Therefore, inclusion of 2015 and 2016 will create some inaccuracy problems. The search strategy in this article was based on retrieving articles with the keyword probiotics in title-abstract-key and keywords relevant to the term "pediatrics" in article title or keywords. All articles with the keyword "adult" were excluded. To increase the accuracy of our search, documents classified as errata, or books, or book chapter or un-defined type of documents were excluded and therefore this study is restricted to documents that are considered journal articles. All documents obtained after refining the results were transferred to Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 20 to present the bibliometric indicators. The validity of our method was assessed by assessing the top 300 (~10 % of the results) cited documents retrieved by the method mentioned above to assure that the content of these retrieved articles matches the search query of interest. The main bibliometric indicators presented in this study included type and language of the published documents, country and institutional affiliation, source/ journal title in which documents were published, most productive authors, most cited articles, and collaboration patterns. Many of the bibliometric indicators were presented in rank order. Research productivity was assessed by the quantity of publications while the total number of citations was used to identify the most influential articles in the field [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The impact factor (IF) of journals was used as a measure of quality of journals and was obtained from Thompson Reuters [23] . The Hirsch index (h-index) was used to assess the quantity and quality of publications per country or per institution or per author [24] . The research productivity of different countries was normalized using population size and national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) retrieved from the online databases of the World Bank [25] . Bibliometric maps and network visualization methods were made using VOSviewer software [26] . Using the VOSviewer and thresholds of minimally ten fractionally counted articles for each term, density visualization maps were generated for most frequently encountered terms in title of retrieved articles. In these maps, most frequent terms had dense colored cluster. For co-authorship analysis, a minimum number of 500 authors were selected in VOSviewer program. Authors located within or close to a large cluster are believed to have higher number of coauthors suggestive of inter and intra country collaboration. The methodology used in this study was similar to recent bibliometric studies published by the same research group using SciVerse Scopus [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . All data and documents were extracted and analyzed on 12 th of April, 2016. Since the data for this study was obtained from electronic sources that are publicly available and not pertaining to specific patients' data or profile, IRB ethical approval for the study was not required.
