We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO registry: CRD42014007617) to identify published reports describing general emergency care delivered to an undifferentiated patient population in all 139 LMICs. For each LMIC, we searched PubMed, CINAHL, and all World Health Organization (WHO) regional indices using ''[country name] + emerg * " as the search term. We performed a similar search on Google Scholar, but limited the search to within article titles given the large number of results. We also manually screened select non-indexed journals known to frequently publish research on emergency care. Reference lists of all studies included were further screened manually. Results were screened by title and abstract, and selected for inclusion if they described facility-based emergency care provided to all patients, regardless of disease category or chief complaint. Articles published after 1989 in all languages were included provided an English or French abstract was available. We excluded studies focussed only on specific emergent conditions (e.g., stroke only), subsets of the general emergency patient population (e.g., women only), or data aggregated from multiple departments or facilities, unless they provided general emergency facility statistics or data on the burden of diseases. We evaluated the reporting frequency of data elements commonly found in published emergency care literature originating from LMICs. We created a database that continually expanded with new data fields as the systematic review progressed and new reported metrics were encountered. At the conclusion of the review, we selected publications that provided comprehensive descriptions of their facilities and patients, and used them as models to structure our recommendations for future research. At the conclusion of our review, we presented our findings at the African Federation of Emergency Medicine consensus conferences, Addis Ababa 2014 and Cape Town 2015. Small group discussion amongst attendees provided invaluable insight into some of the local determinants and limitations to data collection and publication in certain settings. We incorporated lessons learnt from the group discussions on how to improve data standards into our recommendations. We highlight specific information to be recorded and reported by individual emergency facilities, to enable reliable inter-facility data comparisons and expose areas for improvement in specific locales. Fig. 3 presents the proportion of these publications that reported the data elements of interest.
