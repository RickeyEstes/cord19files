Ten isolates of SARS coronavirus from 10 different SARS patients who satisfied the revised WHO criteria for SARS are listed in Table 1 . The drugs used for antiviral susceptibility specialists to draw up a "technical scheme (tentative) for the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) using traditional Chinese medicine". In the scheme, a recipe "Qing Fei Jie Du Tang" (soup for clearing the lung and detoxification) was recommended which consists of Huang Qi (Astragalus membranaceus) 15 gm, Chai Hu (Bupleurum chinense) 10 gm, Ma Huang (Ephedra sinica) 5 gm, Xing Ren (Prunus armeniaca) 10 gm, Sheng She Gao (Plaster Stone) 30 gm, Sheng Yi Ren (Coix lacryma-jobi) 15 gm, Gua Wei Pi (Benincasa hispida) 15 gm, Jie Geng (Platycodon grandiflorum) 9 gm, Bo He (Mentha haplocalyx) 6 gm, Huang Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis) 10 gm, Sheng Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) 5 gm, Jin Yin Hua (Flos lonicerae) 15 gm, and Qing Hao (Artemisia apiacea) 15 gm. Among them, only Scutellaria baicalensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Flos lonicerae and Artemisia apiacea have their pure chemically defined ingredients being extracted, purified and documented to have antimicrobial activities. Consequently, the main bioactive compounds, namely, baicalin (derived from Scutellaria baicalensis), glycyrrhizin (from Glycyrrhiza uralensis), chlorogenic acid (from Flos lonicerae) and artesunate (from Artemisia apiacea) were investigated in the present study. The pharmacological properties of baicalin, glycyrrhizin, and chlorogenic acid are summarized in Table 2 . Artesunate is not included in this table since it is already well known as an anti-malarial drug in Western Medicine (Price, 2000) . They were extracted as we have previously reported (Lu et al., 2003) . The concentrations of baicalin, glycyrrhizin, No glycyrrhizin in plasma is found after oral administration of 100 mg glycyrrhizin in healthy persons, presumably glycyrrhizin is metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid by intestinal bacteria which contain ␤-d-glucuronidase or the amount consumed is too little Only traces expected (1000 mg per person, in human); this may be due also to that the amount consumed is much lower than that for animals Standard doses in oral administration in humans ∼1500 mg baicalin (as tablets); also can be up to ∼6000 mg baicalin (calculated from herb, assuming 30 g herb used; the herb may contain up to 20% as baicalin) ∼300 mg glycyrrhizin (as tablets) or ∼1700 mg glycyrrhizin (calculated from the herb assuming that the herb contains 5.65% glycyrrhizin) ∼2220 mg (calculated from the herb assuming that the herb contains 7.4% chlorogenic acid) Serum level (after intravenous administration) chlorogenic acid, and lopinavir in the cell culture system were also monitored by HPLC (Lu et al., 2003) whereas the concentration of others were monitored by neutralization assays with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Indiana strain and a laboratory strain of Influenza A H1N1.The procedures used for in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing are as follows. Initial screening of all compounds against the prototype SARS coronavirus strain no. 39849 was performed in 96-well microtitre plates seeded with foetal rhesus kidney-4 cells. Two-fold dilutions of antiviral agents starting from more than four times the peak serum concentration after the maximum therapeutic dose to less than one-quarter of the trough serum concentration were tested in quadruplicate against 100 TCID 50 of SARS coronavirus. A corresponding set of cell controls with drug but without virus inoculation was used as controls for drug toxicity. The cells were scored for the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 and 72 h. Those compounds with demonstrable in vitro inhibitory activity were re-assayed against the other nine strains of SARS coronavirus collected from different patients from different hospitals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Their antiviral activities were also compared in both foetal rhesus kidney-4 (fRHK-4) and Vero-E6 cell lines. Those likely to have clinically significant inhibitory activity were tested by the plaque reduction assay. For selected agents with consistent activity in the plaque reduction assay, checkerboard assays for synergy were per-formed for combinations of interferons and ribavirin using the same neutralization test in 96 well microtiter plates seeded with Vero cell line. Cells were not incubated with the interferons before viral inoculation. Vero cells were used instead of Vero E6 and fRhK-4 cell lines because better antiviral effect can be demonstrated in Vero but less so in the other two cell lines for ribavirin and the interferons.
