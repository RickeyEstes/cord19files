Participants were enrolled at four sites, Riley Hospital for Children (Indianapolis, USA); St. Louis Children's Hospital (St. Louis, USA); Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (Perth, Australia); and Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, Australia). Study approval was obtained from the regulatory boards at each institution. Written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to enrollment. All participants were identified through newborn screening and enrolled by 4 months of age. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of CF based on sweat chloride levels > 60 mEq/L or two pathogenic cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) variants. Exclusion criteria included the inability to successfully or safely perform study visits. Study visits were scheduled at 1 to 3-month intervals, coordinating with routine clinic appointments. A history and physical examination were performed at visits. Parents were contacted weekly via telephone to assess for new respiratory symptoms using a standardized questionnaire (Online supplement). Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were obtained at research clinic visits, and when participants were symptomatic, the parents collected a nasopharyngeal swab at home (FLOQSwabs TM and UTM TM Viral Transport Media, COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). Parents were trained in collection techniques by research personnel in clinic (Online supplement). Viral analysis was performed at the Special Projects Laboratory at Washington University. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the GenMark eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics Inc. Carlsbad, CA). Infant pulmonary function testing (PFT) was performed in a subset of infants using the raised volume technique coupled with plethysmography [ 14 , 15 ] . Bronchoscopy with lavage was performed on a different day, < 4 weeks apart as per protocol. If bronchoscopy was performed for pulmonary symptoms during that time frame, the research protocol for BAL fluid collection was followed. Inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α, IL-1 β, and IL-8, were analyzed using commercially available sandwich enzyme immunoassays according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Functional activity of NE was measured using a specific peptide chromogenic substrate (Elastin Products, Owensville, MO). The urea dilution method was used to determine cell counts and cytokine concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) [ 16 ] . For our analyses, classical CF pathogens were defined as: Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and -sensitive (MSSA) Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Clinical treatment decisions were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools [ 17 ] hosted at the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.
