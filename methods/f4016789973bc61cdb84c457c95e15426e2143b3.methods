This retrospective study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. The local electronic database containing all patient diagnoses and discharge summaries of our rheumatologic outpatient clinic and the affiliated hospitals of the Department of internal medicine were searched for a combination of the terms of the rheumatologic/vasculitic/ connective tissue disease and pneumonia or pneumonitis. Each episode of a positive hit was reviewed. Severity of current immunosuppressive treatment was scored 0-4 as follows: 0 = no immunosuppressive medication; 1 = lowdose: (prednisone â‰¤ 10 mg/d) or (azulfidine/chloroquine); 2 = intermediate: (prednisone 20-40 mg/d) or (prednisone 10 mg/d+methotrexate) or (prednisone 10 mg/d+leflunomide) or (cyclosporine) or (pred-nisone+mycophenolate mofetil) or (prednisone 20 mg/ d+azathioprine); 3 = strong: (prednisone 40 mg/d+methotrexate) or (prednisone 20 mg/d+methotrexate+anakinra) or (prednisone 20 mg/ d+methotrexate+leflunomide) or (prednisone 20 mg/ d+etanercept) or (prednisone 40 mg/d+azathioprine) or (lower dose prednisone+azathioprine+leukopenia); 4 = maximal: (prednisone 60 mg/d+cyclophosphamide) or (prednisone 100 mg/d). At the time of in-hospital treatment the patients were diagnosed and treated by current standards of clinical practice and were not part of a prospective clinical trial regarding the treatment of pneumonia or pneumonitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was performed when deemed appropriate. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with each bronchoscopic examination and material was subsequently centrifuged, fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using hematin-eosin. Standard microscopic examination was performed. BAL fluids were also subjected to viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when deemed appropriate that always consisted of testing for HSV-1 and CMV (cytomegaly virus). In selected positive cases immunohistochemistry of BAL for HSV-1 was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against HSV-1 (DAKO Laboratories, Denmark). Bronchoscopic biopsies were performed when deemed appropriate and processed using standard protocols. Microbiologic and serologic diagnostics were performed using standard protocols. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad, La Jolla, CA).
