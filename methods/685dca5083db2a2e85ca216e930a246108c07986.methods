All animal procedures were approved by and conducted according to the guidelines of the Utah State University Animal Care and Use Committee. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. Oocyte collection. Ovaries from domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) were obtained from a local abattoir (Springville, UT, USA) and transported to the laboratory within 4 hours after collection. The ovaries were transported at 20-27 °C in saline containing 100 U/mL penicillin/ streptomycin. On arrival at the laboratory, the ovaries were processed using a slicing technique as previously described 18 . Only oocytes with three or more layers of compact cumulus cells and homogeneous cytoplasm were used. In vitro maturation. In vitro maturation was performed as previously published by our group 18 10 μg/mL LH, 5 μg/mL FSH, 1 μg/mL estradiol-17β, and 0.05 g/L gentamicin. After 22 hours of culture, cumulus cells were removed from matured oocytes by vertexing the COCs for 1-2 min in TL-Hepes containing 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase. Nuclear maturation was confirmed by the presence of a first polar body. Oocytes at this stage are termed MII oocytes.
