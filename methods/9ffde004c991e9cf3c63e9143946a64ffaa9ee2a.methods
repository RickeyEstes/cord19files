Agent lists were collected from various sources as described in more detail for each Additional File below. Government agency lists (Additional Files 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10) were taken directly from the specified agencies, while additional tables were compiled using cited literature. Organism names from all lists were converted to NCBI species names. This included changes from species synonyms to NCBI-accepted nomenclature and expansion from Genus to Genus species (e.g. Shigella to Shigella dysenteriae or Shigella sonnei) to represent the most important species (when known). Where possible, disease names were associated with the name of the most predominant organism that causes the disease. The Additional Files contain taxonomic information, the NCBI name of the agent and any well-known synonyms, and accession numbers for the complete genome of each agent (if available). Names of the infectious agents listed in the Additional Files were placed in tree-structure drawings shown in the figures that display the biological relatedness of the organisms. Cellular life forms were organized according to currently accepted phylogenetic relationships. Bacterial phylogeny (Figure 2 ) is based on work by Hugenholtz et al. [69] . The eukaryotic phylogeny tree (Figure 3 ) is based on ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequence analysis [70] . The branching order presented in Figure 3 should be considered tentative as the on-going recognition of additional protist lineages is likely to alter the topology of the eukaryotic tree in the near future [71] . The phylogeny of DNA viruses (Figure 4 ) was derived primarily from the work of Iyer, Aravind & Koonin [72] . The common origin of RNA viruses and their tentative relationships ( Figures  5,6,7) is based on an extensive analysis of their RNAdependent RNA-or DNA-polymerase (manuscript in preparation). The RNA virus phylogenetic trees were created using maximum parsimony on protein sequences. The branching of double-stranded RNA viruses is for now left unresolved in light of their apparent polyphyly [73] . The symbol key is shown in Figure 1 and symbols are used in the other figures to link the pathogens in the figures to Additional Files. The agents listed in Additional File 1 [see Additional File 1] were taken from a list maintained by the WHO. The WHO tracks the occurrence of morbidity and mortality of global infectious diseases. Because of the great disparity in infectious disease prevalence between developed and developing nations, the WHO divides the world into demographically developed nations (including the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and nations of the former Soviet Union) and demographically developing nations (including India, China, other Asian nations, Pacific island nations, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East) [3] . The WHO lists leading causes of death worldwide by disease categories. The disease can be caused by multiple diverse organisms or co-infections of different organisms, as is the case for acute respiratory disease, or by specific organisms, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or tuberculosis. In the former case, we identified the most prominent organisms responsible for the disease for display in Additional File 1. The CDC-notifiable-disease list represents those diseases that offer the greatest threat to public health in the United States. Additional File 2 [see Additional File 2] lists the agents on this list. There are no set criteria for inclusion on the notifiable disease list; rather, the list is created by the CDC in cooperation with state health departments. As diseases occur less frequently and new diseases emerge, the notifiable disease list changes. An up-to-date version of the list can be found online on the CDC website [74] . The online list provides links to case definitions of each disease, including the etiological agent(s) responsible. In cases where the etiological agent was not listed or was unspecific (i.e. Brucella species), further research was done to determine an etiological agent and literature used is cited in legend for Additional File 2. The most common causative agents of food-and waterborne illness were taken from a publication by Tauxe [75] and are listed in Additional File 3 [see Additional File 3] . Hub√°lek [20] published a list that constitutes a representative subset of emerging infectious diseases, which was used as the basis for Additional File 4 [see Additional File 4] . The complete list of all species classified as emerging is substantial [18, 76] . The number of pathogens listed in the emerging disease table at http://www.microbialrosettas tone.com/ is significantly larger than that found in Additional File 4.
