Mice. Female C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. (Beijing, China). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facilities at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using protocols approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. Cloning, expression, and purification of fusion proteins. The full-length SpyCatcher expression plasmid pDEST14-SpyCatcher was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Howarth (University of Oxford, UK). DNA sequences of truncated forms of SpyCatcher were first amplified by PCR using the following primers: common forward primer DSc-F1 (GATTACGACATCCCAACGACCGAAAACCTGTAT-TTTCAGGGCGATAGTGCTAC) and reverse primers DSc-R1 (CGCGGA-TCCTTAAT TAACTGTAAAGGTAATAGCAGTTGCT, for SpyCatcherDN) and DSc-R2 (CGCGGATCCTTAAATATGAGCGTCACCTTTAGTTGCTTT, for SpyCatcherDNC). A 63-histidine tag coding sequence was further added by secondary PCR using DSc-F2 (GGAATTCCATATGTCGTACTACCATCACC ATCACCATCACGATTACGACATCCCAA) and DSc-R1 or DSc-R2. The bold font indicates an NdeI or BamHI site. The underlined letters encode a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site or 63-histidine tag. The PCR products were cloned into pDEST14 using the NdeI and BamHI sites. For protein expression, BL21(DE3) competent E. coli cells were transformed with respective plasmids, and single colonies were picked and cultured in 5 ml LB at 37uC overnight. The cultures were then amplified to 400 ml and induced by 1 mM IPTG for 6 h. The bacterial cultures were harvested and lysed, and the targeting proteins were purified using a Ni-NTA agarose column (ComWin Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To generate a SpyCatcherDN-OVA 8 -TBEV ED3 expression plasmid, cDNA encoding TBEV ED3 was PCR amplified with the plasmid pET-30a(1)-TBEV ED3, provided by Dr. Xiaoping Kang (Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China), and G 4 S linker and the OVA 8 epitope (chicken ovalbumin 257-264 , or SIINFEKL) were added at the N-terminus during PCR. The primers used in the PCR were as follows: OE F (CCGCTCGAGGGCGGTG-GTGGCAGCCAGCTTGAGAGTATAATCAACTTTGAAAAAC TGACTG-AATGGACATAC ACAATGTGCG) and OE R (CCGCGAGCTCTTATCA TTTTTGGAACCATTG), in which the bold font indicates an XhoI or SacI site. The SpyCatcherDN fragment was amplified using the primers DNSc-F (GCAATTCCATATGTC GTACTACCATCAC) and DNSc-R (CCGCTCGAGAATATGAGCGTCACCTTTA G), in which the bold font indicates an NdeI or XhoI site. The SpyCatcherDN and OVA 8 -TBEV ED3 fragments were then ligated and cloned into pDEST14 at the NdeI and SacI sites. Expression and purification of the SpyCatcherDN-OVA 8 -TBEV ED3 protein were performed as described above. A plasmid encoding the DNA sequence of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-DEC205 (clone NLDC145) was kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Steinman (The Rockefeller University, USA). The single chain-encoding DNA was PCR amplified using the following primers: DEC205 F, GCG CGTACGGAGG-TGAAGCTGTTGGAATC and DEC205 R, GCGTTCGAACCGTTT CAATT-CCAGCTTGG. The DNA was then cloned into the pEE12.4 expression plasmid (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) between the IgGk leading sequence and the human IgG Fc sequence using BsiWI and BstBI (bold font). The SpyTag-encoding sequence (GCTCACATCGTGATGGTGGACGCCTACAAGCCCACCAAG) and a GSGESG linker (GGATCCGGCGAGTCCGGC) were then genetically fused to the C-terminus of the human IgG Fc fragment by PCR to construct the final plasmid pEE12.4 aDEC205-SpyTag. Figure 6 | Perspective on protein assembly-based synthetic vaccine R&D. During the R&D of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases, especially in the era of big data, many functional units (such as immune molecules) and antigens are available for screening and optimization. The conventional way (left) of making synthetic vaccines usually completely depends on de novo construction, and each combination has to be made individually, which is time consuming and costly. By taking advantage of a protein assembly-based method (right), each vaccine component can be prepared and then simply assembled into a full vaccine, as needed. This procedure could be easier, faster, more flexible and more efficient. Ag, antigen. For the in vivo assay, na誰ve WT C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the tail base with 200 pmol of the aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 adduct, aDEC205-SpyTag or isotype-control antibody. After 20 h, inguinal DLNs were collected and digested to form a single-cell suspension. The cells were stained with an anti-FccR mAb, followed by PE-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody staining before flow cytometry analysis. ELISA. Microtiter plates (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) were coated with 2 mg/ml (100 ml/well) full-length SpyCatcher or TBEV ED3 protein in carbonate buffer at 0.1 M (pH 9.5) overnight at 4uC. After washing away the unbound proteins, the plates were incubated with PBS containing 5% FBS at 37uC for 1.5 h. Serially diluted serum samples from immunized mice were added and incubated at 37uC for 1.5 h. HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG was used as the detection antibody (Zhong Shan-Golden Bridge Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). The plates were visualized by adding 100 ml TMB (eBioscience) and were read at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Intracellular cytokine staining assay. Na誰ve WT C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously immunized twice with 30 pmol of aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 or Sc-OVA 8 -ED3, along with 30 mg CpG1826 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Beijing, China) and 30 mg Poly I:C (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) as an adjuvant, at a 7-day interval. Five days after the secondary vaccination, the spleens of the immunized mice were harvested and processed into single-cell suspensions. Splenocytes (1 3 10 6 cells/well in triplicate) were restimulated in U-bottom 96-well plates with 5 mg/ml OT1 peptide (SIINFEKL) (ChinaPeptides, Suzhou, China) for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin A (5 mg/ml) at 37uC with 5% CO 2 . After restimulation, the cells were first surface stained with APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a antibody (53-6.7) before fixation/ permeabilization and intracellular staining for IFNc (XMG1.2). All of the reagents and antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, and the manufacturer's protocol was followed for the surface and intracellular staining. In vivo cytotoxicity assay. Na誰ve WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 30 pmol of aDEC205-Sc-OVA 8 -ED3 or Sc-OVA 8 -ED3, along with CpG1826 and Poly I:C as an adjuvant, as described above. Five days after the secondary vaccination, the immunized mice were injected intravenously with the peptide-pulsed target cells for in vivo killing. Briefly, congenic na誰ve splenocytes (2 3 10 7 cells/ml) were pulsed with 10 mg/ml OT1 peptide for 1.5 h at 37uC. After one wash in PBS, the cells were labeled with 5 mM CFSE (CFSE high ) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 10 min, after which 20% FBS was immediately added to terminate the labeling reaction. The cells were then washed twice in PBS before use. Meanwhile, unpulsed splenocytes were labeled with 0.5 mM CFSE (CFSE low ) following the same procedure. A 151 mixture of CFSE high and CFSE low cells (2.5 3 10 6 cells from each population) was co-transferred to the immunized mice. Twenty hours later, the spleens were harvested, and single-cell suspensions were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of specific killing was evaluated with the following formula: % specific killing 5 1 2 % survival, in which % survival 5 (the number of OT1-pulsed target cells remaining)/(the number of un-pulsed target cells remaining). Protein structure and immunogenicity analysis. BepiPred Linear Epitope Prediction was used for immunogenicity analysis 32 , and the crystal structure data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank were used for structural analysis. Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed t test and GraphPad Prism statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). A value of P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*, P , 0.05; **, P , 0.01; and ***, P , 0.001).
