This was an open-label, multicentre, observational study in patients receiving teicoplanin for suspected or diagnosed Grampositive infection. Data collection included demographics, method of administration, loading and maintenance doses, creatinine and adverse events. Trough and peak concentrations were determined 15 minutes prior to drug administration and 60 minutes after. Serum was separated and stored at -20°C until analysis. Levels were determined with an Abbott TDx ® /FLx ® analyzer and Seradyn Teicoplanin Innofluor assay kits. Seradyn internal teicoplanin controls were run within and between each batch. Mean trough and peak plasma levels were calculated for 4 days of therapy. Results Seventy-four patients with complete records were analyzed and whilst all patients received an 800 mg loading dose on day 1, 40 received 400 mg twice daily thereafter (BD group) and 34 once daily (OD group), for nosocomial pneumonia (n = 14), skin and soft tissue infection (burn and nonburn including diabetic foot) (n = 13), bacteraemia (n = 10), intra-abdominal infection (n = 8), bone and joint infection (n = 6) and as pre-emptive therapy for severe trauma (n = 13). In the OD group, mean trough levels remained at 9.64 µg/ml from days 2 to 4 and peak levels remained at a mean of 24.84 µg/ml. In the BD group, mean trough levels increased by 5.65 µg/ml/24 hours to 21.8 µg/ml by day 4; the mean peak level increased by 5.06 µg/ml/24 hours to 43.89 µg/ml by day 4. Conclusion Higher trough levels of glycopeptides (15-20 µg/ml) are targeted to improve efficacy and reduce resistance development. In the OD group the conventional target of 10 µg/ml was achieved, whilst in the BD arm 20 µg/ml was exceeded for 60% of the time by day 2 and 100% by day 4. BD dosing is recommended for most patients with severe infections, particularly those that are critically ill. No premature discontinuations or adverse events were reported during the study. In vitro experiments included static and dynamic evaluations of resin binding. Whole human blood was stimulated with endotoxin for 4 hours at 37°C; or with the addition of added cytokines or toxins for evaluation. For static conditions, 4 ml plasma with 1 ml resin were incubated for up to 10 hours. Aliquots were withdrawn between 0 and 10 hours and cytokine inflammatory mediator and toxin adsorption were determined with standard ELISAs, multianalyte protein arrays, HPLC and diode array adsorption spectroscopy. Dynamic conditions involved defining the optimal linear velocity and evaluating the adsorption capacity under flow conditions. These experiments used a closed circuit consisting of a plasma filter and resin cartridge. Samples were taken from a blood port and immediately before and after the plasma cartridge. In addition, serum, pre-cartridge and postcartridge plasma samples were also taken from septic patients undergoing CPFA. Results Endotoxin-stimulated blood or samples from septic patients had high levels of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The resin used in the CPFA adsorptive cartridge showed higher than 80% adsorption under both static and dynamic conditions for: IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α and MIP-1β, TNFα, MCP, myoglobin. IL-6 appeared to be particularly adsorbed by the cartridge. Severe septic patients had great variability and often very high levels of IL-6 ranging from normal levels (50 pg/ml) up to 12,300 pg/ml. The mean of 10 patients treated before CPFA was 1,775 ± 3757 pg/ml, while postsession IL-6 was 995 ± 2178 pg/ml. The plasma levels before the cartridge ranged from 12 pg/ml to 1,750 pg/ml, while postcartridge levels were below the level of detection. Conclusions The resin in CPFA has a high adsorption capacity for several cytokines and mediators involved in severe sepsis and septic shock. Studies are currently ongoing to correlate cytokine reduction with clinically relevant improvements in these patients. Methods Twenty-four patients with septic shock induced by peritonitis underwent laparotomy for drainage. Endocannabinoid absorption with PMX-DHP was examined in two groups of patients: patients in whom systolic arterial BP had increased more than 20 mmHg (BP elevation group; n = 12) and patients in whom BP did not increase or had increased no more than 20 mmHg (BP constant group; n = 12). Results Levels of AEA did not change after PMX-DHP in the either the BP constant group or the BP elevation group, whereas levels of 2-AG decreased significantly after PMX-DHP in the BP elevation group but not in the BP constant group (Figure 1 ). F2-isoprostane gradually increased after PMX-DHP. On the other hand, levels of F2isoprostane remained constant in the BP elevation group (Figure 2 ). The system was designed to track a desired end-tidal CO 2 pressure (PaCO 2 ), to find a PEEP leading to maximum estimated respiratory system compliance and to maintain the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) at an optimal level. We developed a program in LabView (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) on a laptop that is able to read the internal data of a ventilator (Evita 4; Dräger Medical, Germany) in real time. Respiratory signals (for example, SaO 2 ) are acquired from monitoring. Discrete measurements (for example, PaO 2 ) are either assumed constant until next measurement or are interpolated using a model-based approach evaluating, for example, the etCO 2 data. The course of etCO 2 following the setting of optimal frequency was evaluated to calculate the time required for equilibration of etCO 2 . Results A module automating the initial settings of the ventilator according to local ICU rules is realized. Modules were added that optimize breathing frequency with respect to PaCO 2 /etCO 2 and FiO 2 according to SO 2 whenever no PaO 2 is available. A lung simulator (Michigan Instruments Inc., Grand Rapids, MI, USA) connected with the LS4000 (Dräger Medical) was used to evaluate the system. Exemplary results are presented in the figures, which show the minute volume/etCO 2 relationship ( Figure 1 ) and a parametric fit of etCO 2 data ( Figure 2 ). The adjustment of the frequency is based on the current etCO 2 model. Conclusion Automation is a 'sine qua non' to achieve optimal patient individualized ventilation support. Our system is enabled to evaluate a therapeutic strategy and to base the settings of the ventilator on current trends/drifts observed in the data. Results A multistep optimization process is performed to reduce the difference between measured data and model prediction. At any moment during a tidal breath or during some respiratory maneuver the current state of the model can be visualized. The inflated volume splits up into extension of open alveoli and into temporal or pressure-dependent recruitment. Distribution of these compartments over time during a tidal inflation is depicted in Figure 1a . The pressure vs time and flow vs time curves are shown in Figure 1b . Conclusion The fitting of recruitment models provides interesting insight into not directly observable R/D. It may be used for monitoring trends and drifts in recruitment. Currently results rely on certain assumptions; for example, distribution and quantity of superimposed pressure. With modern imaging techniques (for example, CT, EIT) a validation of the fitted models will come into reach and will be performed as a next step. Introduction Results FRC increase in group A is statistically significant (W) (step 1: 1,525 ± 360 ml; step 2: 1,937 ± 583 ml, P < 0.05 vs step 1; step 3: 2,592 ± 659 ml, P < 0.05 vs step 2 and P < 0.01 vs step 1) while the FRC increase in group B is not significant (step 1: 1,697 ± 210 ml; step 2: 1,757 ± 367 ml; step 3: 1,982 ± 365 ml); the FRC of group A is statistically higher than the FRC of group B in step 2 (P < 0.05 MW) and in step 3 (P < 0.01 MW). The ratio increase in group A is statistically significant (W) (step 1: 256 ± 133; step 2: 407 ± 187, P < 0.01 vs step 1; step 3: 379 ± 169, P < 0.05 vs step 1) while the ratio increase in group B is not significant (step 1: 194 ± 50; step 2: 253 ± 83; step 3: 276 ± 73); the ratio of group A is statistically higher than the ratio of group B in step 2 (P < 0.01 MW) and in step 3 (P < 0.05 MW). The C stat increase in both groups is not significant, but in group A C stat is statistically higher than C stat of group B in every step (P < 0.05 MW) (step 1: 38 ± 2 ml/cmH 2 O for group A vs 28 ± 7 ml/cmH 2 O for group B; step 2: 44 ± 6 ml/cmH 2 O vs 36 ± 8 ml/cmH 2 O; step 3: 47 ± 5 ml/cmH 2 O vs 36 ± 8 ml/cmH 2 O). Conclusion With the limit of low sample size, these preliminary data suggest that the FRC evaluation system is a good parameter to optimize pulmonary recruitment and seems to be in a position to overcome the C stat limit for the evaluation of pulmonary recruitable parenchyma. Introduction The purpose of this study is to report our clinical experience with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) for rescuing trauma patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia despite optimal conventional ventilation. Experimental and clinical data suggest mechanical ventilation can contribute to mortality in ARDS, and modern ventilatory strategies require protective measures such as low tidal volume, low airway pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ), which is not always possible with conventional ventilation. HFOV could be an alternative to achieve protective ventilation and adequate oxygenation. Methods We retrospectively analyzed nine trauma patients who presented with ARDS criteria and failed conventional mechanical ventilation requiring HFOV. The mean airway pressure was initially set 3-5 cmH 2 O higher than that for conventional ventilation and was subsequently adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation >90% and FiO 2 <0.6. The PaCO 2 target range was 35-60 mmHg with a pH >7.25. We collected demographic data, injury severity scale (ISS), APACHE II score, time to HFOV, time spent on HFOV, ventilation settings and arterial blood gas before and after HFOV and mortality. Results Fifteen out of the total 28 patients were R and 13 were NR. Both the groups were similar prior to HFOV in terms of APACHE II score, number of organ failures, PEEP and plateau pressures, and duration of ventilation before HFOV. The baseline PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and improvement in it at 6 hours and 24 hours in the R group were statistically significantly higher as compared with Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/11/S2 The classic SLICE method [1] determines parameters of the respiratory system for abutted volume ranges. The Gliding-SLICE method enhances this method by moving a window of analysis along the volume axis. This way, a quasi-continual course of intratidal mechanics can be determined. To test the new method we build up a physical model that consists of two connected chambers filled with water. During inspiration water is displaced from one chamber to the other resulting in a counter pressure. Using wedges of certain shapes we simulated volume-dependent nonlinear compliances. Results Using the Gliding-SLICE method we determined a nonlinear course of compliance in a patient ( Figure 1 ) and in model data ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion The Gliding-SLICE method allows one to calculate mechanical parameters of the respiratory system quasi-continually. This allows a more intuitive interpretation of data. The method is not limited to principle constrictions but can be enhanced by ventilatory maneuvers; for example, for separated view on inspiratory and expiratory respiratory mechanics. S85 decrease after PEEP was reduced from 15 to 5 cmH 2 O but decreased after PEEP was reduced from 5 to 0 cmH 2 O. Conclusion Accurate measurements of FRC are obtained during a constant breathing pattern that is easier to obtain during controlled ventilation in comparison with pressure-support ventilation. In patients with ALI/ARDS, the FRC decreased during each PEEP reduction, but whether the largest change in FRC indicates the optimal PEEP needs further research. Methods The percentage of V non (%V non ) relative to the total lung volume was quantified in CT-image series (n = 21) of sheep with gross anesthesia-induced atelectasis. This was performed for different combinations of number and anatomical location of CT slices and the results were compared with the %V non of the entire lung (lung). The combinations were: one juxtadiaphragmatic slice (juxta), three apical, hiliar and juxtadiaphragmatic slices (3old), and three consecutive juxtadiaphragmatic slices (3new). The correlation between %V non and the arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2 ) was examined for all combinations. The PaO 2 was measured at the time of the CT and transformed logarithmically (lnPaO 2 ) to linearize the relation between PaO 2 and %V non . Linear regression and Bland-Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. The following biochemical and physicochemical parameters were investigated: total protein concentration (Biuret assay) and albumin antigen (nephelometry); quantitative analysis of contaminating proteins by nephelometry, levels of polymers and fragments by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6, the binding affinity of exogenous ligands for Sudlow's site I (warfarin) or site II (dansylsarcosine) by steady-state spectrofluorimetry, the reactivity of Cys34 with Ellman's reagent, and the esterase-like activity using p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate by spectrophotometry. Results All pharmaceutical-grade products show a purity ranging from 95% to 108%. The main contaminant proteins are prealbumin, transferrin, α-1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobulin, and retinol-binding protein. All of them are in conformity with the European Pharmacopeia specifications. The warfarin-binding capacity of the 10 albumin preparations was studied. An average binding constant of 2.6 (±0.3) x 10 5 M -1 (n = 1) was found. The presence of stabilisers reduced the binding of dansylsarcosine significantly (by 27-40%). The esterase-like activity toward pnitrophenyl acetate and the reactivity of Cys34 differed from product to product. Interesting is the absence of free Cys34 in the recombinant albumin. Conclusion Significant differences were observed between the 10 different human albumin preparations, recombinant or not. We confirm that the presence of stabilisers such as tryptophan derivatives significantly reduces the binding capacity of Sudlow's site II. Two important physiological properties of albumin, the esterase-like and antioxidant activities, were also found to be modified to different extents in all pharmaceutical-grade products in comparison with the albumin without stabiliser. The benefits of albumin administration should be considered carefully, taking into account the different functions and properties of albumin. Aims and methods A clinical scenario was used to assess current knowledge among medical staff regarding i.v. fluid therapy. 'An 85year-old lady is brought into A&E semiconscious. Temperature 32°C, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg and BM 6.5 mmol/l. Arterial blood gases (ABG) on room air: pH 7.12 pO 2 10.8 kPa, pCO 2 2.6 kPa, HCO 3 -12 mmol/l, O 2 saturation 94% and base excess -19'. Medical staff were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the case under supervised conditions. Results Eighty-seven questionnaires were completed by seven SpR/consultants, 48 F2/senior house officers, 13 F1 and 19 finalyear medical students. ABG interpretation was correct in 80/87 (92%). Only 52/87 (59.8%) could calculate the anion gap and only 1/87 listed fluid as a cause of a metabolic acidosis. Eighty-three staff (93.4%) knew that a metabolic acidosis caused an increased respiratory rate. Normal saline was the first-choice fluid for resuscitation in almost 60% (52/87) cases. The chloride concentration of normal saline was known by 12/87 staff (13.8%). The serum chloride concentration was known by 28/87 staff (32%). Conclusion The majority of medical staff prescribe normal saline as their first-choice intravenous fluid. Many medical staff are unaware of the electrolyte composition of normal saline, the phenomenon of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, or how to differentiate hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis from lactic acidosis by calculating the anion gap. A good understanding of fluid therapy is important for all medical staff. Introduction Postoperative outcomes may be improved if cardiac output and oxygen delivery are maintained at optimal levels. Trials of the use of dopexamine for this purpose have yielded inconsistent results. This may relate to the use of high doses in some trials. A meta-analysis of data from these trials may therefore identify a benefit of low-dose dopexamine on postoperative mortality and length of stay. Methods A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify published randomised trials of perioperative dopexamine infusion in patients undergoing major surgery. Individual patient S129 data were obtained, allowing a meta-regression approach to explore mortality outcomes after correction for age and dose of dopexamine. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to examine the length of stay. Results Five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Low-dose dopexamine (≤1 µg/kg/min) was associated with a 49% reduction in 28-day mortality (6.3% vs 12.3%; OR = 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.89), P = 0.008). The length of postoperative stay was also reduced in the low-dose dopexamine group compared with control (median 13 vs 15 days, HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.88), P = 0.004). High-dose dopexamine (>1 µg/kg/min) was not associated with a difference in mortality (14.5% vs 12.3%; OR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.67-2.08), P = 0.37) or length of stay (median 17 vs 15 days, HR 1.10 (95% CI 0.90-1.34), P = 0.37) when compared with controls. Conclusions Perioperative use of low-dose dopexamine decreases mortality and duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing major surgery. The blood pressure waveform carries information about the cardiac contraction and the impedance characteristics of the vascular bed. Here, we demonstrate that the start of isovolumic ventricular contraction is persistently reflected as an inflection point in the pressure wave as recorded in the aortic root (TPIC) as well as in the carotid artery distension waveform (TDIC) as it travels down the arterial tree. In a group of six patients with normal pressure gradients across the aortic valve after valve replacement, the TPIC had a small delay with respect to the onset of isovolumic ventricular contraction (<10 ms). In a group (n = 21) of young, presumably healthy, volunteers, the inflection point occurred persistently in the carotid distension waveform, as recorded by means of ultrasound, before the systolic foot (intersubject delay between inflection point and systolic foot: mean ± SD = 40.0 ± 9.4 ms, intrasubject SD 4.6 ms). Retrograde coronary blood flow during isovolumic ventricular contraction may be the origin of the persistent end-diastolic pressure and distension perturbation. This study shows that the duration of the isovolumic contraction can be reliably extracted from the carotid artery distension waveform. We conducted a prospective observational review of 100 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU. We collected data relating to daily maximum organ dysfunction scores. Outcome was defined in terms of length of ICU stay and ICU mortality.
