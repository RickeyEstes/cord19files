Viruses and cells. IAV strain A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2), was obtained from the French national influenza monitoring network GROG (Groupes Régionaux d'Observation de la Grippe, Lyon, France). Virus was cultivated and titered in MDCK cells and stored at − 80 °C, as previously described 60 . MDCK cells were purchased from Lonza (ATCC, CCL34) and were passaged twice weekly in serum-free Ultra-MDCK medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma Aldrich), penicillin (225 units/ml) and streptomycin (225 μ g/ml) (Lonza). Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were cultivated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Lonza, Biowhittaker) supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μ g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Dutscher). All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For infection, viruses were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hpi to 24 hpi, in DMEM supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μ g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.5 μ g/ml TPCK-trypsin (Roche diagnostics), as previously described 17 . For viral kinetics on A549 cells, confluent cells were infected with viruses at a MOI of 2 for one hour under a minimal volume of medium at 37 °C. Cells were then overlaid with fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C. Samples of supernatants were harvested at several time points post-infection and stored at − 80 °C until end point viral titration assays in MDCK cells using the Reed and Muench statistical method (TCID50/mL), as previously described 78 . Light microscopy observations. The Confocal Microscope Laser Scanning allows an optical section image acquisition in two dimensions X and Y. For 3D reconstruction of a stack of images, with a motorized stage, a minimum of twenty optical sections were acquired with the confocal microscope described above with a 0.1 μ m z-step. JAcoP plugin for imageJ 80 was used to highlight the colocalization of both stainings by thresholding the signal above the background. The confocal image stacks were treated by three-dimensional visualization software: Amira version 3.1 (Mercury Inc). To create three-dimensional animations and pictures, two methods were applied. Isosurface generated a geometric surface representing points of constant value as a limit between shadow and brightness of a staining. This limit was defined through an adjusted threshold. This representation was used to define the limit of the nucleus staining (DAPI). Volume rendering visualization technique was used to simulate the casting of light rays through the volume and give a 3D impression of the stained structure. Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C and soluble protein complexes were purified using glutathione sepharose 4B beads (Amersham), according the manufacturer's instructions. Beads were then washed extensively four times with lysis buffer, and pull-down proteins displayed on NuPAGE acrylamide gels before being transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. GST-tagged viral protein and endogenous nucleolin were detected using standard immunoblotting techniques with mouse anti-GST (Covance, 1:1000) and rabbit anti-nucleolin (1:1000) antibodies. All results were reproduced in at least three independent experiments.
