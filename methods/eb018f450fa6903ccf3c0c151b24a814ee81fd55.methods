Reagents and cell lines. Mouse antibodies against Flag and HA epitopes (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit IgG Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 100-units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Flag-or HA-tagged RNF114, RNF125, RNF138,   RNF166, and RNF166 truncations were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques.  Mammalian expression plasmids for Flag-RIG-I, -MDA5, -VISA, -TRAF3, -TRAF6, -TBK1, -IRF3,  HA-ubiquitin, -K48O ubiquitin, -K63O ubiquitin (Lys-48-and Lys-63-only ubiquitin mutants; all lysine  residues except Lys-48 and Lys-63 were mutated to arginine) , and IFN-Î² promoter luciferase reporter plasmids were provided by Dr. Hong-Bing Shu (Wuhan University, Wuhan, China).
