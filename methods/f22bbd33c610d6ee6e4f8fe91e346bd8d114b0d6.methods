Dependent variable. We defined two EVD exposure variables, both binary variables, which were defined as 1 if the survey respondent reported knowing one or more close friends or family members who had Ebola or 0 otherwise, and the second which was coded as 1 if the respondent knew a friend who died of Ebola or 0 otherwise. Independent variables. We constructed two measures of wealthrelated SES, one at the household-level, and the other at the community-level, using principal component analysis (PCA) of available assets or resources. At the household-level, the wealth index was built based on ownership of the following assets or goods: shelter type, roofing material, water source, toilet location, radio, television, vehicle, mobile phone, receive remittance, always have food, always have water, always have medications, always have fuel, and always have cash. We first calculated the wealth index using pooled data from all households in both Sierra Leone and Liberia after ensuring all data were coded uniformly and then calculated the wealth index quintiles for the full sample as well as for country-specific samples. A separate communitylevel index was also constructed using the same methods and data sources with binary (yes/no) sampling unit-level resources only, which included: passable roads, paved roads, electricity grid, piped water, mobile phone service, post office, school, police station, health clinic, market stalls, bank, and public transportation. Only the first principal component was used, and separate factor analyses of urban and rural households were then regressed against the pooled results to obtain a common score (Filmer & Pritchett, 2001; Rutstein & Johnson, 2004) . As a robustness check, a household index was also created using a weighted average approach after selecting variables using Cronbach's alpha and item-response correlation (Anderson, 2012) but since the estimates were similar we use the measures of SES constructed PCA methodology. In addition, to wealth, we also examined the relationship between educational attainment and Ebola exposure at an individual and community level. Respondents were recoded into categories of having received no formal, at least some primary, at least some secondary, or at least some post-secondary education. Community-level education is measured by taking the average education level in the province or county and dividing into three groups of equivalent size. We also adjusted models for demographics (urban residence, age of the respondent, the number of adults in the respondent's household, and gender of the respondent) as well as the region of the household. Given that the size of the units may vary across countries, we include one specification that includes dummy variables to control for these regions, and one that does not. The main results are based on logistic regression using STATA 14 (College Station, TX, USA), using survey weights, population-weighted post-stratification across countries, and jackknife variance estimation. The logistic regressions were run on both the fullsample with data pooled across both countries and then separately for each country individually.
