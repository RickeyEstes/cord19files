National public health authorities in all European countries were contacted by the EUNID Coordination Team, with the help of the European Commission, in the planning stages of the project in 2003, and were asked to suggest (although not to formally endorse) experts in HID/HLIU management as national representatives. In 2004, during the first year of project activity, a data collection form was drafted by the Coordination Team, reviewed by the co-opted experts and sent to all national representatives. The aim of the data collection form was primarily to provide a uniform and comprehensive tool for the assessment of hospital capabilities. The form was developed as a survey tool and was not intended to set mandatory requirements or to establish a national legal standard for preparedness. Survey forms were issued in September 2004. The following features were investigated: number of hospitals equipped with HIRs, total number of hospital beds within such rooms, location of HIRs, number of air changes (6 or <6 air changes per hour), route of exhausting of air, connection with a laboratory at BSL 3/4 and availability of intensive care capabilities. The number of HIR hospital beds per million of population was calculated using the most recent census or estimates in the document 'Population in Europe 2007: first results', developed by Eurostat and on its website. Responses to the data collection form were discussed, reviewed and updated during both the first and second annual meetings of the EUNID project (27e28 May 2005; Rome, Italy, and 7e8 April 2006; London, UK). Finally, the Coordination Team prepared this report, shared it with national representatives and subsequent revisions were made in response to participants' comments until the content was agreed by all.
