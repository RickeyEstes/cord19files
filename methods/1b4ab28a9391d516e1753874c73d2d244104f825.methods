Collection of Betacoronavirus strains. The NCBI genome assemblies page was searched, on January 26, for taxonid of genus Betacoronavirus, resulting in a list of 22 genomes, including four isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We downloaded in addition to this initial list two more assemblies one for a bat coronavirus (MG772933) and another for MERS (KF600630), see Table 1 . For easy identification of genes and annotations from GenBank, we included unique locus_tag identifiers containing locus id and an index number. Metadata was collected to define user friendly strain names and to understand phylogenetic trees in the context of virus host, country, taxon id and data release date. Creating a pangenome for Betacoronavirus GenBank annotation and sequences were used as a starting point for this pangenomic analysis study. These GenBank annotations contain heterogeneous identifiers for genes so we included unique locus tags containing the strain accession number and gene index number for computational processing. In addition, we collected metadata for these coronaviruses for displaying on the interactive phylogenetic trees for analysis later on. Gene sequences were compared to each other for sequence similarity, followed by gene clustering. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the core gene clusters to produce a species tree and similarly for each gene cluster to produce gene trees. For this pangenome analysis we used panX 12 (Ding et al., 2018 ) that takes GenBank files as input and extracts gene coordinates, annotations from GenBank and sequences from these genomes on both nucleotide and protein levels. For interactive visualization of pangenome clusters, alignments and phylogenetic trees we used panX visualization module obtain from github, https://github.com/neherlab/pan-genomevisualization/. Other databases showing greater detail about many viruses, such as Virus Pathogen Resource (VIPR, https://www.viprbrc.org) and GSAID (https://www.gisaid.org) are very useful but these resources do not provide gene clustering or pan-genome analysis. Re-annotation of proteins from Betacoronavirus genomes using KAUST Metagenomic Analysis Platform (KMAP) annotation pipeline. To annotate uncharacterized genes in Betacoronavirus, we utilized all available protein sequences available from the clustering analysis as an input to our Automatic Annotation of Microbial Genomes (AAMG) pipeline 27 , available via KAUST Metagenomic Analysis Platform (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/kmap). AAMG uses sequence-based BLAST to UniProtKB (www.uniprot.org), KEGG (www.kegg.jp) and also Protein Family (PFam) domain detection using InterPro (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro). Prediction of function using DeepGOPlus. We used all genes from Betacoronavirus dataset in order to explore Gene Ontology predictions through our in-house DeepGOPlus 18 tool that combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity-based predictions to derive relevant functional classes from Gene Ontology alongside a confidence score. Results were included with a score 0.1 and filtered for class specificity. Predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms with a confidence score from DeepGOPlus were visualized using QuickGO (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) for SARS-CoV-2 specific gene clusters. DeepGOPlus is available on github, https://github.com/bioontology-research-group/DeepGOPlus Structure based prediction of function ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam) was used for calculating protein features. Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) and SignalP-5.0 were used for prediction of transmembrane regions and signal peptides 28 . Jpred4 was used to calculate secondary structure features (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/). 3D modelling was carried out using SwissModel (homology modelling) 29 or QUARK (ab initio structure predictions) 30 .
