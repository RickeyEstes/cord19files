Ten asthmatic children (aged 9 to 15 years) were studied during and after febrile infections. Serological studies performed during the acute and convalescent (14-21 days) phases of the illness included complement-fixation tests for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumonice, and corona viruses (OC43, 229E), and hxmagglutination-inhibition tests for influenza viruses A and B and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3. Fourfold or greater increases in titre were regarded as indicating infection. Theophylline half-life was determined during the acute illness and 1 month later. All patients received round-the-clock aminophylline (theophylline ethylenediamine) before the study, but this therapy was suspended at least 6 h before the half-life was determined. The half-life was measured after a 10-min intravenous dose of aminophylline equivalent to the patient's regular oral dose which had been adjusted to maintain plasma-theophylline between 10 and 20 g/ml. Plasma samples were collected after 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours. Theophylline concentrations were measured by a modification of the Schack and Waxler procedure.' Inter-assay variation between duplicate control theophylline measurements in our laboratory does not exceed 3 -7%.2 The equation for the regression line of the log of plasma-theophylline concentration against time was obtained by the least-squares method. The half-life was determined by dividing the log of 2 by the slope of the last half of regression line. Statistical analysis was performed by means of a 1-tailed Student's t test. Two subjects (3 and 4) had positive throat culture for group-A p-hsemolytic streptococcus and received therapy for 10 days with oral penicillin. 3 of the 4 subjects in whom seroconversion, as judged by a respiratory-virus panel, was lacking had gastrointestinal symptoms and signs, rather than indications of respiratory illness. During their acute illness serum-transaminases in these children were within the normal range (7-29 units/ml). Urinary specific gravity ranged from 1.007 to 1.023. There was no statistically significant change in urinary creatinine clearance in these subjects.
