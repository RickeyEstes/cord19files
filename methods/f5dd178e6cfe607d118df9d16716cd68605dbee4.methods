This paper compiles previously published data (see references below) and additional analyses of those data, but we present a brief summary of the data collection methods below. Hospital records of animal-bite injuries compiled from northwest Tanzania were used as primary data sources. These data informed a probability decision tree model for a national disease burden evaluation [7] , which has since been adapted for global estimates of human rabies deaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to rabies [3] , a standardized measure for assessing disease burden [8, 9] . Hospital records were also used to initiate contact tracing studies [10] [11] [12] , whereby bite-victims were interviewed to obtain more detail on the source and severity of exposure and actions taken, allowing subsequent interviews with other affected individuals (not documented in hospital records) including owners of implicated animals. Statistical techniques applied to these data for estimating epidemiological parameters and inferring transmission links are described elsewhere [10, 12] . Rabies monitoring operations including passive and active surveillance involving veterinarians, village livestock field officers, paravets, rangers and scientists were used to collect samples from carcasses (domestic dogs and wildlife whenever found), which were subsequently tested and viral isolates were sequenced [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] , with results being used to inform estimates of rabies-recognition probabilities [7] and for phylogenetic analyses [10, 16] . Operational research on domestic dog vaccination strategies was carried out in a variety of settings [14, 17] . Household interviews were also used for socio-economic surveys and to evaluate human:domestic
