The study population consisted of clinical laboratories performing diagnostic testing for MERS-CoV in medical institutions (hospitals and medical centers) and referral medical laboratories among clinical laboratories accredited by the Korean Laboratory Accreditation Program [6] . This survey was an initiative of the MERS-CoV Laboratory Response Task Force of the Korean Society for Laboratory Medi-cine. We conducted a survey of 49 clinical laboratories. A short questionnaire to assess clinical laboratory practices related to MERS-CoV diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and the clinical pathologists (laboratory physicians) in charge of the clinical laboratories performing MERS-CoV tests. The survey focused on the number of tests and the number of positive test results for MERS-CoV, turnaround time (TAT), request process, collection and transportation of specimens, testing and reporting, communication of results, laboratory safety, and reagents and equipment.
