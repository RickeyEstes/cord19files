Between July and December of 2005, HCWs were recruited from 5 medical centers in King County, Washington. Eligible study settings included emergency departments (EDs) and primary care (PC) clinics associated with each medical center; one center restricted participation to the emergency department. Eligible subjects included HCWs who currently work in either a PC or an ED setting $1 day per week at a study location, with routine patient contact through clinical care or reception and admittance. Participating clinic managers provided the investigators with the estimated number of potentially eligible HCWs (1363) by job category: physicians, 398 (29%); physician assistants or nurse practitioners, 54 (4%); nurses or nurse aides, 533 (39%); allied professionals, 170 (12%); and reception or administration staff, 208 (15%). Of those, survey materials were distributed anonymously to 1241 HCWs, and 122 unused surveys were returned to the investigators. With the exception of one medical center per Institutional Review Board restriction, a coffee coupon ($3) was included as an incentive with each survey. Completed surveys were returned in a stamped addressed envelope (n 5 653; 53%, overall). The percent response ranged from 39% to 76% at each institution. The Institutional Review Board of the medical center with the 39% response rate did not allow use of the incentive. Response rates for the remaining 4 medical centers ranged from 56% to 76%. Among all respondents, 630 met eligibility criteria and were included as study subjects. Twenty-three survey respondents did not meet subject eligibility criteria and were excluded from the study. Estimated percent participation by job type was as follows: physicians, 46%; physician assistants and nurse practitioners, 45%; nurses and nurse aides, 57%; allied professionals, 53%; and administrative staff, 44%. The study protocol was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division. In addition, one center required an independent review by its own Institutional Review Board. Questionnaire items involving reported use of infection control practices were derived from CDC guidelines, 11, [17] [18] [19]
