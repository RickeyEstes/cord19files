Cells and viruses. LLC-PK, PK-15 and human cervical cancer HeLa cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U ml À1 penicillin and 100 µg ml À1 streptomycin. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were kindly provided by Dr Sun-Young Im, Chonnam National University, South Korea. Crandall Reese feline kidney (CRFK), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), African green *Histopathological changes in the central nervous system were scored according to the severity of gliosis and perivascular cuffing as follows: 0, normal; 1, one or two glioses or perivascular cuffing; 2, !2, 3 glioses and/or perivascular cuffing; 3, multiple glioses and/or perivascular cuffing with heavy infiltration of lymphocytes or glial cells. †Antigen distribution in the central nervous system was evaluated based on the number of antigen-positive cells as follows: 0, no positive cells; 1, one to two positive cells; 2, three to five positive cells; 3, many positive cells. ‡Mock inoculation with serum-free EMEM. monkey kidney Vero and MA-104, human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 U ml À1 penicillin and 100 µg ml À1 streptomycin. MA-104 cells (ATCC) were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 U ml À1 penicillin and 100 µg ml À1 streptomycin. Human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 U ml À1 penicillin and 100 µg ml À1 streptomycin. Primary chicken embryo cells [including primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), kidney (CEK) and intestine (CEI) cells from 12-day-old SPF White Leghorn foetus] were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 U ml À1 penicillin and 100 µg ml À1 streptomycin.
