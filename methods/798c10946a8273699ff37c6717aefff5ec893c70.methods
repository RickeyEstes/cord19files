This paper is based on qualitative research conducted from March 2007 to December 2009 as part of a broader empirical project analyzing the organizational effects of the implementation of identification and tracking technologies in hospitals. The methods for this project were observational studies and semistructured interviews with personnel at hospitals that have implemented systems that are used to identify or track patients, staff, and/or equipment. The ethics boards at Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University approved this research. The project included 23 U.S. hospitals that were selected based on their use of a qualifying system (as identified through personal contacts, press releases, or media coverage) and their receptivity to participating in the research. One or both authors visited each hospital, were given demonstrations of the systems, and observed the systems in use. In addition, we conducted 80 semi-structured interviews with hospital staff, including physicians, nurses, administrators, information technologists, and biomedical engineers, as well as vendors involved with these systems. Interviewees were recruited from hospital employees who make decisions about or are targeted users of the systems. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and stripped of personal identifiers. The hospital sites and personnel have been kept confidential in the study. We analyzed all transcribed interviews and observational notes to identify core themes, such as key ethical concerns associated with these systems. Although the research was not designed to investigate the effects or characteristics of biosecuritization per se, the themes of security, emergency, and fear repeatedly emerged in interviews even as the managerial benefits of these technologies were observed. This paper explores three examples of such systems that ostensibly lend themselves to increased patient security and care.
