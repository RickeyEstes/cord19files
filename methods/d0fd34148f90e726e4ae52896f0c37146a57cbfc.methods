The database used in this bibliometric study comprises ScopusÂ® (Elsevier BV Company, USA). Scopus is more comprehensive and easier to be used in biomedical field compared to any other tool for literature research, it shows all author 's affiliations, and it is considered as the world's largest database for abstract and citation information [29, 30] , that researchers regularly used in various bibliometric studies. "West Nile" and "WNV" were used as phrases to search titles; in addition, "virus", "fever", "disease", "infection", and "infectious" were used all as words to search titles, abstracts, and keywords; to ensure that the search results adequately reflects the literature related to WNV field. All publications related to WNV were retrieved from the past until the date of December 31, 2016. Data were extracted from Scopus at one day (June 10, 2017) to avoid bias because of daily updating in the database. Data published in 2017 were excluded from the analysis. Search query that is used for data extraction from Scopus database looked like this: ((TITLE ("West Nile") OR TITLE (*WNV*)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY (virus) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (fever) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(disease) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (infection) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (infectious))) AND (EXCLUDE (PUBYEAR, 2017)). The methodology applied in this study was comparable to recent bibliometric studies [17, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . This study was focused on identifying WNV publication trends with regard to publication year, publication type, prolific countries, language of publication, as well as, prolific journals, citations, and collaboration patterns. In this study, two indicators for research evaluation are used, i.e. the impact factor (IF) and the h-index. IF is a useful indicator to assess the quality of journals [36, 37] ; and h-index is used to measure the productivity and impact of published works from different countries [38] . The IF of each individual journal was obtained from the relative official website (i.e. the Journal Citation Reports (JCR 2015) [39] . International collaboration was considered if a publication was co-written by authors from more than one country. If the article was coauthored by researchers from multiple countries, it was calculated for all assigned countries in the article. Additionally, if an article was assigned by author with multiple countries/institutions, it was calculated for all assigned countries in the article. Furthermore, this study determined the contribution of low-and middleincome countries (LMIC) to the WNV literature. The list of LMIC were extracted from the World Bank online databases [40] .
