This was a retrospective, Institutional Review Board-approved study of patients who developed laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections and whose symptoms began during hospitalization at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children's Hospital (HCH) between April 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016. Rhode Island Hospital is licensed for 719 beds, 87 of which are licensed for HCH. The two hospitals are located in adjoining buildings on the same campus as part of the Lifespan Hospital System. A nosocomial respiratory viral infection was defined as a hospitalized patient who had a positive respiratory viral panel ([RVP] Luminex, Austin, TX), rapid influenza test (Xpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), or rapid respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test (Xpert; Cepheid) of a nasopharyngeal or bronchoscopic lavage specimen. The RVP assay included testing for influenza A and B, RSV A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, as well as rhinovirus and enterovirus; however, the assay did not distinguish the latter 2 viruses, which heretofore will be noted as rhino/enterovirus.
