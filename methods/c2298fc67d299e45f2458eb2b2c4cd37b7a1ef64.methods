We calculated the relative pressure on national healthcare systems by determining the number of deaths and cases per hospital bed for each country. Three categories of hospital beds were considered: (1) available hospital bed capacity and (2) curative hospital bed capacity, as reported by Eurostat [4] from 2017 or 2018 (most recent data extracted) and (3) critical care hospital bed capacity as reported by Rhodes et al. [5] . As a first measure, we compared the number of COVID-19 related deaths relative to the number of beds, which provides an approximation of the severity of cases up to the present, and therefore also more likely to approximate pressure experienced on the health care system. The accumulated deaths to beds ratio provides an assessment that is likely less susceptible to inter-country variation in testing practices, and associated variation of underreporting of cases. We refer to this measure as the "intensity-approach". In a second measure, we compared the number of active COVID-19 cases, relative to the number of beds. The latter is referred to as the "magnitude-approach". We used the number of active COVID-19 cases and cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths in Italy on March 11, 2020 as a benchmark. These numbers, 10 590 active cases and 827 deaths were chosen as a benchmark, based on Remuzzi & Remuzzi [1] . The authors forecast the number of cases attending ICU to exceed the ICU bed capacity by March 14. As such, this benchmark acts as a reference for a "soon to be overloaded" healthcare system. We retrieved the number of active cases and the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths on March 14, 2020 [6] and calculated the proportion per hospital bed for each of the hospital bed types for 30 countries. We calculated, for each country, six ratios by dividing the number of active cases and cumulative deaths by the number of beds for each bed type. Afterwards, we normalized ratios by the bedspecific benchmarks for Italy, which is defined as the cumulative number of COVID-19 related deaths (intensity-approach) or active cases (magnitude-approach) on March 11, divided by the number of all hospital beds, curative care beds and critical care beds, respectively.
