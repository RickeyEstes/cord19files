Protein expression and purification. The gene encoding MERS-CoV spike protein (GenBank accession number JX869059, residues 18-1,294, with an Arg751Ser mutation to abolish the protease cleavage site) and the SARS-CoV spike gene (GenBank accession number AY2,78,488, residues 14-1,193) were both synthesized and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastbac1 (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal gp67 signal peptide, a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site followed by a T4 fibritin trimerization domain and a 6X Histag. The two kinds of S protein were produced with Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) separately. Transfection and virus amplification were conducted with Sf9 cells, and Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) were used to produce the recombinant proteins. Soluble S protein was captured from cell supernatants by metal affinity chromatography using a HisTrap HP 5 ml column (GE Healthcare). The eluted product was pooled and further purified by gel filtration chromatography with a Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. Then, the S proteins were both cleaved with thrombin (Sigma, 3 units per mg S protein) at 4°C overnight to remove the C-terminal trimerization domain and 6 Â His-tag. A final round of size exclusion chromatography was conducted to purify the cleaved product with a Superose 6 10/300 GL column. The resulting S proteins reached a purity of 95% as shown by SDS-PAGE ( Supplementary Figs 2 and 4) . The coding sequence for N terminal domain (NTD, spanning residues 18-353) of MERS-CoV S protein (MERS-CoV S-NTD) was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pFastBac1 vector for baculovirus expression (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen). An N-terminal gp67B signal peptide and a C-terminal 6X Histag were added to facilitate protein secretion and purification. The MERS-CoV S-NTD protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity column and Superdex200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The protein was concentrated to 15 mg ml À 1 in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl for crystal screening. The SARS-CoV S-NTD (spanning residues 14-292) was constructed, expressed and purified with the same strategy. N-terminal sequencing. The thrombin-cleaved MERS S protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently electroblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane with CAPS buffer (10 mM CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol) at 200 mA for 1.5 h. The polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was stained with freshly prepared Coomassie Blue R250 (0.1% Coomassie Blue R250, 1% acetic acid, 40% methanol) for 50 s and destained with 50% methanol until bands were visible and the background was clear. Then the membrane was dried and the target bands were cut for the N-terminal sequencing with the Edman degradation method by using PPSQ-31A (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Crystallization and structure determination. The monomeric MERS S-NTD was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method at 18°C with 1 ml protein solution mixed with 1 ml reservoir buffer. High-quality crystals of MERS S-NTD grew in buffer of 0.2 M Magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.1 M BIS-TRIS pH 5.5, 25% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3,350at a protein concentration of 15 mg ml À 1 . Derivative crystals were obtained by soaking MERS S-NTD crystals overnight in mother liquor containing 2 mM KAuCl4. The SARS S-NTD was also crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method at 18°C. High-quality crystals grew in 1.3 M Na/K hydrogen phosphate (pH 7.0) at a protein concentration of 15 mg ml À 1 . Diffraction data were collected with cryoprotected (in a reservoir solution containing 20% [v/v] glycerol) crystals at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BL17U. All the datasets were processed with HKL2,000 software 37 . The structure of MERS S-NTD was determined by the SAD method using Au derivative data set with SHELXD (ref. 38) and Phaser-ep (ref. 39) , while the structure of SARS S-NTD was determined by the molecular replacement method using cryo-EM structure. The atomic model was completed with Coot 40 and refined with phenix.refine in Phenix 41 , and the stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with Molprobity 42 . Data collection, processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 . The native data set was collected at 0.979 Å, while the derivative data set was collected at 1.039 Å. Cryo-electron microscopy data collection and processing. Purified S protein (3 ml) with a concentration of B0.4 mg ml À 1 for MERS-CoV S or B0.3 mg ml À 1 for SARS-CoV S was placed on a glow-discharged holy carbon grid (GIG, 1.0 mm hole size, 400 mesh). After 4 s blotting with filter paper, the grid was flash plunged in liquid ethane using an automatic plunge device (Leica EM GP) with 10°C temperature and 99% humidity. Cryo-EM single particle data collection was performed using a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope equipped with K2 camera. Using the super resolution mode, each image was exposed of 11 s at a calibrated magnification of 38461 and an electron dose rate of B8 e per pixel per s, resulting in a total dose of B50 e Å À 2 that was fractionated into 32 movie frames. The images were binned before data processing, yielding a final pixel size of 1.3 Å. In each micrograph, after beam induced motion of each movie frame being corrected by the program MOTIONCORR (ref. 43 ), a 32-movie frames averaged micrograph was calculated and the parameters of the contrast transfer function on this micrograph was determined by the program ctffind 44 . A subset of protein particles were semi-automatically boxed using the program e2boxer.py in EMAN2 software package 45 and processed with 2D classification. Automatic particle boxing of the whole data set was performed by RELION program, 46 Figure 6 | Proposed mechanism of membrane fusion promoted by MERS-CoV S protein. After cleavage into S1/S2 subunits, the S1 subunit is easily disassociated from the S2 subunit. In the endosome, the S2 0 cleavage site could be further cleaved by the host proteases, releasing its fusion peptide. Then, under low pH environment, the connecting region, HR1 helix and central helix undergo structural rearrangement to form a long helix to help the insertion of the fusion peptide into the host membrane. Finally, the HR1 and HR2 fold into an intra-hairpin helical structure that can trimerically assemble into a six-helix bundle, resulting in membrane fusion. NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms15092 ARTICLE obtained three distinguished class average images as references. A total number of B530,000 particles were picked in 1,810 micrographs and processed by no reference 2D classification using RELION program. About 260,000 particles in the good classes representing the S1/S2 trimers ( Supplementary Fig. 4a) were kept for further 3D classification. The HKU1 S trimer density map was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and rescaled as a reference map for 3D classification without imposing any symmetry. All the particles were classified into six classes and a 3D model within each class was reconstructed. Among the six reconstructions, two of them having the most accurate rotational alignment have reasonable rod-like densities in the middle representing central helices of S2. Class one containing about 55,000 particles has two RBDs in a standing state and one RBD in a lying state. Class two containing about 40,000 particles has one RBD in a standing state and two RBDs in a lying state. Further classification could not identify other conformations such as all three RBDs in a standing state or all three RBDs in a lying state, probably because of the small population of particles with these conformations. The rest part of the S protein monomer kept the same in a trimer. Thus, for better alignment, a 4.1 Å reconstruction with three-fold symmetry imposed containing all the particles from these two classes was calculated. However, the density of RBD region became quite low due to the average of RBD density between lying state and standing state. Further particle based motion correction and particle shinning process improve the resolution to 3.7 Å of the three-fold symmetry reconstruction by 0.143 criterion in the gold standard Fourier Shell correlated Coefficient (Supplementary Fig. 4d ). In addition, the shiny particles in class one and two were used to calculate a 4.1 and a 4.2 Å map without imposing any symmetry, respectively. The orientation distribution ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ) of MERS S protein trimer in the three-fold symmetry reconstruction was similar to that of HKU1 (ref. 27) . The local resolution of the three maps was calculated using program ResMap 47 . The data of SARS-CoV S was processed in the same way as mentioned above, and the shiny particles in class one and two were used to calculate a 3.2 Å with three-fold symmetry imposed and a 3.7 Å map without imposing any symmetry. During 2D classification of MERS-CoV S protein data, some of the class-averaged images had a hole in the middle of the protein. We selected the particles (B60,000) within these classes for the reconstruction of S1 trimers. These class-averaged images were used to build an initial model of S1 trimer for 3D classification by e2initialmodel.py program 45 . After 3D classification, B15,500 particles were kept for the high-resolution refinement imposing the three-fold symmetry which resulted in a 9.5 Å map of S1 trimer. We were not able to identified separate S2 proteins probably because S2 trimer was lacking of a stable conformation. Model building and refinement. For model building, the predicted model of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV S protein from the Phyre2 web server 48 was used as the starting model. De novo building was performed manually in COOT (ref. 49 ) based on the well-defined continuous electron density of its main chain in the three-fold symmetry map, and sequence assignment was guided mainly by bulky amino-acid residues densities. For MERS-CoV S model, the NTD domain and RBD domain were generated by fitting its crystal structure into the electron density map. For SARS-CoV S model, the NTD initial model was built manually in COOT based on the electron density of its main chain in the map, and then the NTD initial model was used as template for crystal structure determination. Finally, the model of SARS-CoV S NTD domain and RBD domain were generated by fitting the crystal structures into the electron density map. The structure model was first refined in real space against the cryo-EM map using phenix.real_space_refine application in PHENIX (ref. 50) with geometry and secondary structure restraints. Refinement in reciprocal space was then performed in REFMAC (ref. 51) with stereo-chemical. Automatic real-space and reciprocal-space refinements followed by manual correction in COOT were carried out iteratively until there were no more improvements in both R factor and geometry parameters. The refinement statistics of the structural model are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . For the reconstructions of MERS-CoV S class one, class two, S1 trimer and SARS-CoV S class one, class two, all domains of S1 and S2 model were fitted into the corresponding maps separately.
