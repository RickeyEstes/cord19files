Data for this study was collected using Barbados' National Infl uenza Surveillance System which is comprised of ten sentinel sites, responsible for sending weekly notifi cations to the Ministry of Health of ARI and SARI. Using guidelines provided CAREC [8] , a case was reported as an ARI if it met the following case defi nition: acute (sudden) febrile illness (>38.0ºC or 100.4ºF) in a previously healthy person, presenting with cough or sore throat with or without respiratory distress. Cases were reported as SARI if they presented a sudden onset of fever over 38ºC, cough or sore throat, shortness of breath or diffi culty breathing, and required hospital admission. During the pre-pandemic period, as part of routine surveillance, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from all cases of SARI detected at the hospital sentinel site and a sample of six swabs from patients meeting the criteria of ARI from two of the most centrally located ambulatory sites. In April 2009, after the announcement by the WHO that the world had entered pandemic phase fi ve, an enhanced testing strategy was introduced and all primary health care facilities, both private and public, were asked to take nasopharyngeal swabs from all persons who presented with fever (>38ºC) with respiratory symptoms and a travel history to an aff ected area. When sustained community transmission of 2009 H1N1 was established, this testing strategy was returned to the pre-pandemic level. Nasopharyngeal samples taken from suspected cases were sent fi rst to the Barbados Public Health Laboratory (local) where they underwent preliminary screening using immunofl uorescence testing. Using this method, it is possible to detect infl uenza A virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncitial virus, parainfl uenza types 1, 2 and 3 and infl uenza B. All samples which met the criteria for testing, irrespective of result, were sent to CAREC. At the peak of the epidemic in the Caribbean, Barbadian health offi cials began sending some samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia in an attempt to reduce the burden being placed on CAREC. Th e CDC and CAREC collaborated during the outbreak to provide critical guidance and technical capacity to the region. During the pandemic, the Ministry of Health's public health offi cials convened meetings of the National Pandemic Planning Committee which met at least weekly for the fi rst two months of the declaration of a pandemic and then monthly for the duration of the outbreak in Barbados. A smaller Technical Command Committee was also convened to manage the response to the pandemic and met weekly. At the end of the outbreak period in Barbados, a formal evaluation was conducted by many of the major stakeholders within the health sector. Th e pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented as a result of these meetings form the basis of the results presented in this paper. The evidence surrounding the use of some NPIs to delay spread of infection in a pandemic has been found to be weak [9, 10, 11] . Aledort et al. published a systematic review which examined the literature and also made recommendations based on expert opinion in cases where there were no or very low quality articles available as a study. Here we consider the pharma ceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions carried out by the Government of Barbados through the Ministry of Health, and compare these interventions to the recommendations of the article by Aledort et al [9] .
