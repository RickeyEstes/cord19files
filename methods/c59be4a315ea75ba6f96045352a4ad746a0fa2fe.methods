This was a qualitative, semi-structured interview study. The aim of the study was to explore and understand the EMS providers' views about reporting for duty during disease outbreaks and the factors that affect their feelings and potential attitudes. In order to accurately capture this kind of information, the use of a qualitative method was the appropriate choice [13] . The primary data collection method was face-to-face semi-structured interviews with frontline EMS providers. This method helps researchers to gain more information from the participants by capturing their words, insights, and expressions. While semi-structured interviews employ a number of predetermined questions, they also allow the researcher to probe far beyond the answers to get more in-depth information about particular areas of study [13] . An interview guide was developed and designed based on previous research on this topic to elicit the participants' views about working during disease outbreaks, compared with both natural disasters and day-to-day operations. For the purpose of this study, disease outbreak is defined as "the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season" [14] . As defined by the World Health Organizations (WHO), natural disasters are "catastrophic events with atmospheric, geologic and hydrologic origins. They include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods and drought" [15] .
