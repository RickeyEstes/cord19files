As influenza epidemic data, we used Weekly CPS at a PHC jurisdiction (V i (w)) from the 38 th week in 2010 to the 26 th week in 2011 in Miyazaki Prefecture 6, 7 . Weekly CPS at one jurisdiction is calculated by dividing the number of weekly reported cases by the number of influenza sentinel sites. There are nine PHCs (i.e. Miyazaki city, Chuo, Miyakonojo, Nobeoka, Nichinan, Kobayashi, Takanabe, Takachiho, and Hyuga) in Miyazaki Prefecture. Here, i denoted nine jurisdictions and the imaginary "other prefecture", which was defined as the prefecture with the average features of Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Oita Prefecture (i.e. index i was varied from 1 to 10). Additionally, w was the index representing a week. The number of influenza-associated medical facilities [i.e. clinics and hospitals which included patients from the internal medicine or paediatrics departments as the examination subjects] (h i ) in each PHC jurisdiction was obtained via data from the Kyushu Okinawa hospital, from 2001 to 2009. In this study, the number of clinics used within each jurisdiction was 232, 15, 95, 58, 42, 45, 61, 10 and 35. Then, the number of weekly influenza patients at each PHC jurisdiction was estimated by the following equation (1): On the other hand, the V i (w) outside Miyazaki Prefecture was defined as the average of Weekly CPS in Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Oita prefectures as obtained by the NESID. We defined the h i outside Miyazaki as the average number of medical facilities (i.e. all those clinics and hospitals which included patients from the internal medicine or paediatrics departments as the examination subjects) in each of the three prefectures as obtained by a medical facilities survey in 2010. The I i (w) outside Miyazaki Prefecture was estimated by equation (1) . Finally, the number of daily influenza cases at each PHC jurisdiction (  I t ( ) i ) was estimated as in the case of a previous study 19 in which t was the index representing day. Briefly, a smoothing spline was fitted to the weekly cumulative curve of each jurisdiction. Then, the daily difference of the cumulative counts was taken in order to obtain the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ number of daily patients. In this process, if the estimated  I t ( ) i was lower than 0, it was set at 0. It was also rounded to make it an integer. To obtain a coefficient of determination R 2 at 0.995, the smoothing spline was used in this study. The spline model was evaluated by the AIC to obtain the most predictive model when the beginning and end of the epidemic varied from the 38 th week to the 44 th week in 2010 and from the 26 th week to the 28 th week in 2011. The night-time population in a national population census in 2010 was defined as the population in each jurisdiction. Human movement between jurisdictions was also quantified by a national population census conducted in 2010. The census was summarized in a unit of city, town, or village in Miyazaki Prefecture, and each jurisdiction of PHC included more than one city, town, or village. Thus, municipal night-time, day-time, and inflow and outflow populations were tallied for each jurisdiction, and we estimated the number of people who moved from j to i (c ij ), where j also denoted nine jurisdictions and the imaginary "other prefecture". Data on efflux and influx of population between a jurisdiction in Miyazaki Prefecture and another prefecture (i.e. Kagoshima, Kumamoto, or Oita Prefecture) as well as vice versa were not fully represented in the national population census. Thus, the population of an imaginary "other prefecture" was defined as the average population of Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Oita Prefecture. Consequently, we modified the model reported previously 24 , and the expected value of daily cases (  I t E( ( )) i ) was estimated by equations (2) and (3): , ω(τ), and T represent the rate of population who moved from j to i to the night-time population in j, the distribution of serial intervals τ days ago, and the cut-period for the serial interval distribution, respectively. We used shifted gamma distribution 25 with a mean of 2.6 days and a standard deviation of 1.5 days 12,26 as the serial interval distribution. Further, we assumed that the R i (t) value was the same during a given week. Each parameter was estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, assuming that I i (t) is Poisson-distributed with a mean of Ê I ( (t)) i . The number of iterations, chains, and burn-in were 20,000, 8, and 5,000, respectively. In addition, the Rhat statistic of Gelman-rubin was determined to converge, due to the fact that it is less than 1.1. A sensitivity analysis of R i (t) was conducted by varying the mean and the standard deviation of serial interval distribution from 2.6 to 3.7 considering viral type A and B and from 1.5 to 2.0, respectively. In this study, the model uncertainty derived from serial interval was only considered, and that derived from interpolation of smoothing spline was not. The latter uncertainty is likely to be less influential on R i (t) since all coefficients of determination R 2 for estimates by the smoothing spline were over 0.995 and the goodness of fit was not significant in any jurisdictions. The original model was used to analyze the spatial distribution of the Ebola epidemic. However, the only parameters that characterize the Ebola epidemic are serial interval and human movement parameters. In this study, we used parameters suitable for influenza, to investigate the spatial distribution of influenza infection among ten regions.
