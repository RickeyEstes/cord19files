From February 1 to 14, 2020, clinical specimens including serum, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, urine, stool and tissues from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients were obtained in accordance with China Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and tested for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the China CDC-standardized quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay [5] . Clinical characteristics of the 73 patients were shown in Supplementary Table 1 Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on a patient as described in Supplementary Case Clinical Information. As shown in Figure 1 , the mucous epithelium of esophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum showed no significant damage with H&E staining. Infiltrate of occasional lymphocytes was observed in esophageal squamous epithelium. In lamina propria of stomach, duodenum and rectum, numerous infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes with interstitial edema were seen. Importantly, viral host receptor ACE2 stained positive mainly in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells ( Figure 1 ). To note, we observed that ACE2 is rarely expressed in esophageal epithelium, but abundantly distributed in cilia of glandular epithelia. Staining of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) was visualized in the cytoplasm of gastric, duodenal and rectum glandular epithelial cell, but not in esophageal epithelium. The positive staining of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 was also observed in gastrointestinal epithelium from other patients, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces (data not shown).
