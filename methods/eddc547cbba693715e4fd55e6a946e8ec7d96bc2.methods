The local university ethics review board approved the study. Participants included all 53 SARS Steering Committee members. The authors designed and tested a survey containing 13 forced-choice and 8 open-ended questions, which focused on perceptions on the Extranet and on other SARS information and communication sources. Both web-based and paper-based surveys were used to ease completion and simplify data collection as well as to increase the response rate. User testing was conducted with the online version of the survey to identify problems with use, ensure survey comprehension, calculate average completion time (10-15 minutes), and identify if dynamic or technical functionality posed challenges. A three-member observation team tested the web survey with four PHCS employees who were familiar with the SARS Extranet and comfortable using the web. Instructions were given to each participant based on a think-aloud protocol, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Participants were asked to complete the web survey, while observers took notes. Participants were instructed to think out loud, make statements, or ask questions as they made their way through the survey. They were informed that observers would not respond, but that observers would benefit from hearing their comments and watching their actions. Observers noted problems spoken and/or observed, which were later discussed in a debriefing session after each test. They participated in a final debriefing session to identify problems that occurred with more than one participant; this process provided direction for survey improvements. Several minor survey modifications were made prior to the launch. The online survey form was dynamic and, depending on how a respondent replied to one question, determined the next series of questions. Thus, changes identified through the think-aloud technique related to branching of questions (If yes, go here; If no, go there). No other significant issues were identified. The paper-based survey was also modified slightly to match the web version. On July 3 rd 2003, all steering committee members were sent an information email along with a letter of introduc-tion, an invitation to participate, and a direct link to the online survey. One week later, a reminder email was sent to non-respondents; two weeks later, the paper-based survey and self-addressed stamped envelope was mailed. Quantitative data were entered into SPSS for analysis. Two researchers independently coded the open-ended questions. Consensus was reached with the entire research team whenever differences in coding existed.
