All laboratory-confirmed dengue patients identified from our hospital microbiology database and treated using a standardized dengue clinical care path at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Singapore from 2006 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed for demographic, serial clinical and laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data. These cases were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [13] . We included patients with only positive dengue serology in only subgroup analyses, as we did not have paired sera, and other etiologies for elevated AST and ALT could not be excluded without more extensive evaluation. Cases were categorized using serial clinical and laboratory data from the entire clinical course as dengue fever (DF), DHF, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) using WHO 1997 classifications [9] . Dengue fever classification requires fever and at least two of the following: headache, eye pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, bleeding, and leukopenia. Dengue hemorrhagic fever requires all of the following: fever, platelet count #100610 9 /liter, bleeding, and plasma leakage [9] . Dengue shock syndrome is a case of DHF with either tachycardia and pulse pressure ,20 mmHg or systolic blood pressure ,90 mmHg [9] . Cases were also categorized as dengue without warning signs (WS), dengue with WS, or severe dengue using WHO 2009 classifications [1] . Dengue (WHO 2009) requires fever and two of the following: nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, leukopenia, or any warning sign [1] . Warning signs include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, or hematocrit rise ($20%) with rapid drop in platelet count (,50,000/liter) [1, 14] . We modified the WHO 2009 warning sign of rise in hematocrit concurrent with rapid drop in platelet count by quantifying it as hematocrit $20% concurrent with platelet count ,50,000/liter, as this was shown to correlate significantly with dengue death in our adult dengue death study [14] . Severe dengue includes severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, and severe organ impairment [1] . We performed a subgroup analysis for median maximum AST and ALT values stratified by febrile (days 1-3 of illness), critical (days 4-6), and convalescent (days 7-10) phases as defined by WHO 2009 [1] and compared across dengue severity classification according to WHO 1997 [9] and 2009 [1] . We excluded severe dengue due to isolated elevation of AST or ALT$1000 U/L from our definition of severe dengue outcome, as this would be a confounder in assessing the relevance of AST or ALT levels in defining dengue severity. Patients had AST/ALT taken at presentation and then throughout hospitalization at the physician's discretion. Maximum AST and ALT values recorded at a median of 4 days of illness (interquartile range [IQR]: 3-5 days) were used in this analysis. Those with pre-existing liver diseases were excluded. At TTSH, the ULN for AST is 41 U/L; for ALT, it is 63 U/L for males and 54 U/L for females. We assessed the clinical relevance of elevated AST or ALT levels using four liver failure criteria-two for acute liver failure, and two that determine prognosis from chronic liver disease. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends defining acute liver failure in a patient as: international normalized ratio (INR)$1.5, any degree of altered mental status, and illness ,26 weeks in duration without preexisting cirrhosis [15] . The King's College criteria assess prognoses in those with acute liver failure; the criteria are: prothrombin time .100 seconds or 3 of the following: age .40 years, prothrombin time .50 seconds, serum bilirubin .18 mg/dL, time from jaundice to encephalopathy .7 days [16] . The model for endstage liver disease (MELD) determines three-month mortality based on the following formula: 3.86(log serum bilirubin [mg/ dL])+11.26(log INR)+9.66(log serum creatinine [mg/dL])+6.4 [17] . The Child-Pugh criteria include assessment of degree of ascites, serum bilirubin and albumin, prothrombin time, and encephalopathy to determine one-and two-year survival [18] . The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine statistical significance for continuous variables, and chisquare or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical tests were conducted at the 5% level of significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showing the area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine the discriminatory performance of aminotransferase values. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 10 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). This was a retrospective study involving data collection from medical records. All patient data were anonymized during analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, National Healthcare Group, Singapore [DSRB E/08/ 567].
