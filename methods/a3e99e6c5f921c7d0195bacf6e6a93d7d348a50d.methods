Our approach is guided by the use of literature in peer-reviewed journals on disease burden and health system reforms in developing countries, specifically in sub-Saharan West African countries. Periodicals released by international organizations, including the United Nations Development Program, WHO, United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank, on global health challenges were also relied on to critically examine the health, sociopolitical, and economic conditions and to identify the priority and policy areas discussed in this article. Building on the policy analysis work of de-Graft Aikins, Boynton, and Atanga (2010), the structural psychology work of Hepworth (2004) , and the antiretroviral adherence analysis work of Kagee et al. (2011) , we extrapolated from these prior works to critically examine the challenges and opportunities that, if understood and addressed, can effectively contribute to halting the spread of Ebola and potential infectious diseases specific to the West African setting.
