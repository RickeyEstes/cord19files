Our NICU is a reference centre for central Turkey and serves about 4000 patients annually, including 500 extremely low birth weight neonates. The NICU spans two floors, one of which is exclusively for premature infants. This section has 50 incubators and open beds, although the total capacity of the unit is 120. Our NICU provides family-centred care, and parents are permitted to visit and take part in the care of their babies, which renders infants susceptible to exposure to external pathogens such as RSV. The RSV season in Turkey is usually between October and April in northern and central regions and between November and April in southern regions of the country. In July 2008 we initiated a screening study to search for cases of RSV infection otherwise overlooked and to determine the real incidence of RSV infection. Every two weeks infants hospitalised for more than seven days who had respiratory symptoms were screened using Respi-Strip Ã’ (Coris BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium). The principle of this point-of-care immunochromatography test is that a nitrocellulose membrane is sensitised with a monoclonal antibody directed against RSV while a mobile anti-RSV monoclonal antibody is conjugated to colloidal gold particles. If the sample contains RSV, the conjugate-RSV complex will remain bound to the anti-RSV antibody adsorbed onto the nitrocellulose, revealed as a red line that develops on the strip. Testing was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained and placed in a tube containing saline solution and agitated. An aliquot was then mixed with extraction buffer and stirred thoroughly. The strips were then inserted into the tube and incubated for 15 min before reading. The presence of a positive control line with a positive test line was considered a positive result. All tests were performed by the primary investigator (E.A.D.) and testing was available out of working hours throughout the outbreak period. Each box of Respi-Strip was checked with a positive control included in the box before being used in patients. No cases were found between July and December 2008. However, early in January 2009 screening detected RSV positivity in 11 preterm infants on the same day. Following this, all infants in the NICU were screened, revealing two more cases: these infants were initially asymptomatic (cases 6 and 10) but developed respiratory symptoms within 24-48 h. The 37 remaining premature infants in the NICU, all of whom were <34 weeks' gestational age at birth, were given palivizumab prophylaxis (administered i.m. at 15 mg/ kg) within a few hours of detection of the index cases. The diagnosis of RSV was subsequently confirmed in all 13 cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Surveillance testing for RSV was repeated using Respi-Strip every 48 h until all of the infected infants became negative. Infants who tested negative with Respi-Strip were tested again if they became symptomatic on follow-up. Two days after palivizumab administration, RSV was detected in one additional infant (case 4) who had become symptomatic. Another infant (case 7), whose clinical picture was suggestive of RSV infection but who tested negative by Respi-Strip, was subsequently found to be positive by PCR. Besides RSV, patients were tested by PCR for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, coronavirus 63/43, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus, and screened for bacterial sepsis by blood culture. In addition to palivizumab prophylaxis, positive cases were nursed together in a separate section of the unit and contact precautions were instituted. Infection control measures were implemented including the use of gloves, gowns, and masks. All healthcare personnel who had respiratory symptoms were also screened, visitor numbers were limited, and the unit was closed to admissions until the outbreak subsided. The charts of the infected infants were reviewed and the gestational age, date of birth, birth weight, sex and pre-RSV oxygen need were recorded along with clinical outcomes.
