Cells and Viruses. HEK293T cells and PK-15 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum supplemented with penicillin (100 U ml −1 ) and streptomycin (100 g ml −1 ). Sendai virus (SeV) was obtained from the Centre of Virus Resource and Information (Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). Plasmids and Agents. IFN--Luc, 4x PRDIII/I-Luc (referred to as IRF3-Luc), 4x AP-1-Luc, and 4x NF-B-Luc luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed according to an earlier protocol [12] . Accession numbers of STING, IRF3, and MAVS were KC860780, KC860781, and KC860782, respectively. Expression plasmids for RIG-1 (p-Flag-RIG-1) and TBK-1 (p-Flag-TBK-1) were generated with the following primers: RIG-1 forward, 5 -TTTGGATCCATGACAGCA-GAGCAGCGGCGGAAT-3 , RIG-1 reverse 5 -TTTAAG-CTTCACTCAAGGTTCGGGATTCCCTG-3 ; TBK-1 forward, 5 -TTTGAATTCATGCAGAGCACTTCTAATCAT-CTTT-3 , TBK-1 reverse 5 -TTTAGATCTTAAAGACAG-TCAACATTGCGAA-3 . To construct the DNA expression vector, pMyc-PL1, pFlag-PL1, and pPL1-Myc, encoding TGEV PL1, standard reverse transcription-(RT-) PCR was applied to amplify cDNA of the total RNA extracted from PK-15 cells infected with the TGEV strain HX, using the following primers: PL1-forward, 5 -GTACAAGAA-GCTGAACAATTTAA-3 (3498-3520 bp), PL1 reverse, 5 -ATCGTTTTTAGGACTTTGAATTT-3 (4249-4271 bp). All constructs were validated via DNA sequencing. pDsRed2-Mito was purchased from Clontech (Tokyo, Japan). Transfection agent was performed with X-tremeGENE HP (Roche, Switzerland) per the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.2 g/well reporter plasmid, 0.02 g/well pRL-TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, USA) as an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency, and the indicated expression or empty control vector plasmid. Where indicated, cells were also mockinfected or infected with SeV (100 hemagglutinating activity units/well) at 10 h after cotransfection. Cells were subsequently lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data are presented as mean relative luciferase units ± standard deviation from triplicate samples. For statistical analysis, data were compared between empty vector-and TGEV PL1-transfected groups with the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test using SPSS 11.0 software. values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant [13] . ELISA. Cell supernatants of transfected PK-15 cells were centrifuged at 3,000 for 5 min to remove cell debris and stored at −80 ∘ C until use. Secreted IFN-in the cell supernatants was determined using commercial Porcine IFN-(Interferon Beta) ELISA Kit (Elabscience, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot Analysis. HEK293T cells were cultured in 6well plates and 60 mm dishes were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. After 36 h, cells were harvested by the addition of lysis buffer and protein concentrations in whole cell extracts measured. Equal amounts of samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for TGEV PL1, STING, TBK-1, and IRF3 proteins via immunoblotting using HA, Flag, or GFP-tagged antibodies (Sigma, St Louis, USA). Expression of p-IRF3, IRF3, and GAPDH was detected with the rabbit-anti p-IRF3 (ab76493), IRF3 (ab68481) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and a mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St Louis, USA). Assay of Deubiquitinase Activity in Cultured Cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-Ub plus the indicated amounts of TGEV PL1, p-Flag-RIG-1, and p-Flag-STING constructs. The effect of TGEV PL1 on ubiquitinated proteins in cultured cells was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed on HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids as described in an earlier report [14] . Immunofluorescence Assay. HEK293T cells were plated on fibronectin-treated glass coverslips in 24-well plates. To evaluate the localization of TGEV PL1, cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNA expressing Flag-PL (500 ng per well) and pDsRed-Mito (500 ng per well) using X-treme GENE HP, according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with IRF3-GFP (500 ng per well) and empty vector (500 ng per well) or IRF3-GFP (500 ng per well) and Flag-PL1 (500 ng per well). 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with SeV (100 hemagglutinating activity units/well) for 16 h. Next, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h, followed by incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Flag (1 : 100) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse (Sigma, St Louis, USA) for 1 h, and subsequently with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were washed with PBS, and fluorescent images were acquired under a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5; Leica, Solms, Germany).
