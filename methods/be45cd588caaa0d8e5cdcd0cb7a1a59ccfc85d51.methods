Workflow for parallel chunk-based predictions Rather than predicting the RNA sequence as a whole, we cut each sequence into chunks and predict each chunk independently before merging the predictions into the whole secondary structure. As the cutting process can be performed in different ways, the search for effective ways to cut sequences can require a large search space and generate a large number of independent prediction jobs that can potentially be performed in parallel. The workflow for a parallel chunk-based RNA secondary structure prediction and accuracy assessment consists of the following four steps: (1) chunking: each RNA sequence is cut into multiple chunks (or segments) according to various chunking algorithms and parameters; (2) prediction: the secondary structure for each chunk is predicted independently by using one or more prediction programs; (3) reconstruction: the whole secondary structure of a sequence is reconstructed from predicted structures, one for each chunk; and (4) analysis: reconstructed structures are compared against known structures to assess prediction accuracies. Figure 3 .a shows the prediction workflow. Note that the chunks do not necessarily have the same length: the lengths depend on the chunking method and parameters used. Also note that the chunk's prediction time and memory usage can vary based on the number of nucleotides in the chunk and the prediction program used. In most prediction programs the time and memory used do not grow linearly but exponentially with the number of nucleotides, with the exponential factor depending on the program complexity and its capability to capture complex RNA secondary structures such as pseudoknots.
