Mice. Card9 -/-, Syk flox/flox , Ips-1 -/and Myd88 -/mice have been previously described 18, [45] [46] [47] . These mice were backcrossed at least 8 times onto C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The animals were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Kitasato University Medical Center and animals were treated in accordance with the Regulations for Animal Experiments in Kitasato University. All surgeries were performed under ketamine hydrochloride/xylazine anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Antibodies and reagents. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-F4/80 (clone BM8), FITC-conjugated anti-CD45R/B220 (clone RA3-6B2), FITC-conjugated CD19 (clone 6D5), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-Ly-6G (clone 1A8), PE-conjugated anti-SiglecH (clone 551), biotin-conjugated anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136), biotin-conjugated anti-BST2/PDCA-1 (clone 927), peridinin chlorophyll protein/Cy5.5 (PerCP/Cy5.5)-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11), phycoerythrin-Cy7 (PC7)-conjugated anti-CD3Îµ (clone 145-2C11) and PC7-conjugated anti-CD11c (clone N418) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 (clone KT15) monoclonal antibodies, PE-conjugated H-2D b tetramer coupled with a viral NP-derived ASNENMETM peptide (NP 366-374 : ASNENMETM), H-2D b -restricted influenza NP 366-374 peptide were purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Syk inhibitor IV (BAY 61-3606) was purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA). LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). NaClO-oxidized zymosan was prepared as described 48 . IFV infection in mice. C57BL/6 and Card9 -/mice were anesthetized and infected with 10 4 plaque forming units (PFU) (unless otherwise indicated) of a mouse-adapted IFV (A/PR/8/34 strain: H1N1 isotype, kindly provided by the Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan) by intratracheal administration as described 10-12 . Histology. Whole lungs were collected at 0, 4, and 8 days after IFV infection. Paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissues were performed using standard methodologies.
