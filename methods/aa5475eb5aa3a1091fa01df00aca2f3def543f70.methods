We conducted a cross-sectional survey one month into the COVID-19 outbreak on February 20-21, 2020, about one month into the COVID-19 emergency in China. All the participants were adults not affected by the virus epidemiologically but they lived in locations that were affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. To cover people in areas of varying severity of COVID-19, we surveyed adults from 64 prefectures across China. The 64 prefectures were chosen to cover a wide spectrum of regions based on the severity of COVID-19 and should not be taken as a representative national sample. All respondents agreed to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee at Tongji University. We reached 529 adults, and 369 of them answered the survey, with a response rate of 69·8%. We assessed individual health by the Short Form-12 (SF12), a standard scale on mental and physical health function. 11 The scale had been translated into Chinese and validated in China. 12 SF12 contains 12 items and 8 dimensions: physical functioning (2 items), role physical (2 items), bodily pain (1 item), general health (1 item), vitality (1 item), social functioning (1 item), role emotional (2 items) and mental health (2 items). The eight dimensions form two composite scores of physical and mental composite scale (PCS and MCS), with a possible score ranging from 0 to 100. 13 As a formative score, a higher SF12 score indicates a better health condition. We measured distress by the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6) with a Cronbach's alpha of 0·79. 14 We measured life satisfaction with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), 15 which consists of five items with a Cronbach's alpha of 0·72. .
