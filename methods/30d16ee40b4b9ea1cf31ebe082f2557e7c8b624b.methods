This 4-year prospective study was conducted from November 2001 through October 2005, a period before the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Israel. All children age < 5 years who were residents of southern Israel, evaluated in the pediatric emergency department (ED) of the Soroka University Medical Center (whether subsequently discharged to home or hospitalized), and met the World Health Organization's radiologic criteria for alveolar pneumonia 12 were eligible for enrollment in the study. Nasopharyngeal wash specimens were obtained daily from all children during specific hours (Sunday to Thursday between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., except holidays). Thus, the nasopharyngeal wash often was obtained from hospitalized children the morning after hospitalization, but some of the outpatients were discharged from the ED before viral testing could be offered. Children encountered $ 48 hours after admission to the hospital were excluded, because their viral infection was considered a potential hospital-acquired infection. Because we had only scan information on the prevalence of HMPV in healthy children, we included healthy controls as well. These were children age < 5 years admitted to the Soroka University Medical Center for elective surgery from whom specimens were obtained within 48 hours after admission. Control children were admitted all year-round, but only controls enrolled during the peak HMPV period were tested for HMPV (from November through May each year). Thus, the controls were not age-matched, but they were year-and season-matched. Accordingly, the results were adjusted for age and ethnic group in the analysis. Nasopharyngeal wash specimens obtained from both cases and controls whose legal guardians provided signed informed consent were analyzed. Detailed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from the medical files, and missing information was obtained by interviewing the parents or the child's primary care physician. Variables studied included age; sex; ethnic origin (Jewish or Bedouin children); number of siblings; history of wheezing or diagnosis of asthma, pneumonia, or otitis media; antibiotic treatment during the 3 months before enrollment; presence of clinical signs and symptoms; and maximal temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and mortality also were recorded. The study design was approved by the institutional and national Ethics Committees and was performed in accordance with the Human Experimentation Guidelines of the Israeli Ministry of Health.
