Tissue samples. In Japan, the capture and handling of a bat were approved by the Japanese Ministry of Environment (license No. 21-27-0213 to 21-27-0215), and conducted in accordance with the approved protocol. An E. nilssonii was captured in Hokkaido, Japan and euthanized; then, the liver was removed. The liver sample was stored in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) prior to the isolation of genomic DNA. Bat muscle tissue (E. serotinus) and cell cultures from E. serotinus, M. daubentonii (MyDauNi/2), M. nattereri (MyLu/2), Nyctalus noctula (NyNoNi/2) and Pipistrellus pipistrellus (PipNi/1) were available from previous studies and originated from animals found dead in Germany and delivered to centres for bat protection 34, 35, 36, 37 . Because all German bats are protected through the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ nature/legislation/habitatsdirective) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (www.eurobats.org), investigative research requires special permission by local government bodies. As part of a study on diseases in European bats 38 Table 3 ). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 60 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 30 sec, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Amplified DNA was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
