We conducted a retrospective study, analyzing the records of all the patients hospitalized between 2005 and 2015 for PM in our institution. We included patients with the diagnostic of PM based on appearance on Gram stain, a positive latex agglutination reaction of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples and/or a positive culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae (CSF culture or blood culture and concomitant meningitis). We defined "recurrent meningitis" as at least two episodes of meningitis, separated by a period of at least 4 weeks. Prospective study realized in the Matei Balș Institute between October 2015 -July 2016, including 55 patients diagnosed with sepsis. There were evaluated: number of SIRS criteria, primary sites of infection, incriminated germs, organ failures, septic metastases and there were calculated two scores of severity -APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APS (Admission Point Score) and the estimated mortality rate. The statistical analysis was realized using SPSS. We performed a prospective single center study that included consecutive cases of sepsis admitted in Matei Balș Institute. For each patient we determined NLCR at admission. Two groups of patients were created: group 1 with NLCR < 10 and group 2 with NLCR > 10. Clinical and biological parameters and also the severity calculated with APACHE IV and APS scores were comparatively analyzed between the two groups. Results Fifty-five consecutive patients with sepsis were analyzed, with mean age of 57.92 years old and sex ratio F:M = 1.75:1. Group 1 included 21 patients with NLRC <10 (38.18 %) and group 2-34 patients with NLRC >10 (61.82 %). The comparative analysis between the two groups showed: more patients with 3 or 4 criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the second group (55.88 % vs. 42.85 %), more patients with identified etiology in the second group (32.32 % vs. 14.28 %) but without statistical significance (p = 0.2543), more patients with at least one organ dysfunction (76.47 % vs. 52.38 %, p = 0.032) and with procalcitonin at baseline > 2 ng/mL (medium PCT in the first group = 2.88 ng/mL vs. medium PCT in the second group = 16.88 ng/mL) in the second group. The correlations of initial value of NLRC with the severity scores (APACHE IV and APS) and with the estimated mortality rate were statistically significant (p = 0.01). The last correlation was stronger than the one between procalcitonin and the mortality rate (p = 0.05). Conclusions NLRC more than 10 was associated with severity expressed through the number of SIRS criteria and the presence of organ dysfunction at baseline. The value of NLRC was correlated with severity appreciated with APACHE IV and APS scores and with the estimated rate of mortality. NLRC is an easy to obtain biomarker which can be very helpful in order to assess the severity of sepsis. Background Whooping cough is a highly contagious acute infectious disease caused by bacilli of the genus Bordetella pertussis, parapertussis and extremely rare in humans B. bronchiseptica with paroxysmal cough and variable impaired general condition, hematological changes and high risk of complications. We performed a prospective 4-year study conducted in National Institute for Infectious Diseases Prof. Dr. Matei Balș, Bucharest between 2012 and 2016, in which we included all orthopedic sonicated implants sent from the regional centers. The implants were sonicated at 40 kHz on BactoSonic® ultrasonic bath (Bandelin, Germany) and the sonication fluid was cultured on both aerobe and anaerobe media. The period of incubation was 7 days for aerobe culture and 14 days for anaerobe cultures, respectively. Vitek®2 Compact automated system (Healthcare, BioMérieux, USA) was used for bacteria identification and antibiotic susceptibility. The interpretation of the results was made according to the latest EUCAST breakpoints. The study was retrospective and included 24 diagnosed cases of infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hospitalized in the Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases, University of Medicine and Pharmacy "Gr.T.Popa" Iaşi, in the period 2013-2016. We conducted a 5 years study from Jan 2011 to Dec 2015 on 2851 children admitted in our pediatric intensive care unit of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases for severe forms of SIRS and bacterial sepsis. Some of them were immunosuppressed. We watched the correlation of data obtained by hemocultures, CSF cultures versus PCR and the clinical evolution of the patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with Streptococcus suis infection between January 2005-December 2015 in one tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. We also reviewed the Steptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, according to the microbiological method confirming the etiology. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests of KP strains isolated from blood between January 1 st 2010 -December 31 st 2010 and between January 1 st 2015 -December 31 st 2015 were analyzed. We compared the resistance trend between these two periods. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We performed a retrospective study (01.01.2011 -06.01.2016 ) analyzing blood cultures results collected from patients hospitalised in the Infections Disease and Pneumology Clinics of "Victor Babeş" Hospital from Craiova. The antibiotics resistance of 180 S. aureus strains isolated from blood cultures was analyzed based on the results of disc diffusion sensitivity testing. The methicillin-resistant strains presented an inhibition zone around the disk of cefoxitin (30 mcg) under 22 mm. The results' evaluation was carried out by comparing percentage differences and by performing the Chi 2 test. We have performed a pilot experimental study in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș", treating six patients with combined therapy: antibiotics and bacteriophages. The study received Ethics Committee approvals: Matei Balș c/5101/02. 10.2014 and Carol Davila 47/26.01.2015 . The pathogenic agents were evaluated for phage susceptibility to commercial Georgian phage cocktails, namely Pyo and Intesti (Eliava BioPreparations, Tbilisi, Georgia) . We included in the study patients failing antibiotic therapy, with hard-to-treat infections due to antibiotic resistant bacteria, biofilm formation or hard to sterilize infection sites. Phages were administered orally or/and topically. The study was conducted between January 1 st 2015 -July 31 st 2016 by collecting swabs from criteria based selected patients: pharyngeal (908), nasal (880) and rectal (823). A total of 2,611 swabs were processed in 19 months' interval. The targeted microorganisms were MRSA, vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and other multidrug resistant Gramnegative bacteria. Swabs were inoculated on appropriate chromogenic culture media from Oxoid, UK (Brilliance MRSA agar, Brilliance VRE agar, Brilliance ESBL agar) and were interpreted at 24-48 hours of incubation at 37°C, aerobic atmosphere. All microorganisms were identified and tested for susceptibility to antimicrobials by MicroScan Walk Away 96 Plus (Siemens, USA). EUCAST guidelines were used for interpretation. The KPC, MBL and OXA-48 Confirm kits (Rosco Diagnostica, Denmark) were used to determine the carbapenemase-producing strains. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance has remained at low levels (0.5-1.5 %) and no strains have been resistant to linezolid and vancomycin. The incidence of resistance was higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci, most isolated from blood, 60.5-81.7 % for oxacillin, 21.2-42.1 % for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The incidence of penicillinresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from invasive infections decreased from 37.5 % in 2010 to 12.0 % in 2015. Enterococcus faecium was more resistant compared with Enterococcus faecalis to all tested antimicrobials, for gentamicin with 45.7-75.5 % compared with 38.7-61.5 % and for ciprofloxacin 35.7-64.5 % compared to 85.7-100 %. The first vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains were isolated in 2012 with an incidence of 4.3 % which reached 35.0 % in 2014. Only two Enterococcus faecalis vancomycinresistant strain were isolated, one in 2013 and one in 2014. Streptococcus pyogenes resistance to erythromycin increased significantly over time from 7.6 % in 2010 to 16.9 % in 2015. The analysis is based on antimicrobial resistance data collected by NIPH for 2012-2015 and national antibiotics sales for 2011-2015, provided by IMSHealth Romania. The European level data were obtained from EARS Net and ESAC Net newest reports. The current study reviewed 78 cases of health care-associated meningitis or ventriculitis which were treated in "Sf Parascheva" Infectious Diseases Hospital Iași from January 2011 to December 2015. We analyzed the clinical data obtained in our ICU department over a period of 6 months in 2016 and outlined the main patterns involved in the occurrence and evolution of nosocomial infections. The main sources of nosocomial infections were venous and arterial catheters responsible for bloodstream infections (4 cases), orotracheal intubation (5 cases) causing severe ventilator-associated pneumonia and bladder catheterization responsible for most cases of urinary tract infections (4 cases). Every nosocomial infection's ethology was analyzed and correlated to its clinical impact. Suggestive signs developed when peripheral catheters were implanted and fever was the first sign of catheter-associated bloodstream infection. The purulent aspect of pulmonary secretions in intubated patients was the first omen of VAP. The turbid aspect of urine indicated a potentially hospital-acquired infection in patients with bladder catheterization. The study involved 20 patients with chronic viral hepatitis: B -10 patients (Group I), and C -10 patients (Group II), among them in Group I -7 men and 3 women, and in Group II -4 and 6, respectively. The patient examination included physical exam, biochemistry tests (ALT, AST, GGT), complete blood count, molecular biology assays (HBV DNA and HCV RNA quantification by PCR). Viusid was prescribed as follows: 1 sachet 3 times daily (every 8 hours) for 3 months. The patient physical examinations were performed monthly, and the laboratory testsat the beginning and at the end of treatment. This is a prospective study of patients with HCV genotype 1 Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, treated with OPrD-ribavirin regimen, in the Third Department of Matei Balș Institute. We analyzed the patients who developed hyperbilirubinemia during antiviral therapy in order to identify the risk factors for this side effect. The management of these patients was also analyzed. The statistical analysis was made with open-epi 3.0 program. We performed a prospective analysis of all patients with HCV compensated cirrhosis treated in Third Department of Matei Balș Institute since November 2015 until July 2016. We included all patients who underwent at least four weeks of antiviral therapy. We analyzed the evolution of clinical and biological parameters and also the trend of HCV viral load. We performed a prospective study of HCV Child A cirrhotic patients monitoring in Third Department of Matei Balș Institute who developed liver decompensation during OPrD therapy. We correlated the liver decompensation with some clinical and biological characteristics at baseline. We performed a prospective study using the database of cirrhotic patients treated with OPrD-riba regimen in Third Department of Matei Balș Institute. All the adverse events that occurred in these patients were introduced into a database and we established the correlation between the regimen and each side effect, the grade of each side effect and also its management. We performed a prospective study in which we enrolled all the patients known with compensated cirrhosis who received vouchers for access to the therapy (FibroMax, viral load and HCV genotyping test). The current status of each patient was analyzed. Results 120 patients were included in the DAA therapy program in Third Department of Matei Balș Institute. Among them: 88 (78.33 %) received the approval, 17 patients are awaiting the approval (14.16 %), 3 patients were ineligible despite F4 fibrosis due to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and 12 (10 %) had fibrosis less than F4 and were ineligible according to the local guideline. From our patients only 92 (76.66 %) had F4 fibrosis according to the FibroMax. In 4 cases the previous fibrosis investigated by FibroMax or Fibroscan was F3 and the patients had severe comorbidities. Despite these data, the evaluation of FibroMax during the National Program showed F2 fibrosis and were ineligible for DAA therapy. In one case, the result of FibroMax was F2 but the patient had significant clinical signs of cirrhosis and the therapy was approved. For twentytwo patients the FibroMax showed F3 fibrosis (19.16 %). However, they were known with compensated cirrhosis previously diagnosed by: FibroMax, Fibroscan, liver biopsy or by clinical findings like esophageal varices. Among them, 15 patients were considered eligible for therapy (65.21 %): 11 patients have already received the approval (78.57 %) and 4 patients are awaiting the commission's decision. Eight patients without clinical signs of cirrhosis were declared ineligible (34.78 %), despite the previous evaluation of fibrosis by non-invasive methods. We present a series of 3 cases of viral reactivation following discontinuation of Entecavir (ETV), administered for chronic HBV. Prospective study of the HCV cirrhotic patients treated with OPrDribavirin regimen from November 2015 until July 2016 in Third Department of Matei Balș Institute which analyzed the dynamic of hemoglobin level and platelet count during 12 weeks of DAA therapy. We have performed a cross sectional study based on a standardized questionnaire and serologic tests to assess the prevalence of risk factors for transmission of viral hepatitis in two study groups. The Z-test was used for checking the statistical significance of the proportions of specific risk factors in the two groups. We performed a prospective study that include patients with HM treated with rituximab containing chemotherapy and anti HCV positive. The patients were monitored in the 3 rd department of the Prof. Dr. Matei Balș National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Bucharest, Romania, between 2008-2014. Anti HCV, HCV-RNA (by PCR) and biochemical tests were measured at baseline and every three months. Viral reactivation was defined as ≥1log 10 IU/mL increase of HCV-RNA following chemotherapy. The study employed 40 assessments of the serum IFN γ level in 5 patients between 25-36 years hospitalized in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Bucharest, Romania with chronic HCV infection, genotype 1 and F2 hepatic fibrosis who received treatment with peginterferon-α 2a 180 mcg weekly and ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/day. All patients showed undetectable HCV RNA viral loads after the first 3 months of treatment and remained undetectable over the next 2 years of follow-up. The study performed a comparative analysis (before/after treatment) on the serum levels of IFN γ (ELISA, Bio Scientific) in the first 6 months of interferon α treatment. We implemented a nationwide screening program for chronic viral infections, which also included a standardized questionnaire for assessing the prevalence of risk factors for HBV, HCV or HIV transmission in the general population in Romania. The statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (Armonk, USA). We have analyzed the evolution of liver fibrosis as assessed by shearwaves elastography on Aixplorer (SuperSonic Imagine, France) in patients with chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis, treated with the 3D regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir (AbbVie, USA). Liver stiffness was determined at baseline, at the end of 12 weeks of treatment and at a follow-up visit at 12 weeks post-treatment. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman's rankorder correlation in SPSS Statistics for Windows (v22.0, IBM Corp, USA). We assessed 21 patients diagnosed with chronic HCV genotype 1b who received combination therapy with sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) for 12 weeks. Patients with cirrhosis were not included in our study. The degree of fibrosis was established by Fibroscan and Fibromax. The study carried out in 2015 at the Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology "Prof. Dr. Panait Sârbu" from Bucharest refers to a number of 9 HIV positive patients diagnosed with thrombophilia. We performed a prospective study on 27 patients (17 women, 10 men, aged 22-71 years) with HCV infection and 6 controls hospitalized in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș" Bucharest, Romania. Of the 27 patients, 15 had recently received treatment with peginterferon and ribarivin and showed negative RNA HCV viral loads, 2 patients were cured following acute HCV infection and 10 were untreated (positive RNA HCV viral loads). The study recorded the serum level of LL37 (Elisa Hycult Biotech) and IFN ɣ (Elisa, Bioo Scientific) along with liver injury markers: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin (Bil) and CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphocyte count (flowcytometry). We investigated 32 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients (with no treatment, without neurologic manifestations) and 32 non-HIV-infected volunteers. The determination of antiganglioside antibodies of IgM type directed against GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b was performed by immunoblot technique, using EUROLine kits. The evaluation of the results was realized using EUROLine scan software. After reading the signal intensity on the strips marked with ganglioside antigens, the interpretation of the results was made. A cut-off value equal to 10 was established (according to manufacturer's instructions). The results were considered positive at values of the signal intensity greater than 10, and negative at values lower than 10. We have performed many studies regarding cases of measles during the last years hospitalized in Clinic II of Infectious Diseases of V. Babeș Hospital Timișoara. We have performed a retrospective study of the 2015-2016 influenza season in one pediatrics ward of a tertiary-care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. We collected demographic, clinical and microbiological data regarding influenza disease characteristics and outcome, and regarding the incidence and outcome of pneumococcal colonization/ infection. We hereby report the preliminary results of this study. Faced with an increased number of enteroviruses associated infections, during the summer season of 2016, the present paper analyzes the managed cases in the pediatric department of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș" -Bucharest, referring specially to the severe and challenging cases, particularly towards the ones with associated meningoencephalitis. Retrospective analysis of cases hospitalized in the period December 2015 -April 2016, confirmed with influenza AH1N1 virus, with severe respiratory failure (ARF). We highlight clinical data, biological, viral, and biological imaging specific to each patient. In our study we included 136 subjects divided into 4 groups: group A -40 patients with viral infections (HIV, HCV, HBV), group B -40 patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma, group C -16 patients with malignant melanoma associated with viral infections and group D -40 healthy subjects. The determination of serum levels of IL-6, sIL-6R and soluble glycoprotein (sgp) 130 was performed by ELISA technique. We followed in this study 50 patients hospitalized in our clinic within 5 years. Patients in the study were diagnosed with acute B type hepatitis in patients with positive HBsAg. Have observed that our patients with persistent HBsAg over 3 months in 19 patients presenting more frequently than unfavorable evolution towards healing. We have performed a retrospective study to assess the prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi identified through smears and cultures of vaginal and cervical discharge collected from pregnant patients attending one gynecology/obstetrics ward of a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania from July 2015 to July 2016. The statistical analysis included the Chi-square test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test for continuous variables, and was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics v.22 (Armonk, USA). We performed a retrospective study to ascertain the prevalence of GBS colonization/infection during July 2015-July 2016, in pregnant patients monitored in a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest, Romania. We have studied the incidence of acute Toxoplasma, rubella and CMV infection (serum IgM screening) and the seroprevalence of serum IgG antibodies in pregnant females attending a reference center for obstetrics-gynecology in Romania. The study was implemented through the Norwegian Financial Mechanism and access to the screening program was available to pregnant females from all over Romania in any trimester of pregnancy. To date, 500 patients have been screened for TORCH in this project. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics for Windows (v22.0, IBM Corp, USA), using Pearson Chi-squared test for multi-group comparisons and independentsamples t-test for normally-distributed continuous variables. Monitoring and analysis of clinical data, biological imaging, microbiological and evolution of gases in the blood, guides us on the effectiveness of therapy and management to follow. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of varicella complications in immunologically healthy children admitted to Infectious Disease Hospital of Brașov within the period January 2013 -July 2016, and to analyze the clinical and evolutive aspects of studied cases. We have carried out a retrospective study on all cases of acute C. difficile infection in children admitted in the Pediatric Department of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș" between 2013 and 2016. In all patients we have monitored age, sex, immunological status, clinical form of disease, and evolution under treatment. The diagnosis of colitis was established based on clinical criteria and confirmed through laboratory methods (detection of C. difficile A/B toxin from stool). All cases received treatment according to standard protocol except for one case where allergies to all antibiotics from the therapeutic schemes prompted us to perform fecal microbiota transplantation. Retrospective study (July 2015-December 2015) on hospitalized patients with CAP in Adult Infectious Diseases Clinics of "Victor Babeș" Hospital Craiova; we analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data and the evolution of cases. We retrospectively analyzed the HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (defined as at least 3 loose stools in 24 hours) admitted in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș", between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2015. Incident cases were defined as first positive C. difficile toxin A and/or B using enzyme immunoassay technique, or PCR for toxin A/B gene in stool samples using GENEXPERT method. The relapses of CDI were excluded from our study. Results 18 patients completed the inclusion criteria, representing a total of 24 % of the HIV-positive patients with diarrhea, and 75 % of the HIV-positive patients with infectious etiology of diarrhea, in which CDI was the most frequent agent. Male gender prevailed (61,19 %), with a mean age in our group of 40 years (ranging from 26 to 60 years) and an average hospitalization period of 27 days (ranging from 2 to 68 days). In 94.5 % of the cases, the diagnosis was established by PCR. 94.44 % of cases had previous hospitalizations within the last 3 months and 72 % had a recent antibiotic treatment, other than regimens used for opportunistic infection prophylaxis. As for the biological abnormalities, the mean WBC count was 6300/cmm (ranging from 1990 to 12690/cmm). The average value of CD4 cell count was 231 cells/cmm (ranging from 4 to 1044 cells/cmm Background Candida superficial mycosis are very common fungal infection, one of the most frequent being Candida stomatitis. It is usually associated with immunocompromised status and with certain nutrition habits. A serious epidemiological evaluation for Romania was not published, yet. The raw data were obtained from the Medical Statistic Direction of the Romanian Ministry of Health (2008-2012 data from the entire country). A statistical analysis based on usual methods (mean, standard deviation, Annova, Fisher tests, T Student, and other tests were performed in order to validate the results. We reviewed the data of the patients admitted with anthrax suspicion, in 3 infectious diseases (ID) hospitals from south-eastern Romania: National Institute ID-Bucharest, Pitesti-County Hospital and Constanța-ID Hospital, between January 2013 and August 2016. Along with ECDC definitions of "confirmed" and "probable", we used the category of "suspected" case from CDC* definitions. (*http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/ conditions/anthrax/case-definition/2010/). We designed a cross-sectional survey based on a self-administered printed questionnaire comprised of 26 questions. In June 2016, all medical doctors and nurses were invited to take part voluntarily and anonymously in the study. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel (2013) and IBM SPSS Statistics (v. 22). The study was conducted at the pediatric department of Teaching Hospital of Infectious Diseases, Cluj-Napoca, between February and March 2016. We performed a prospective clinical observational study among children 1-18 years of age, admitted to our department. All consecutive patients with infection were screened for sepsis criteria at admission and were stratified in two groups with and without sepsis. Serum vitamin D measurement was performed in all patients within 2 days of admission and deficiency was defined as concentration of 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL. Electronic database included age, gender, diagnosis, identified microorganisms, Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score (PRISM-III), hematological and biochemical characteristics. Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad-Prism5. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare nonparametric variables. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and clinical or biochemical variables was determined by relative risk and Spearman's rank correlation. We studied the clinical and epidemiological aspects and prophylaxis of Lyme disease among patients who presented with tick bites to the Clinical Infectious Disease Hospital "Toma Ciorbă", Chișinău, Republic of Moldova. We retrospectively analyzed HIV-infected patients diagnosed between January and December 2015 with TB in six tertiary care facilities in Romania. We included patients with diagnosis of DR-TB based on genotypic (MTB/RIF Xpert) and/or Löwenstein-Jensen culture plus drug susceptibility testing. The authors developed a prospective study on 55 patients with urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and 30 control cases. All the subjects were adults, with normal serum lipids, normal weight and a balanced diet. Serum profile of KIM-1 (ELISA method) was analyzed by correlation with markers of renal dysfunction. The renal function was evaluated by serum urea, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin/creatinine ratio and uric acid/creatinine ratio. The study included 60 subjects with benign prostate hyperplasia grouped, as follow: group A -30 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia with urinary tract infections, group B -30 cases of benign prostate hyperplasia without urinary tract infections. Gangliosides status by prostate specific antigen (PSA), C-reactive-protein (CRP), prostate volume and IPSS were determined. Serum levels of gangliosides were determined by spectrophotmoteric method using resorcinolclorhidre, evaluated at 580 nm. PSA was determined by ELISA, CRP by immunoturbidimetry. In the studied period (2013) (2014) (2015) , 180 cases of toxocariasis were admitted to the Iași Infectious Diseases Hospital. The isolates of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci were identified at species level using the Rapid ID 32 A system (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). We examined nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 646 patients diagnosed with SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) and admitted to 20 hospitals from six counties and Bucharest. Laboratory techniques: (1) real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of influenza viruses type A and type B; (2) multiplex RT-PCR commercial kit RT-PCR One-Step ACE Seeplex (Seegene) for the detection of other respiratory viruses, and (3) sequencing of a fragment of 212 base pairs of the gene SH RSV B for identification and confirmation of RSV. In the Cantacuzino Institute, antiviral susceptibility testing is performed mainly by phenotypic methods, only able to detect the degree of reduction of neuraminidase inhibition, respectively highly reduced inhibition (HRI) indicating a resistant influenza virus strain. The concentrations of the antiviral substance required to inhibit 50 % of the neuraminidase enzymatic activity (IC50) generated in this assay are used to evaluate the NAI-susceptibility. In the last epidemic season the use of fluorescent instead of chemiluminescent substrate was introduced in phenotypic assay, the method which led to a more reliable analysis, functional and increasing the number of samples tested. The viruses strains with significantly elevated IC50s are further analyzed by conventional sequencing to identify known markers of NAI resistance or novel changes in the NA. We conducted a retrospective study of hospital records of 15 patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital "T. Ciorbă" with the diagnosis of sepsis. Data elements assessed included demographic information, physiological variables, comorbidities, laboratory measurements, suspected source of infection, and administered treatment. Results A total of 15 patients were admitted. The most affected age range was 55-64 years and males were more commonly affected than women. The diagnosis of referral was as follows: 4 patients have been directed with sepsis, 2 patients came with acute or chronic hepatitis, 1 with acute respiratory infection, 1 with salmonellosis, and 7 patients had no diagnosis of reference. At admission the diagnosis of sepsis was established in 5 patients, fever of unknown origin in 4 patients, enteroviral infection in 2 patients, and in other cases the diagnosis of acute hepatitis, influenza, food poisoning and yersiniosis was established. The identification of the primary source of infection was possible in 8 patients: infectious endocarditis 2 cases, urogenital sepsis 2 cases, HIV + tuberculosis 1 case, generalized form of salmonellosis 1 case, 1 case of lung infection (medial-lobe pneumonia), and 1 case of skin infection. Identification of etiologic agent was possible in 10 patients by bacteriological examinations. The causative agents most frequently found were the species of Staphylococcus: Staphylococcus aureus -1 case, Staphylococcus epidermidis -3 cases, Staphylococcus hemolyticus -4 cases, 1 case of Salmonella enteritidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis -1 case. The most commonly used antibiotics were generation III and IV cephalosporins, alone or associated with other antibiotics: metronidazole, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and in 2 cases vancomycin ± 1 aminoglycoside was administered.
