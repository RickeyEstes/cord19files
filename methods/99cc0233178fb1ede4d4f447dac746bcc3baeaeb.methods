Nucleotide sequences of 256 gene segments (GenBank accessions CY061626-CY061881) from 32 swine influenza A genomes in (Vijaykrishna et al., 2010) were downloaded from the GenBank website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). The 32 swine viruses were collected from June 2009 to February 2010 in Hong Kong as part of the IGSP project funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (Vijaykrishna et al., 2010) . Sequences were aligned individually for each gene segment using the MUSCLE program (Edgar, 2004) . Recombination analysis was performed on the aligned sequences using RDP (Martin and Rybicki, 2000) , SEQ (Boni et al., 2007) , OnePop (Hao, 2010) and Max χ 2 (Smith, 1992) . Detected recombinant sequences were further assessed by classical statistical tests using R (R Development Core Team, 2009). Phylogenetic trees were initially constructed using a maximum likelihood method via the RAxML program (Stamatakis, 2006) under a GTR+Γ+I substitution model. To assess the robustness of the obtained phylogenetic trees, neighbor-joining trees were constructed using neighbor of the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein, 1989) version 3.6. Furthermore, two other maximum likelihood programs PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) and PUZZLE (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996) were applied on the same dataset using a variety of substitution models (including GTR+Γ+I). Phylogenetic incongruence between sequence regions defined by the break point identified by the recombination detection programs was examined by the approximately unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002) . In brief, the site-by-site likelihoods for the trees were calculated with PUZZLE (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996) , the AU-test was then implemented using CONSEL (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 2001) to assign the tree probabilities. Simulation studies were performed using the Seq-Gen program (Rambaut and Grassly, 1997) to generate phylogenetically related 2000-nucleotide sequences using the empirical base composition and transition/transversion ratio measured from the polymerase basic 2 protein (PB2) gene alignment using PUZZLE (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996) . The empirical base composition is 34.0% (A), 18.9% (C), 25.4% (G), 21.7% (T), and the transition/transversion ratio is 5.29. Recombinant sequences were artificially constructed between simulated nucleotide sequences. For simplicity, the recombination break point was assumed to be the middle of the sequences for all simulated recombinant sequences. Each constructed recombinant sequence and its parental sequences were then tested for recombination using the RDP program (Martin and Rybicki, 2000) as a representative of the recombination detection programs.
