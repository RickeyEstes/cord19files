Consider a network G(N, E) where N and E are the set of nodes and edges, respectively. For a given degree threshold d t , let G * (d t ) be the subnetwork of G, which is constructed by the whole nodes whose degree values are not larger than d t and the whole edges Let C 1 (d t ) and C 2 (d t ) correspond to the largest and the secondlargest connected components of G * (d t ), respectively. In this way, Let N(d t ) be the set of incoming nodes which is the node set difference between N * (d t ) and . .} (assign a unique label to each node), and then orderly add them into the network G * (d t − 1) one by one. In this way, the function C 2 (d t ; j) is constructed and the critical node j * is defined as: where  To illustrate how to determine the critical node, the largest connected component of the network of coauthorships between scientists [30, 31] is considered. In order to clearly understand, we obtain the experimental network ( Fig. 1(a) ) by removing the little isolated components after the removal of node 51 and node 52. After a node is immunized, id values are renumbered, but the ordering of nodes induced by the ids remains the same as in [31]. From Fig. 1(b) to Fig. 1(c) , C 2 (d t ) increases as d t increases. In Fig. 1(d) , the critical degree threshold d * t = 14 is obtained, and then the critical node 223 ∈ N(d * t ) is determined. The details of C 1 and C 2 of d t are shown in Fig. 2 where the critical node is that connecting the largest connected component with the maximal second-largest connected component. We also obtain the other critical nodes until the predetermined fraction of nodes to immunize by repeating this process on the largest connected component of the network after the critical node removal.
