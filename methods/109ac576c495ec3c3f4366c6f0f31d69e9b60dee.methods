The A&R System was designed to assist and support the MSPP in detecting and receiving, verifying, assessing, and urgently responding to cholera alerts requiring immediate action. This system started operating in early November of 2010 with the deployment of eight field teams and complemented the dedicated cholera surveillance system by adding an EWARN component, which is key for real-time monitoring of the spread of a disease and directing allocation of prevention and control resources across a country. Objectives. The initial A&R System objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cholera cases and (2) control the spread of cholera through early intervention at the community level. To achieve its objectives, the main activities of the system were to (1) identify and assess cholera alerts and hotspots and (2) organize a rapid response with partners to provide immediate support based on needs identified in the field (e.g., supplies, training, social mobilization, water, and sanitation). As the situation improved and the increased risk of disease transmission lessened, the objectives of the A&R System evolved to cover a broader range of public health risks, ultimately establishing the basis for an event-based surveillance within the Haitian national surveillance system in the context of the IHR (2005) requirements. 1 Principles and structure. The PAHO-MSPP A&R System was based on a network of partners supported by the health cluster mechanism that included any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The system was composed of a national alert team (an Alert and Response coordinator, an epidemiologist or public health expert with experience in event-based disease surveillance and disease control) based in Port-au-Prince and the PAHO/ WHO field teams based at the departmental level covering all departments in Haiti. During the first phase of the response, both the A&R coordinator/epidemiologist and the field teams were mainly staffed by GOARN personnel and supported by the PAHO/WHO structure. Essential to this system was a broad network of partners, including MSPP staff at national and departmental levels, partners from different response clusters (http://haiti .humanitarianresponse.info/), NGOs, the CDC, the BMC, the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and other UN agencies, public and private hospitals, local authorities or leaders, and other governmental and non-governmental institutions (Figure 1 ). Response Clusters consist of groups of humanitarian organizations (UN and non-UN) working in humanitarian action sectors, such as shelter and health. They are created when clear humanitarian needs exist within a sector, there are numerous actors within sectors, and/or national authorities need coordination support. They provide a clear point of contact for the partnerships created across international, national, and local authorities and civil society, and they are accountable for adequate and appropriate humanitarian assistance. 21 The UN's Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) decided in 2006 to organize international response in 11 groups or clusters, each led by a UN agency and composed of all UN system institutions and other international institutions and NGOs interested in the subject. The Health Cluster leadership was assigned to the WHO, signifying that it should ensure coordination of response activities by international actors in health in an affected country. 22, 23 Function. The operational hub of the A&R System was in Port-au-Prince, where alerts were received by the national alert team either directly through field teams, partners, and clusters or by e-mail and phone. The A&R coordinator analyzed and communicated alerts on a daily basis, characterizing hotspots and assessing the need for a response. The focal points in the field were the MSPP-PAHO/WHO A&R field teams. These teams consisted of two experts with experience in cholera: one expert being a field epidemiologist, public health officer, and/or medical officer (for instance, a case management and infection control expert) and the other expert being a logistician and/or water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist. The composition of these teams was initially mainly international staff, with a gradual incorporation of national staff, and it varied over time from five to eight teams covering all ten departments. The field teams' objectives were to (1) strengthen the epidemiological surveillance system (detection and alert) at the departmental level by training and assisting national officials in case and event detection, reporting, and data analysis; (2) support the response capacity, particularly to cholera (both at healthcare facilities and the community level), by training health professionals and setting up new CTUs, providing material resources, essential drugs and supplies, and establishing community brigades for social mobilization and health promotion; and (3) strengthen standards of clinical care and improve infection control practices, water and sanitation activities, and outbreak logistics at the local level by designing and distributing case management flowcharts, guidelines, and diagnosis and treatment protocols, training health and local staff, and providing water and sanitation to CTCs and CTUs. Operation. The primary operational components of the PAHO-MSPP A&R System were (1) the alert/early warning function; (2) a process of verification and assessment of alerts; and (3) a response function. (1) Alert/early warning function. The PAHO-MSPP A&R System initially focused on the detection of any cholera event requiring an immediate response through retrieving information on (a) first cases or deaths (in previously cholera-free areas), (b) deaths in the community (cholera or other cause), (c) significant increases of numbers of cases or deaths (in areas with confirmed cases of cholera as indicated by local partners and/or field team members), (d) insufficient treatment capacity (hospitals, CTCs, and CTUs), (e) need for partners, drugs, and/or equipment supplies or staff for the CTCs, CTUs, or ORPs, (f) lack of access to healthcare services and/or potable water, (g) lack of a sanitation strategy (body management and disposal and waste management), and (h) lack of training (for example, in case management or prevention). After the initial setting up of the A&R System, the alert criteria and the information and types of alerts to be collected were standardized, and specific collection forms were designed for daily and weekly reports. As the situation began to improve, the focus was widened to cover any event that could pose a public health risk using the framework established by the IHR (2005). The A&R coordinator in Port-au-Prince received reports by e-mail-dedicated gmail and yahoo addresses-or telephone (24 hours a day, 7 days a week); these contact details were widely distributed to all partners. Field teams reported alerts detected on the same day in the shortest time possible and at least on a daily basis, including reporting zero alerts if applicable. In addition to the daily reports, weekly reports were generated, highlighting the number of alerts received during the week, results from onsite investigations, contributing factors, and type of response conducted. This weekly report also contained the departmental epidemiological data from the cholera surveillance system as well as an analysis of gaps and constraints in surveillance and response. (2) Verification and assessment. After the information received was classified as an alert, verification was done as soon as possible (within the first 24 hours). This process was carried out either directly by the A&R coordinator or the field teams in place or through the network of partners in the field. Information received from official or reliable sources, such as health cluster members, was considered as verified, signifying no necessity for additional verification. After information was verified, a request was made to the source or direct investigation was done by the field teams (for instance, when facing conflicting information from different sources) for more details concerning approximate number of cases or deaths, time frame, specific location, accessibility, resources already in place, needs (if known), partners in the area, available partners and resources for the response. This investigation was done to (a) assess the public health risk posed by the reported event, (b) assess the need for and urgency of such a response, and (c) define the type of response and appropriate partners. (3) Response function. Response was coordinated at the national hub in Port-au-Prince by the A&R coordinator in collaboration with PAHO's Emergency Preparedness and Disaster (PED) Advisor and PAHO's Logistics Officer as well as staff from the MSPP or Civil Protection and in the field, through the PAHO/WHO field teams and MSPP staff at the departmental level (Health Directorate). In humanitarian emergencies, the arrival of many new players poses an additional challenge and compromises the capacity of understaffed and overwhelmed national and local authorities to lead the public health response and handle international aid. PAHO/WHO supported the MSPP to strengthen the coordination of these activities and avoid duplications to ensure an efficient and timely response and ensure that all partners contributed to a common strategy. This coordination was mainly done through the health and other cluster meetings. Most of the cluster meetings in the departments were organized by the PAHO/WHO field teams and at times, by an NGO. In departments where an MSPP cholera focal person was identified, coordination was more effective. However, because of a lack of human resources, this person quite often ended up being the MSPP Departmental Director. As a result, coordination was more difficult, because the directors had limited time due to competing obligations inherent to their positions.
