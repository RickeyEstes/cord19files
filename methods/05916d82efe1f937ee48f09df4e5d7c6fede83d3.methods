Layer architecture. In the numerical simulations, each layer is a scale-free network constructed by the preferential attachment algorithm 48 . The network structure is determined by a symmetric adjacency matrix A, whose elements A ij are 1 if there is a link connecting nodes i and j, and 0 otherwise. The degree, . The same network was used throughout all numerical simulations. Each simulation uses a different realization of the inhibitor's network G (v) , whose mean degree ( ) k v is varied between simulations. The superscripts (u) and (v) refer to activator and inhibitor. For convenience, the indices i (u) of nodes in the layer G (u) are assigned in order of decreasing degrees ( ) k i u : that is, . The nodes i (v) in the layer G (v) follow the ordering of their counterpart in G (u) , so for example node 1 in the inhibitor network (the most highly connected node) always corresponds to node 1 in the activator network, but the latter may or may not be highly connected. Multiplex networks. The multiplex networks used in our numerical simulations consist of two separate layers and two different types of links, intra-layer and inter-layer links. Intra-layer links are described by the adjacency matrices and limit the diffusional mobility of the species. Inter-layer links connect every node i (u) of layer G (u) to its counterpart i (v) in layer G (v) . They represent the reaction dynamics defined in the functions f(u i ,v i ) and g(u i ,v i ). Activator-inhibitor dynamics. We choose the Mimura-Murray model 42 . Substituting into equations (1-2), we obtain the linearized differential equations . Alternatively, the linearized differential equations can be written as dw/ / = d dt w  . Examining matrices Q 0 and Q 1 , the first has elements Non-uniform stationary pattern is shown in the activator layer G (u) (a) as well as in the inhibitor layer G (v) (b). Nodes in activator layer are ordered according to decreasing degree; nodes in the inhibitor layer are ordered correspondingly. c, Same pattern is shown in the actual multiplex network. Nodes in G (u) are plotted using a spring algorithm, so that, those having high degrees are placed in the center and those with small degrees in the periphery. Nodes in G (v) follow the same indexing. For convenience, intra-layer links are not shown, while from inter-layer links only few are chosen to be shown. This approximation neglects entirely the matrix Q 0 , which is associated with the precise architectures of the layers. Instead, each node is characterized only by its degree. This is quite similar to the powerful mean-field methods used for analyzing Turing patterns in single-layer networks 26, 27 , and is always valid for multiplex networks consisting of layers with large mean degrees. Amplitude of non-uniform patterns. The amplitude of a non-uniform pattern is quantified as
