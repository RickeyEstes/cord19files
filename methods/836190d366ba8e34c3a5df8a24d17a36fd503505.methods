Homology modeling of 2019-nCoV S-RBD structure. The amino-acid sequence of 2019-nCoV Sprotein was taken from the first genome sequence of a 2019-nCoV isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) deposited in GenBank on January 12, 2020 (GenBank No: MN908947.3) . The initial structure of S-RBD was built according to standard modeling procedure on the SWISS-MODEL server at https://swissmodel.expasy.org, by submitting its amino-acid sequence in Fig. 2A and then selecting the SARS-CoV S-RBD structure (PDB 2AJF) as the modeling template. With the obtained model, highresolution all-atom refinements were then carried out to optimize the conformations of the protein backbone and side-chains with the relax program of the Rosetta software suite (Das and Baker, 2008) . And the Rosetta all-atom energy function 2015 (REF15) (Alford et al., 2017) Local protein-protein docking. The docking program of Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2008) was used to carry out the local protein-protein docking with the starting conformation of a given S-RBD-ACE2 complex. The Rosetta energy function 2015 (REF15) was employed in the docking to evaluate the interaction energy of two docking components (i.e., S-RBD and ACE2). For each S-RBD-ACE2 pair, at least 3,000 independent docking simulations were performed to generate a large number of thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations for calculating the binding freeenergy. The top-scoring, lowest-energy conformations were identified as the native-like conformations of the S-RBD binding to ACE2. The local protein-protein docking protocols are:
