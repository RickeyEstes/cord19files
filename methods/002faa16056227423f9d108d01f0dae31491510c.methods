The influenza vaccination program is organized once annually (started in 2004) for all employees of the hospital and held over a 2-to 3-week period from late September to early October. The influenza vaccine is offered at no cost to the employees. In 2004 and 2005, 3 vaccination booths were set up at convenient locations within the main hospital building for easy access by employees. Employees reported at these vaccination booths to receive influenza vaccination from nurses at the booths. In 2005, on-site arrangements for influenza vaccination through the use of mobile vaccination teams and same-service area vaccination arrangements were organized to improve influenza vaccination rates: 1) mobile vaccination teams-each team comprised a nurse and an assistant; the team would proceed to the departments located at a distance from the main hospital building to vaccinate the employees of these departments; 2) sameservice area vaccination arrangement-an arrangement to provide on-site vaccination to employees who worked in a same working or service area within the hospital (eg, the operating theatres and the specialist outpatient clinics area). The hospital's pharmacy delivered the influenza vaccines to the service area, and designated nursing team members on the service area would then vaccinate employees on-site. The influenza vaccination data of employees were captured electronically during the vaccination period. Reporting and influenza vaccination rates of on-site arrangements and vaccination booths were calculated and compared by chi-square tests. Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical program SPSS (version 11.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
