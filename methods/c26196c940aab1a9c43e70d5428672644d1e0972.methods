Two software tools enabling adaptive model-assisted control applying unstructured, unsegregated models have been developed and implemented using MATLAB Â© , WinErs and Fortran, one tool for fedbatch control and another one for seed train simulation and optimization. The Genethon rAAV-8 process was transferred to an iCELLis Nano bioreactor 0.8 m 2 (2 cm bed height, 144 gm/L density) bioreactor using FreeStyle media. The initial iCELLis Nano process was established as (1) seed on Day 1, (2) transfect at Day 5, (3) harvest at Day 8 and yielded <1x 10 9 vp/cm 2 (n=3). Media exchange, cell density at transfection, pDNA/cell ratio, and lysis method were then changed to determine the effect on productivity. The modified process was then scaled from 0.8 m 2 to 4.0 m 2 (10 cm bed height, 144 gm/L density) iCELLis Nano bioreactor.
