Cells, drugs and viruses. HEK-293T and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MDCK cells were grown in Modified Eagle's Medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS. Cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was added to the medium at the time of infection (100 μ g/mL). Influenza viruses A/Paris/908/97(H3N2) and A/Udorn/307/72(H3N2) were provided by the National Influenza Center at the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). The A/WSN/33(H1N1) and A/Paris/650/2004(H1N1) viruses were produced by reverse genetics as described in ref. 55 . The VSV (Indiana strain) virus was kindly provided by O. Delmas (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The Adenovirus 5 was kindly provided by P. Fortes (Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain). The recombinant A/WSN/33 viruses expressing a PB2 protein fused to Gluc1 or to the Strep-tag were described previously 29, 56 . The recombinant A/WSN/33 virus expressing a Nanoluc protein was produced by reverse genetics using a pPolI-PB2-Nanoluc plasmid (described below). Plasmids. The Gateway entry plasmids containing the DDX ORFs were obtained from the human ORFeome resource. To generate vectors encoding Gluc2-, GlucFL-, and Strep-DDX fusion proteins, the ORFs were transferred respectively into a Gateway-compatible pSPICA-N2 57 , pGlucFL or pIBA105-GW destination plasmid (kindly provided by C. Demeret and Y. Jacob, respectively). Directed mutagenesis of the Gateway DDX19B entry plasmid was performed using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). The siRNA resistant DDX19B cDNA was designed in silico and produced by GenScript. The reverse genetics plasmid pPolI-PB2-Nanoluc was produced by replacing the Gluc1 sequence of pPolI-PB2-Gluc1 plasmid 29 with a sequence encoding the self-cleaving 2A peptide from porcine teschovirus followed by the Nanoluc coding sequence, as described in ref. 58 . The Nanoluc template was kindly provided by P. Palese and N. Heaton (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA). All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for amplification and sequencing can be provided upon request. Scientific RepoRts | 6:33763 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33763 Antibodies and immunoblots. Unless otherwise noted, protein extracts were prepared in Laemmli buffer. Immunoblot membranes were incubated with primary antibodies directed against DDX19 (NB100-760, Novus Biologicals), A/PR/8/34 virions 59 , NS1 (kindly provided by Daniel Marc, INRA-Tours, France), M1 (GA2B, Pierce), HA (Genetex), NA (Genetex), GAPDH (Pierce), TPB (Cell Signaling), MEK1/2 (L38C12, Cell Signaling), Gaussia luciferase (New England Biolabs), and revealed with secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) or peroxidase-conjugated Strep-Tactin (IBA), and with the ECL 2 substrate (Pierce). The chemiluminescence signals were acquired using G-Box and the GeneSnap software (SynGene). siRNA-based assays. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools or individual siRNAs and Non-targeting Control pool). Cells were transfected with 25 nM of siRNA using the DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Viability Assay kit (Promega). To control the efficiency of siRNAs targeting DDXn genes, siRNA-treated A549 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a DDXn protein fused with the full-length Gaussia luciferase (pGlucFL-DDXn) using polyethylenimine PEI (Polysciences Inc). The luciferase activity was measured 24 h later in cell lysates using the Renilla luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and a Berthold CentroXS luminometer. For screening purpose, A549 cells were infected at 48 hpt with the WSN-PB2-Nanoluc virus at a m.o.i. of 0.0001 pfu/cell. For rescue experiments, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 50 nM of a combination of DDX19A and DDX19B siRNAs using the INTERFERin reagent (Polyplus), and with the pStrep-DDX19B or empty vector using the FuGENE reagent (Promega). The cells were infected at 24 hpt with the WSN-PB2-Nanoluc virus at a m.o.i. of 0.01 pfu/cell, and the luciferase activity was measured at 24 hpi using the Nanoluc Luciferase kit (Promega). For multi-cycle and single-cycle infection assays, A549 cells were infected at 48 hpt at low and high m.o.i., respectively, as described in ref. 60 . Plaque assays on MDCK cells were performed as described in ref. 61 . AdV was titrated by immunostaining as described in ref. 62. Subcellular fractionation. A549 cells were pelleted at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% Igepal), and incubated for 2 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 8 min, and the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol), and high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.4 M KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol) was added before incubation on a spinning wheel for 30 min. The insoluble nuclear fraction was pelleted at 10,000 g for 15 min, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs were extracted using sequentially Trizol LS (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
