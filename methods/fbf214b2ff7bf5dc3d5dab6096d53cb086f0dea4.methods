We estimated R 0 under current and future projected climatic conditions at 30 sites in Canada that formed two roughly southnorth transects in Ontario and Quebec, two Canadian provinces where I. scapularis ticks are becoming established. These transects were chosen to capture the climate variability that exists in the region. For simplicity in data presentation, the sites were grouped into clusters [Southern Ontario, Huron Ontario, Upper Southern Ontario, South-Western Quebec, and the Boreal region (see Supplemental Material, Table S1 and Figure S1 )] according to geographic proximity and similarity in temperature conditions (see Supplemental Material, "Variation in temperature and R 0 amongst sites," pp. 2-6, Figures S2-S4) , and mean values for clusters are presented. We also estimated R 0 for two sites in the United States where Lyme disease is endemic in the Northeast and upper Midwest, respectively: Old Lyme (Connecticut), where the human Lyme disease cases were first recognized (Wood and Lafferty 2013) , and Fort McCoy (Wisconsin) (Anderson et al. 1987) . Modeling R 0. The I. scapularis model is a deterministic model consisting of 12 ordinary differential equations as described by Wu et al. (2013) , based on the mechanistic simulation model described by Ogden et al. (2005) . This model captures the effects of temperature on host-seeking activity and the rates of development from one life stage to the next (effects common to, but variable among, all arthropod vectors), parame terized from field and laboratory studies on I. scapularis. Mortality rates of nonfeeding I. scapularis in Canada and the northeastern United States are similar in summer and winter, presumably due to the insulating effects of the litter layer in woodland habitats (Brunner et al. 2012; Lindsay et al. 1995) . Our analyses operated on the hypothesis that the effects of ambient temperature on I. scapularis population survival are indirect via effects on temperature-dependent rates of development of ticks from one life stage to the next. The lower the temperature, the longer is the tick life cycle and, due to constant daily per capita mortality, the fewer larval ticks survive to become mated adult female ticks. At a threshold temperature, mortality outstrips reproduction and the tick populations die out (or fail to become established)-that is, at this temperature, threshold R 0 falls below unity (Ogden et al. 2005) . At the latitudes under study here, effects of climate change on I. scapularis are expected to be the effect of climate warming on shortening the life cycle, resulting in increasing R 0 (Ogden et al. 2006b ). Quadratic effects of temperature on arthropod vector life history traits are common (Mordecai et al. 2013) , and quadratic effects of temperature on tick activity are included in the model. High temperatures may impact tick survival, causing a northward contraction of the southern range of I. scapularis, resulting in a northward shift, rather than overall expansion, of the geographic range of climatic suitability for I. scapularis (Brownstein et al. 2005) . Here we confined our study to Canada and the main regions of Lyme disease risk in the United States north of 40°N ). Impacts of rainfall on off-host tick survival and on hostseeking activity are considered accounted for in the model in assuming a) tick populations only become established in woodlands where the micro climate is suitable for tick survival, and b) most temperate woodlands types occur where rainfall is sufficient for I. scapularis survival, which is supported by studies in Canada (Lindsay et al. 1995) . Future projections for increased precipitation across much of Canada with climate warming are already being seen to occur (Environment Canada 2013), so rainfall changes are not expected to limit the northward spread of I. scapularis. For the present study, we modified the simulation model of Ogden et al. (2005) in order to calculate R 0 by the next generation operator as described by Wu et al. (2013) . Apart from the temperature values used to calculate tick development and host-finding rates, the values for host numbers (20 deer and 200 rodents) and all other parameter values were those used as starting values by Wu et al. (2013) . R 0 was estimated using mean monthly temperature data for each year and location as described in the following sections. Variations in host abundance affect the final size of the tick population but not the temperature threshold (Ogden et al. 2005) . The temperature threshold would be affected by variations in the mortality rates of ticks in the environment, and slight variations in this have been observed in the field (Ogden et al. 2006a ). For the sensitivity analysis of R 0 to variations in model parameter values, see Supplemental Material, "Model sensitivity analysis," pp. 7-11, Table S2 and Figures S5 and S6 . Modeling R 0 under current climate. For observed temperatures, we used Australian National University Splines (ANUSPLIN) (Hutchinson et al. 2009 ) of 10-km gridded daily time-series data, which were obtained by thin-plate smoothing spline interpolation of daily climate station observations while accounting for latitude, longitude, and elevation. ANUSPLIN data cover the 40 years that encompass the period of Lyme disease emergence in North America, have coverage across northern North America, and account for missing data by temporal and spatial interpolation. A mean daily near-surface temperature was assigned to the 32 study sites, which were weather stations located over a wide range of the orographic and forest eco systems of Ontario and Quebec or interpolations of ANUSPLIN data for locations in the United States. Monthly mean near-surface air temperatures were used to parameterize the I. scapularis population model for estimating annual values of R 0 for each site, for each year from 1971 to 2010 (see Supplemental Material, "Variation in temperature and R 0 amongst sites," pp. 2-6). Values for annual cumulative degree days > 0°C (DD > 0°C), contemporaneous for each estimated R 0 value, were computed as the accumulation of daily temperature > 0°C for each year for each site. The tick model calculated R 0 for each year using temperature data for that year, but in reality R 0 will depend on the temperature conditions over the 2-to 3-year life cycle of the tick. Therefore, we used the moving average of R 0 over 3 years (that year, the previous year, and the subsequent year) to describe R 0 for each year for each site; so for each site, we obtained a time series for R 0 and DD > 0°C for 38 years and DD > 0°C for 40 years . Modeling R 0 using projected climate data. An ensemble of modeled temperature data available from three regional climate model (RCM) and two global climate model (GCM) runs were used to estimate future changes in R 0 (see Supplemental Material, "Validation of climate model output," pp. 11-14; Table S3 ). We extracted time series of daily temperature for the 30 Canadian sites from each model. Simulated temperature at a given site was defined as the mean of the closest grid values to that site, increasing confidence in the physical representativeness (Gachon and Dibike 2007) . We chose bias-corrected output from Canadian RCM CRCM4.2.3, version 4 (Laprise et al. 1997; Music and Caya 2007) to provide temperature data for the I. scapularis model because it relatively accurately and conservatively hindcasted observed ANUSPLIN data in comparison with other climate models and because it provided projected temperatures at a local scale. (Meehl et al. 2000) . For future projections starting in 2001, we chose the A2 scenario (midhigh Green-House-Gas emission scenario) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000) because of the availability of regional climate model output using this scenario and because current actual trajectory of emissions corresponded best to this emissions scenario. Mapping R 0 under current and future climate. We mapped 30-year mean values of R 0 for I. scapularis using observed and projected values. Maps of DD > 0°C for North America north of 40°N and east of the Rocky Mountains were generated using observed data for 1971-2000, and using DD > 0°C projected by bias-corrected CRCM4.2.3 output for the period 2001-2070. We then computed R 0 for each year from the gridded DD > 0°C data using the formula R 0 = 1.072 × 10 -6 DD > 0°C-4.658 × 10 -3 DD > 0°C 2 + 5.556, obtained using observed temperature data as described in Supplemental Material, "Mapping R 0 ,"pp. 15-16, Figure S9 (the threshold for R 0 ≥ 1 was DD > 0°C ≥ 2859.6°C). We then mapped mean 30-year values for R 0 for the periods 1971-2000, 2011-2040, and 2041-2070 (Figure 2 ). Regions west of the Rocky Mountains were masked because it was assumed that I. scapularis will not cross the Rocky Mountains, west of which Lyme disease risk will continue to depend on transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi by the tick I. pacificus (Ogden et al. 2009 ). Literature search on R 0 ranges for parasite and pathogen systems. There are, to our knowledge, no equivalent estimates of how environmental changes may affect R 0 of vectors. However, to better comprehend the ecological or epidemiological importance of projected changes of R 0 of I. scapularis, we performed a literature review to obtain published estimates of how R 0 for parasites and pathogens varies due to changes in factors already recognized as having ecological or epidemiological importance. These include variations in geographic location, host density, strain or genotype, disease control effort, and variations among different epidemics. Articles were searched in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information PubMed search site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) using search terms a) "basic reproduction number," without specifying pathogens or parasites, and then b) "basic reproductive number," repeated with one of the following terms: tick, mosquito, chagas, malaria, dengue, nematode, "seasonal influenza," "pandemic influenza", pH1N1, "avian influenza," measles, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and fluke. Abstracts were reviewed, and relevant articles were reviewed in full. Relevant articles were those in which R 0 for parasites and pathogens was calculated to explicitly estimate its value under field, rather than theoretical, conditions. This meant articles that employed simulation models using field data, fitting of epidemiological data (e.g., ageseroprevalence or age-infection prevalence), or other methods such as estimates from phylogenetic analysis. We did not review and use R 0 ranges obtained in model-based sensitivity analyses, variations in R 0 associated with seasonal variations in mosquito abundance in one location (which may vary from zero to very high values), estimates where control methods effectively eradicated disease resulting in almost infinite values for changes in R 0 , or model-predicted variations across whole potential geographic ranges that range from a theoretical high to zero values (e.g., Estrada-Peña et al. 2013) . We also did not use some very high modeled ranges of R 0 for malaria [e.g., 1-11,000 (Smith et al. 2007 )] when the modeling of empirical age-infection prevalence data produced strongly contrasting single-digit estimates of R 0 (Hagmann et al. 2003; Hay et al. 2005) . The goal of the literature search was to provide an illustration of how important projected changes in R 0 of I. scapularis could be, compared with R 0 of other parasites and pathogens; it was not intended to be an exhaustive catalog ing of all literature in this field. Further, we recognized that R 0 estimates are not precise and vary according to the estimation method used (Heffernan et al. 2005; Li et al. 2011 ).
