The method of this study was derived from those of previous similar studies [17, [23] [24] [25] . Searches were completed in April 5, 2016, using the Scopus database. A search without any language restriction was performed to extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Scopus published by Elsevier is known to be the most common source of data for bibliometric studies in the sciences [17, [25] [26] [27] . Compared with other databases, such as PubMed or Web of Knowledge, its records provide more comprehensive coverage [28] of the toxocariasis literature. The terms "toxocar*", "nematode ophthalmitis", "visceral larva migrans", "ocular larva migrans", "Nematode endophthalmitis", "dog roundworm" and "cat roundworm" were used as keywords to search titles. These keywords were based on previous review articles [6, [29] [30] [31] . The asterisk (*) was applied as a wildcard and enabled the search for variations of key terms. For example, entering "toxocar*" in the Scopus search engine would include the following terms: toxocariasis, toxocarabriefly, any probable word that might start with the seven letters (i.e. 'toxocar'). Therefore, searching only titles would have resulted in data more related to the field of toxocariasis. No time period restriction was designated in the search concerning the start date, thus all publications prior to December 31, 2015, were included. In this study, a traditional bibliometric technique that included analysis of yearly publication output, languages, publication types, countries with their h-index, international collaboration research, source journals with their IFs, citation patterns and institutes was used. Documents published in 2016 or errata were excluded from the analysis. IFs were retrieved from the Journal Citation Reports (JCR 2014) [32] . The values of the h-index were extracted from the Scopus database for each country.
