The components of the systemic rapid assessment method, which represents the capacity for timely reporting, were analysed in previous studies with the Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) Toolkit, a framework that includes: External contexts such as demographic, economic, political, legislative, epidemiologic, socio-cultural and technological factors; stewardship, which refers to organisational systems and laboratory and drug networks; financing, resource generation and allocation; and healthcare provision and information systems [23, 24] . The framework provides conceptual and analytical guidelines for the evaluation of health systems and infectious disease control programs and echoes the national responsibilities required by IHR 2005 [24] . Therefore, we collected transparency data and measurements based on this framework for further analysis.
