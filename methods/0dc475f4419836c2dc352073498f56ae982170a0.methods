In order to investigate the age-related prevalence of each respiratory pathogen, we retrospectively studied the results of all the samples, which had been processed during 1 year-period (November 2015 to November 2016) with the FA-RP, in the Central Laboratories of Hygeia & Mitera General Hospitals of Athens, Greece. Among 656 respiratory samples (Rs) tested, 362 (55%) were from male and 294 (45%) from female patients, while the median age of these 656 patients was 7 years old (0.1-92). In order to have an age-related distribution, the following age groups were implemented: (<2), (≥2, <5), (≥5, <10), (≥10, <18), (≥18, <45), (≥45, <65) and (≥65) years old. Ethical approval and/or patient consent were not necessary, because the paper does not report on primary research and all data analyzed were retrospectively collected as part of routine diagnosis.
