Data collection for this study was carried out using Scopus database. The methodology used was similar to that described in previously published bibliometric studies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Keywords used for data extraction were obtained from published review articles on carbapenem resistance. Search query used for data extraction from Scopus looked like this: (TITLE("carbapenem resist*" OR "imipenem resist*" OR "meropenem resist*" OR "ertapenem resist*" OR "doripenem resist*" OR "carbapenemase produ*" OR "carbapenem non-susceptible" OR "carbapenem hdroly*ing") AND PUBYEAR < 2016) OR ((TITLE-ABS-KEY(Ndm-1 OR "New Delhi metallo*" OR "carbapenemase" OR "extended-spectrum *lactamase*") AND TITLE-ABS("carbapenem resist*")) OR ((TITLE ("coli" OR "enterobacter*" OR "aeruginosa" OR "baumannii" OR "klebsiella")) AND KEY("carbapenem resist*")) AND PUBYEAR < 2016) AND (LIMIT-TO(SRCTYPE, "j")) AND (EXCLUDE(DOCTYPE, "er")) The asterisk was used for certain words to retrieve all potential correct words while the quotation marks were used to retrieve correct and exact phrases. Validity of the search query was confirmed by manual analysis of the top 100 cited articles. In this study, manual analysis of the top 100 cited articles showed no deviation from required goal of retrieving articles on carbapenem resistance. The time span for data collection was all previous years until 2015. Retrieved documents were refined and limited to journal articles. Errata and undefined documents were excluded. Bibliometric indicators were presented as top ten productive countries, institutes, authors, journals, and highly cited articles. For evaluation of quality of publications, h-index, average number of citations per article, and total number of citations were used [13, [22] [23] [24] [25] . For quality of journals publishing articles on carbapenem resistance, impact factor (IF) and scientific journal rankings (SJR) were presented for each journal. Impact factors for journals were obtained from the latest Journal Citation Report published by Thompson Reuters [26] while SJR for journals were obtained from Scimago Journal Rank [27] . Poisson loglinear regression was carried out using the annual worldwide productivity as a dependent variable. Predictor independent variables were used as covariates in the model. The covariates were: number of publications produced annually by top three countries, number of articles with the keyword "hospital", and number of articles produced annually in the field of molecular biology/microbiology. Author co-citation analysis (ACA) was presented as density visualization map using VOSviewer techniques [28] .
