Details of the methods have been described previously [23] . Briefly, the study took place in 13 hospital sites in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between October 2004 and September 2005, 13-26 months after the resolution of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Eligible health-care workers included nurses in medical and surgical inpatient units and all staff of intensive care units, emergency departments and SARS isolation units in these hospitals. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of each hospital. Participants were surveyed in two waves. The first wave consisted of a survey that included the demographic indices, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and measures of symptoms and sick days. Of the 769 health-care workers (668 women and 101 men) who completed this survey, 180 (163 women and 17 men) also participated in a second wave (Survey B + diagnostic interview), which included a measure of adult attachment. Subjects who participated or did not participate in Survey B were compared on a wide range of psychological and demographic indices and found to be similar [23] . In addition, participants in the second wave did not differ from those who participated only in the first wave with respect to sleep indices. Since the relationships that are tested in this study may vary with sex and the number of men who completed Survey B is small, we report here only on the women who completed all of the measures analyzed in this report (n=141), excluding 10 further subjects who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for current major depression as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [24, 25] .
