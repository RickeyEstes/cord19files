A descriptive study was developed, using secondary data during the years 2009 and 2010. Data were obtained from the national base, the pandemic "influenza" module of SINAN, requested from the Ministry of Health, with records identified nominally. The definitions of a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and of SARS caused by influenza were those used by the Ministry of Health in Brazil. (1) The criteria for cases discarded of SARS caused by influenza are: case in which no infection by the influenza virus has been detected, cases in which another disease has been diagnosed, or suspect cases with an epidemiological link to cases discarded as per laboratorial findings. (1, 27) The databases were submitted to the process of double verification, using the RecLink IIIâ„¢ software. The Epi Info version 3.5.4. software was used for the descriptive analysis.
