Translation assays. We used a variant of the original dnaX frameshifting site as described previously 20 . The mRNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase 43, 44 and purified using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. All mRNAs had the same length and contained the native stem-loop structure, but differed in the slippery site sequence, as shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Ribosomes from E. coli MRE 600, EF-Tu, EF-G, and initiation factors, were prepared according to detailed protocols 37, [45] [46] [47] [48] . fMet-tRNA fMet Phe-tRNA Phe , Val-tRNA Val , Ile-tRNA Ile , Glu-tRNA Glu , Lys-tRNA Lys , and Leu-tRNA Leu (CUN) were prepared as described previously 20, 49 . Ala-tRNA Ala and Gln-tRNA Gln were prepared by hydrophobic tagging 49 . Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. Concentrations of aa-tRNAs were determined photometrically by absorbance measurements at 260 nm and by liquid-liquid scintillation counting where applicable (Ultima Gold XR, Perkin Elmer). The experiments were carried out in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 70 mM NH 4 Cl, 30 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl 2 ) supplemented with GTP (1 mM) at 37°C. To prepare initiation complexes, 70S ribosomes (1 μM) were incubated with a 3−5-fold excess of mRNA, a 1.5-fold excess of f[ 3 H]Met-tRNA fMet and a 1.2-fold excess of IF1, IF2, and IF3 each in buffer A for 30 min. Initiation complexes were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion (1.1 M) in buffer A. Ternary complexes were prepared by incubating EF-Tu (two-fold excess over aa-tRNA) together with GTP (1 mM), phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mM), and pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml) in buffer A for 15 min and then with the purified aa-tRNAs for 1 min. Translation experiments were performed in buffer A at 37°C either as end-point experiments (60-120 s incubation) by hand or using a KinTek RQF3 quench-flow apparatus. Translation experiments were carried out by rapidly mixing initiation complexes (0.2 μM after mixing) with the respective ternary complexes as indicated (1 μM) and EF-G (2 μM) with GTP (1 mM). Reactions were quenched by the addition of KOH (0.5 M), and peptides were released by incubation for 30 min at 37°C. After neutralization with acetic acid, samples were analyzed by HPLC (LiChroSpher100 RP-8 HPLC column, Merck) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) in order to separate the basic (MAK and MAKK) peptides or in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution times of the reaction products were established using a set of model peptides synthesized in vitro, in which one of the amino acids is [ 14 C]-labeled 20 Supplementary Fig. 1c . An analogous model was used to evaluate peptide synthesis in the presence and absence of Glu-tRNA Glu . The fraction of non-progressing ribosomes was taken into account by drop-off parameters in the model. Standard deviations of rates were determined by numerical integration using in-built software routines assuming 95% confidence limit. All kinetic experiments were repeated at least twice. FS as a function of base-pair free-energy differences. For the −1 frameshifting of the dnaX mRNA, a stem loop downstream of the slippery sequence is essential 26 . The stem loop has been proposed to pause the ribosome, thereby increasing the time the tRNAs interact with the slippery sequence codons 26 . If the pausing time is long enough, frameshifting efficiency FS, i.e., the probability of ending up in the −1-frame, is only determined by the free-energy difference between the 0-frame and −1-frame. To test if the free-energy differences suffice to explain the measured FS values, we introduce a free-energy model of frameshifting. Given are frameshift efficiencies FS experiment = (FS experiment,1 ,⋯, FS experiment,N ) measured for N different mRNA sequences (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 ). Here, we analyze N = 64 different mRNA variants. Upon frameshifting, the mRNA-tRNA base-pairing nucleotides change and therefore the free energy of the mRNA-tRNA interaction changes. Let us assume that the efficiency FS i of the ith mRNA variant solely depends on the difference between the free energy of the −1-frame G −1,i and of 0-frame G 0,i . In this case, the efficiencies can be determined by the ratio of Boltzmann probabilities Hence, if ΔG i for the ith mRNA variant is negative, i.e., the free energy of the −1-frame is lower than that of the 0-frame, the corresponding FS i is larger than 50%. During dnaX −1 frameshifting, the two tRNAs, which were located in the ribosomal P and A sites prior to translocation, are interacting with the first and second codon of the mRNA, respectively. Due to the shift of the reading frame, the base pairs in the codons may change, depending on the sequence (compare Fig. 1a) . Each codon consists of three base pairs which are denoted by either P1, P2, P3 or A1, A2, A3, where the letter corresponds to the P-site or A-site codon and the number corresponds to the position of the base pair in the codon. The second assumption, which will be tested using the free-energy model, is that the free-energy difference ΔG i only arises from the free-energy differences of the base pairs at the individual positions present in the 0-frame and −1-frame, and further, that these are additive. Base-pair changes are denoted by their codon position and the two base pairs, e.g., P1 A·U → C·U corresponds to changing the mRNA-tRNA base pair A·U into a C·U base pair in the first position of the first codon. In the N = 64 mRNA sequences, n = 16 base-pair changes are found: at the first positions of both codons (P1 and A1), six base-pair changes each (A·U → C·U, A·U → U·U, A·U → G·U, U·A → A·A, U·A → C·A, U·A → G·A) and at the third positions (P3 and A3), two base-pair changes each (G·S → A·S, C·G → U·G). The base pairs at the second positions (P2 and A2) remain unchanged upon frameshifting for all the 64 mRNA variants and therefore do not contribute to the free-energy differences ΔG i . Here, S denotes the modified nucleotide mnm 5 s 2 U, which is present in the anticodon of tRNA Lys (Supplementary Fig. 4) . The estimated free-energy difference ΔG est,i between the 0-frame and the −1frame for the ith mRNA sequence can then be calculated from the sum of the individual free-energy differences ΔG bp,j of the base-pair combinations where M i,j is 1 if the free-energy difference ΔG bp,j contributes to ΔG i , −1 if −ΔG bp,j ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12648-x contributes to ΔG i , and 0 if ΔG bp,j does not contribute to ΔG i . For a compact notation, the base-pair free-energy differences are combined into a vector Writing all the estimated free-energy differences ΔG est,i of the N mRNA sequences as a vector, Equation (2) can be expressed as a matrix multiplication, ΔG est = M · ΔG bp , where M is an N × n matrix with entries M i,j . From the estimated free-energy differences ΔG est , using Eq. (1), we can calculate the frameshift efficiencies FS model , which are now a function of the base-pair free-energy differences. Metropolis with Bayesian Inference. The aim is to find the individual base-pair free-energy differences ΔG bp that best reproduce the measured frameshift efficiencies FS experiment . Using Bayesian inference, the probability for the base-pair free-energies is where P(ΔG bp ) is the prior probability of the base-pair free-energy differences, and P(FS experiment |ΔG bp ) is the probability of observing specific frameshift efficiencies FS experiment for given base-pair free-energy differences ΔG bp , where σ experiment,i is the standard deviation of FS experiment,i obtained from repeated measurements (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 1 ), and FS model,i is the ith entry of the vector of frameshift efficiencies FS model estimated from ΔG bp , using Eqs. (1) and (2) . The prior distribution P(ΔG bp ) of the vector of base-pair free-energy differences ΔG bp is where P(ΔG bp,j ) is the prior distribution of free-energy difference of the jth base pair. This prior distribution was chosen to be a uniform distribution between −25 and 25 kJ/mol. P(ΔG bp |FS experiment ) was sampled using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm 50 in two independent calculations with 10 6 steps. To that aim, we used the function which is proportional to the desired probability distribution (compare to Eq. (4)). The initial free-energy difference values ΔG bp,j were set to 0 kJ/mol and the function f was evaluated. For each metropolis step, n sub-steps were carried out. For each substep j, first, a new value for the ΔG bp,j was drawn from a normal distribution centered on the current value with a σ of 0.2 kJ/mol. Then, the function f was evaluated with the new ΔG bp,j , and the ratio α of the new and previous value of f was used as the acceptance ratio: If α > 1, the new ΔG bp,j was accepted. If α < 1, a random number u between 0 and 1 was drawn and the new ΔG bp,j value was accepted if u ≤ α and rejected otherwise. Determination of independent free-energy differences. The mean μ and standard deviation σ of the probability distributions of the base-pair free-energy differences ΔG bp,j , obtained from Metropolis sampling of P(ΔG bp |FS experiment ), are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a . For 10 of the 16 base-pair combinations σ is small ( Supplementary Fig. 5a, green background) showing that the ΔG bp of these combinations is well determined. For the remaining six base-pair combinations with large σ values, the absolute ΔG bp values are not determined, but their ΔG bp values sampled during the calculations show strong mutual correlations (Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The ΔG bp values of the three base-pair changes P3 G·S → A·S, A1 A·U → G·U, and A1 U·A → G·A show strong positive pairwise correlations. The same is observed for the other three base-pair changes P3 C·G → U·G, A1 A·U → C·U, and A1 U·A → C·A. Since strong positive correlations for pairs of ΔG bp values means that the difference between them is determined, we ran additional Metropolis sampling calculations, now with ΔG bp set to zero for P3 G·S → A·S (Supplementary Fig. 5b ). As expected from the correlation, the σ of the ΔG bp values for A1 A·U → G·U and A1 U·A → G·A is reduced. Analogously, setting ΔG bp of P3 C·G → U·G to zero, leads to small σ values for A1 A·U → C·U and A1 U·A → C·A ( Supplementary  Fig. 5c ). Setting both ΔG bp values to zero at the same time, results in low σ values for all base-pair combinations (Supplementary Fig. 5d ). This result enabled us to determine probability distribution for ΔG bp values for pairs of base-pair changes (Fig. 2c) . To check the consistency of the free-energy model, we recalculated the FE values, using Eqs. (1) and (2), from all the ΔG bp values after omitting the first 20% of the Metropolis steps. The rmsd between the measured FE experiment values and those obtained from the model FE model was 2.52% for all of these cases ( Supplementary Fig. 5a-d, Fig. 2d ). To further test whether the FE model values have converged, we first extracted intervals of the sampled ΔG bp values from the first N steps Metropolis steps (Supplementary Fig. 7a, number of steps) . For each interval the first 20% Metropolis steps were omitted and then, the rmsd between the FE experiment values and the mean FE model values obtained from the ΔG bp values was calculated. For the two independent calculations, the rmsd drops to the same value showing that the FE values have converged ( Supplementary  Fig. 7a) . For cross validation, iteratively, each mRNA variant was selected and the distributions of ΔG bp were calculated from the FE values of all other mRNA variants. Next, the FE for the selected mRNA variant was predicted from the obtained ΔG bp values (Fig. 2e) . The rmsd between the predicted and the measured FE values as a function of Metropolis steps is shown in Supplementary Fig. 7b and converges to 4.1%. Estimation of the kinetic contribution to frameshifting. So far, the frameshifting efficiency was assumed to be solely determined by the free-energy difference between the 0-frame and the −1-frame ΔG. Next, to challenge this assumption and to test if the frameshifting efficiency also depends on kinetics, we expanded the model by a term that describes kinetic effects. Given the two states, 0-frame and −1-frame, and the rates between these states, k 0,−1 and k −1,0 , the master equation for the time-dependent probability of being in the −1-frame P −1 (t) can be written as dP À1 ðtÞ dt ¼ k 0;À1 1 À P À1 ðtÞ ½ À k À1;0 P À1 ðtÞ: ð8Þ Assuming that the system starts in the 0-frame and, hence, P −1 (0) = 0, the solution of the master equation is given by With transition rates given by Arrhenius's law with barrier height ΔG z and attempt frequency A, the probability of being in the −1-frame reads P À1 ðtÞ ¼ FS 1 À expðÀðk 0;À1 þ k À1;0 ÞtÞ where FS is the equilibrium frameshift efficiency as described in Eq. (1). Obviously, for t → ∞, the probability P −1 (t) converges to P −1 (t → ∞) = FS, the equilibrium efficiency. The time window for transitions between the two frames is limited and ends with the completion of tRNA translocation. We define the kinetic factor κ = exp(−(k 0,−1 + k −1,0 )τ) with τ as the length of this time window. Therefore the frameshifting efficiency FS kinetic , obtained from the model including kinetic effects, is then FS kinetic = P −1 (τ) = FS(1−κ). Substituting k 0,−1 and k 0,−1 using Eq. (10) results in This model of the possible non-equilibrium dynamics of frameshifting leaves as the only remaining unknown parameter. The kinetic factor κ is different for different mRNA variants, depending on the ΔG which in turn depends on the basepair free-energy differences. Since we are interested in the kinetic contribution to frameshifting, we performed additional Metropolis sampling calculations, with the mean κ of all kinetic factors included as a nuisance parameter. The probability for the base-pair free-energies is then PðΔG bp jFS experiment Þ / PðFS experiment jΔG bp Þ Á PðΔG bp Þ Á Pð κÞ; where Pð κÞ is the prior distribution of κ for which a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 was chosen. To sample the probability, in each Metropolis step, the parameter C which results in the mean kinetic factor κ was calculated and from that the κ value for each sequence. Two independent calculations were carried out with 10 6 Metropolis steps each, as described above, now with an additional sub step for drawing a new value for κ from a normal distribution centered on the current value of κ with σ ¼ 0:001. The obtained probability distribution of κ is shown in Fig. 3b .
