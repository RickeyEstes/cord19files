Data sources. Medical care in Taiwan has been provided under Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) since 1995. This system covers more than 99% of Taiwan's inhabitants for most medical expenses related to inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care, Chinese medicine, and dental services. For administrative and reimbursement purposes, the Bureau of the NHI audited patients' diagnosis, procedure, and medication data to ensure correct coding and appropriateness; these data were recorded and stored in the NHIRD, which has been described in detail in our previous studies 11, 12 . To examine OAD use among patients with T2D, we extracted the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients dataset from the NHIRD. This dataset includes all available medical registry data for 120,000 patients with incident T2D per year during the period 1999-2012. This study was exempted from full review by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei City Hospital because it used de-identified and secondary claims data released by the NHIRD for research purposes.
