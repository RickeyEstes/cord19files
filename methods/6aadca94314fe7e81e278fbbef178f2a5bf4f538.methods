Results Some physiology and CCMDS data were missing for 175 patients. Age, sex and mortality are described in Table 1 . A total of 90.9% of patients had traumatic injuries, 2.1% received CPR prior to ICU admission, 1.5% prehospital. A total of 20.6% had head, neck or spinal trauma. A total of 85.7% were transferred directly to the ICU from a military hospital overseas, others coming to the ICU following surgery at RCDM. Of the 382 patients with APACHE II score data the mean score was 11.0 (SD 4.9), probably refl ecting stabilisation in military hospitals overseas or during aeromedical critical care transfer. The mean number of ICU days was Level 3: 7.6 (SD 11.6); Level 2: 2.0 (SD 2.8). A total of 70.4% of patients required advanced respiratory support for a mean of 7.5 days, and 33% required advanced cardiovascular support for a mean of 3.7 days.  We retrospectively analyzed trauma patients transported to our center for the recent 2 years. Patients transferred from other hospitals with minor injuries or confi rmed cardiac arrest at the scene were excluded. Results A total of 297 trauma patients were included in this study. Thirty-one (10.4%) patients required MT. Sensitivity and specifi city for the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score were 48% and 99%, respectively. Because blunt injuries account for most trauma patients in Japan, we established new simple criteria using signifi cant factors that were derived from the examination on arrival. If trauma patients met any of the following conditions -that is, shock index (SI) >1, base excess (BE) <-3 mmol/l, and positive focused assessment of sonography for trauma (FAST) -sensitivity and specifi city was 97% and 80%, respectively. Conclusion Patients with sepsis receiving blood products, particularly platelets, were signifi cantly more likely to develop ARDS, had more days on mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality. The lack of an increase in mortality associated with PRBC transfusion may be due to the benefi t in oxygen delivery or sample size. Introduction Perioperative red blood cell transfusion is commonly used to address anemia, an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1] ; however, evidence regarding optimal blood transfusion practice in septic shock is lacking. The aim of this study was to defi ne which is the best transfusion strategy in septic shock patients regarding 28-day mortality and clinical outcomes: restrictive or liberal. Methods The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an ICU at a university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients (n = 502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible; analysis was by intention to treat. This is a randomized controlled parallel-group trial, which included 300 patients admitted to a cancer ICU with diagnosis of septic shock. Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood transfusion (to maintain hemoglobin >9 g/dl) or to a restrictive strategy (hemoglobin >7 g/dl). Mortality in 28 days was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes were clinical complications days free of organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, adverse eff ects of transfusion and 60-day mortality. Results A total of 136 patients were included in the fi rst part of the trial. Mean age was 62 ± 14 years, SAPS 3 at admission was 65 ± 15 and all patients had the diagnosis of solid neoplasm. Sixty-three patients (46.3%) were included in the liberal strategy and 73 patients (53.7%) in the restrictive strategy. Occurrence of 28-day mortality was similar between groups (54% in liberal group vs. 56.2% in restrictive group; P = 0.395). Conclusion Among cancer patients with septic shock, the use of a restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy compared with a more liberal strategy resulted in similar rates of 28-day-mortality. Reference Introduction Blood transfusion is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the critically ill [1] . Adverse eff ects of transfusion may be mediated by changes in the blood product that accumulate with storage time [2] . The mechanisms, however, are largely unknown. Erythrocyte-derived microparticles (MPs) have been found in transfusion bags [3, 4] and their concentration increases with storage duration [5] . We hypothesize that accumulation of MPs during storage induces a proinfl ammatory state in the recipient. in capillary leakage and subsequent pulmonary edema [2] . TRALI is a clinical diagnosis with the following criteria: acute onset within 6 hours of blood transfusion, PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio <300 mmHg, or worsening of the P:F ratio, bilateral infi ltrative changes on chest radiograph, no sign of hydrostatic pulmonary edema (pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure ≤18 mmHg or central venous pressure ≤15 mmHg) and no other risk factor for acute lung injury [2] . Methods We describe a fatal TRALI in a patient with infl uenza A (H1N1), suggesting a relationship between a fi rst-hit lung injury followed by the second lung impairment after blood transfusions. We conducted a prospective audit of FB and renal function in patients undergoing major elective surgery admitted to critical care over a 28-day period. Fluid overload was defi ned as: (positive FB) / (weight × 0.6) × 100%. Results Thirty-two patients (56% female, median age 64) were studied over a median of 3 critical care days (range 1 to 7). Total FB was +3.9 l at discharge; however, 75% of this occurred intraoperatively so that positive FB in critical care was only +390 ml/day. Patients had median 9% fl uid overload at discharge. Two patients had transient AKI stage 1. Overall SCr decreased signifi cantly from preoperatively to discharge (P = 0.003), median 73 to 55 μmol/l, with decreases occurring both postoperatively and during critical care stay ( Figure 1 ). Conclusion We achieved near-neutral fl uid balances after admission, but did not resolve intraoperative fl uid accumulation. SCr fell signifi cantly, even after there was no further net fl uid accumulation. This suggests a decrease in creatinine generation after major surgery, rather than fl uid expansion, may largely account for sCr decreases in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients who underwent emergency surgery for colorectal perforation and were admitted to the ICU of our hospital from January 2003 to August 2013. Patients with traumatic, iatrogenic, and appendicitis perforations were excluded. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. The modifi ed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (mSOFA) score, a customized SOFA score excluding the central nervous system component [1] , was used for prognostic scoring. The mSOFA score and several clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis as possible predictors of survival. We collected lactate levels and base excess (BE) measured during surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 hours after the fi rst measurement and calculated the respective LC values. The associations of initial blood lactate level, LC, and BE with mortality were assessed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses. Introduction Measurement of arterial lactate (A-LACT) levels has been used to monitor poor tissue perfusion, predicting mortality and guiding resuscitation. Peripheral venous lactate (V-LACT) has been regarded as an unreliable test, but a less invasive approach. We aimed to determine correlation between A-LACT and V-LACT and agreement of both in order to determine the usefulness of V-LACT as a biomarker for assessment in sepsis.  In 183 patients, in a prospective observational study, serum CRP and PCT values were collected every day starting on postoperative day 1 through day 5. The defi nition of SIRS includes two or more of the following: temperature >38 or <36°C; heart rate >90 beats/minute; respiratory rate >20/minute; arterial carbon dioxide pressure <32 mmHg; white blood cell count >12,000/mm 3 Introduction The occurrence of sepsis-induced immune suppression is associated with multiple organ dysfunctions, although the exact role of T-cell malfunction is obscure. We investigated the impact of sepsis on the adaptive immune system and to monitor T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity. Methods TCR diversity was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from septic shock patients at three time points (days 1, 3 and 7 after diagnosis of septic shock). TCR diversity was measured in genomic DNA isolated from PBMCs using the Human Immun TraCkeRb test (ImmunID Technologies, Grenoble, France) [1] . Multi-N-plex PCR was performed using a primer specifi c to a V gene family and several primers specifi c to J segments. The signal is measured as a function of the fl uorescence intensity of the reference marker. Rearrangement validation and map generation were detected and analyzed using the Constel'ID software (ImmunID Technologies). HLA-DR expression on CD14 cells was measured by fl ow cytometry. Results TCR diversity was markedly decreased in septic patients at day 1 compared with healthy volunteers. A recovery of TCR diversity was observed at days 3 and 7 except for dead patients. HLA-DR expression was signifi cantly decreased in septic patients at day 1. The total lymphocyte count reduced in septic patients at day 1, but the lymphocyte count recovered at days 3 and 7 except for dead patients. Introduction Sepsis is associated with immune hyporesponsiveness but the immunological processes behind this are ill defi ned. Methods This study quantifi ed diff erences in plasma concentrations of cytokines between septic patients with faecal peritonitis, age and gender-matched surgical patients (without sepsis) and age and gender-matched healthy participants. In addition, cytokine levels were measured in supernatant from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+anti-CD28, incubated for 4 days. Cytokine concentrations of IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IFNγ and TNFα were determined by multiplex cytometric bead array. Results Plasma levels of IFNγ and IL-13 were lower in septic patients compared with healthy participants. In contrast, plasma levels of IL-6 (see Figure 1 ) and IL-8 were increased in septic patients compared with both surgical patients and healthy participants. Plasma levels of IL-10 were signifi cantly higher only in comparison with surgical patients. Following incubation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD3+anti-CD28, concentrations of IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6 (see Figure 1 ), IL-13, IL-17A, IFNγ and TNFα were markedly decreased in samples from septic patients. In addition, stimulation with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 resulted in lower production of IL-10 in septic patients. Lower concentrations of IL-8 were detected in septic patient samples stimulated with only anti-CD3. We found cytokine levels of IL-12p70 remained unaff ected across all groups and stimuli. Conclusion We demonstrated a proinfl ammatory cytokine profi le in blood from septic patients, preceding a pan downregulation of all assessed cytokines following in vitro T-cell stimulation. To our knowledge, this study is the fi rst to perform an immune functional assay across these three groups. Introduction Activated protein C (APC) defi ciency is prevalent in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. The aim of the study was to relate the anticoagulation activity evaluated by APC with other coagulation parameters adjusted to 28-day mortality. Methods A cohort study of 150 critically ill adults. Age, sex, sources of infection and coagulation markers within 24 hours from severe sepsis or septic shock onset, defi ned according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) criteria, were studied. We analyzed APC activity using a hemostasis laboratory analyzer (BCS® XP; Siemens). A descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). We retrospectively analyzed data from 54 patients, including 10 patients with isolated brain injury and 44 patients with brain and extracranial injuries. The fl ow-cytometric analysis was performed within 48 hours of trauma. Collected data are shown in Table 1 . Results Preliminary analysis is limited to descriptive statistics that show an immediate immunosuppression condition after TBI, as established by reduction of CD4 + T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes. Signifi cant data are collected in Table 2 . Conclusion In severe TBI patients, an immunosuppression state is early developed. It is relevant to establish whether this condition could aff ect the course and prognosis of ICU patients. .03) was found in low and high Cl:Na ratios (P = 0.081 and P = 0.046) (Figure 1 ). Conclusion Stewart's strong ion theory provides assessment for the etiology of acid-base disturbances. This evaluation can be performed easier and faster with the Cl:Na ratio. This study demonstrates that the disturbed Cl:Na ratio is associated with increased mortality in sepsis and severe sepsis patient groups. In this single-center, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned adult patients presenting signals of defi cient gas exchange (PaO 2 /FIO 2 <250 at a PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O) in the immediate postoperative period to either intensive alveolar recruitment or a standard protocol, both using low-tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg/ibw). Our hypothesis was that an aggressive alveolar recruitment protocol will be translated to better lung compliance, better gas exchange, fewer pulmonary complications and reduced length of hospital stay when compared with the control group. Results A total of 320 patients were enrolled in the study, 163 patients in the standard protocol group and 157 in the intensive alveolar recruitment group. Patients of the interventional group presented a higher incidence of pneumonia than patients for the control group (5 (3.3%) vs. 19 (22%), P = 0.004). The length of the hospital stay was shorter among patients receiving intensive alveolar recruitment than among those receiving standard care (10.9 (9.9 to 11.9) vs. 12.4 days (11.3 to 13.6); P = 0.045). There was no diff erence between groups according to extrapulmonary complications and mortality. Conclusion In this trial, an intensive alveolar recruitment protocol associated with a protective mechanical ventilation strategy reduced pulmonary complication and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (NCT01502332).  We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, pilot randomized trial of antifungal therapy in critically ill patients with a clinical suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia with positive airway secretion specimens for Candida spp. We also included an observational group without Candida spp. in their airway secretions. We measured the recruitment rate, infl ammatory profi les over time and clinical outcomes. Introduction Candida spp. are increasingly isolated in the critically ill, but the clinical signifi cance hereof is hard to establish [1] . Candida spp. colonization has been suggested as a risk factor for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [2] . The effi cacy and safety of inhalational amphotericin B (AB) is unknown [3] . The hypothesis was that inhalational AB deoxycholate is a safe and eff ective treatment for Candida spp. colonization of the respiratory tract and thereby prevents VAP and prolonged need for mechanical ventilation. Results Administration of IT as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics was associated with a decrease of systemic infl ammation and acute respiratory insuffi ciency signs 2.3 ± 1.2 days after the treatment onset (vs. 6.3 ± 1.5 days in group 2, P = 0.03). The decrease of microbial titer to 10 3 to 10 4 CFU/ml was detected in both groups by days 5 to 7, but it Critical Care 2014, Volume 18 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/18/S1 was reliable in 80% of the patients of group 1 (P <0.02). It is noteworthy that 21% of group 1 patients were in vitro resistant to tobramycin, but it was clinically eff ective, probably due to a local superconcentration. Treatment with IT was associated with an increase of sensitivity of microbes to antibiotics they were prior resistant to (32% of patients). This is probably due to IT eff ects on biolayers. De-escalation of antibiotic therapy was possible in group 1 by day 5 in 42% of patients. The treatment with IT made it possible to wean 40% of patients by day 5.3 ± 1.8 after treatment cessation (vs. 35% and 11.2 ± 1.3 days in group 2, P = 0.02). Hearing loss and tinnitus was detected only in three patients of group 1. There were no cases of bronchospasm. The mortality was 12% (n = 3) in group 1 and 16% (n = 4) in group 2 (P >0.05), and was not related to a progression of NP [1] . Conclusion Administration of IT as an adjunct to systemic antibiotics is effi cient in treatment of NP caused by multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria in sepsis. Introduction Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis plays a crucial role in preventing sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery [1] . In institutions with high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci species, vancomycin prophylaxis is recommended either as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant agent [2] . In our study, we assessed sternal wound infection rates before and after the introduction of a vancomycin prophylaxis protocol. Methods Twenty-six of a total 227 consecutive cardiac surgical patients, between July and December 2012, developed sternal wound infection (Group A). All of the patients received a standard empirical antibiotic prophylaxis. From January to July 2013, 308 patients underwent cardiac surgery (Group B). In this group, we applied a more restricted antibiotic protocol, considering the resistance patterns and the results of microbiological tests of group A. We also evaluated the results of MIC susceptibility testing of fi ve antibiotics: oxacillin, linezolide, daptomycin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. In the new protocol the fi rst vancomycin dose was given 1 hour before sternal incision followed by three additional doses (48 hours duration). Thirty-three of these yielded signifi cant results (6.1%) but only nine (1.7%) were deemed clinically useful. A total of 102 cultures were taken in the fi rst 24 hours of the ICU, of which 17 were positive (16.7%) and six were useful (5.9%). Fifty-three were taken over the next 24 hours, of which two were positive and two were useful (3.8%). Forty-four cultures were taken over the following 24 hours, of which two were positive (4.5%) and one was useful (2.3%). A total of 343 cultures were taken subsequent to this in the ICU, of which 12 were positive (3.5%) and three were deemed useful (0.9%). Of 22 blood cultures taken in the 24 hours post ICU, one was positive but deemed useful (4.5% yield). Conclusion These results demonstrate overall low clinical utility of blood cultures but specifi cally that utility of ICU cultures is signifi cantly lower than pre ICU (1.7% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.0001). The yield of positive blood cultures and their clinical utility also decrease during ICU stay. This may refl ect appropriate empirical antibiotics and lower bacteraemia burden in later illness. Given the low clinical yield and a lack of established sensitive or specifi c triggers [1] , we suggest further work in an ICU setting to maximise utility whilst minimising harm. Reference Results Renal replacement therapy was performed on 136 patients in this group (4.2%). The fl uid accumulation percentage was associated with an 8% increase in odds for AKI (OR (CI), 1.08 (1.04 to 1.12)), and a 13% increase in odds for requiring renal replacement therapy (1.13 (1.05 to 1.21)) for each percent increase in fl uid accumulation (l/kg%) after cardiac surgery, after adjusting for variables including APACHE score, cardiac failure, type of surgery, and inotrope use in multivariate analysis. Conclusion In this relatively homogeneous patient group undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative percent fl uid accumulation at 18 hours was associated with AKI and need for renal replacement therapy. Whether there is residual confounding due to indication for fl uid use or unmeasured risk factors requires further investigation in controlled trials. Introduction Renal replacement therapy in critical care is associated with increased mortality. It is not known for which patients RRT confers the most benefi t, or who will recover function and remain dialysis independent on a long-term basis. Conclusion The reported incidence of AKI in critical care ranges from 20 to 50%, with the highest rates seen in sepsis [1] . Utilisation of CRRT for AKI is higher at our centre than the described 5% [2] , potentially due to close collaboration between critical care and nephrology [3] or relatively lenient ICU admission criteria. Increasing mortality was seen with age, APACHE II score and delay in initiation of RRT. Prospective analysis is required to look at determining biomarkers for AKI and risk factors for mortality; dynamic monitoring of haemodynamic responders (MAP, vasopressor requirement <24 hours), percentage creatinine decrease [4] , severity-of-illness scores and urine output. Results of current RCTs are awaited, which may provide more information on mode of clearance, fl ow rates and early versus standard initiation of RRT to more accurately prognose patients' outcomes. The primary objective of this multicentre European noninterventional study was to evaluate the performance (effi ciency) of SGC under routine conditions in adult ICU patients requiring BG control. The primary endpoint was the percentage of time within the target range, and secondary outcome measures were the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes and BG measurement intervals. Patients in this trial were assigned to the target range 4.4 to 8.3 mmol/l. Nutritional management (enteral, parenteral or both) was carried out at the discretion of the each centre. Results Seventeen centres from nine European countries included a total of 508 patients. During the study a total of 29,575 BG values were entered into the SGCs and the same number of recommendations were rendered. The mean time-in-target was 77.5 ± 20.9%. The mean proposed next measurement time was 2.0 ± 0.5 hours. Only four episodes of hypoglycaemia <2.2 mmol/l occurred (0.01% of measurements). Conclusion SGC is a safe and very effi cient system to control BG in ICU patients. Introduction Glycemic control in the ICU has been shown to reduce morbidity, mortality and length of stay. However, current methods of blood glucose (BG) monitoring are invasive, intermittent and laborintensive. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has potential to improve safety/effi cacy of BG control. The performance of a noninvasive, transdermal CGM system (Symphony CGM; Echo Therapeutics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was evaluated in post-surgical ICU patients. Methods Adult surgical patients with planned ICU admission of ≥24 hours at four medical centers were consented. Following admission to the ICU, the skin of an upper arm was cleaned and a 6 mm diameter site was prepared with controlled micro-abrasion using the Symphony CGM system. A transdermal CGM sensor containing glucose oxidase was applied. Following a 1-hour warm-up period, a calibration was performed. Blood samples were obtained from a radial artery catheter approximately every hour, centrifuged to plasma, and glucose was measured using a YSI 2300 STAT Plus Glucose Analyzer (reference BG). A maximum of 30 reference BG samples were collected for each patient. Samples were collected as frequently as every 15 minutes for trend analysis. CGM was prospectively calibrated every 4 hours. All treatment decisions were based on BG alone. Safety was assessed by visual inspection of the site using a dermatological scale following sensor removal. A study was defi ned as evaluable for CGM sessions >16 hours. Results Thirty-two subjects completed the study. Additional subjects were not considered evaluable due to early discharge from the ICU, failure or early removal of the radial artery catheter, or administration of intravenous acetaminophen. The study cohort was 19% female, 28% diabetes, 56% cardiac surgery, with a mean age of 65 ± 13 years. Overall mean absolute relative diff erence between CGM and reference BG was 12.5%. Continuous glucose error-grid analysis, which assesses point and trend accuracy, showed 98.2% of readings in the A zone (clinically accurate) and 1.2% in the B zone (benign errors). Glucose values ranged from 49 to 324 mg/dl. No device or study-related adverse events were reported. Conclusion The Symphony CGM system demonstrated clinically relevant accuracy and excellent safety in a variety of patients and ICU environments. Future studies are needed to determine whether Symphony CGM can be used to direct therapy and improve BG control in this patient population. Introduction The aim of this study was to determine the impact of preadmission or fi rst 24-hour blood glucose (BG) measurements in UK ICUs on mortality. Methods The Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre case-mix programme database on adult admissions to general, neuroscience and cardiothoracic critical care units was used for analysis. Within the database, the highest and lowest blood glucose (BG) values measured during the fi rst 24 hours from admission were recorded. BG control value was defi ned as BG (≥4.0 ≤9.9 mmol/l). Other BG levels were defi ned as: very low, ≤2.2 mmol/l (≤40 mg/dl); low, >2.2 ≤3.9 mmol/l (40 to 70 mg/dl); high, ≥10.0 <11.1 mmol/l (180 to 200 mg/dl); and very high, ≥11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). Results There was an increased incidence of mortality in those patients with at least one BG measure below 3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) compared with those without (Table 1 ). There was a link between BG levels and LoS for surviving patients with the longest hospital stays (critical care and total hospital) experienced by those with BG levels below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). Conclusion There is a strong association between BG levels during admission and mortality and LoS outcomes. Although it is not possible to make the link with causation from our dataset, we present results from the largest single dataset of critical care unit patients [1, 2] . Introduction While there is ongoing discussion of the optimal range for glycemic control in hospital intensive care, recent publications from Mackenzie and colleagues [1] and Krinsley [2] [3] [4] suggest not only that mean BG should be considered, but also that glucose variability and complexity may be equally important. This has increased the need for continuous systems which can provide early warnings of hypoglycemia and eff ectively measure variability. GlySure Ltd has developed an intravascular glucose monitoring system to simplify the application of hospital protocols for tight glycemic control (TGC) at the point of care. Experience with the original research-based instrumentation [5] has now been incorporated into a combined pre-production monitor and Critical Care 2014, Volume 18 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/18/S1 autocalibration unit. We have now completed a 34-patient trial using this device and present the data collected from this study. Methods The study used GlySure sterile, single-use sensors and a 5-lumen 9.5-Fr CVC device, allowing the fl uorescence optical-based sensor to be placed into the patient's right internal jugular vein. The screen data were blinded to the bedside staff . Data from the monitor were later compared with sample measurement from the Yellow Springs (YSI) glucose analyzer. The data accuracy was measured using the mean absolute relative diff erence (MARD), an error calculation tool. In a prospective, controlled study, 134 patients with septic shock were randomized into three study groups: group A (n = 43), 200 mg/day hydrocortisone hemisuccinate in four daily doses; group B (n = 47), same dose of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate in continuous administration; group C (n = 44), no hydrocortisone hemisuccinate. Patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded. The duration of hydrocortisone treatment was a maximum 7 days. The target blood glucose (BG) level was below 180 mg/dl. BG values were analyzed by calculating mean daily values, standard deviation (SD) of BG values as an index of glycemic variability, and insulin doses. The local ethics committee approved the study. Results There were no diff erences between the three groups at the beginning of the study regarding demographic data and the clinical characteristics, including BG value. BG levels were strongly correlated with severity of septic shock estimated by APACHE II score (r = +0.241; P = 0.005) or Simplifi ed Acute Physiology Score II (r = 0.280; P = 0.001) -Pearson correlation. The risk of death is signifi cantly increased if SD of BG is more than 20 mg/dl (67.7% vs. 20.8%, P = 0.000). A total 94.4% of deceased patients in group A registered a SD of BG more than 20 mg/dl versus 89.5% in group B or 40% in group C (P = 0.006). In total, 53.5% of patients in group A needed insulin therapy versus 25.5% in group B or 27.3% in group C. The dose was between 30.28 ± 6.65 UI/day in group A, 37.85 ± 11.95 UI/day in group B, and 14.28 ± 5.76 UI/day in group C (P >0.05). Conclusion BG variability is highly associated with mortality compared with BG mean daily value or insulin dose. SD levels above 20 mg/dl were associated with a signifi cantly higher mortality rate relative to those with SD levels below 20 mg/dl. We conducted a prospective cohort study with concurrent controls from February 2011 to February 2013 in a network of 29 Toronto-area hospitals. The PACT was implemented in two hospitals and functioned as a consult service with a nurse and physician oncall 24/7. Patients from other network hospitals acted as concurrent controls. The PACT focused on four key processes of care: targeted temperature management (TTM); coronary angiography; avoidance of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST <72 hours) on the basis of neuroprognostication; and electrophysiology assessment. We included nontraumatic OHCA patients who were >18 years old, survived at least 6 hours, and were comatose. We excluded patients with do-not-resuscitate orders, intracranial or other severe bleeding. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess whether PACT implementation was associated with higher odds of achieving each of the four targeted processes of care while adjusting for secular trends unrelated to the intervention.
