To calculate the rate of nucleotide substitution, we require a measurement of the number of nucleotide substitutions occurring in a given time interval. Starting from a given set of aligned sequences {s 1 , ..., s n } for n taxa, we define the pairwise distance in number of substitutions to be the estimates {K ij } under a given model of nucleotide substitution. Naturally the unobservable true values {D ij } of the pairwise distances differ from their estimates {K ij }. To understand this difference, we associate each D ij with an error ε ij and assume that ε ij tends to zero as sequence lengths increase without bound. We further assume that the covariance between errors, cov(ε ij ; ε mn ), is bounded and known. For time measurements, we assume that each sequence is labeled by a sampling time t i given in consistent units. Since we know only the sampling time of a given sample up to the unit of time reported (day, month, year) we posit an uniform error ν i ~ U [0, 1] underlying each t i over the unit sampling interval. To complete the error structure specification we force the two forms of error (ν i and ε ij ) to be independent. Finally, for a set of three sequences (s i , s j , s k ) and their associated pairwise distances, we enforce a fixed topology among sequences, as shown in Figure 1 , via methods outlined in [26] . We augment the topology with the observed sampling times of the three sequences, α, the divergence time between the two sequences of interest and β, the divergence time of all sequences. When necessary for clarity, we write α ij to indicate the true time of divergence between sequences i and j. Under our triplet method, we aim to estimate the true rate of nucleotide substitution, p ij , between sequences s i and s j with an unobserved error δ ij . With respect to outgroup sequence k, an unbiased estimate is where the factor corrects for bias resulting from the time sampling error structure (see Appendix for derivation). We superscript to denote its weak dependence on outgroup sequence k. Dependence is weak as the path of evolution from t k to α is shared between the paths from sequence k to both sequence i and sequence j and hence largely cancels out in Equation 1. We make this transparent in the following derivation. For brevity, we consider only unobservable true values, ignoring error terms. Let u be the location on the triplet in Figure 1 corresponding to time α and let p xy be the true rate along the path connecting locations x and y. Then, as distance is rate multiplied by time, we have Subtracting the first equation from the second equation , which is equivalent to Equation 1. This derivation makes clear that the estimator (1) measures the rate along the path from sequence i to sequence j, with only incidental dependence on sequence k. The variance for the estimator (1) is well approximated by Further, we can estimate the time of subtype divergence α ( Figure 1 ) between sequences via We note that the term t i + t j -1 is used rather than t i + t j to account for the expected error coming from the uniformly The phylogenetic relationships between three sequences s i , s j and s k , sampled on dates t i , t j and t k respectively As nucleotide data increases without bound, K ij → D ij and → p ij , ensuring that → α ij . For finite sequence lengths, this relation ensures that . To gain an understanding of this estimator, we note that with a standard model of substitution (e.g. JC69, HKY85), a rate of substitution of 10 -4 (s/s/yr) and a sequence of 2000 nucleotides, the above estimator yields a standard error of approximately 23 years [20] . The above derivations express our rate and time estimates for a single triplet of sequences. We now consider estimates that combine information across multiple representative sequences from each subtype. For discussion, we label subtypes A, B and C (which are only incidentally the same as the labels for influenza) and we assume the topology in Figure 1 for these groups. We let n r , where r ∈ {A, where P α is the sum of the inverse variance of each estimate, . Having found , we estimate its variance by a bootstrap resampling of sequences from each subtype [8] . The computational efficiency of this estimator is on the order O(n 3 ) for a tree of n taxa. This is natural as each of the initial rate estimates is composed of information concerning three taxa. While the growth of computational expense in the number of taxa may appear unpleasant, in practice this algorithm is both fast and stable, owing to the absence of costly optimization procedures for parameter inference, and is able to handle data sets of thousands of taxa. The authors detail the computational efficiency of a similar statistic in [26]. As an example, for the data presented below all computations required only a few seconds on a desktop computer.
