This was a retrospective observational study which was approved by the institutional review committee. Data were collected from a 1732-bed hospital, located in central Taiwan, with eight probable SARS cases, including two proven cases (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test), during the SARS period. The first probable SARS case who had been infected by his brother, a resident at Amoy Gardens, an apartment building in Hong Kong, was admitted to this hospital on 3 April 2003 with a fever and cough. The World Health Organization removed Taiwan from its list of areas with local transmission of SARS on 4 July 2003. There was no SARS outbreak at this hospital and no HCWs became infected with SARS-CoV. Resuscitation record sheets, which have been used for chronologically recording procedures and administration of drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and other resuscitations at our hospital since 2001, were reviewed from 1 January to 4 July 2003. They are used in cases with sudden apnoea or respiratory distress, sudden hypotension, bradycardia or sudden loss of consciousness. Nontrauma patients who received emergency resuscitation from January 1 to April 2 (total, 92 days) or from April 3 to June 3 (total, 92 days) were classified into two groups: before (period 1), and during (period 2), strict implementation of ICMs. In period 1, protection during emergency resuscitation consisted of surgical mask and gloves. Immediately following confirmation of the first SARS case in our hospital (period 2), strict ICMs were implemented and the personal protection equipment (PPE) during emergency resuscitation was upgraded to an N95 respirator and/or surgical mask, gloves, gown and goggles as well as rapid sequence intubation if indicated. ICMs before and during resuscitation of suspected SARS patients included the standard operating procedures of wearing gloves and gown, in addition to use of airway and breathing equipment, intubation and ventilator. Other strict hospital ICMs in period 2 included the following: (i) all new admissions were required to be examined by our emergency department's SARS screening team; (ii) all febrile patients were required to be admitted to the fever screening ward regardless of their diagnoses; (iii) unnecessary contact between HCWs was restricted and regular meetings and conferences were cancelled; (iv) each step of the standard operating procedure was strictly audited during resuscitation. Data collection included: patients' age and sex; whether or not emergency endotracheal intubation with rapid sequence intubation was performed; clinical areas where resuscitation was performed; response time and duration of resuscitation; number of resuscitators involved; and the result of resuscitation. The records of patients with fever >38 C within 3 days prior to emergency resuscitation were reviewed, as well as those who had been diagnosed with pneumonia before resuscitation. Areas for resuscitation were classified as emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, ordinary ward and any other locations within the hospital. Response time was calculated from the time the emergency call was received to the time the physician arrived. The duration of resuscitation, the period from start to end of resuscitation, was also recorded. The number of participating resuscitators (physicians or nurses) who had been involved in the resuscitation was collected by reviewing the names signed on the special resuscitation sheet. A repeat resuscitation occurring 6 h after the previous resuscitation was defined as a different event. The result of resuscitation was classified into 'failure' and 'having response'. 'Having response' indicated that the patient's condition was persistently stable more than 6 h after emergency resuscitation. A 'failure' result meant that the patient died after resuscitation. The changes in proportion of the different variables between the two periods were compared by Chi-squared test.
