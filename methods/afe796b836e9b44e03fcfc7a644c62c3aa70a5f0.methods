All patients followed up at the SARS Review Clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, between May and July 2003 who were referred solely for physiotherapy were invited to participate in the study. Patients who were haemodynamically unstable (fluctuating blood pressure and resting heart rate), poorly motivated, unco-operative, unable to communicate, with poor pre-SARS mobility, unstable medical conditions (e.g. known cardiopulmonary disorders) or musculoskeletal conditions which affect mobility (such as rheumatoid arthritis and avascular necrosis) were excluded from the study. In addition, subjects with above-normal performances compared to normative data in the 6-minute walk test and the Chester Step Test were also excluded after baseline assessment (Coordinating Committee for Physiotherapy 2003, Sykes 1998). Approval had been obtained from the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong -New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee. The baseline measurements of cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, and health-related quality of life were conducted at least 2 weeks after the patient had been discharged from the hospital (i.e. 5 weeks after disease onset). No sample size calculation was performed prior to the conduct of study as we aimed to recruit all SARS patients admitted in the Prince of Wales Hospital. However, the sample size of the current study was 133 and adequate to have statistical power and significance level of detecting changes in 6-minute walk test distance as suggested by Berry et al (1999) . Of the 258 SARS patients, 31 (12.0%) were not accessible, and 54 (20.9%) either refused to participate or were found to have abovenormal performances; 2 (0.8%) had died. Finally, 171 (66.3%) patients with subnormal performances with respect to the same age range of healthy subjects were recruited for baseline assessment (Lau et al 2005) . With 38 patients unable to participate in the subsequent training sessions, 133 remained and were allocated randomly to the control or exercise group using computer-generated minimisation (Jensen 1991) . Each patient's particulars were keyed in and the computer program automatically allocated the patient to the group that yielded the smallest imbalance in age, gender, and cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness. The allocation was concealed (that is, the person who recruited subjects and the potential subjects were unaware, at the time subjects agreed to enter the study, of which group they would subsequently be allocated to). Details of the study design and number of subjects recruited throughout the study are provided in Figure 1 . The control group received a standardised educational session from the physiotherapists. The session involved provision of advice about general exercise, and a video on exercise was shown to them. Subject compliance and problems related to the exercise were monitored and discussed through weekly phone contact by the physiotherapists. The exercise group underwent a 6-week supervised exercise training program in the physiotherapy department on top of the standardised treatment. The baseline physical profile and SF-36 were assessed. Follow-up assessment for both groups was conducted 6 weeks after the recruitment (i.e. at the end of training for the exercise group) by another independent assessor blinded to allocation. Patients in the exercise group completed an intensive exercise program provided and monitored by the physiotherapists for 4-5 sessions a week (two sessions in the physiotherapy department) with 1-1.5 hours per session for 6 weeks. They were instructed to continue training on other days of the week to ensure that they had adequate training effects. For cardiorespiratory training, subjects were asked to perform 30-45 minutes of aerobic exercise (e.g., with an upper/lower limb ergometer, stepper, or treadmill) after a 10-minute warm-up in each session. The initial exercise intensity was based on the result of the Chester Step Test (predicted maximum heart rate) and the ratings of perceived exertion using modified Borg scale (0-10). The training zone and exercise intensity (resistance of ergometer, speed, or inclination of treadmill) were at 60-75% (up to 80-85% for fit subjects) of predicted maximum heart rate and rating of perceived exertion of 4-6/10, progressed accordingly (ACSM 1998). The resistance training consisted of 3 sets of a 10-15 repetition maximum load with a 1-2 minute rest interval, for each large muscle group of upper and lower limbs. Each set of resistance training was fatiguing and progressed by 5-10% increments in each successive session (ACSM 1998). A self-administered exercise logbook was also given to these patients and evaluated by the physiotherapists regularly during the training program. Regular phone follow-ups (twice weekly) were made to both groups of subjects in order to reinforce their compliance in home exercises. It was hypothesised that once the patients in the exercise group were taught how to improve their physical and cardiopulmonary fitness level they could regain a better physical profile and quality of life than those in the control group (Gauchard et al 2003) .
