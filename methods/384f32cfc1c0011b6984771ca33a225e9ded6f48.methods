Families with at least two children aged 1-5 years were recruited at two study sites (Pittsburgh, Charlottesville) in each of 3 years. After acquisition of informed consent, families were entered in October, followed through April of that year, and reimbursed $100/month for participation. The study was approved by the IRBs at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Virginia. The general protocol included acquiring demographic information on the children, followed by daily parental assignment of their children's status with respect to the presence/absence of a CFLI and the presence/absence of seven illness signs (i.e. runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, fever, irritability and earache), and periodic collection of nasal secretions for virus identification by PCR throughout the "typical cold season". Because there is no generally accepted criteria for assigning a CFLI in infants and children, CFLI presence/absence for each day was not based on predefined illness criteria, but rather on assignment for that day as determined by the caretaker. The initial plans were to collect secretion samples at regular intervals with supplemental sampling during CFLIs in the child or a family member but this was not possible for a variety of reasons. Consequently, a convenience sampling strategy was adopted that concentrated on CFLI periods, periods when the child's sib had a CFLI and other non-CFLI periods when acceptable to the children. For all years, the number of samples processed in each month from October through April was 149, 229, 219, 181, 211, 195 and 115 with some variability in the frequency of monthly samples among years. Parent-reported CFLI days were cast as a temporal string extending from entry to 30 April and CFLI episodes were defined by two or more CFLI days separated from other episodes by at least three non-CFLI days. Nasal secretions collected from the children were frozen at −70 and assayed in batch using PCR to detect adenovirus, coronavirus (types 229E and OC43), influenza virus (types A and B), parainfluenza (types 1-3) virus, rhinovirus/picornavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These viruses were sought using a protocol adapted from the Hexaplex procedure (Prodesse, Inc., Waukesha, WI) and previously described primers and probes (Winther et al., 2007) . Reported sensitivities of the PCR assays were ≤1 tissue culture infectious dose 50 /0.1 ml for picornavirus, 0.01 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for coronavirus, 0.28 TCID 50 /280 l for RSV and <1 TCID 50 /0.1 l for adenovirus (Winther et al., 2007) . For time periods with no CFLI or a single identified CFLI, individual virus/no virus detections were reduced by linking identical virus/no virus detections within a 20-day period as one detection/no detection. For each child, virus results were mapped onto the corresponding CFLI present/absent string. Virus detection within 5 days before, during or within 5 days after a CFLI episode was associated with the episode, +PCR+CFLI and operationally defined as a clinical vURI. A CFLI episode sampled for virus but with absent detection, −PCR+CFLI, was defined as UR inflammation of undermined etiology. Virus detection not associated with a CFLI episode, +PCR−CFLI, was defined as a subclinical vURI. For each assayed virus, the relative frequency of subclinical vURIs was calculated as +PCR−CFLI/+PCR. Pairwise comparisons of these frequencies were done using Fisher's exact test.
