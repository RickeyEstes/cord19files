This study was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's approach [43] and this systematic review is consistent with the PRISMA (the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist [44] . In addition, the GRADE approach [22] was also taken to grade the quality of evidence and make recommendation regarding the use of Kangfuxinye enema in the UC. Five methodological factors (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) were judged to downgrade or upgrade the quality of evidence [45] . Ethical approval and patient informed consent were waived because all data were extracted from previous studies.
