Decapeptides were chosen for comparison with the extramembrane segments of the proteolipid protein, the rationale being that decapeptides are more than sufficient to induce an immune response [11] and that epitopes of membrane proteins are generally located at extramembrane hydrophilic regions. Comparisons and statistical scorings were made using the database (release 6.8 of 28 August 1985, containing 3309 sequences) and programs of the Protein Identification Resource of the National Biomedical Research Foundation. The search program compared every decapeptide in bovine brain myelin proteolipid with every decapeptide in the database. The calculation of similarity scores was accomplished using the Mutation Data Matrix [12] program. For each proteolipid decapeptide, 709253 comparisons were made and the highest scoring segments and their standard deviations were printed out. We selected those viral decapeptides, similar to extramembrane hydrophilic segments of myelin proteolipid, with scores higher than 30, and which also exceed the average by 5 standard deviations; i.e., the probability that the match is due to random chance is <3 x 10 -7 . A VAX 11/750 computer was used for searching and calculations.
