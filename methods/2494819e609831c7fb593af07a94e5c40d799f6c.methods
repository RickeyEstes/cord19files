The research is primarily based on the investigators' recent involvement with a planning exercise for tourism development in the Guniujiang National Nature Reserve (hereafter GNNR). Established in 1988, GNNR is located across the borders of Qimen County and Shitai County in the southwest of China's Anhui Province (see Fig. 1 ). The study is conducted first of all by reviewing the 3-year implementation of 2001 -2020 Guniujiang Guanyintang Tourism Development Master Plan (hereafter GGTDMP, cf. Shenzhen Shenlanke Company Ltd., 2001 , which has been steered by a private investor to develop a national park in the reserve. Now the planned area (approximately one sixth of the acreage of 18,535 hm 2 ) has become a newly developed tourist attraction adjacent to the famous national mountain resort-Huangshan-in Anhui Province, bearing the name, Guniujiang National Geological Park (hereafter GNGP). The major reason for selecting the case is GGTDMP reflects the tourism planning undertaken in one of China's inland provinces, Anhui. Compared with the more prosperous and developed coastal regions, the inland of China has been increasingly marginalized and lagged behind in social, cultural and economic development since the 1980s when the Chinese central government adopted the policy to give development priority to the coastal regions. In order to catch up with the more developed coastal regions, the inland provinces are trying to exploit their abundant natural resources for development. Tourism is deemed an important field for such exploitation. Recently in Anhui Province, various tourism projects have been initiated for boosting the local economic development. GGTDMP is just one of them. In the inland regions, development plans are subject to higher rate of abortion due to the comparatively less developed social, cultural and economic conditions, therefore may offer typically exemplifying cases for such a research. The specific techniques for collecting and analyzing the data begin with a conceptualization of GPI, which aims to establish a theoretical framework for the research. While planning, in its broadest definition, is organizing the future to achieve certain objectives (Inskeep, 1991) , implementation literally denotes carrying out a plan to realize those objectives. So GPI can be regarded as a disparity or discontinuity between the two. To conceptualize GPI, an examination of the basic tourism planning process (see Fig. 2 ) is carried out, the results of which reveal two major phases-plan preparation and plan implementation. The whole process contains eight stages of which six are in the phase of plan preparation. They are study preparation, determination of objectives, surveys, analysis and synthesis, plan formulation and recommendations. Their ultimate purpose is to form ''recommendations'' that will guide activities in the phase of plan implementation, so as to achieve the goals of planning. The phase of plan implementation contains the last two stages. The first is to carry out the ''recommendations'' which are often made up of various action programs or projects indicated by specified schedules (WTO, 1994) . The second is, by monitoring and reformulation, to assess the effects of implementation periodically and adjust the initially prepared ''recommendations'' according to the collected feedback regarding the plan's implementation. The above examination of the basic tourism planning process reveals that GPI is a break of continuity, in tourism planning process, between ''recommendations'' (stage 6) and ''implementation'' (stage 7). GPI creates a disparity between the original intentions of planning and the actual implementation results. There exist two types of GPI (disparity): not implemented (the ''recommendations'' as a whole or in part fail to be carried out); deviated implementation (the plan's implementation fails to observe the ''recommendations''). This conceptualization of GPI leads to two major research questions that facilitate the study of the causes of GPI existing in the process of implementing GGTDMP. (1) To what extent have the elements of the ''recommendations'' of GGTDMP been implemented, in terms of carrying out the planned activities by planned schedules from 2001 to 2004? (2) What barriers to implementation has the park encountered during the course? These techniques are employed to seek the answers:
