Maintenance and SILAC adaption of L929 and PaKiT03 cell types Immortalised Pteropus alecto kidney cells [25] and L929 cells which were not used in SILAC experiments were maintained as follows: PaKiT03 cells were grown in DMEM Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham with 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4 (Sigma) and L929 cells were grown in MEM with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 2 mM Lglutamine (Life Technologies) both supplemented with 10% v/v foetal calf serum (FCS). For SILAC adaption, PaKiT03 and L929 cell types were maintained in Minimal Essential Media (MEM, Thermo Scientific) deficient in L-Lys and L-Arg, supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialysed FCS and differing combinations of L-Lys and L-Arg containing stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. L-Lys-2HCl + L-Arg-HCl (unlabelled, designated 'Light'), 13 C 6 L-Lys-2HCl + 13 C 6 L-Arg-HCl ('Medium') and 13
