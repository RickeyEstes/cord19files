From December 2004 to December 2012 we collected data concerning the activity of our Mobile ECMO team. All consecutive patients transferred by our mobile transport team were included in the study. Clinical records (Innovian Medical Suite © -Drager Medical) and manual data sheets were retro- spectively reviewed. Due to the retrospective observational design of the study, informed consent was waived, according to Italian Regulations (AIFA, Directive of March 20, 2008) . Data from the fi rst 14 transports have previously been published (13) . All patient transfers were performed from local trust to San Gerardo Hospital (SGH) and subsequently admitted into our 10-bedded General ICU. The National Health insurance covered the expenses of the transport, and the average cost was 10.000,00€ ± 800,00 per transport (ambulance 720,00 € ±278,00 -staff 2.500,00 € ±780,00 -medical devices: 6.500,00 € ±100,00). The alert protocol and procedure for patient eligible for ECMO treatment was based on phone call to our unit for the fi rst evaluation and commence for possible transport activation ( Figure 1) . Criteria for ECMO team activation were: reversible respiratory failure, PaO 2 value <50 mmHg with FiO 2 ≥60% for more 12 hours, Lung Injury Score ≥3; or respiratory acidosis pH ≤7.2 (13) . Exclusion criteria were: intracranial bleeding/haemorrhage, unable to undergoing to heparinization, negative prognosis,body weight ≥130 Kg (logistic and equipment restrictions). The internal standard procedure, in case of positive assessment for transport, guarantee an ECMO crew activation time within 60 to 90 minutes after the distress call. The basic team includes two intensivists (MD), one Registered Nurse specialist (RN) and one perfusionist. When possible, a professional on training joined the mission for transport education. The transportation program began in 2004 based on experience gained by our ICU staff from in-hospital patient transport on extracorporeal support (14) . Since 1994, in hospital transfers were performed by a mobilization system able to house all the biomedical equipment. This tool underwent continuous evaluation to optimize logistics and performance (15) . This device is composed of an x-ray spine board compatible and multi-storey counter top. The pulmonary ventilator, the ECMO pump, syringe pumps and monitoring are placed on shelves. The counter top is equipped with an electrical junction box that provides power to all equipment by a single connection from the main electricity network. Figure 2 shows the system's structure and Figure 3 Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 Table 1 -Technical data of ambulances used in inter-hospital transports. Technical data: Table 1 . The gas circuit has 4 connections: 2 for oxygen and 2 for compressed air (UNI grafts), controlled by an electronic unit with automatic switching from one cylinder to another. A gas monitoring and alarm system is in situ to check the working pressure and the residual gas availability. In case of electric failure it is possible to switch into manual pneumatic dispensing delivery of the gases. In order to reduce risks and guarantee the best comfort during transfer from ground to ambulance floor, the vehicle is equipped with a stretcher supported with hydro pneumatic suspension (model: STEM-Piuma ® ). In addition to oxygen and compressed air, it is possible to deliver nitric oxide via cylinder 10 L volume/200 ATM pressure via a nitric system. An additional vehicle transports the rest of the crew and equipment. All the equipment required to perform the cannulation and transport has been split into three bags. All the materials ( As far as the veno-venous support (twosites approach) is concerned, a drainage percutaneous cannula-multistage type was usually positioned in the left femoral vein and a percutaneous no multistage-cannula type was used for the reinfused blood, to avoid blood recirculation. Two types of centrifugal pump have been used: Rotaflow ® and Cardiohelp ® System. The first choice was the two-site veno-venous approach to allow for quick weaning from sedative drugs and an early mobilization of the patient (9) . All the cannulations were performed via percutaneous approach, using real-time ultrasound and a dilatation modified technique to reduce the enlargement stages (16) . At the time of arrival of the ECMO team, the following procedures were carried out : patient assessment and optimization of the ventilator setting (recruitment manoeuvre, lung protective ventilation with tidal volumes <6ml/Kg, trial of inhaled Nitric Oxide, apparatus dead space reduction by removal of mount connector or HME (heat and moisture exchange), close suctioning system and continuous EtCO 2 monitoring) (17) (18) (19) , to evaluate the safety and feasibility of patient transport with "conventional" ventilation (i.e. without ECMO). Criteria for transport with "conventional" ventilation were: pO 2 >90 mmHg with FiO 2 = 1, pCO 2 <65 mmHg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) <20 cmH 2 O. If these criteria were not met or in case for any reason a transport with "conventional" ventilation was not judged safe, an ECMO support was started on site and the patients were transferred on ECMO. After the ECMO support has been established, the minute ventilation is gradually (departure from and back to SGH) was equal to 508 minutes (±185 with range of 120-960 minutes). The longest distance of 1044 km was performed by transportation of the ambulance and team on the 'Hercules C 130' aircraft provided by the Italian Air Force. No mission was postponed or cancelled due to organizational failure or extreme weather conditions. For 28 (67%) transports, transfer pulmonary ventilator EVITA ® (4 or XL -Dräger Medical) were used, while in 13 cases (31%) SERVO I ® Maquet ventilator was the choice; and only for the first transport the Siemens SERVO 300 ® ventilator was used. The median number of syringe pumps used during transport was 4 (IQR 3-4/range 2-6). The median number of inotropic drugs (Dopamine, Dobutamine, Norepinephrine) administered during transport was equal to 1 (IQR 0-1/range 0-1). We did not report any morbidity or mortality due to the transport or to the ECMO support on transfer. The following complications were observed: in one patient battery failure of Evita XL® ventilator during transport from the ICU to the ambulance; in another case it was difficult to obtain an acceptable extracorporeal flow due to the patient's position and it was necessary to stop the ambulance to reposition the patient. No patient required transfusion of blood products during transport. The average days on ECMO were equal to 18.21 (±22.96 -range 2/116). The average length of stay in ICU was 26.07 days (±27.96 -range 2/126). 33 patients (79%) were discharged alive from SGH, 9 died in the ICU (21%). All patients who died were transported with ECMO support: no patient died during transport, but they all died while still on ECMO. In the group of patients who required ECMO support, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate differences between survivors and non-survivors with regard to: pre-ECMO ventilation days, days on ECMO and length of hospital stay. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of mechanical ventilation before the activation of the ECMO team: in survivors the median of pre-ECMO ventilation days was 2 (IQR:1-4) while in non-survivors was equal to 8 days (IQR:3-13) (p=0.04). Table 4 collects data of all patients related to pre-transfer, data collected on arrival to SGH and the ones related to patients transferred on ECMO versus no ECMO support.
