In September and October 2003, 96 focus groups were held across 16 European countries. Immunisation was discussed in 66 groups: 5 groups in Austria (Linz, Vienna), 5 in Belgium (Antwerp, Liege), 1 in Denmark (Vejle), 4 in Finland (Helsinki, Jyväskylä), 1 in France (Tours), 6 in Germany (Hamburg, Leipzig), 3 in Greece (Athens, Salonica), 4 in Ireland (Cork, Dublin), 7 in Italy (Milan, Rome), 5 in Luxembourg (Luxembourg City), 3 in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Eindhoven), 6 in Poland (Krakow, Warsaw), 3 in Portugal (Lisbon, Oporto), 6 in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid), 4 in Sweden (Orebro, Stockholm) and 3 in the United Kingdom (Glasgow, London). The topic guide was piloted in additional focus groups held in France and the United Kingdom. The focus group methodology enabled participants to discuss issues that they may not have previously considered and to form or challenge their opinions through discussions with other people [16] [17] [18] . Focus groups contained an average of eight people per group. Participants were recruited by Market Research companies in each country via a range of techniques: telephone directories, a recruiter database of contacts, and doorto-door and on-street recruitment. In order to reduce the chance that focus group discussions would be biased by people with strong views for or against particular issues, a screening questionnaire was used. Potential recruits were excluded if they responded that they were very active in working for political issues; if they had absolutely no interest in current political and social issues; or if they worked for the government or in marketing or the health industry. The groups were segregated according to gender; age (20-30 or 45-60 years); marital status; parental status; educational status; and smoking status. The combination of variables in each group was varied in different countries to ensure that each permutation was included. Table 1 provides an illustrative example. The number of focus groups conducted was large by qualitative standards, but the number of groups in each specific national demographic was proportionally less. Care must be taken if looking for similarities and differences between countries and demographic groups. Historical and legislative differences, linguistic issues and the small sample size involved must all be considered. It is possible that the findings may have been influenced by the timing of the study. Focus groups were held during September and October 2003 when the global panic surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was at a peak. This may have heightened public awareness over the dangers of communicable diseases and thus possibly increased support for immunisation per se and for State powers to impose vaccinations. However, this was also a time when fears over vaccine safety continued to be in the public consciousness in particular countries [19] , for example, MMR in Ireland, Italy and the UK [20] [21] [22] [23] and the use of mercury as a binding agent in the USA [6, 24, 25] . In some countries such concerns may have reduced support for immunisation and/or led to greater support for parental freedom to choose. It The focus groups each lasted approximately 2 h and were conducted in the appropriate local language. During the 2h sessions, a range of public health policies and potential interventions were discussed, including childhood immunisation, the fluoridation of public water supplies [26] , smoking, the physical punishment of children, the legalisation of cannabis, Not In My Back Yard issues (NIMBY-ism) and preferences for a high tax/high State provision society or a low tax/low State provision society. Participants spent no longer than 20 min discussing immunisation. The question on immunisation asked: Should the decision as to whether to vaccinate their own child be left to the parents? Or should vaccinations be enforced by the government in order to keep diseases (such as measles which can cause more death and damage to more children than the risks associated with the vaccine) out of society as a whole? This question was intentionally loaded. Childhood immunisation, and in particular compulsory childhood immunisation, is a contentious issue and the question was designed to elicit strong emotions and a focused debate. Each focus group was led by a trained group leader working from a semi-structured topic guide and approved prompts. The prompts were also designed to be dichotomous and provocative, both in support of compulsory immunisation and in support of parental freedom to choose. Participants were presented with these two extreme positions and were not taken through the various types of State compulsion or the range of alternatives between compulsion and parental choice. Rather, it was left to participants to consider and debate possible (preferred) alternatives. The focus groups were transcribed into the local language and translated into English. As the focus group data was so rich and nuanced, an inductive analysis [27, 28] was employed. A coding frame evolved as the transcripts were systematically interrogated by the research team [29] . The data was coded both vertically by issues arising from within topic-based discussions (e.g. debates around compulsory immunisation, concerns over vaccine safety, debates around the necessity and utility of immunisation per se), and horizontally as over-arching themes emerged (e.g. risk, immigration and trust). Transcripts were coded using Atlas.ti software and analysed using a general inductive approach which enabled the research team to explore the themes and issues that were felt to be important by the focus group participants [30] . Similarities and differences across sub-groups (e.g. focus groups in different countries, those with children and those without children) were also explored.
