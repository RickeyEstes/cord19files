In this retrospective study 1055 nasopharyngeal, tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveoloar lavage samples were taken from children (age 13 days to 5 years) hospitalised with respiratory tract infections in 2003 and 2004 in the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town. Croup as a specific diagnosis was not reported for any of these children. Samples had previously been screened by using an indirect immunofluorecence assay (Light Diagnostics, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) for the common respiratory viruses including RSV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, adenovirus and CMV. hMPV was also tested for using reverse-transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In the South African setting, where the prevalence of HIV is high, all infant respiratory samples are routinely screened for CMV as in our setting this virus is a major cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. For the detection of HCoV-NL63, RNA was extracted from 200 ll of sample using the Seek Viral RNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Talent, Trieste, Italy). Ten microlitres RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany) and the iScript kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). PCR amplification of a region of the 1b gene of HCoV-NL63 was used for screening and positive samples were confirmed by amplification of a portion of the 1a gene. Briefly 10 ll of cDNA was added to a 50 ll of PCR mix containing 2 IU Supertherm polymerase (JMR Holdings, Kent, UK), 1AE5 mm MgCl 2 , 200 lm each dNTP and 0AE2 lm primers. PCR was performed with two sets of outer primers, one set to the 1b gene and one targeting the 1a gene from the study of van der Hoek et al. 6 To improve sensitivity a nested PCR was performed using 2AE5 ll outer product and inner primers described by Smuts et al. 9 The 1b and 1a PCR products were 169 and 520 bp respectively. The 1a amplicons were sequenced directly and the nucleotide sequences were deposited into GenBank (EU477762-EU477770).
