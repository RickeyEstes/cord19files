WeChat (called Weixin in China), provided by Tencent Inc., is the largest social media in China with over 1 billion monthly active users. WeChat Index, accessed in WeChat app, is a publicly available data service that shows how frequent a specific keyword has appeared in posts, subscriptions, and search on WeChat over a period of last 90 days. Using WeChat Index, we obtained daily data from Nov 17, 2019 to Feb 14, 2020 for the keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease such as "SARS", "Feidian (Chinese abbreviation for severe acute respiratory syndrome)", "pneumonia", "fever", "cough", "shortness of breath", "dyspnea", "fatigue", "stuffy nose", "runny nose", "diarrhea", "coronavirus", "novel coronavirus", and "infection" (see the raw data in Appendix A). All the keywords except "SARS" were used in Chinese. Baidu is the dominant Chinese Internet search engine. Baidu Index (https://index.baidu.com), provided by Baidu Inc., can show how frequent a keyword has been queried over a time period from a region. The keywords related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease as mentioned above were also .

The daily data were plotted according to time for each of the keywords. As the outbreak is an isolated rather than recurrent event and the cut-off value to detect an outbreak based on social media and online search behavior is unknown, statistical analysis were not performed. The outbreak was announced by Wuhan Health Commission (WHC) on Dec 31, 2019 (D-day) and China CDC involved in investigation and response this day [11] . If WeChat Index for a keyword spiked or increased before D-day, the index for the keyword was considered as a potential candidate for the outbreak sign [12] .
