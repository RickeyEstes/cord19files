Following a stand-alone error-correction step, our pipeline performs the following three steps. First, we construct the set of "seed reads" by mapping the reads against provided reference sequences, which could be sequenced genomes or functional sites such as genes. All the reads that can be mapped to the reference constitute the set of "seed reads". The read mapping process can be conducted using existing tools such as Bowtie2 [25] . Second, we recruit reads that form significant overlaps with the seed reads. Newly recruited reads will be added to the seed set. This process will iterate until no new reads can be recruited. Third, we conduct strain-level assembly using the reads identified in the second step.
