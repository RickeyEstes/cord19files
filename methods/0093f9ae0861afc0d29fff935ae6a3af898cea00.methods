Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University (KUPRI). KUPRI houses 13 species (Pan troglodytes, Hylobates agilis, Papio hamadryas, Macaca fuscata, Macaca mulatta, Macaca cyclopis, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca radiata, Ateles belzebuth, Cebus apella, Aotus trivirgatus, Saguinus oedipus, Callithrix jacchus) and ca. 1,200 individual nonhuman primates including 800 Japanese macaques, 250 rhesus macaques, 140 common marmosets, 13 chimpanzees, and 11 cynomolgus macaques. The macaques are kept either in individual primate cages (W900 3 D650 3 H820 mm) in air-conditioned rooms, in outdoor group cages or in open enclosures. Pelleted diets (AS, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) and supplementary diets such as fruit and vegetables are provided twice a day. Fresh water is provided by an automatic watering system. At KUPRI, environmental enrichment has been promoted to improve behavior and psychological conditions of all macaques. Japanese macaques. We examined affected Japanese macaques that were dead or euthanized. As non-infected controls, we also examined Japanese macaques that were raised at the second campus at KUPRI, among which there were no affected macaques. April 28, 2006) . This study was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. No specific animal research protocol was drafted for this study as only clinical samples were analyzed for diagnostic purposes. The protocol to collect samples in control macaques was reviewed and approved by the Monkey Committee at KUPRI, and then authorized by the Kyoto University Animal Experimentation Committee (2011-115). Extensive veterinary care was provided to all macaques affected to minimize pain and distress. Macaques in extreme thrombocytopenia were humanely euthanized using overdose of pentobarbital by veterinarians. Clinical investigation and necropsy. Clinical investigations were performed on affected macaques and some macaques who were kept in the same room together with the affected macaques. Symptomatic treatment were initially provided to the affected macaques, however these treatments were not effective. After Nov. 2009, the affected macaques were euthanized due to poor prognosis and risk of spreading infection. Necropsies were performed on all dead and euthanized macaques, and samples were taken for further investigation. Antibody tests against viral pathogens. To determine the virus that was responsible for the disease, antibodies against Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses, all of which induce hemorrhagic syndromes in humans, were examined at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Neutralizing antibodies against CDV were also tested, because CDV is known to cause a lethal disease in macaques 26 . Antibody tests against eight primate viral agents [SEBV, CMV, simian varicella virus (SVV), B virus (BV), SIV, simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV), SFV, and SRV] were conducted at the Corporation for Production and Research of Laboratory Primates. The corporation is an inspection agency which established original testing procedures for monkey viruses. Detailed procedures for the antibody tests used at the corporation have not been published. However, the corporation is the only inspection agency in Japan that can perform these antibody tests. Most primate research institutes in Japan use this inspection agency and it is trusted. Electron microscopy (EM). Viral particles in the plasma of three Japanese macaques that developed thrombocytopenia were examined by transmission EM. The plasma was diluted three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were clarified further by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 30 min. The virus particles, if any, were pelleted using 20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS at 31,000 rpm for 2 h, resuspended in PBS, and subjected to EM analysis. The samples were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde, negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, and observed under a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Isolation of viral RNA and proviral DNA. Viral RNA was isolated from the plasma or serum of macaques at onset using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) or a High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan). Proviral DNA was also isolated from blood using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR and PCR analyses of viral pathogens. Viral pathogens in the plasma of three Japanese macaques that contracted severe thrombocytopenia (ID: HGN174, HGN181 and IZ1470) were examined. Twenty DNA viruses and 13 RNA viruses listed in Table 3 were tested by RT-PCR or PCR based on the previous studies 3, 12, or using the in-house testing procedures at National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Rapid determination of viral sequences (RDV) method. RDV was performed as described previously 54, 55 . In this study, RNA and DNA were extracted independently from partially purified viral fractions, which were prepared as described in the ''Electron microscopy'' section. Hae III and Alu I restriction enzymes were used to synthesize the second cDNA library. Metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic analysis was performed using a highthroughput sequencer. Total RNA was extracted from specimens with TRI-LS (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) and reverse-transcribed with a Transplex whole transcriptome amplification (WTA1) kit (Sigma-Aldrich) 56 using a quasi-random primer according to the manufacturer's protocol with modifications (i.e., 70 cycles of PCR). PCR amplification to prepare the template DNA for pyrosequencing was performed using AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase LD (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) 56 . Because almost all of the amplified cDNA were within the 200-1,000-bp range, the PCR products were used as templates directly for emulsion PCR in GS Junior pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences). The obtained data were then subjected to a data analysis pipeline for BLAST search. Data analysis was performed with computational tools using each read sequence, as described previously 56 . Detection of SRV-4 viral genome by RT-PCR or PCR. The viral RNAs from Japanese macaques were examined by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that were specifically designed for SRV-4 4 . The partial regions of the gag gene were amplified using following two primer sets; aSRV-F1167 and aSRV-R1710, and/or aSRV-F429 and aSRV-R855 4 . RT-PCR was performed with OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) as reported previously with some modification 4 . RT-PCR cycles were performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) as follows: 50uC for 30 min, 95uC for 15 min, 40 cycles at 95uC for 30 s, 45uC for 32 s, and 72uC for 75 s, and 1 cycle at 72uC for 2 min 4 . In addition, the gag region of proviral DNA was amplified by nested PCR using primers (Tga1, Tga2, Tga3, and Tga4) that specifically detected the gag region of the SRV/D-T (SRV-4) 12 . www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 8850 | DOI: 10.1038/srep08850 Virus isolation. Virus isolation tests with Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586), human SLAM-Vero 57 , canine SLAM-Vero cells 58 , and embryonated egg cultures were performed using the plasma or clots from the affected macaques. PBMCs were isolated from SRV-4 provirus-positive Japanese macaques (ID: TH1626 and IZ1470) by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and washed with PBS. Approximately 5 3 10 5 PBMCs were cocultured with 2 3 10 5 Raji cells (a Burkitt's lymphoma B-cell line) in complete medium, which comprised RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), concanavalin A (10 mg/ ml), and recombinant interleukin-2 (200 U/ml). Viral CPE was monitored during cocultivation 5 . DNA from Raji cells cocultured with PBMCs was extracted using a NucleoSpin Blood Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). Then the gag region was amplified by nested PCR using the SRV-4 specific primer set described above 12 . Phylogenetic analysis. The partial regions of the gag gene were amplified by RT-PCR using the primer set, aSRV-F1167 and aSRV-R1710, as described above. The RT-PCR products were purified using MinElute PCR Purification Kits (Qiagen) or cleaned enzymatically with Calf intestine Alkaline Phosphatase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and Exonuclease I (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). Direct sequencing was performed with a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI 3130xl generic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences of the samples in this study were combined with previous data (database accession numbers: SIVRV1CG for SRV-1; M16605, AF126468, and AF126467 for SRV-2; M12349 and AF033815 for SRV-3; FJ971077, FJ979638, FJ979639, GQ454446, and AB181392 for SRV-4; and AB611707 for SRV-5) and aligned using the CLUSTALW computer program 59 . Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with MEGA 6.0 60 . Evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method. The phylogenetic tree was evaluated using a bootstrap test based on 1,000 resamplings. The sequence of simian endogenous retrovirus (SERV; STU85505) was used as an outgroup to indicate the location of the root of the ingroup.
