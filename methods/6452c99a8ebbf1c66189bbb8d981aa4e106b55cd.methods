This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statements [18] . Multiple search strategies were employed to summarize the existing evidence relating to animal assisted therapy or animal assisted activity for inpatients. Searches for papers reporting data about the effectiveness or the risks of animal use in hospitals were carried out using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, PsychInfo, Ebsco Animals, PROQUEST, Web of Science, CINAHL and MEDLINE. Three researchers (EC, GP and GV) independently performed a systematic search using the following strings: "Animal assisted activity" AND hospital, "Animal assisted therapy" AND hospital, "Animal assisted intervention" AND hospital, "Pet therapy" AND hospital, "Animal assisted activity" AND hospitalization, "Animal assisted therapy" AND hospitalization, "Animal assisted intervention" AND hospital, "pet therapy" AND hospitalization. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they: were conducted in hospitals or in long-term care facilities were written in English, Spanish or Portuguese considered interventions of "Animal Assisted Therapy", "Animal Assisted Activity" or "Animal Assisted Intervention" No restriction was performed based on inpatient age, pathology, or type of animal used. All types of papers were included, since RCTs were few and did not give a complete overview of the topic. Articles were excluded if they: were conducted outside the hospital were published before 2000 used robotic animals were case reports or letters to the editor Three investigators (EC, GP and GV) independently conducted a first literature search, sorting sources by title and abstract. Then, the eligible studies for full text review were selected. During the first screening, the irrelevant or duplicated papers were excluded. The search was completed through a reference list screening. Finally, the researchers independently assessed the articles considering the criteria enunciated above.
