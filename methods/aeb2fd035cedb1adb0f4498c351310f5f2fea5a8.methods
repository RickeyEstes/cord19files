Protein expression BG505 SOSIP.664 and B41 SOSIP.664 trimers were expressed by transient transfection (cotransfected with furin) in HEK293F (Invitrogen; mycoplasma-free) and purified as previously described using 2G12-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography 28, 29 . The two N-terminal domains of human CD4 were cloned into vector pHCMV3 with an Nterminal Ig-kappa secretion signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for expression in HEK293F. One liter of 293 Freestyle cells was transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of DNA. After 7 days, the supernatant containing the secreted protein was applied to a 5ml HisTrap
