Cloning and Protein Purification. ISG15 and Met1 diubiquitin were cloned into an His-tagged expression vector (32 The catalytic activity of Lb pro was also monitored using an antibody that recognizes GlyGlymodified Lys residues. Loading controls are in Fig. S6C. (B) Infection assays using an FMDV Lb pro -mengovirus chimera. The catalytic activity of Lb pro was monitored as in A, with the difference being that ISG15 was detected using an anti-ISG15 antibody (Left). A catalytically inactive FMDV Lb pro -mengovirus (C51A) was used as a control. Fig. S6D shows loading controls. (C) FMDV infection time course using BHK fibroblast cells transfected with FLAG-ISG15 and the ISG15 conjugation machinery. Lb pro catalytic activity was monitored with anti-FLAG (Top) and anti-GlyGly (Bottom) antibodies. All assays were performed in triplicate. purified according to ref. 33 . For the ISG15 CTD -ΔC probe, ISG15 (amino acids 79-154) was cloned in frame into the intein/chitin binding domain pTXB1 vector. ISG15-intein was expressed and purified according to refs. 17 and 34. SI Methods has expression and purifications procedures for His-tagged ISG15 and Met1 diubiquitin. Biochemistry Assays. ISG15-AMC assays were performed as described previously (18) . Ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like TAMRA assays were performed according to ref. 35 . ISG15-TAMRA reagent was used to determine Michaelis-Menten kinetics (additional details are in SI Methods). Cleavage assays of pro-ISG15 CTD and mature ISG15 CTD were performed under the same conditions as the TAMRA assays. ISG15 probe assays were also performed under these conditions. SI Methods has condition details. MS analysis was performed according to ref. 36 . Crystallography. The Lb pro ∼ISG15 CTD -ΔC complex was purified by anion chromatography (Resource Q) and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol. After dialysis, the complex was concentrated to 4 mg/mL and set up at a 1:1 protein:precipitant ratio in a sitting drop vapor diffusion format. Crystals grew in 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Na citrate, pH 5.6, and 0.2 M K/Na tartrate and were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% glycerol. Crystallographic data were collected at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron (Table S1 ). Additional descriptions of the methods are listed in SI Methods. Model for Lb pro action against ISG15 and ubiquitin. Lb pro preferentially targets ISG15 over ubiquitin, which results from an optimized hydrophobic ISG15 binding site. The acidic groove coordinates the C terminus of ISG15 into the active site of Lb pro and enables cleavage between Arg and GlyGly of the modifiers. This has two consequences: it renders ISG15 or ubiquitin incapable of (re-) conjugation and leaves substrates modified with a GlyGly remnant on their Lys residues. GlyGly-modified Lys remnants can be detected using available antibodies, enabling infection detection strategies. NTD, N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain.
