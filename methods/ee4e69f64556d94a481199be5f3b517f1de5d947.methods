Using a mixed methods design, the study starts with a qualitative approach followed by a quantitative questionnaire-based survey. The main goal of this study was to explore main barriers against the expansion of MT in recent years in Iran. In both parts, subjects were selected from professionals in different ministries and organizations including: the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, Iran Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Mine, Industry and Commerce, some medical universities, and some public, semi-public and private hospitals and medical centers. In the qualitative part data were collected using two methods: 1. In-depth interviews: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 unique participants from three ministries/organizations ( Table 1 ). The interview transcripts were analyzed using the 'framework' analysis approach. This involved a five-step process: I. Familiarization; II. Identifying a thematic Framework; III. Indexing; IV. Charting; and V. Mapping and Interpretation. 2. Focus Groups: three focus groups were arranged with 22 unique participants from seven ministries/organizations (Table 1) . In this section, data analysis consisted of examining, categorizing, and recombining the ideas to address the main objectives of this study. In parallel to the above mentioned parts, all available documents and reports of the MOHE were reviewed and relevant concepts were extracted. Afterwards, the qualitative findings were analyzed and accordingly and on the basis of extracted concepts from review of the MOHME documents a structured questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire face and content validity was confirmed by a group of scholars from the focus group participants and the questionnaire reliability was tested using a Cronbach's alpha which was calculated 0.8. A purposive sampling method was used to select 61 eligible participants from aforementioned seven ministries/organizations (Table 1 ). All questionnaires were returned in due time. The study was carried out from July-September 2015. The questionnaires' items were described using appropriate tables and graphs. The average score of each item was calculated in a scale between 0 and 10. At the end, the findings of qualitative and quantitative parts and extracted themes from the literature review were combined and summarized in simple descriptive tables.
