A short six item pandemic infl uenza question module was developed, as the fi rst part of a larger module of questions on potential threats. These questions were fi eld tested, validated and subsequently administered within the NSW Population Health Survey, using the NSW Health Survey program CATI Anticipated public health compliance for pandemic infl uenza system, between January 22nd and March 31st, 2007. The NSW population health survey includes questions on health behaviors, health status (including psychological distress, using the Kessler 10 measure, 20 and self-rated health status), access to health services, as well as the demographics of the respondents and the households. The target sample was persons living in NSW stratifi ed by the state's eight area health services. Households were contacted using random digit dialing. Details of the sampling approach can be found in the 2007 NSW Health survey report. 21
