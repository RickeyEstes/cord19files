This was a prospective cohort study of all infants who were hospitalized in the NICUs at PMH and WIH from January 15, 2012, to January 31, 2013. The PMH NICU is a 90-bed, Level 3C, predominantly inborn unit with approximately 1200 admissions annually. Gowning is not required for entrance into any areas of the NICU, and neither is the use of gloves for all patient contacts. Parents have unlimited access except in the high-acuity area, where visiting is discouraged from 9 a.m. to noon, when daily patient rounds are held. Visitors are limited to 2 per visit; siblings $12 years of age may visit anytime with a parent. Siblings <12 years of age may visit with a parent twice a week under the supervision of a Child Life specialist; they must have received all the recommended childhood vaccinations, including influenza vaccine. The WIH NICU is an 80-bed, Level 3-4 regional facility comprising predominantly single-family rooms that has on average 1200 admissions annually. Gowning is not required for entrance into any area of the NICU, and neither is routine use of gloves for patient contacts. Parents have unlimited access and they may have up to 2 visitors per visit. Siblings of any age may visit provided they have received all ageappropriate vaccinations, including influenza vaccine, and after undergoing screening to confirm lack of fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms or recent exposure to individuals with such symptoms. Parents and visitors are requested to perform a 1-minute fingertip-to-elbow disinfectant scrub upon first entering the infant's room and use hand sanitizer after touching any surfaces and before handling the infant. Infants were eligible if they were inborn, had never been discharged to home, and were evaluated for possible lateonset sepsis and antibiotic therapy was initiated at >72 hours of age. Eligible infants were identified by daily review of all antibiotics provided by the NICU pharmacists. Infants who received antibiotics for only superficial skin or surgical-site infection were excluded. After obtaining informed consent, enrolled infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by PCR within 72 hours of initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for pertinent maternal and infant demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until discharge from the NICU. In addition, at the time of consent, the mother or legal guardian of the infant was asked whether any one at home had symptoms of suspected respiratory viral infection. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, WIH, and Rhode Island Hospital.
