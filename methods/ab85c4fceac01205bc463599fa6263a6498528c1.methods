The study involved patients with age ≤3 months admitted at Pediatric Department of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome from March 1st, 2011 until September 30th, 2013, with acute respiratory symptoms or conditions (cough, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, bronchiolitis, apnea, acute life threatening episode). For all the patients, a nasopharyngeal specimen was tested for Bordetella pertussis (BP) and for viruses generally associated to respiratory infections (RV) such as Adenovirus, Influenzae Virus, Parainfluenzae Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus and Rhinovirus. The samples were obtained within 24 h of admission by trained nurses and processed within 48-72 h. The medical records of subjects were retrospectively reviewed. Information collected included age, gender, medical history, immunization status, clinical presentation, ongoing antibiotic therapy, admission diagnosis, length of illness, length of hospital stay, laboratory test results, concurrent infections and complications (requirement of oxygen therapy, pneumonia, death). Patients who had received the first dose of DPT vaccine were excluded from the study. For nucleic acid extraction 10 μl of internal control (IC) were added to 200 μl of sample for BP and to 400 μl for RV, obtaining 90 and 60 μl of eluate respectively, by using the automatic "magnetic beads-based" EZ1 Advanced XL (Qiagen) instrument. Primers and Probe for IC were provided by the manufacturer (Argene, Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The IC in use for this assay is referring to a "capsided" synthetic sequence that need to be lysed before being processed in extraction protocol and handled as well as "regular" specimen. The bacterial DNA was processed immediately on Taqman platform (Applied Biosystem) with Bordetella R-gene™ assay (Argene, Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), able to amplify a fragment of 191 bp of the target region IS481 for BP. The ready-to-use amplification mixture included primers, dNTPs, amplification buffer, Taq Polymerase, probes specific for Bordetella and for the IC. The target DNA was amplified through the Taq Polymerase activation at 95°C for 15 min, and 45 repeats of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s and hybridization/elongation at 60°C for 40 s. The Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) targeting IS481 is the most commonly used diagnostic tool when suspecting pertussis given its high sensitivity since up to 238 copies of IS481 is found in the BP genome. The high sensitivity does not correspond to high specificity, as few copies of IS481 are also present in the genome of Bordetella holmesii and Bordetella bronchiseptica [16] . We assumed as positive patient for pertussis a subject who received a positive RT-PCR result (following described as BP+). For RV detection samples were analyzed by reverse transcription and gene amplification with RT-PCR. All procedures performed in studies were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the Institutional Scientific Review Board of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital.
