Monoclonal antibody production. For expression of m336 IgG1, the previously described m336 IgG1 vector 23 was used to infect CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After screening of 960 clones for antibody productivity by ELISA and subsequent characterization, a stable cell line was generated and inoculated into a Bioflo 410 bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ) for large-scale production of m336 IgG1. Purification was carried out by using a protein G column (GE Healthcare), and endotoxin was removed by Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Columns (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
