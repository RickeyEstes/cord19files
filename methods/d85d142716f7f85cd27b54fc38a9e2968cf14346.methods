We modeled each pathogen with a deterministic SEIR transmission model coupled to a simple observation model: , and I are the proportion of the population that is susceptible, infected but not yet infectious, and infectious, respectively. β is the effective contact rate, σ is the rate of movement from pre-infectious to infectious ,and γ is the rate of loss of infectiousness. The β ' is the strength of the interruption to disease transmission during the extreme weather event, which operates on a square pulse θ t between times t start and t end . In the observation model, H is the number of observed infections, p is the convolution of sampling probability and population size. The α parameter is the strength of the interruption of observation during the extreme weather event, which is assumed to be -10% based on hospital visit data (Figure 1 ).
