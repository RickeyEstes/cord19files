Derivation of Equation 2. The accumulation of substitutions in a genome occurs via mutation and recombination, with associated per nucleotide rates µ and R. These rates can be interpreted as the per nucleotide probability of a substitution occurring in a replication event. Assuming mutation and recombination are independent processes, the probability of a substitution (variability) at each nucleotide can be represented as: The probability that a substitution occurs for each nucleotide can be interpreted as a rate of substitution per replication event. Substitution events are assumed to be deleterious. Each event contributes to the reduction in fitness of the viral progeny, and these events accumulate in a genome, creating non-linear declines in fitness. Viral genome size is constrained by this reduction in fitness: larger genomes accumulate more substitutions and potential for fitness reduction is greater than for small genomes [14, 18] . Nucleotide-level fitness thus corresponds to genome-level fitness, and successful production of nucleotide variability is constrained by the fitness decay that occurs with increasing genome size. For purposes here, fitness will be synonymous with viability of each replicated genome. Setting the fitness of the parental virion or template genome at 1, fitness of progeny takes values between 0 and 1. Because a mutation and recombination event at a given nucleotide are mutually exclusive, the probability of each event occurring separately can be calculated as Across mutational models, fitness (infectivity) due to lethal mutagenesis is given as ω mut = e −µγ(nt) [18] . The fitness in the event of recombination is demonstrated to be ω recomb = ρ m(d−m) d−1 [17] , where m is the number of amino acid substitution events due to recombination and d is the . Because mutation and recombination are components of fitness, the probability of each occurring with exclusion of the other at each nucleotide must be accounted. This can be done by replacing µ with P r(µ\R) and R with P r(R\µ). Genome-level fitness for substitution events can be calculated as The resulting rate of per nucleotide variability produced is the product of variability accumulation and the average fitness of each genome replicated. When µ and R are sufficiently small such that µR µ, R (i.e. lim µ,R→0 µR µ+R = 0), then equation S5 can be approximated as This is given by equation 2 in the main text. Parameter values for figure 1. in table S1. r is the rate constant (k pol ) for RNA dependent RNA polymerase in nucleotides per second. This is the speed at which the replicase complex can replicate RNA. I is the product of r and the amount of additional time (in seconds) required to replicate a strand of RNA outside of the elongation phase plus any additional delay associated with replicating multiple, short strands of RNA rather than fewer, long strands on which multiple replicase complexes could be active simultaneously. The value for I chosen was simply an order of magnitude smaller than the large Coronavirus genomes, though this delay has not been quantified in scientific literature. This value is important in determining the genome size at which the maximum rate of production of genetic variability (per second) occurs. µ is the mutation rate per nucleotide per replication event by RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This quantity can vary around the value given in table S1, but the value chosen is an appropriate approximation for ssRNA(+) viruses. R is the recombination rate per nucleotide per replication event. This value varies considerably in RNA viruses but tends to be high for many ssRNA(+) viruses. γ gives the proportion of lethal mutations of the total number of mutations. The vast majority of mutations fall into three categories: neutral, deleterious, or lethal. There is likely variation in the respective proportions of each for viruses, though few attempts have been made to quantify these proportions. In the study referenced, one-third of mutations resulted in viral particles that were not capable of infecting (infectivity assay). This constitutes a lethal mutation and is a good estimate of fitness reduction for cross-species transmission events. ρ represents the effective tolerance of proteins to a single recombination event. Misfolding proteins likely constitute lethality or severe reduction in fitness in viruses, so this measure is used to simulate the reduction in fitness in the event of amino acid substitutions due to recombination. D is the proportion of dissimilar nucleotides in a co-infecting viral strain or species. Higher dissimilarity results in higher probability of amino acid substitutions due to recombination. 12% dissimilarity is the nucleotide dissimilarity between COVID-19 and SARS-COV. Literature review. Peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched for reports on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans using the Web of Science electronic library database for published reports through 2019. Keywords were used in the search as specified in the main text. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization reports as well as published compilations of human infectious diseases were also used as references, but reported viruses were cross-validated as zoonotic with other supporting peer-reviewed literature [1, 5, 19] . Zoonotic viruses were identified as having known non-human and human hosts via molecular or serological assay (seroconversion). Viral infections supported by circumstantial evidence sans assay verification were not included. The list of zoonotic viruses was formed after searching for complete genome sequences on the NCBI database [12] then extending to other peer-reviewed full genome sequences if the virus was not found in the NCBI database. This final list included 126 unique viral species. Each viral species was classified according to the Baltimore classification system by mRNA production/genome structure. The compiled list is included as table S3. Non-zoonotic virus filtering. The entire NCBI database on viral genomes was downloaded and screened for animal-associated viruses. The category of unidentified viruses was excluded from the screening process. All incomplete sequences were excluded as well. The majority of viruses are labeled with host associations, though in many instances, these labels were found to be inaccurate. Viruses were organized by families and screened initially by known host range. Viral families associated with prokaryotes, archaea, plants, or fungi exclusively were not included. Satellite viruses and viroids were also excluded. Remaining genera and species were manually cross-checked with existing literature to verify the belonging as animal associated. If 13 .

The animal grouping was assigned due to the difficulty of parsing associations further to vertebrates. Many viruses are recovered from vectors or other invertebrates, yet have known or unknown association with vertebrates. Sometimes viruses have no known association outside of an insect vector, though relatives of the virus are known to infect vertebrate hosts. As an exercise to ensure genome size did not differ substantially between vertebrate and invertebrate-associated viruses, another filtering process was conducted manually whereby each species was cross-validated with existing literature to remove known or likely known to not be associated with a vertebrate host. The total number of non-zoonotic viruses was reduced from 2088 to 1533 in this process. Performing one-tailed Welch's T-tests with this new data set revealed little departure from previous conclusions. Results are presented in table S2 and Fig. S1. 14 .
