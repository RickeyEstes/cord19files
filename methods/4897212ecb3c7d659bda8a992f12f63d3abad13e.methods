This in vivo blinded study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (OBA, Pisa, prot. n. 33,479/2016 of 29.06.2016) and was carried out at the University of Pisa's dairy farm, where nearly 100 animals are maintained in free-stall conditions. During the study period, the population consisted of 40 Italian Friesian calves aged between 1 and 60 days. All the calves underwent the same management condition. Briefly, immediately after birth they were weighed and then housed in a single straw-bedding pen (2.5 × 2 m) that leads contact between each other. Two L of good colostrum (≥50 g/L of Ig) from their own dam, or from the colostrum bank, were administered as soon as the calf could drink (30 min -2 h). Another 2 L were administered within the next 4-8 h in order to achieve a good passive transfer immunity [22] . All the calves received a total of 4 L of colostrum, twice a day, until the third day of life. Then, they received 6 L of whole milk at 39°C, twice a day until the third week of life. All the feeding procedures were conducted by an expert operator and by using a nipple bucket. Even when there were cases of diarrhea, there were still no feeding restrictions or changes of feeding regime. From the third day of life, fresh and clean water were provided to each calf ad libitum. Free choice-hay was administered after the first week of life. The calves were weighed and moved into a collective pen after the third week of life. The inclusion criteria were calves up to three weeks of life and the manifestation of diarrhea, defined as a fecal score ≥ 1 [1] . Briefly, the fecal score represents the evaluation of feces fluidity as reported in literature: score 0 means "normal", thus firm, but not hard and the original form is distorted slightly after dropping to the floor and settling; score 1 means "soft", thus does not hold its form, but piles and spreads slightly (like soft-serve ice cream); score 2 means "runny", thus spreads readily to about 6 mm depth. (i.e., pancake batter); score 3 means "watery", thus liquid consistency, splatters. (i.e., orange juice) [23] . Since the first day of diarrhea (T0), the fecal score (FS) was recorded daily by the same expert operator until the complete recovery from diarrhea, at the same time, the physical examination has been done. The duration of a diarrheic episode (DDE) was defined as the period (in days) between the first diarrhea outbreak (fecal score ≥ 1) and the normalizing of the FS (fecal score = 0). Once the diarrhea had started, a fecal sample was collected from each calf by manual restraint. A gloved, lubricated finger was passed gently through the anus in order to massage the rectal wall and to stimulate rectal evacuation. Fresh feces were then collected in two different sterile tubes: one aliquot was immediately tested with a rapid ELISA test (test strips for detection of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, E. coli F5 and C. parvum in bovine feces, Biox Diagnostics, Belgium), while the second aliquot was stored in a refrigerated bag and evaluated within one hour for gastrointestinal parasites, according to Izzo et al. (2015) [1] . At the inclusion time, calves were randomly assigned to a control group (C) or a tannin-treated group (T), both made up of 12 calves (6 males and 6 females in each of the two groups). All the calves enrolled in group C received Effydral® (Italy Zoetis Ltd.) (sodium chloride 2.34 g, potassium chloride 1.12 g, sodium bicarbonate 6.72 g, citric acid anhydrous 3.84 g, lactose monohydrate 32.44 g, glycine 2.25 g) in 2 L of warm water q24h. The calves assigned to group T received Effydral® (Italy Zoetis Ltd.) in 2 L of warm water plus 10 g of chestnut tannins as extract powder (750 g/kg of dry matter equivalent of tannic acid; Mauro Saviola Group srl, Radicofani, Siena, Italy) q24h. The chemical composition of the powder is described in Campo et al. (2016) [24] . The powder adopted in the present study was produced in a single batch and analyzed by the manufacturer at the beginning of the study. Both solutions were administered using a graduated calves bottle in order to ensure the intake of the entire quantity. The bottle was equipped with a flexible rubber nipple (10 cm of length) specific for calf feeding. Calves in both groups received the solutions until the normalization of the FS. Before the administration of the treatments, all the calves were daily submitted to a complete physical examination and FS evaluation until the resolution of diarrhea. Physical examination included evaluation from a distance plus hands-on examination, focusing on: physical appearance, body weight, body condition, head, mouth, eyes, ears, neck and back, thorax, abdomen, umbilicus, musculoskeletal system, perianal region, body temperature, feces, urine, and external genitalia [25, 26] . Dehydration status was assessed with a score system [27] . Milk intake was recorded during the entire diarrheic episode. At the conclusion of the study, the female calves were raised in the farm as rearing cows, while the male calves were sold for fattening as meat animals. Data concerning the weight at birth and at the third week of life, the age of diarrhea onset and the T0 fecal scores (T0-FS) recorded for both groups were assessed for normal distribution by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and then a Mann-Whitney test was applied in order to verify differences between the two groups at the inclusion time [28] . The average daily gain between birth date and third week of life was calculated for all the calves in both groups. Data concerning the average daily gain, the DDE and fecal scores recorded throughout the DDE were analyzed by a linear model including treatments and sex and their interaction as fixed factors. A Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed to assess data distribution. A Mann-Whitney test was carried out to verify differences between the two groups regarding the average daily gain, the DDE and the fecal scoring [28] . Values with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
