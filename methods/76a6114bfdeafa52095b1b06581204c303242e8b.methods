In the 19 months since August 2004 when we introduced hMPV PCR testing as part of our respiratory screen, 9274 respiratory samples were screened using real time RT-PCR for hMPV and 13 other viruses. This survey of respiratory samples, the largest to date, included influenza virus (A, B and C), corona virus (NL63, OC42 and 229E), rhinovirus, RSV A and B and para-influenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4. The hMPV real time RT-PCR amplified a 70 bp fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene (Jane et al., 2005) .
