hDPP4 mice were randomly assigned to intranasal or intramuscular vaccination with 10 8 infectious units of either a control ChAdOx1 eGFP or the ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine. The experiment was performed blinded and the experimenters had no knowledge of group allocation of the individual mice and the analysed samples. Sera were obtained before vaccination and 28 days post vaccination and post challenge analysed with a virus neutralisation assay with HCoV-EMC/2012 MERS-CoV or ELISA as described previously. 12, 15 Approval of animal experiments was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. The performance of experiments was done following the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) by certified staff in an AAALAC-approved facility, following the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Work with infectious MERS-CoV strains under BSL3 conditions was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). Inactivation and removal of samples from high containment was performed according to IBC-approved standards.
