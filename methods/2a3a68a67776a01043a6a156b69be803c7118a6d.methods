Plasmids, antibodies, and chemicals. The full-length, infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 58 and the Vpu-defective counterpart NL4-3delVpu 2 have been described previously. The codon-optimized Vpu expression plasmid pcDNA-Vphu was used to express the Vpu 59 . pNL4-3delVpu and pcDNA-Vphu were kindly provided by K. Strebel. The N-terminally HA epitope-tagged tetherin expression vector, the deletion mutants of human tetherin delCT and delGPI, tetherin from African green monkey (agm), and chimeric human tetherin with agm transmembrane domain (Hu-Agm) were described previously 8, 11 , and were generously provided by P. Bieniasz. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to introduce Ala substitutions at three cysteines (C53, C63, C91; referred to as CCC) and two asparagines (N65, N92), and serine, threonine and serine (S2,T3,S4 referred as 2STS), two lysines (K17, K20), and, in combination, serine, threonine and lysine (STSKK) residues in the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin. Anti-HA, anti-FLAG and anti-tubulin antibodies, anti-HA conjugated agarose beads, and kifunensine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Anti-human transferrin receptor antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and anti-CD4 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas). Anti-calnexin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Zenon antibody labeling kits and the Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated secondary antibody were from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Anti-SGTA and anti-Bag6 antibodies were raised in rabbit 33 . Anti-Vpu 40 , anti-tetherin, and anti-HIV-1 Ig were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Yeast two-hybrid screening. The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out at Myriad Genetics (Salt Lake City, UT). Briefly, the PNY200 yeast strain 60 was co-transformed with linear pGBT.superB DNA 61 and bait fragment to obtain recombinant plasmid to express Vpu fused to the GAL4 DNA binding protein (BD). The BK100 yeast strain 60 was transformed with a prey cDNA library (isolated from brain, spleen, and macrophages), which expresses the various cDNA-encoded proteins as hybrids with the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (AD). To perform the yeast two-hybrid screen, the PNY200 yeast strain expressing the GAL4-binding domain fusions was mated with the BK100 yeast strain. After mating, the cells are plated onto selective media, and if the bait and prey proteins interacted, transcription of two auxotrophic reporter genes (HIS3 and ADE2) with dissimilar promoters occurred 62 and colonies were picked from the selection plates, and the prey inserts were identified by sequence analysis. To confirm interactions in this screen, the bait and prey plasmids were isolated from yeast diploids, and co-transformed into a native yeast strain, and a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system 62 was used to monitor the interaction. Cell culture and transfection. 293T Virus release assays. To knock down SGTA expression, we used siRNA from three different sources that were pools of four siRNAs (Sigma), three siRNAs (Ambion) or a single siRNA (Qiagen). One day after plating, HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nM non-target or SGTA siRNA with Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Four hours later, cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or Vpu-defective pNL4-3 molecular clones. The next day, medium was changed and the siRNA transfection was repeated. One-day later, virions were pelleted in an ultracentrifuge and cell and viral pellets were lysed 63 . In overexpression experiments, HeLa and 293T cells were co-transfected with pNL4-3 or pNL4-3delVpu in the absence or presence of tetherin and SGTA expression vectors. One-day posttransfection, virions were collected and cell and viral pellets were lysed as above. Viral proteins in cell and virus lysates were immunoblotted with HIV-Ig 63 and virus release efficiency was calculated as the amount of virion-associated Gag as a fraction of total (cell-plus virion-associated) Gag. Western blotting analysis. For immunoblot analyses, cells were washed with PBS, and then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche life sciences, Basel, Switzerland). Proteins were denatured by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and incubated with appropriate antibodies as described in the text. Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence signal was detected by using West Pico or West Femto Chemiluminescence Reagent (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA). The protein bands were quantified by using Imagelab-Chemidoc (Bio-rad Laboratories, France).
