Inhibiting the influenza virus adsorption: Monolayer MDCK cells were incubated for 1 h with different con-centrations of Jinchai in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37℃. After discarding the supernatant, the cells were washed with Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS). MDCK cells were then infected with FM1 and incubated for 1h at 37℃ with 5% CO2. The supernatant was discarded and the cells washed with PBS. After digestion with digestive enzyme (Gibco), cells were centrifuged and the pellet collected for real-time quantitative PCR. To extract the total cellular mRNA, MDCK cells (a density of 5×10 5 cells/mL) were incubated in one milliliter TRIzol for 20 min at room temperature. The suspension was then centrifuged at 13 400 ×g for 10 min at 4℃. The supernatant was mixed gently with 0.2 mL chloroform for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 2-3 min. After centrifugation again at 13 400 × g for 15 min at 4℃ , the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 mL isopropanol and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The precipitate was collected after a third centrifugation at 13 400 × g for 10 min at 4℃ and washed with one milliliter 75% ethanol, then centrifuged again at 10 400 ×g for 5 min at 4℃. The RNA precipitate was dried for 5-10 min, and then dissolved with 15 μL DEPC water, and immediately stored at -80℃. Before the one-step real-time fluorescent RT-PCR reaction was performed, samples were diluted 20 times with DEPC water. The 20 μL total reaction volume included 2 μL of the RNA sample, 16.4 μL of One Step SYBR GREEN, and 0.8 μL (10 pMol) of each primer. Duplicate PCR reactions were tested using the following amplification protocol: 95℃ for 10 s followed by 40 cycles at 95℃ for 5 s and at 60℃ for 34 s. After the reaction, a melting curve analysis was performed to identify the specificity of PCR products. The cycle threshold (Ct) value of each sample was analyzed by Sequence Detection System software. The A/FM/1/47 sequence was downloaded from the national center for biotechnology (NCBI)-GenBank. Sequence analysis and primer design were performed by using primer premier 5.0 software. The melting temperature value of primers, GC content and the stability of the 3' end were determined according to optimized primer principles. Upstream and downstream primers of influenza HA virus gene sequence were 5′-GACCAATCCTGT-CACCTCTGAC-3′ and 5′-GGGCATTTGGA-CAAACGTCTACG-3′ , respectively. Upstream and downstream primers of the housekeeping gene GAP-DH were 5′-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG -3′ and 5′-CTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTG -3′, respectively. The relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the relative quantitative method (2 -ΔΔCt ). The ΔCt was calculated by subtracting the Ct value of the GAPDH reference from the Ct values of the gene expression of interest (sample): ΔCtsample＝Ctsample-CtGAPDH. The 2 -ΔΔCt value represents the relative fold changes between the calibrator and every treatment group gene expression.Changes in the relative content were equal to: 2 -ΔΔCt ×100%.
