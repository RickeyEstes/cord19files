Mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany) and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions according to the national and institutional guidelines. All experiments were approved by the local government agency (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit; file number 33.12-42502-04-10/0108) and have been performed in accordance to these guidelines. Antibodies, antigens and cell lines. EndoGrade Conjugation of OVA to αDEC-205. Chemical conjugation of purified α DEC-205 to OVA was performed as previously published 64 with minor modifications. In brief, α DEC-205 was first activated by sulfo-SMCC (sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and in parallel the sulfhydryl-groups of the OVA protein were exposed by using 30 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (1.5 hours at room temperature). Excess of TCEP and sulfo-SMCC in the respective samples was removed using Zeba Desalt Spin Columns, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The reduced OVA was immediately mixed with the activated antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resulting α DEC-205/OVA conjugate was concentrated and separated from unbound OVA using 150 K MWCO Pierce ® concentrators (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Quantification of the OVA content within the α DEC-205/OVA conjugate was achieved by comparison of OVA signal intensities on Western blot with graded quantities of OVA on the same blot ( Supplementary Fig. S4) 14 Immunization. Mice were subcutaneously immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 with either 30 μ g α DEC-205/ OVA, 30 μ g α DEC-205, 10 μ g BPPcysOVAMPEG 12 or 7 μ g OVA co-administered either with 50 μ g Poly(I:C) and 50 μ g CpG, as previously published 15, 16, 24, 25 or 5-10 μ g BPPcysMPEG 39 in a total volume of 50 μ l PBS per animal. Determination of serum ALT. For ALT quantification, 75 μ l peripheral blood were mixed with 25 μ l 1% heparin (Ratiopharm, Germany), centrifuged (10,600× g, 10 minutes, room temperature) and 32 μ l of the supernatant were used for detecting ALT activity using the scil Reflovet ® Plus reflection-photometer (scil animal care, Germany). Analysis of liver lymphocytes. Livers were perfused with ice-cold PBS and minced on ice followed by enzymatic digestion in IMDM (Gibco, Germany) containing 0.2 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche, Germany), 10 μ g/ml DNase (Sigma, Germany) and 5% FCS for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After addition of EDTA (5 mM final concentration), cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15 minutes at 300× g) and liver lymphocytes were enriched by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The cells were stimulated with a mixture of OVA protein and the OVA peptides CD4 323-339 and CD8 257-264 (20 μ g/ml final concentration for all) for 24 hours at 37 °C. The cells were then stimulated by incubation with 0.01 μ g/ml PMA (Sigma, Germany) and 1 μ g/ml ionomycin (Sigma, Germany) for a total of 4 hours, 10 μ g/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma, Germany) were added after 2 hours. For flow cytometric analysis, Fc-block was performed through incubation with anti-mouse CD16/CD36 antibody (2.4G2) followed by surface staining for mouse CD8 (53-6.7) and CD44 (IM7) (BD Biosciences, eBioscience). After fixation (2% paraformaldehyde/PBS v/v), cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Igepal ® CA-630/PBS (Sigma, Germany) and stained for intracellular IFNγ (XMG1.2). Data were acquired on an LSR Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences) and further analysed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, USA).
