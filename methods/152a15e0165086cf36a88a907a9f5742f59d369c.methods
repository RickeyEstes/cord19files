The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) is an inpatient and outpatient cancer care center based in Seattle, Washington. In 2012, 5599 patients were treated for cancer at the SCCA over the course of 72,300 visits. Patients at the SCCA are seen by teams of providers in different physical locations at a single site, divided by type of cancer or therapy, designated as Teams A through F. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients were seen by Teams A and B, autologous stem cell transplants were seen by Team C, pediatric patients were seen by Team D, patients in long-term follow-up were seen by Team E, and hematology-oncology patients were seen by Team F providers. The SCCA infection control team tracks incident RSV cases using an electronic system that identifies patients by provider team and location. Electronic medical records were used to abstract sociodemographic and clinical data for patients with RSV detected during the 2 outbreak periods. Lymphopenia was defined as 500 cells/mL and severe lymphopenia as 300 cells/mL. Respiratory specimens were obtained in patients for testing by nasal washes or from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid when clinically indicated by the primary treatment team [19] . Direct fluorescent antibody detection was performed using RSV-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) on all nasal wash samples before January 21, 2008, and reverse transcriptase PCR was performed afterward at the University of Washington Virology Laboratories using previously published methods [19, 20] . All bronchoalveolar lavage samples undergo routine direct testing for RSV using direct fluorescent antibody, shell vial culture, and/or reverse transcriptase PCR testing. During the 2007-2008 outbreak, all employees at the SCCA were administered a daily 12-symptom respiratory screening paper questionnaire for presence of runny nose, sinus congestion/stuffy nose, postnasal drip, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing or chest tightness, sputum production, sore throat, sneezing, watery eyes, ear pain, or fever (temperature >100.4 F) and had a nasal wash collected for respiratory viral testing per institutional policy at the time. Testing for RSV and 11 other respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, rhinovirus, human coronavirus groups 1 and 2, and bocavirus were performed on employee samples using previously published methods [19, 21] . Employees who had a positive nasal wash for any respiratory virus were not permitted to return to work until complete resolution of all symptoms and clearance by Occupational Health. To compare the outbreak with community data, rates of RSV detected in community samples from the Seattle and Pacific Northwest region were obtained from the University of Washington Diagnostic Virology Laboratory database (http://depts.washington.edu/rspvirus/ respiratory.htm). Sequencing was attempted from residual RSV-positive samples from the 2 respiratory seasons using a semi-nested PCR protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the attachment glycoprotein coding region [22] . Random residual de-identified RSV-positive community samples collected from subjects seeking medical care during the same respiratory seasons were also sequenced to serve as control subjects. Sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers KC565494 to KC565526. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic data were analyzed using Stata 12.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX). Nucleotide sequences for 233 and 212 base pair regions of the second hypervariable region of the RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region were aligned using ClustalX2 [23] . Phylogenetic trees were constructed separately for the 2007-2008 and 2012 outbreaks using MEGA5 with evolutionary distances calculated using the maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates [24] . This was performed using the Tamura-Nei model. The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. When the number of common sites was 100 or less than one-fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise, the BioNJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The trees were drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.
