Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, [6] [7] [8] [9] six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement in order to arrive at a consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim of the study. Key themes emerged: first, the extent of the health burden of allergic and hygiene-related diseases; second, the most recent evidence regarding the nature of the link between reduced microbial exposure and its impact on the human microbiome and the immune regulatory system; third, the question of relationship between lifestyles and protection against infectious diseases. The Delphi technique is a qualitative research method that relies on the judgement of individuals presumed to be knowledgeable and expert at what they do. when a sufficient degree of consensus is achieved, the Delphi process is curtailed and the resulting judgement is published. Six experts in infectious diseases and allergies were invited to participate, and the issues to be addressed were agreed via online communication. The authors participated in a conference in which each presented evidence related to their area of expertise. Following this, authors submitted a written contribution. These were analysed and key themes were integrated into a paper which was made available online to all authors for review. This included further questions soliciting the author's views. After further rounds of questions and revision, a consensus position was obtained. results Why hygIene Is IMportAnt In the 21 st century in the 1950s and 1960s, there was optimism that, with vaccination and antibiotics freely available, conquest of most infections would follow. During the last four decades, this opinion has been reversed. infectious disease continues to exert a heavy burden on health and prosperity. The various infectious disease issues are most often considered in isolation, but when viewed together, they represent a powerful argument for renewed emphasis on hygiene, which alongside vaccination strategies remain key to containing infectious disease. 10 During the 1980s, there was a rapid increase in reported cases of food poisoning in the United Kingdom, particularly related to Salmonella and Campylobacter. 11 Although reported cases have somewhat declined, food, waterborne, and non-food-related infectious intestinal diseases (iiDs) remain at unacceptable levels. The latest study of iiD (food and non-foodborne iiD) reported that the true incidence in the community is 43% higher than in the mid-1990s: this study estimated 17 million cases a year in the United Kingdom. 12 The estimated cost of foodrelated iiD is Â£1.5 billion a year, including resource and welfare losses. 12 Norovirus, mainly spread from person-to-person, is the most significant cause of intestinal infections in the developed world, including 3 million cases per year in the United Kingdom. 12 evidence shows that respiratory hygiene involving hands and surfaces can limit spread of respiratory infections, particularly colds, and also influenza. [13] [14] [15] Since respiratory and intestinal viral infections are not treatable by antibiotics, prevention through hygiene is key. in developed countries, about 7% of inpatients acquire an infection in hospital. 16 Governments, looking at prevention as a means to reduce health spending, have introduced shorter hospital stays and increased homecare. This requires new policies to prevent HCAis in community settings 19 where there is no evidence of a decline. Until recently, most episodes of C. difficile infection were believed to result from acquisition in health-care
