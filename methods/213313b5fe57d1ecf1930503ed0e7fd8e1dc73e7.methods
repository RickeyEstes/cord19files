The detection of PEDV-specific IgG and IgA in individual specimens was evaluated using serum and meat samples from PEDV naïve (n = 50) and PEDV inoculated pigs (n = 87) at 14 days post-inoculation. PEDV positive pigs were orally inoculated with 1 × 10 3 TCID 50 cell-culture propagated PEDV (isolate USA/IN/2013/19338E) at 4 or 2 days of age. All piglets were closely observed for clinical signs through day post-inoculation (DPI) 14 or until humane euthanasia was necessary. Productive infection was confirmed by positive PEDV RT-rtPCR results on individual fecal samples collected ≥4 days post inoculation and tested at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory [5] . PEDV negative specimens were collected from 21 piglets from PEDV naïve sows farrowed in a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) research facility and 29 finishing pigs originating from a PEDV-free commercial swine farm. All animals were housed in research facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). All animal procedures were conducted with the approval of the Iowa State University Office for Responsible Research. Serum and meat (longissimus dorsi muscle tissue) samples were collected from all pigs at necropsy. Meat juice samples were harvested from the muscle tissue after one freeze-thaw cycle. Serum and meat juice samples were randomly ordered and tested using PEDV ELISAs (IgG and IgA), as fully described elsewhere [6] . In brief, PEDV ELISA plates were coated with purified PEDV (USA/NC35140/2013) viral particles propagated in Vero cells. To prepare the antigen, propagated PEDV was subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle (− 80°C). The harvested material were centrifuged at 4000 x g for 15 min to remove cell debris. The virus pellet was harvested and washed (2X) with PBS (1X, pH 7.4). The purified virus was resuspended in PBS (1X pH 7.4) at a dilution of 1:100 of the original supernatant volume and stored at − 80°C. The virus was coated onto polystyrene 96-well microtitration plates (Nalge Nunc Corp.). PEDV serum and meat juice ELISA (IgA, IgG) positive and negative controls consisted of samples controls collected from pigs of known PEDV status. Positive and negative controls were included in duplicate in every plate. To perform the test, 100 μl of diluted (1,50) serum was aliquoted into each well and the ELISA plate incubated for 1 h at 25°C. For serum, 1:20,000 peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX) or 1:3000 goat anti-pig IgA (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 25°C for 1 h. The reaction was visualized by adding 100 μl of substrate solution (TMB, Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA) to each well, then incubating the plate at 25°C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid). Reactions were measured as optical density at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Biotek® Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The results were represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios: S=P ratio ¼ sample OD À blank well control mean OD ð Þ positive control mean OD À blank well control mean OD ð Þ Meat juice samples were tested using the protocol described above, except that samples were diluted 1:25 and conjugate concentrations were 1/40,000 and 1/10,000 for IgG and IgA, respectively. Serum and meat juice ELISA S/P data were analyzed using commercial statistical software (SAS® 9.4, SAS® Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to estimate the cutoff thresholds and associated diagnostic sensitivities and specificities for both serum and meat juice IgG and IgA ELISAs. Confidence intervals for diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the exact Binomial formula. The strength of the association between individual pig serum and meat juice IgG and IgA ELISA S/P responses was evaluated by linear regression analysis.
