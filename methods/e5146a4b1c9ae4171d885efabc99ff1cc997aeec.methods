We assembled the PPIs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 ('IFITM interactome') by predicting novel PPIs with HiPPIP 39 and collecting known PPIs from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) 44 and Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) 45 . HiPPIP uses a score cut-off of 0.5 to achieve a high precision of 97.5%, albeit successfully predicting only a few PPIs (recall of 5%), when evaluated on a held-out test data. Thus, the novel PPIs predicted by HiPPIP are highly dependable to lead to successful experiments. Furthermore, predicted PPIs with scores ranging from 0.41 to 0.65 were experimentally validated and found to be true interacting pairs 39 . The HiPPIP model was also computationally evaluated on hub proteins and showed a better performance when compared to Qi et al.'s model 39, 46 . HiPPIP is configured to present protein-pairs achieving a score of greater than 0.5 to be novel PPIs. Additional information regarding experimental validation of predicted interactions and model evaluation are available in prior work 39 . IFITM interactome figure was created using Cytoscape 47 . Pathways associated with proteins in the interactome were collected using Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisÂ® suite (www.ingenuity.com). Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the interactome were computed using the BiNGO plugin of Cytoscape 48 .
