To assist in controlling other newly emerging diseases, we modeled a generic respiratory illness caused by pathogens transmitted by close interpersonal contact. To evaluate actual interventions for SARS, we estimated some biological parameters from the case series in Hong Kong, adjusted others to fit clinically diagnosed probable cases in Singapore, and calculated outbreak sizes under alternative scenarios. Motivated by the social cost of quarantine relative to its contribution to control in Singapore, we also derived analytical expressions policymakers could use with limited information to determine the most effective strategy for controlling future outbreaks of new human diseases.
