The Mass Casualty Disaster Plan Checklist was modified in 2 ways to convert it into a survey instrument. First, some items on the checklist asked for a single answer to questions that contained 2 or more parts. These items were separated, unless the multiple parts were so closely related that a single response was appropriate. Second, some items of specific interest to the KHA task force were added (eg, respondents were asked how much their facility had spent on preparedness since 9/11). The final instrument was 14 pages long, with 252 items. In July 2002, the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to chief executive officers (CEOs) of all 118 short-term and long-term hospitals in Kentucky. The CEOs were asked to oversee completion of the survey. In practice, most CEOs assigned completion of the survey to staff members responsible for emergency planning and/or infection control, and input was typically obtained from several staff members. The survey was also available on the KHA Web site, and a few respondents completed it electronically. In August 2002, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) released a needs survey for hospitals to use as a checklist for assessing their capacity to handle victims of bioterrorist attacks and the adequacy of their emergency plans. 16 Because the AHRQ instrument focused on bioterrorism, the area of greatest concern to state officials, the KHA task force mailed a brief supplemental survey (3 pages, 20 questions) using items selected from the AHRQ instrument in September 2002. Repeated calls were made by KHA staff to hospitals that did not respond to the surveys. Clarification and corrections were also made via telephone. In total, the survey process extended from July 2002 to February 2003.
