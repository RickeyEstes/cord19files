1 Deterministic time delays of the type t Ã€ s; the most common method used to get a simple self-repressor to oscillate, can reproduce most results from other methods. However, for stochastics they require non-Markov simulation. Furthermore, while the equations are straightforward, the authors know of no way to determine a priori the numerical values of time delays that substitute for the delaying steps. The methods outlined in this Letter, in contrast, are purely Markov and involve only the actual chemical rates of the represented processes. Chemical Physics Letters 490 (2010) 216-220
