DCC-based active surveillance. Twelve DCCs licensed to care for infants and toddlers and having at least 10 children 0 to 24 months Of age enrolled at the time of recruitment were randomly selected from licensing lists of all such DCCs located within 5 miles of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston (UTMSH). Enrollment of the DCC required consent of the owner or director and permission of parents of study age children. The protocol was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the UTMSH. On enrollment, children 0 to 24 months of age in each DCC were placed under continuous active surveillance for diarrhea and RV infection. Children were divided by age group and were cared for in different rooms according to the policy of the individual DCC; a total of 26 classroom groups participated in the study. These children and new entry children in each age group were observed for the duration of the study or until they left the study child group or the DCC. To determine annual rates of RV infection and outbreaks, this surveillance was conducted from January 13, 1986, to January 16, 1987. Surveillance was extended through March 31, 1987, to comPare patterns of RV infection in DCCs and in the reference pediatric clinic, and of symptomatic and asymptomatic RV infection, during a second epidemic season. Surveillance included collection of demographic information for each child 0 to 24 months of age by standardized questionnaire at time of entry into the study. Each DCC was visited at least twice weekly by a study nurse, and was contacted daily to identify cases of diarrhea among study children. If a child was absent, information oh whether diarrhea occurred during absence was obtained from the parent or the caregiver. Stool specimens for RV identification were obtained routinely each week from study children, and whenever a study child had diarrhea, if RV was identified in any 9 specime n , stool specimens were collected twice weekly from all children i n the child care room until RV was no longer identified for 2 consecutive weeks in that room. Pediatric clinic reference population. A concurrent study of acute diarrhea in Houston children was conducted from September 1985 through March 1987. RV testing was performed on stool specimens from children 0 to 30 months old identified at a pediatric clinic of a large health maintenance organization. Because participation in this HMO is frequently a fringe benefit of employment, the population consisted largely of young families socioeco-n0mically comparable to ~the DCC study population. Of ill HMO Children tested, 25% attended a DCC, but none attended the DCCs under Study. Specimen collection and identification of R V. Stool specimens were collected bY DCC Workers or study nurses at the time of diaper changing. Specimens were then transported to the laboratory within 3 hours in temperature-stabilized containers. Aliquots of specimens were placed into phosphate-buffered saline suspension for enzyme-linked immunoassay testing and held at 4 ~ C until assayed (withi n 24 hours). Stool specimens were also tested for other enteropathogens as outlined below. Remaining bulk stool was stored at -70 ~ C for additional testing. Rotavirus testing was performed using a monoclonal antibody ELISA assay (Kallestad Laboratorie s, Inc., Austin, Texas). This test has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of better than 95% in Controlled studies. 1~ However, because large numbers of Stools from well children were tested under this study protocol, a substantial number of false POsitive results were expected (giving a low predictive value of a POsitive result). Therefore, each specimen that was positive by initial ELISA was assayed a second time in the same assay. Those specimens that were again positive were then tested in a blocking ELISA using po!yclonal goat anti-SA-11 antibody. In this report, "positive" specimens include only those that were doubly ELISA positive and successfully blocked. This combination of procedures is exPected to yield a false positive rate of <1 per i000 specimens. Confirmation of these EL1SA results was performed !ndependently on Subsets of symptomatic and asymptomatic positive and negativ e specimens in a different ELmA system by Dr. Robert Yolken, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore. This testing yielded a 98.5% concordance with our ELISA results. In addition to RV, all stool specimens were evaluated for form and consistency, fecal leukocytes, and blood~ Stools were cultured on MacConkey, Shigella-Salmonella, Tergitol 7, and Campy-BAP agars for isolation of Shigella, Salmonellal Esherichia coli, Aeromonas, and Campylo: bacter. The first 100 stool specimens from children with diarrhea had E. coti tested for heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxin production by gene probe analysis. Giard~a lamblia antigen was tested for by ELISA, an d attempts to visualize cryptosporidium were made on stool specimens after modified acid-fast staining. H
