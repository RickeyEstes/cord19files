We studied all laboratory-confirmed cases of invasive S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis infection among residents of Montréal, Canada, notified to the Public Health Department of the Montréal Health and Social Services Agency between 1 January 1996 and 7 June 2008 (with the exception of S. pneumoniae, whose notification began on January 5, 1997). The notifications of each infection were aggregated into weekly case counts. Numbers of positive influenza A and B test results for residents of Montréal during the same period were provided by the Québec Public Health Laboratory from a sentinel laboratory surveillance network database and were similarly aggregated into weekly influenza A or B counts. The number of hospital laboratories in the sentinel network varied from six in 1996 to seven in 2008, with a stable core of five laboratories throughout the study period. Testing practices changed after the introduction of commercial rapid tests in 1996 and after improvement in the access to antiviral drugs, contributing to an overall increase in the total number of positive results. A binary indicator variable (short work week) was created to identify weeks that include fewer than five working days, when fewer notifications are to be expected, because non-emergency medical care is less accessible or notification is delayed. About 6 weeks per year include other holidays that were not taken into account because their dates vary from year to year and could not be recovered. Descriptive analyses used frequency distribution histograms, correlation matrices and time series of counts. Modelling of the bacterial infection counts used multivariate negative binomial regression, rather than Poisson regression, because it does not require the variance of observations to be equal to their mean. The parameters b i of the models are most easily understood after transformation into incidence rate ratios (IRR). The IRR for any predictor x i is equal to e bi; it represents the ratio of the expected value of the count when x i is in the model over its expected value when x i is not in the model. If x i is an influenza count, the IRR is the ratio of the risk associated with a count of x i + 1 compared to the risk for a count of x i ; the IRR for a count of x i + n compared to x i is IRR n . Overall trends in the time series of counts were accounted for by including in the model restricted cubic spline terms to remove long-term (secular) trends, and sine-cosine (periodic) terms to remove seasonal trends. 28 The restricted cubic spline function used had six knots 29 and therefore five parameters, 30 referred to as spline1-spline5. The small number of knots was chosen so that the spline terms would reflect only the long-time trends, while the periods for the sine-cosine terms were 1 year, plus the first five harmonics (1 ⁄ 2 year, 1 ⁄ 3, 1 ⁄ 4, 1 ⁄ 5, 1 ⁄ 6) to account for seasonality and any <1 year periodicities. Periodic terms had the forms sin(xt) and cos(xt), where x = 1 to 6 and t = (2p · week number · 12.438) ⁄ 649; the week number ranged from 1 to 649, representing 12.438 years, the length of our time series of counts. Comparisons of the overall closeness-of-fit of nested models (all the terms in the smaller model being included in the larger model) used the deviance ()2 · difference between log-likelihoods), tested by chi-square. The deviance served as an overall test of whether a model including a set of terms (for instance the influenza counts) is statistically superior to the same model without these terms. As any effect of influenza on the risk of subsequent bacterial infections should occur within a few weeks, 11, 14, 15 and relying on preliminary results, we decided to estimate the effects on the bacterial infection counts for any given week (called week 0) of influenza counts for the same week and for the five preceding weeks (called weeks )1 to )5).
