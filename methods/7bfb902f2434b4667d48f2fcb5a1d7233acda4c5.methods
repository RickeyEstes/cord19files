Cells. Vero E6 (a gift from Dr. G. Pijlman, Wageningen University) and Vero WHO (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μ g/ml), 10 mM HEPES, and 200 mM glutamine. PBMCs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Human PBMCs were isolated from Buffy coats using standard density gradient centrifugation procedures with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare), as described previously. The buffy coats were obtained from healthy volunteers with informed consent from Sanquin blood bank, in line with the declaration of Helsinki. The PBMCs were cryopreserved at − 150 °C. Isolation/Depletion of CD14 + monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from thawed PBMCs using the Magnisort human CD14 positive selection kit (eBioscience). Briefly, a single-cell suspension containing 1 × 10 8 PBMCs per mL of cell separation buffer (PBS, 3% FBS, 10mM EDTA) was prepared. Cells were then incubated for 10 min with 20 μ L of anti-human CD14 Biotin per 100 μ L of cell suspension. Cells were washed and resuspended in separation buffer. Then 30 μ L of Magnisort Beads per 100 μ L of cell suspension were added. Following 10 min of incubation a magnet was used to remove the bead-bound CD14 + cells from the remaining PBMCs. The unbound CD14cells were also collected. Isolation efficiency was determined by flow cytometry staining with anti-human CD4-PE and anti-human CD14-APC (both, eBioscience). Virus and virus titrations. CHIKV (La Reunion OPY1) was a gift from A. Merits (University of Tartu, Estonia), and was produced from infectious cDNA clones and passaged twice in Vero E6 cells 51 . Virus preparations were analysed with respect to the infectious titre and the number of genome equivalents copies, as described previously 52 . Briefly, the infectious virus titre was determined by standard plaque assay on Vero-WHO cells at 37 °C and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the number of genome equivalents copies (GEc). Inhibition of JAK1/2 signalling. PBMCs were thawed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and pretreated with Ruxolitinib (5 μ M, Invivogen) for 2 h at 37 °C. Then the cells were infected with CHIKV at the indicated MOI and/or stimulated with IFNβ (500 U/mL, eBioscience). Ruxolitinib was added to maintain the 5 μM concentration during infection. After 2 h incubation at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and fresh medium containing IFNβ (500 U/mL) or Ruxolitinib (5 μ M) was added to the cells. At 24 hpi, cell-free supernatant was collected and cytokine production was analysed by ELISA. Blocking of IFNAR. PBMCs were infected (MOI 1, 5 and 10) in the presence of IFN-α /β receptor chain 2 neutralizing antibody (1, 2 or 5 μ g/mL, Mab 1155, clone MMHAR-2; Millipore) for 2 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed and fresh medium containing the corresponding antibody concentration was added to the cells. At 24 hpi, cell-free supernatant was collected and cytokine production was analysed by ELISA. Co-culture of monocytes with IFNβ pre-stimulated Mo∆PBMCs. Immediately after isolation, 1 × 10 5 Mo∆ PBMCs were incubated for 4 h with IFNβ (500 U/mL). Next, the cells were washed and added to the same amount of unstimulated monocytes. After 24h of co-culture cell-free supernatant was collected and cytokine production was analysed by ELISA as described here below. Time course analysis. After 2 h incubation at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and fresh medium was added to the cells. For all donors tested, cell-free supernatants were collected at each indicated time point, divided into 2 aliquots and stored for subsequent analyses of cytokine and virus production, respectively. Co-culture experiments in transwell system. 2 hours prior to co-culture, cells were infected at the indicated MOI (1, 5 or 10). After removal of the inoculum cells were co-cultured with 1 × 10 5 infected, mock-infected or cells treated with 10 ng/μ L human recombinant IL-6 (Bio-Connect) in a final volume of 200 μ L in 96-transwell plates (0,4 μ m pore size, Corning). Monocytes were always placed at the bottom compartment while Mo∆ PBMCs were placed at the top compartment of the well. Cell-free supernatants were collected 24 hpi and MCP-1 concentration was determined by ELISA as described below. Scientific RepoRts | 6:32288 | DOI: 10.1038/srep32288 Addition of hrMCP-1. PBMCs were infected in the presence hrMCP-1 (50 to 10000 pg/mL; R&D Systems). 2 hpi the viral inoculum was removed and replaced by fresh medium containing hrMCP-1 to maintain the treatment concentration. At 24 hpi, cell-free supernatant was collected and viral production was determined by plaque assay and qPCR. Neutralization. PBMCs were pretreated with different concentrations (1.25, 2.5 and 5 μ g/mL) of anti-MCP-1 antibody (clone 5D3-F7; eBioscience) or an isotype control (mouse IgG1 K; eBioscience). The following day (20 hpi) the cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 1, 5 and 10. 2 hpi the viral inoculum was removed and replaced by fresh medium containing the corresponding antibody. At 24 hpi, cell-free supernatant was collected and viral production was determined by plaque assay and qPCR. Flow cytometry. To measure the number of infected cells, PBMCs were fixed at 24 or 48 hpi, and stained using CHIKV E1-specific rabbit antibody (a kind gift from Dr. G. Pijlman) and secondary chicken anti-rabbit AF647 (Life Technologies). Data acquisition was performed on a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson). Data was analyzed using Kaluza 1.2 (Beckman Coulter). Determination of MCP-1 concentration. MCP-1 and other cytokines (including IFNα , IFNβ , IL-6) levels were measured in cell-free supernatants using hMCP-1 Ready-steady-Go ELISA and ProcartaPlex (both from eBioscences) according to respective manufacturer's instructions. Statistics. All data are expressed as mean with bars representing standard error of the mean (s.e.m) (unless specified). Unless indicated one-tailed unpaired student's t-test was used for analysis in GraphPad Prism 5 application. Values of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 were considered significant.
