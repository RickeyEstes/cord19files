Given the limited research in crisis response within pediatrics, a descriptive qualitative study was conducted in determining issues of salience that emerged during the epidemic of SARS [15] . Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 participants from key stakeholder groups affected by pediatric SARS as follows: pediatric patients between the ages of 5 and 17 years (n = 5), their parents (n = 10), and frontline pediatric health care providers (n = 8). As the pediatric crisis of SARS in Canada was relatively localized, we attempted to include all eligible pediatric SARS patients and their parents, as well as the respective health care provider. All participants were interviewed 2 months after hospitalization to provide time for experiential reflection and patient recovery. Interview questions invited participants to systematically document and identify their experiences; perceived policy and practice implications of SARS; and lessons learned in the event of a future outbreak. Patient participants were recruited from a database of all children in Toronto admitted to hospital for suspected or probable SARS (a classification clinically determined by fever and/or radiographic evidence of chest pathology). While children under 6 years of age were also admitted with probable or suspected SARS, they were not interviewed due to their young age; however, parents of these young patients (n = 5 parents of young children) were included in the sample of interviewed parents. Sampled children and parents represented a range of cultural backgrounds, and all children ultimately recovered from SARS. Health outcomes for parent participants ranged from full recovery to death. Interviewed health care providers comprised physicians and nurses who provided direct care to pediatric SARS patients. In terms of young children interviews were adapted for developmental level, and skilled child life specialists utilized play, hospital/medical photographs and toys for engaging children and eliciting their reflections as guided by methodological guidelines for qualitative interviewing with young children [16] [17] [18] . The semi-structured interviews were conducted in person, were audio-taped and were transcribed verbatim. A semi-structured interview schedule provided a series of open-ended questions to ensure coverage of similar topical content among all interviewees [19] . Qualitative research computer software assisted in data analysis, and inter-rater reliability was achieved through blinded reviews of data, followed by reviewer agreement on emergent findings. Institutional ethical approval was received prior to study commencement. Interviews were subjected to content analysis, concept saturation, and theme generation, using McCracken's [19] well-established 'long interview' method comprising the following sequential analytical processes. 1. Line-by-line coding seeking notable observations in the text that address the research questions. 2. Developing each observation in and of itself from evidence within a single transcript through data categorization. 3. Examining the interconnection of observations in subsequent transcripts through inter-transcript categorization. By this point, themes and an organizational schema were emerging. 4. Emergent themes were scrutinized in collective form for "patterns of intertheme consistency and contradiction" (p. 42). Redundancy was eliminated and themes were organized theoretically. By this time, the focus was no longer on particulars of individual perspectives, but rather on principles inherent in themes.
