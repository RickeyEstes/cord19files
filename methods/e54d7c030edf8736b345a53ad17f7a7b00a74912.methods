The steps of this systematic review followed the guidelines published in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement, which aims to help the authors to carry out complete and clear records of a systematic review and meta-analysis (8) . numerical assignments, level zero being considered low risk and level three the ambient with high-risk health problems related to air quality. The CSD was classified as level one "an area where it was not found the risk of health problems related to air quality, but some authorities, organizations and researchers suggest that the risk should be considered." All the technical documents analyzed (6, (9) (10) (11) (12) In Brazil, the NBR 7256/2005 (9) is followed, referring to CSD in the cleaning area, which resembles the international recommendations, as shown in Figure 2 . Documents ASHRAE* (2011) ( The four scientific articles included (13) (14) (15) (16) are studies in English: three (13) (14) (15) published between the decades of 1960-1980 and only one in the 2000s (16) ; three (13) (14) 16) are laboratory experimental studies and one is transversal (15) (held in hospital bathrooms); three (13-15) studies conducted in the United States and one in Australia (16) . No studies that evaluated the negative air pressure in MD cleaning areas were found on the searches. Therefore, studies that evaluated the formation of aerosols during cleaning products or surfaces were included, even if not specifically made in a CSD environment. In three studies (13) (14) 16) , experiments were performed to analyze the aerosol recovery generated from equipment commonly used in the CSD: ultrasonic cleaner and scrubbers with pressurized water. In the study conducted with the ultrasonic cleaner (14) , air samples above the water surface in the washer tank were collected (the air gatherer had a flexible termination that was placed inside the washing machine), aiming to recover aerosols with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Air specimens were obtained in four moments: before the washer was turned on (during Comparative analyzes using statistical tests were not performed. In another study (16) , in order to evaluate the formation of aerosols during household activities, a car cleaning experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, sealed with plastic. Two ways of using the hose with pressurized water were tested: spraying (used for rinsing) and a water jet with controlled flow (used to remove dirt), conventional (low pressurization -manual trigger) and efficient (high pressurization). The authors used three gauges of particle sizes not aiming to identify microorganisms in aerosols. It was observed that when used in higher pressurization (efficient method), more and smaller particles were identified (up to 2μm). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the methods: efficient and conventional or between the spray modes and jet. The authors reported that they observed the formation of visible fog in the tent where the experiments were carried out, especially after the high pressurization method, and cogitated they were hydrated aerosols, possibly lower than 500ηm. A study (15) was included considering the possibility that the CSD could be equipped with hot tap water. In The summary of the results is shown in Figure 3 . High-pressure hose with manual trigger device (conventional method) and high pressurization (efficient method); two types of water flows (spray and jet). Three particle gauges (500ηm to 5μm). The average of aerosols produced by the high pressurization device were higher in all experiments (high standard deviations) when compared to the conventional, and a greater number of particles smaller than 2μm (more than 96% went until 6μm). High-pressure devices: greater concern with air transmission of microorganisms. Partially Air samples were positive for Legionella pneumophila in six of the 14 areas. There was variation in the water samples (0-> 200 CFU) and air (0,10-0,33UFC / ft3). There was correspondence between subtypes of water and air strains. Shower heads and taps may produce aerosols with a reduced number of L. pneumophila during routine use, that may penetrate the lower respiratory system. Inconclusive. Increase of 255 times of aerosols compared to the initial contamination, with the lid of the washer on, and 28 times without the lid (respectively, p = 0.006 and p = 0.0006). Higher contamination during operation. Air contamination from the washer may be minimized by daily cleaning of the cleaning solution storage using germicide in it. Use lid washer. Partially conclusive. Braymen, 1969 (13) / Experimental laboratorial Intentional contamination of the wall; automatic washer with pressurized jet, with water and disinfectant solutions. Air samples to determine the particle size (during and after the procedure). After spraying, about 50% of the particles were up to 5μm (aerosols). After brushing, approximately 72.4% were greater than 5μm (droplets). All disinfecting solutions reduced the number of viable microorganisms in aerosols. Microorganisms are aerosolized in a number enough to contaminate susceptible individuals or products. Healthcare professionals that clean must use respiratory personal protection equipment. Partially conclusive. cleaning area, the construction of an anteroom should be considered (6, 11) . The influence of the movement of doors and people traffic in the negative pressure air efficiency in isolation rooms was demonstrated in the study by Adams, Johnson and Lynch (17) . The air pressure differentials were measured between the room and the anteroom and between the room and the hallway. The average in the aerosol count per m3 where larger when there were greater movement of people and doors, however the aerosol score decreased as the air pressure differential increased. The authors indicate a negative air pressure differential of 20 Pa when there is heavy traffic between areas. In this context, there is a need for routine monitoring of the pressure differential between the areas, for example, by testing with the observation of the direction of smoke flow or specific gauges (18) . Other parameters shown in Figure 2 and creating air flow patterns (19) . The need for negative air pressure in isolation rooms is strongly evidenced in the literature, aiming to reduce the risk of exposure microorganisms transmitted by aerosol infected people to uninfected people (especially other patients or professionals). The advent of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu and drug resistant tuberculosis raises concern for health authorities in relation to the isolation of patients (11, 18) .
