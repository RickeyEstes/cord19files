We performed simulations of a dental hygiene procedure involving an artificial bicarbonate aerosol in a vacant dentist's surgery room ( Figure  1 ). Aerosols were formed using the Mini-Clean device (Castellini SpA, Bologna, Italy) with air pressure set to 6 to 7 atmospheres and water flow to 1 atm. We placed the aerosol distributor at a distance of 1 centimeter from a smooth porcelain surface that simulated the patient's mouth. We used a mannequin head to simulate the dentist's face and placed it at a distance of 40 cm from the porcelain surface. The mannequin's oral cavity was covered with latex and had one entry (mouth) and one exit (throat), connected to a 250-milliliter collection flask containing 50 mL of distilled water by a polytetrafluoroethylene tube 30 cm long and 1 cm in diameter that terminated well below the surface of the water. A vacuum pump (Cattani SpA, Parma, Italy) attached to the flask provided two possible airflow rates through the tube of 0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m 3 /hour to simulate human breathing at rest and during exercise, respectively. We adjusted the airflow rates using the lock nut attached to the pump and calibrated by a flow meter. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that the bicarbonate dust (Airflow Prophylaxis Powder, Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) was composed of particles of monosodium hydrogen carbonate (5-300 µm in diameter), silica particles (< 1 µm in diameter) and other (probably organic) particles of variable dimensions (10-20 µm in diameter). We tion, we activated the particulate for only the first 10 minutes of the run. We carefully fitted a new mask for each separate run in the position in which it is commonly worn. At the end of each run, we extracted 25 mL of solution from the collection flask and placed it in a beaker that had been cleaned with distilled water, dried and placed in a stove at 100 C for two days, and had then been weighed with a precision (10-microgram) balance (AT 261 ∆ Range AD, Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) and kept in a dryer until use. After addition of the solution, we placed each beaker in a stove at a temperature of approximately 60 C until complete evaporation was achieved, and then kept it at 100 C for another day before weighing it. We calculated the amount of residual dry sediment as the difference between the baseline weight and the final weight of each beaker.
