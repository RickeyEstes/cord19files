Reagents. LPS from Escherichia coli, (O127:B8) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Rabbit anti-ACE, anti-ACE2, and anti-p65, and mouse antiphospho-p65 and anti-IkBa antibodies were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA, USA). Rabbit anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG, and horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). TNF-a and IL-1b kits were purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR, USA). AngII and Ang-(1-7) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits came from Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA, USA). Mas receptor blocker A779 was obtained from AbBiotech (San Diego, CA, USA). SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK), PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of ERK1/2) and SP600125 (a specific inhibitor of JNK) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Delaware, CA, USA). Animals. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g were obtained from the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. All animals were handled in accordance with the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Research at the College of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China. Cell culture. Isolation and culture of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were performed as described previously 3 . Briefly, the rats were euthanized after intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. Thoracotomy was performed and the lung circulatory system was perfused by injection of 50 mL ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) via the right ventricle. The lungs were removed and washed with 30 mL ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The pleura were carefully cut away and discarded, and then sections (1 mm) were cut from the outer edge of the remaining lung tissue and trimmed into small pieces. These lung tissue pieces were then inserted into the glass pellets (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and rinsed in endothelial cell medium (ScienCell Research, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 g/mL amphotericin B. The glass pellets were incubated in humidified air with 5% CO 2 for 60 h, and the culture media were replaced every 3 days. The cells at 80-90% confluence were harvested by treating with 0.25% trypsinethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and subcultured at 152 ratios. Cobblestone morphology and immunostaining with rabbit anti-human factor VIII, anti-rat CD31 (Boster, Wuhan, China), and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectin (BSI; Santa Cruz, Delaware, CA, USA) were used to identify the endothelial cells. The third to fifth cell passages were used for the following experiments. Generation of recombinant Ace2 and small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-Ace2 lentiviruses. Total RNA was extracted from rat PMVECs and reversely transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Takara BIO, Japan). The cDNA was used to amplify the Ace2 coding sequence with the following primers: forward, 59-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGTCAAGCTCCTGCTGGC-39 and reverse, 59-CGGGATCCTTAGAATGAAGTTTGAGC. Three shRNA sequences targeting the rat Ace2 coding region (homologous to nt 1089-1107, 1152-1170, and 1582-1600 of Ace2 mRNA, respectively) were designed: small interfering RNA (siRNA)1-Ace2 (59-GGTCACAATGGACAACTTC-39); siRNA2-Ace2 (59-GCATATGCCAAGCAACCTT-39); and siRNA3-ACE2 (59-GCTCTTTGTCAAGCAGCTA-39). An invalid RNA interference (RNAi) sequence (59-GAAGCCAGATCCAGCTTCC-39) was used as the negative control. The corresponding oligonucleotide templates of the shRNAs were chemically synthesized. The Ace2 PCR products were purified and ligated to a lentiviral pcDNA-CMV-copGFP cDNA vector and the synthesized shRNA-Ace2 to pSIH1-H1-copGFP shRNA (System Biosciences, CA, USA). Each ligation mixture was transformed into competent E. coli strain DH5a, and the resultant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the vectors carrying Ace2 or Ace2 shRNA and lentivirus package plasmids were co-transfected into 293 T producer cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The supernatants were collected 48 h later. Total RNA and protein were extracted to determine ACE2 mRNA and protein and to select a recombinant shRNA lentivirus with the most sufficient siRNA. Viral titer was evaluated by gradient dilution. The recombinant lentiviruses were named LV-Ace2 and LV-shRNA-Ace2. Lentiviral transduction. One day after seeding, PMVECs cells were infected with LV-Ace2 or LV-shRNA-Ace2 and diluted at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 in endothelial cell medium, which was refreshed 24 h later. The infection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 96 h after infection. One hundred microliters of PMVECs, normal or lentivirus-infected (LV-Ace2 or LV-shRNA-Ace2), were seeded into 96-well plates (1 3 10 4 cells/well) and incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h. PMVECs, whether normal or infected, were then pretreated (or not) with 100 nM A779 for 2 h and then stimulated (or not) with 1 mg/mL LPS for 48 h as follows: (1) normal cells in PBS and untreated (control); (2) normal cells, treated with A779, without LPS (A779); (3) normal cells, treated with LPS only (LPS); (4) normal cells, treated with A779 and also LPS (A779 1 LPS); (5) cells infected with the empty control virus, receiving LPS only (Lv-control 1 LPS); (6) cells infected with RNAi (negative control or NC) receiving LPS only (Lv-NC 1 LPS); (7) cells infected with shRNA-Ace2, receiving LPS only (shACE2 1 LPS); (8) cells infected with LV-Ace2, receiving LPS only (ACE2 1 LPS); and (9) cells infected with LV-Ace2, receiving A779 prior to LPS (ACE2 1 A779 1 LPS). For further experiments using the specific MAPK inhibitors, normal cells and cells infected with shRNA-Ace2 or LV-Ace2 were pre-incubated with either 10 mM SB203580, 20 mM PD98059, or 20 mM SP600125, for 2 hours before exposure to LPS. Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was determined using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the cells were harvested, washed 3 times with PBS, centrifuged at 2000 3 g for 5 min, and resuspended in 500 mL of binding buffer (0.1 M Hepes/ NaOH, 1.4 M NaCl, 25 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 1 3 10 6 cells/ mL. After incubation with 5 mL of annexin V-FITC for 10 min and 5 mL of propidium iodide for 5 min at room temperature, the cell suspension was subjected to flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and detected at excitation wavelength 488 nm. Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Detection of cytokine secretions. The culture supernatants of each group were collected and frozen at 220uC, and IL-1b, TNF-a, AngII and Ang-(1-7) concentrations in the supernatants were assayed by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with the monoclonal antibody specific to IL-1b, TNF-a, AngII, or Ang-(1-7) supplied in the ELISA kit. ELISAs were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve obtained from the same plate. Western blot analysis. Total protein was extracted from the cells using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, IL, USA). The protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, USA), and equal amounts of protein (25 mg) were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Trisbuffered saline (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4)/0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were probed with a primary antibody against rat ACE (15400), ACE2 (15500), ERK1/2 (15400), SAPK/JNK (15500), p38 MAPK (15600), IkBa (15500), phosphorylated P65 (15300), P65 (15500) and b actin (151000). After 3 washes with TBST, the blots were incubated in secondary HRP-conjugated antimouse/rabbit IgG. After washing with TBST 3 times, the membranes were developed with a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit and imaged with X-ray films. Beta actin was used as an endogenous reference for normalization. Statistical analyses. All data are presented as mean 6 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed with the Prism software package (GraphPad v5, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and then the Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. A P-value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
