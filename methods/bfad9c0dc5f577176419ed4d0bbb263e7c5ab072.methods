A collection of 588 putative membrane-fusion proteins for enveloped viruses was gathered using the Entrez protein browser (Benson et al., 1998) . For each virus family (Murphy et al., 1995) , the following protein sequences were gathered (Fields et al., 1996) : arenavirus, GP-C glycoprotein; baculovirus, glycoproteins gp64 and gp67; bunyavirus, G2 glycoprotein; coronavirus, S spike protein; ®lovirus, GP peplomar glycoprotein;¯avivirus, E protein; herpesvirus, gH glycoprotein; orthomyxovirus, hemagglutinin; paramyxovirus, F protein; retrovirus, envelope protein; rhabdovirus, G protein; and togavirus, E1 glycoprotein. Obvious closely related sequences were eliminated by scoring each sequence with the PairCoil program and allowing only one representative sequence into the iteration test set from those that have the same sequence score. This left a total of 266 sequences in the iteration test set. The primary method used for coiled-coil detection is the LearnCoil program. The LearnCoil program is a general iterative method that extends the two-stranded coiled-coil prediction program PairCoil to improve identi®cation of other types of coiled coils (Berger & Singh, 1997) . Previously, the LearnCoil program has been used to identify coiled-coil-like regions in histidine kinase proteins (Singh et al., 1998) . Iterative approaches similar to LearnCoil have been applied to sequence alignment and motif recognition (Tatusov et al., 1994; Lawrence et al., 1993; Attwood & Findlay, 1993; Gribskov, 1992; Dodd & Egan, 1990) . Most recently, the position-speci®c iterated BLAST (PSI-Blast) procedure has been developed to detect weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities during database searches (Altschul et al., 1997) . The basic method and its application to viral membrane-fusion proteins are ®rst brie¯y outlined, and then described below in more detail. Further description of the method and its cross-validation testing can be found elsewhere (Berger & Singh, 1997) . The LearnCoil program iteratively scans the 266 test sequences of putative viral membrane-fusion proteins. In each iteration, the algorithm scores all the test sequences (if the sequence was identi®ed in the previous iteration, its effects are removed before scoring) and converts each score into a likelihood as in the pairwise correlation method PairCoil . Using these likelihoods, a subset of the sequences are chosen to build a database of potential coiled-coil-like regions. At the end of the iteration, these selected sequences are used to update the parameters to the scoring procedure. This iterative procedure repeats until the number of residues in each subsequent database changes by less than 3 %. In the ®nal iteration, regions that have likelihood of at least 0.5 are selected for the ®nal database. Since the procedure is randomized, the algorithm was run ®ve times on the iteration test sequences. This gave ®ve learned probability tables, which were averaged and then used along with the Pair-Coil scoring method to build the LearnCoil-VMF program. LearnCoil-VMF was thus designed as a specialized program for identifying coiled-coil-like regions in viral membrane-fusion proteins. As in each iteration of the LearnCoil algorithm, for each viral membrane-fusion protein, its reported LearnCoil-VMF likelihood is computed after removing the effects of the sequence from the averaged probability table.
