We retrospectively reviewed patients who visited the ED of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between November 2003 and July 2004 because of fever or high body temperature (tympanic temperature > 38.3°C). Because the period of study was within 1 year of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, all febrile patients received blood examinations including WBC count and CRP level. Adult patients (> 18 years) who had normal WBC counts (4,000-10,000/μL) and high CRP levels (> 100 mg/L) were included for further analysis. Patient characteristics including gender and age were recorded. Underlying diseases including diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, liver cirrhosis and malignant neoplasm were recorded by history taking and examination in hospital. The diagnosis and final condition on discharge from hospital were determined according to the chart records filled in by the doctor in charge of the ward or ED. Student's t test was used to compare age and days of hospitalization between patients with and those without underlying malignant neoplasm and/or hematologic disease. χ 2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine the correlation between gender, cause of fever, hospitalization, type of infection and mortality with underlying malignant neoplasm and/or hematologic disease.
