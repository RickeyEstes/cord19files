Peptides were synthetized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). Cas9 tracrRNA was purchased from IDT (catalog # 1072532) and specific crRNAs were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA) or Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO). Lyophilized peptides were resuspended to 250 µM in PBS and kept frozen. GFP-NLS protein was formulated at 5 mg/ml in PBS and kept frozen. Cas proteins and luciferase were kept frozen in manufacturer buffers. gRNAs were stocked frozen at 100 µM and then diluted at 10 µM for use. Prior to the experiment, Shuttle peptides, GFP-NLS, luciferase, gRNA, and Cas proteins were thawed and kept on ice. Cell culture. Primary airway epithelia isolated from human or porcine donor trachea or bronchi were grown at the air-liquid interface on collagen-coated Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters (#CLS3413, 0.3 µm 2 surface area) 73 . Cultures were maintained in media supplemented with Ultro-ser G (USG) and the following antibiotics: penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The cultured cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . All epithelial cells were well differentiated (>4 weeks old; resistance >1000 Ω × cm 2 ). NK cells were kindly provided by Green Shuttle peptide-protein formulation. Shuttle peptides were diluted to obtain the desired final concentration and a volume of PBS was added to achieve the remaining volume minus the volume of the cargo. A volume of protein cargo (GFP-NLS or luciferase) was added to reach the desired concentration. The solution was mixed and added to cells or delivered intranasally to mice. Shuttle peptide-Cas RNP formulation. The RNP was prepared by combining the respective recombinant nuclease protein and the gRNA in PBS and incubating at room temperature for 15-20 min. For SpCas9 delivery, the two-part CRISPR RNA (crRNA and tracrRNA) was first combined in PBS by denaturation at 95°C for 10 min and renaturation at room temperature to form the RNA duplex (10 μM concentration). Cas RNP complexes were formulated at 2× concentration to a final volume of 50 µl. Shuttle peptides solution (250 µM) was formulated in PBS at 2× concentration in a volume of 50 µl and then mixed with 50 µl Cas RNP mixture. The solution was mixed and added to cells or delivered intranasally to mice. Cas12a RNP delivery to primary NK cells. NK cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 400 × g, washed with warmed PBS, and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 cells/ml. Five hundred thousand NK cells were distributed in 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 400 × g. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended with 50 µl mixture containing the peptide (7.5 µM) and the Cas RNP (Cas12a at 1.33 µM and crRNA at 2.0 µM) for 90 s. Cells were washed and transferred in a 24-well plate with 500 µl of NK MACS media supplemented with 1% human serum and incubated for 48 h. GFP-NLS delivery to tracheal tissue explant organ cultures. Tracheal tissues deemed unsuitable for lung transplantation were used. The excised tissues were bisected longitudinally to expose the luminal surface and then cut into 5 × 5 mm 2 pieces. Tissue pieces were then placed, lumen side up, onto Costar 48-well, polystyrene culture plates. The explants were immersed in 250-350 µl of airway cell culture media with USG and antibiotics: penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 µg/µl). To transduce the tissues, a volume of 150 µl shuttle peptide (20 µM) formulated with nuclear-targeted GFP protein (20 µM) was applied to the apical surface of an explant for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . The formulation was then removed by rinsing three times with PBS. The explant was incubated overnight. At~24 h post delivery, explants were fixed in paraformaldehyde, sucrose protected, and embedded in OCT. Cas RNP delivery to airway epithelia. The final concentration of nuclease and RNA in the RNP preparation was 2.5 and 2 μM (SpCas9) and 1.33 μM and 2 μM (AsCas12a), respectively. The RNP was combined with the desired concentration of shuttle peptide and incubated for ≤5 min before the addition to cells. A volume of 50 µl of the mixture was left on cell surface for times indicated in text and figure legends. The gRNAs used are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 . GFP-NLS delivery to human and porcine airway epithelia. The apical surface of well-differentiated airway epithelia grown at air-liquid interface was washed twice with PBS. A volume of 50 µl shuttle peptide (20 µM) formulated with nucleartargeted GFP protein (20 µM) was then applied to the apical surface and incubated for the indicated time. After incubation, the materials were removed and the apical surface was washed thrice with PBS. Live cell imaging and image analysis. Live cell GFP fluorescence was visualized on an inverted tissue microscope Olympus IX70 (Olympus Scientific Solutions Americas Corp, Waltham, MA) and the mean fluorescence intensity was obtained using a SpectraMax i3x fluorescence reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). In vivo bioluminescent imaging. Luciferase expression was monitored noninvasively using bioluminescence imaging 74 . One hour following delivery of a solution containing luciferase protein combined with the CM18-PTD4 peptide in a 50 µl volume intranasally, mice received 100 μl/10 g of body weight (15 mg/ml in PBS, delivered intraperitoneally) of D-luciferin (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) and were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. Approximately 5 min after luciferin injection, Fig. 5 Pulmonary toxicity profile following in vivo delivery using S10 peptide. C57BL/6 mice received PBS alone, S10 alone, or [S10]: 40 µM and Cas9 RNP (2.5 µM Cas9/2.0 µM gRNA) by intranasal instillation. a In vivo delivery of PBS, S10 alone (40 µM), or S10 ( the animals were imaged using a Xenogen IVIS200 CCD camera. Imaging data were analyzed and signal intensity was quantified using the Xenogen Living Image software. Expression levels were normalized by subtracting those from naive (untreated) mice. Surveyor nuclease assay. Three days post transduction, genomic DNA was isolated using QuickExtract (catalog #QE09050, Epicenter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification of the genomic DNA was performed using 700 ng genomic DNA and specifically designed forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 3 ) and KAPA DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems). The PCR product was purified and 315 ng of the purified DNA was denatured and reannealed in the presence of NEB restriction enzyme buffer 2 in a thermocycler. The reannealed DNA was mixed with enhancer and Surveyor nuclease (IDT) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated at 42°C for 50 min before separation on 4-20% Tris/Borate/EDTA gels. The DNA bands were visualized using SYBR gold stain (Thermo Scientific). T7E1 assay. The T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) was also used to detect on-target CRISPR-Cas genome-editing events in cultured cells. Briefly, genomic DNA from target cells was amplified by PCR. The PCR products were then denatured and reannealed to allow heteroduplex formation between wild-type DNA and CRISPR-Cas-mutated DNA. T7E1, which recognizes and cleaves mismatched DNA, was used to digest the heteroduplexes. The resulting cleaved and full-length PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis. The T7E1 assay was performed using T7E1 (NEB, catalog #M0302S). After the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas complex, cells were lysed in 100 μl of Phusion™ High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, catalog #M0530S) laboratory with additives. The cells were incubated for 15-30 min at 56°C, followed by deactivation for 5 min at 96°C. The plate was briefly centrifuged to collect the liquid at bottom of the wells. Fifty microliters of PCR samples was analyzed for each condition. The PCR samples were heated to 95°C for 10 min and then slowly (>15 min) cooled to room temperature. The PCR product (5 μl) was then separated on a 2% agarose gel to confirm amplification. Fifteen microliters of each reaction was incubated with T7E1 nuclease for 25 min at 37°C. Immediately, the entire reaction volume was run with the appropriate gel loading buffer on a 2% agarose gel. DNA signal intensities quantification. Bio-Rad ImageLabTM software (Version 5.2.1) was used to quantify the relative signal intensities of each of the bands directly on gels. Quantification of indels was performed using the equation 100 ×  where a is the intensity of undigested PCR product and b and c are the intensities of the cleaved products 75 . The sum of the three bands of interest (one gene target and two cleavage products) in a given lane corresponds to 100% of the signal. No cleavage product bands were found in the negative controls. Cloning and sequencing to determine editing efficiency. The PCR products amplified for Surveyor assay were also cloned into the pSMART cloning vector (Lucigen). Purified DNA was phosphorylated with T4 PNK at 37°C for 30 min before ligation. DNA ligation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ligation mixture was transformed into DH5α cells, and then plated on LB ampicillin plates. At least 50-100 colonies were grown for plasmid preps and for Sanger sequencing (Functional Biosciences, Madison, WI). Immunohistochemistry. Epithelial cells, tracheal explants, and lung tissues were prepared for histological examination and for immunohistochemistry for cellular markers after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, sucrose protection, and cryoembedding in OCT. In some cases, cells and tissues were embedded in paraffin. For routine histology, tissue sections (~8 µm each) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A detailed description of methods for localizing protein expression in the large and small airways is provided below. To co-localize GFP-NLS protein or membrane-associated GFP expression (ROSA mT/mG mice) with markers of specific cell types, sections were first incubated with primary antibodies to acetylated α-tubulin (1:200 dilution, catalog #D2063, Cell Signaling), Muc5AC (1:200 dilution, catalog #MA5-12178, Invitrogen), or SP-C (1:25 dilution, catalog #PA5-71680, Thermo Fisher), followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin (1:50 dilution, catalog #A22287, Invitrogen), and mounted with Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Labs). Sections were imaged by confocal microscopy using a Leica CTR6500 multiphoton confocal microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Three to five mice (male and female) were analyzed per time point and per experimental condition. Flow cytometry analysis. Cells were lifted from the Transwell support by applying Accumax (catalog #AM105, Innovative Cell Technologies) to the cell surface for 1 h. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS (3% fetal calf serum), and strained through a 70 μm nylon mesh filter. GFP + cells were enumerated using a Becton Dickinson FACScan, FACS caliber, LSRII (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD). Mice and in vivo delivery. Shuttle peptide and protein cargo were formulated and delivered to 8-10-week-old, male and female BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice by intranasal delivery. To transduce the epithelia airway, a volume of 50 µl shuttle peptide (40 µM) formulated with nuclear-targeted GFP protein (20 µM) was used. For genome editing, a volume of 50 µl shuttle peptide (40 µM) formulated with nuclease and RNA in the RNP preparation of 2.5 and 2 μM (SpCas9) or 1.33 μM and 2 μM (AsCas12a) were used. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine intramuscularly (87.5 mg/kg ketamine/12.5 mg/kg xylazine) and the indicated amphiphilic peptide and protein cargoes introduced intranasally. In some studies, ROSA mT/mG mice (Jackson Labs, Stock #007576) were used 42 . Determination of GFP + epithelial cells in vitro. Epithelial cell sheets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed in PBS. The Costar filter inserts were cut from the plastic support, placed onto a microscope slide, and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Media with DAPI. Using a Leica CTR6500 confocal microscope, images of six random fields from each filter were captured at ×20 magnification. Manual counts were performed by enumerating the blue nuclei and GFP + cells. All epithelial cells within these six fields were counted. For determining the percentage of positive cells, the numerator was the number of GFP + cells and the denominator was the total number of cells in the six ×20 magnification fields we counted for each epithelial sheet. Determination of positive epithelial cells in mouse airways. Lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde by perfusion and cryopreserved. The tissue was placed in a cryomold en bloc, ventral side down to ensure a uniform and consistent sectioning of all lobes. Tissues were sectioned at 8 µm thickness. We collected sections for study at a depth of sectioning when all lung lobes were visible in the block. These sections provided areas that contained small airways. Next, sections were collected~150 µm deeper into the block. This region consistently contained large airways with monopodial branching. Consecutive sections were collected for cell counting and co-localization using immunocytochemistry. The following criteria were used to quantify GFP + airway cells: because mouse lungs exhibit monopodial airway branching and these airways lack cartilage or glands, they are anatomically defined as bronchioles. Accordingly, we anatomically segregated bronchiolar airways into two groups based on morphologically distinct sites/sizes. The right or left main bronchus was categorized as large airways. Small bronchiole airways were defined as being a terminal airway of similar size. We measured lumen area using ImageJ by tracing along lumen circumference and measuring lumen length and width. All small airways in this study had lumen areas <50,000 µm 2 with length-to-width ratios <1.7. All epithelia of the small airways in one lobe were counted in each area. We counted the total number of cells in the epithelial layer of each airway using the DAPI nuclear stain. We then counted the total number of GFP + cells in the same airways. The total number of epithelial cells and GFP + cells in the large airways were counted using the same methods as for small airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage. At 1 or 7 days post instillation of PBS, S10 peptide alone, or S10 and Cas9 RNPs, mice were euthanized by inhalation of CO 2 , followed by cervical dislocation. The chest was opened and lungs lavaged in situ via PE-90 tubing inserted into the exposed trachea. A pressure of 25 cm H 2 O was used to lavage the lungs with a total of 4 ml sterile saline. Collected washes were immediately pooled and placed on ice. BAL cell counts were performed using a hemocytometer. Differential cell counts were performed on cytospins following cell staining with a Diff-Quik Stain Set (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Newark, DE). Histopathology. For quantification of cellular infiltrates into lung tissue, a pathologist performing quantification was masked to the group assignment 76 . High-resolution digital images (×100 or ×200 fields) of lung tissues were collected and the number of respective immune cells were enumerated per image field and standardized per image area (mm 2 ). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), and the Mann-Whitney test with statistical significance placed at P < 0.05. Tissues were evaluated by an ACVP boarded pathologist and scored using a post examination masking method 76 . Four mice (male and female) were analyzed per time point and per experimental condition. Extraction of total RNA and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Lung tissue was homogenized in Trizol and total RNA isolated using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). A DNase treatment step was included. Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was used as a template for first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. The resulting cDNA was diluted 4× and subjected to amplification of selected cytokine and chemokine genes by real-time quantitative PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 4 . Average values from duplicates of each gene were used to calculate the relative abundance of transcripts normalized to β2-microglobulin and presented as 2 −ΔCT × 10 relative to normalizer level. The primers used were previously reported 77 . LDH assay. Primary airway epithelial cell cultures from three non-CF human donors were transduced with the S10 peptide alone or co-incubated with GFP-NLS protein in a 50 µl volume for 15 min. The apical surface was washed, and the basolateral media collected at indicated time points post transfection. LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Cayman chemical) was used to measure the LDH levels in the apical surface washes and basolateral media. Percentage toxicity and viability were computed based on LDH levels. Data were normalized to cells treated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) alone (negative control) or cells treated with DMEM containing 1% Triton X-100 (positive control) on the apical and basolateral surface for 30 min to 10 days at 37°C. Statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparison test or two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test were used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. Results are expressed as mean ± SE. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Statement on ethics. Primary airway epithelia and in vivo studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Iowa's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. NK cell study was approved the National Research Council Research Ethics Board of Canada.
