In early 2007, the chief executive officers of all acute care hospitals with inpatient beds in Ontario were contacted by e-mail and standard mail. The cover letter was signed by representatives of the 3 parties involved in the study: Queen's University, The Change Foundation, and the Ontario Hospital Association. The project had an advisory committee, which comprised infection control, emergency management, and public health experts. The survey was to be directed to and completed by the person most responsible for developing their hospital's pandemic influenza plan. The needs assessment survey was based on the core components of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan 2 and the Ontario Health Plan for Pandemic Influenza. 3 The domains evaluated included the following: pandemic influenza plan development, command and control roles and responsibilities, human resources, equipment and supplies, infection control and occupational health, triage and clinical care, security, transportation, mortuary issues, business continuity, training and educational strategies, communications, cooperation with local and regional agencies, and opinion regarding pandemic preparedness learning portal development. An analysis of the content of the pandemic influenza plans of Ontario acute care hospitals is presented in a separate paper (Zoutman DE, Ford BD, Melinyshyn M, Schwartz B. Content of pandemic influenza plans in Ontario acute care hospitals. Submitted for publication, 2009.). Respondents had the option of completing the survey on-line or by downloading a paper copy and returning it by mail. The Ontario Hospital Association circulated reminder notices to all hospitals on behalf of the investigators. Data were analyzed with StatView version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were primarily used to present the data. Hospitals with missing values for a survey item were not included in analyses involving the item. Chi-square analysis was used to test for differences between respondent and nonrespondent hospitals. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to test the association of the number of acute care beds and rural location with whether hospitals had and had tested pandemic influenza plans; adequacy of funding for pandemic planning and satisfaction with the completeness of pandemic plans; and the association of adequacy of funding for pandemic planning and satisfaction with completeness of pandemic plans.
