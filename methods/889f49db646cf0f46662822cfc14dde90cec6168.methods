The daily clinical and laboratory findings of 304 SARS patients at the Ditan Hospital in Beijing were entered on a pre-designed database. The clinical case definition of probable SARS included a fever of 38 8C or higher, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, and close contact with a person who is a suspected or probable case of SARS. Day 1 of illness was defined as the day of onset of fever. Blood was collected for SARS-CoV specific antibody testing from all patients during hospitalization. SARS-CoV specific IgM and IgG were detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA, Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Ger-many), SARS-CoV RNA was detected in throat washes, stools and blood using a SARS-CoV RNA fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR assay (ShenZhen PJ Company, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China). Immunological tests included T, NK and B lymphocyte cell counts by flow cytometry (MultiT-EST CD45Percp/CD3FITC/CD4APC/CD8PE TruCount Four-Color kit, MultiTEST CD45Percp/CD3FITC/ CD16+56PE/CD19APC TruCount Four-Color kit, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Lymphocyte counts were performed as controls on 51 non-SARSaffected and otherwise healthy individuals. All analyses were performed at a single laboratory. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ditan Hospital, Beijing, China. Patients satisfying the case definition of probable SARS were retrospectively classified after discharge into non-severe (122) and severe (149) cases. The non-severe and severe groups were defined according to 'The standard of clinical diagnosis for atypical pneumonia' guidelines listed by the Chinese Public Health Ministry on 4 May 2003. The patients in the non-severe group had a fever of 38 8C or higher, a cough or shortness of breath, and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. The patients in the severe group had in addition at least one of the following features: dyspnea (respiratory rate >30/ minute), hypoxemia (PaO 2 <70 mmHg or SpO 2 <93% whilst on oxygen at a rate of 3-5 L/minute), acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, a chest radiograph showing multifocal involvement over one third of the lung fields (or that developed to 50% in 48 hours), and shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). They also had other underlying diseases, developed a secondary infection or were over 50 years old. Patients satisfying the case definition of probable SARS were retrospectively classified after discharge into those who recovered (246 cases) and those who died from SARS (25).
