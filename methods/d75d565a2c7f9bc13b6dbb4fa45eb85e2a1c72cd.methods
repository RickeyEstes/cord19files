We used mathematical modelling to explore hypothetical scenarios that might result if an active EVD case were to be imported to the Asia-Pacific. The two key questions motivating the construction of our model were: 1. If an active EVD case travelled from an infected country to the Asia-Pacific region, what is the risk of an outbreak subsequently occurring? 2. What are the key health care system constraints that limit the ability of a local health care system to detect and respond to an EVD outbreak in a timely fashion and what type of international intervention would most effectively address these constraints? To construct a model capable of addressing these questions, the following data requirements were identified: 1. characteristics of EVD relevant to infection transmission (disease characteristics); 2. demographic, sociological and behavioural characteristics of the target populations relevant to the transmission of EVD, and their variation across the region (population characteristics); 3. the current capacity of local health care systems to detect and respond to importation and transmission of EVD, and their variation across the region (health care system characteristics); and 4. plausible interventions to support local health care systems to detect and respond to importation and transmission of EVD (interventions). These data requirements are addressed in the following subsections. We then describe appropriate outcome measures given the data-poor situation of interest, and outline the specific scenarios explored in this paper.
