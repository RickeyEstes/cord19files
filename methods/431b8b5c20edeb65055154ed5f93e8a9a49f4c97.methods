Markov chain for protein sequence. Let P = [p i,j ] represent the transition probability matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain 20 . Transition probability p i,j can be defined as follows: = denote the transition probability matrix of a discrete-time Markov chain starting from state i after k steps to end with state j. Each state transition probability p i j k , is given as follows:  The p i j k , can be determined by the equations (2) and (4) . After the derivation of the k th -step transition probability matrix, we optimized the step k = h, which is least positive integer under satisfying following condition for each protein sequence: where rmsd represent root mean square distance between two consecutive transition probability matrices. After optimizing the step of transition probability matrix, i.e, P h . We noted that, all 20 rows in optimized transition probability matrix are approximately identical with each other. Therefore, we took a single row from the transition probability matrix P h as a input for further investigation, which reduced our time complexity. Fuzzy integral and fuzzy measure for the h th -step amino acids sequence. Let  .., 20}, b ∈ M} be the finite set of h th -step amino acids starting from amino acid b and ending with amino acid a i , estimated from protein sequence. The finite set G is termed as feature vector. Let ν, τ ⊆ G and R(G) be the power set of G. A fuzzy measure μ is a real valued function: μ: R(G) → [0, 1], satisfy the following condition, For a fuzzy measure μ, let μ( The mapping x i → μ i is known as fuzzy density function. The fuzzy density of single element x i ∈ G, μ i can be interpreted as the importance of x i in determining the set G. Based on the fuzzy measure definition μ, the measure of a subset is not just only the summation of the measure of its elements but also included the measure of each combination. This information could be delivered by an expert or observed through the problem. However, when handing with larger set, this job may become computationally complex, difficult or even not feasible. λ-measures is the possible solution for solving this problem. λ-fuzzy measure 30 fulfills the criteria of fuzzy measure plus some additional property: for all ν, τ ⊂ G, ν ∩ τ = φ and Furthermore, λ can be obtained by solving following equation: = Therefore, we can construct fuzzy measure by applying equation (6) and equation (7), for this we only need to know the individual fuzzy densities of the elements μ i (∀ i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., 20}). Let ρ:G → [0, 1] represent a function that maps every element of G to its evidence. The function ρ must satisfy descending order, which is as follows: 20 ). If suppose ρ function does not satisfy the above condition, then reorder G so that ρ function must satisfy descending order condition and we will proceed further calculation based on the modified descending order condition. Let μ:R(G) → [0, 1] be a fuzzy measure. Then the fuzzy integral of ρ with respect to the fuzzy measure μ is given by The fuzzy integral examine the fact supplied by each element of a given set, and the assessment of each subset of elements (using a fuzzy measure) in its decision-making process. The combination of the important significance of the source and the extracted information makes the fuzzy integral appropriate for information fusion. This theory has capability to tackle uncertainties associated with issue related to the processing procedures and data extraction. Therefore, this theory has been extensively applied in pattern recognition 31 and classification. Fuzzy integral similarity and distance matrix for protein sequence comparison. The fuzzy integral similarity is based on the h th -step amino acids frequencies between the feature vector of the two sequences. Let ν and τ are feature vectors of the two sequences. We define fuzzy integral function ρ, which is given as: i i i www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ where x i ∈ G (i.e., the similarity of the h th -step amino acid frequency x i in the two feature vectors ν and τ). Using fuzzy measure, we can determine the relative importance of subsets of amino acids being considered. Taking benefit of the λ-fuzzy measure properties described above, we can formulate μ using the fuzzy density of the individual element μ i . In this case, where x i ∈ G (i.e., the maximum level of h th -step amino acid frequency starting from amino acid b and ending with amino acid a i between two feature vectors with respect to their assigned position). Using equation (7), we calculated the value of λ and put the λ value in equation (6) to obtain the fuzzy measure μ. It can be easily verified that μ satisfy the properties (i) and (ii) of the fuzzy measure. Once we have ρ and μ, it is a straight forward using equation (8) to obtain the fuzzy integral 21 . Next we calculate difference between two feature vectors ν and τ, which is given as follows: where I(ν, τ) is fuzzy integral similarity between ν and τ The above process is continued for all pairwise combinations taken from n number of protein sequences. Finally, a distance matrix was generated. This distance matrix contained the dissimilarity information related to n protein sequences. This distance matrix was used as an input data to the neighbor.exe program in PHYLIP package 24 for phylogenetic tree construction.
