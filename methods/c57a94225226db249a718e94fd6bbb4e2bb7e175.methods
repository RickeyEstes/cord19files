Studies were identified through searching electronic databases including; Medline (PubMed and Ovid), EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL from database inception to February 8, 2016. We used a combination of MeSH terms and text words including: 'crowding' OR 'mass gathering' OR 'large event' OR 'group assembly' OR 'holiday' OR 'travel' OR 'sport' OR 'Olympic' OR 'FIFA' OR 'festival' OR 'Hajj' (also alternative spelling 'Hadj' or 'Haj') OR 'pilgrimage' AND 'mask' OR 'facemask' OR 'surgical mask' OR 'medical mask' OR 'simple mask' AND 'infection' OR 'respiratory tract diseases' OR 'disease outbreaks' OR 'infectious disease' OR 'respiratory tract infections' OR 'influenza' OR 'pneumonia'. Additionally, an online search of pertinent epidemiology journals, including those not indexed in the mentioned databases (e.g. Saudi Epidemiology Bulletin) was carried out through free hand Google engine search. Finally, manual search was performed reviewing reference lists of included studies to identify additional potentially relevant studies. The search result was presented according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( Figure 1 ). 19 In the first phase, three authors (OB, SM and HB) identified the potential titles, and sifted the titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria. Titles of all studies published in English language and reported the use or effectiveness of facemask against respiratory infections in MGs were preliminarily included. Studies that dealt with attendees of MGs of any age, gender and country were considered for inclusion. At the end of the screening phase, full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved for detailed study. Finally studies that met the inclusion criteria were included for data synthesis. Duplicates were excluded. Five authors (OB, MA, HB, SM and JA) independently extracted the data from each study into a data extraction sheet which was divided in two sections, 'facemask uptake' and 'facemask effectiveness' and five authors subsequently cross-checked the entries (OB, AA, HB, SM and JA),while a sixth author (HR) arbitrated when a discrepancy occurred. The following data were abstracted in each extraction sheet: study design, year of conducting the study, sample size, country of origin, age, gender, diagnostic method used, definitions of study end point, and history of participants' chronic diseases, if available. The quality of the included studies were categorised according to a modified ranking criteria based on Oxford Evidence Based Medicine (http://www.cebm.net/) into groups (e.g., A, B, C, D) where A was for RCTs of adequate sample size, B for observational studies of adequate sample size with good quality or pilot RCTs or non-randomised trial, C for observational studies of inadequate sample size or of poor quality, and D for cases series, such as focus groups or qualitative surveys.
