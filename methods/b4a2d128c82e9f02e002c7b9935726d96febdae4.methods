Patients diagnosed as having acute bronchitis by the general practitioner (GP) were studied. No criteria for the diagnosis of acute bronchitis were given to the GPs, except that patients with previously diagnosed pulmonary disease were excluded from the study. The study was undertaken in a local general practice with four partners and a practice population of 7700. Sequential patients were recruited into the study between September 1986 and March 1987 and were studied on presentation and at 2 and 6 weeks. On presentation, demographic data were collected and symptoms were recorded using questions from the MRC/ PHLS study (22) . Three methods were used to determine potential pathogens.
