The municipal hospital in Taipei City studied here is a general and teaching hospital with 450 beds. The departments in this hospital include internal medicine, surgery, OBS/GYN, pediatrics, radiology and pathology. The hospital underwent a SARS outbreak during April 2003. Fiftynine hospital workers were infected and this led to seven deaths [1, 3] . To halt the outbreak of SARS infection, the hospital was shut down to allow evacuation of hospitalized patients and workers gradually over 10 days. Twentyfive days after that, the hospital was fully vacated and sterilization carried out. Outpatient services were first reopened after 35 days of quarantine. Inpatient and emergency services were reopened after 65 days. Subsequently, in addition to its general regional hospital function, the hospital became the infectious disease designated hospital for the Taipei area, and receives infectious disease patients, undergoes preparedness exercises and admits tuberculosis patients. In order to compare the recovery situation after SARS, this study follows the numbers of outpatients, emergency patients and inpatients from 2002 to 2006. The patient numbers for emergency and outpatient services, and number of patient days for inpatient service were used as quantitative evaluations and are expressed as the average monthly services amount Â± standard deviation. The hospital was shut down during April 2003, and therefore the study collected the services volume from every April to next March. Year 2002 was selected as the base year of this study. The service volume of 2003, which is when SARS was occurred, and of the two years after that, were compared to the 2002 data. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Taipei City Hospital Hoping branch. Statistically analysis by repeat measurement ANOVA (SPSS for Windows 15.0) was utilized in this study to compare the variation over 4 years. If the service volume for a specific area and year was less than the base year, and showed a significant difference (p < 0.05), then this year was considered to be still recovering. Based on this recovery situation, all the departments can be divided into four groups; these are departments that recovered in the year SARS happened, departments that recovered in the first year after SARS, departments that recovered in the second year after SARS, and finally departments still not yet recovered. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. Various permutations of the order of correlation and order of integration (I) were computed to choose the optimal combination of parameters based on the mean square error. Partial correlogram graphs and correlograms were used to select the order of moving average (MA) and autoregressive (AR) terms in the model. Based on the best model selected, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to measure the quality of fit of the service volume of outpatients during the SARS, and two years after SARS period [9] . During the four years of this study, the economic aspects that affected the hospital's performances remained the same, include beds and medical specialties. Furthermore, the number of similar hospitals in local area did not change. The organization of the healthcare system and its reimbursement still come from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) system [10]. In addition, there were also no significant policy changes with respect to NHI payment policy in these four years. Moreover, the neighborhood population of this hospital underwent no obvious change (the neighborhood population was 173,637 in 2002 and had become 171,092 in 2006) [11] . However, in addition to the general regional hospital, the hospital was also now designated as an infectious disease hospital.
