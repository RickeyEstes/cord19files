Animals. Three-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (abbreviated to B6) mice (Experimental Animal Center, Beijing, China), and three-week-old ACE2 knockout (abbreviated to KO) mice (B6 background) were housed in the animal facility at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology in accordance with institutional guidelines. All experiments involving human subjects were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology (ID: SYXK2010-005) and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Experimental mouse models. The wild-type RSV virus (abbreviated to BJ016) used in this study was isolated from a confirmed RSV-infected patient in Beijing Children's Hospital. The genomic sequence of BJ016 is available in the GenBank database (accession number KC978856). BJ016 and A2 virus were amplified in Hep-2 cells. After freeze-thaw, the infected cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; the supernatants were concentrated by centrifugation at 36,000 × g (Beckman rotor SW401) and the concentrate was re-suspended in 1X PBS. Viral suspensions were overlaid onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 42,000 × g; the purified BJ016 or A2 virus bands were collected, diluted with PBS, and concentrated by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 1 h. Purified viruses were re-suspended in 1X PBS and stored at − 70 °C. For RSV-induced lung injury, 3-week-old WT B6 mice were anesthetized with 20 μ l 1% (w/v) pentobarbital sodium, and then inoculated intranasally (IN) with 2 × 10 6.5 PFU of BJ016 or 20 μ l 1X PBS (mock-infection). For all mice, body weight was recorded daily before and after viral infection. Progression-free survival was evaluated at the time of viral infection. For UV-inactivation, BJ016 viral suspensions at 0.8 ml/well in a six-well plate were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) (approximately 5 inches from UV light source) for 60 min in a biosafety cabinet.
