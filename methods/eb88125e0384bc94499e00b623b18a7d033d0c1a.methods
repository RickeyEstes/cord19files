The taxonomic scope of this review is geese and swans, which are obligate herbivores. We initially included other widespread anatid herbivores (Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope, American wigeon Anas americana, gadwall Anas strepera), but found little relevant data for them, and they were subsequently omitted from analysis. Topical delineations used are: (1) Type of transmission: We included zoonotic transmission (animal to humans) and transmission to commercial livestock and poultry (risk for them per se and for secondary zoonotic transmission). (2) Transmission pathways: For transmission between different animal species including birds we considered potential direct and indirect transmission (via faeces, water, food plants, etc.). From birds to humans, we considered transmission by aerosol (inhalation), water, and direct and indirect contact (also through faeces). Finally, we included transmission from wild birds to humans via poultry and livestock. (3) Types of pathogens: we considered virus, bacteria (including acquired antibiotic resistance), and unicellular endoparasites relevant for livestock, poultry (with a focus on laying hens, broilers, turkeys, ducks and geese) and/or humans ( Table 1) . The list of pathogens with zoonotic potential detected in geese and swans is very long. Therefore, Table 1 . Pathogens/diseases with zoonotic potential in geese and swans treated in the present review. A large number of additional zoonotic diseases exists in wild geese and swans, but have been omitted because they are rare, extralimital or, according to current knowledge, have limited zoonotic potential. we used the One Health perspective to reduce the number subsequently treated here (see Table 1 ). In other words, very rare or extralimital pathogens were omitted, as were those with limited zoonotic potential, or with limited relevance to spread to livestock in developed countries. This review excludes disease transmission originating from domestic poultry facilities to humans and other animals, as well as ectoparasites, fungal diseases, and disease transmitted via human consumption of goose and swan meat. The geographic focus of this review is Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, but we have considered papers from other countries in Europe, as well as from Canada, the USA and northeast Asia when relevant. This is motivated by the fact that most goose and swan species in the Northern Hemisphere have long flyways covering many countries and climate zones. In addition, several species in the focal area occur naturally also in North America and northeast Asia, so it would be unwise to disregard studies from those areas. We used the databases Web of Science, Natural Sciences Collection and Google Scholar. The dates of last access were 12 October 2015, 12 October 2015, and 8 January 2016, respectively. In retrieved papers we performed a backwards search of the reference list for further relevant studies, and the same was done with these until no further relevant papers could be found.
