The taxa sold as wild meat in Malaysia were identified from a survey of wild meat establishments (restaurants, roadside stalls and markets) across Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, conducted by TRAFFIC (Caillabet et al. (Unpublished) . The species identified in this survey (Table 1) were used to categorise the potential zoonotic viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens in wildlife hosts. Between July 2014 and February 2015, we conducted a literature review of publications using online databases Google Scholar and Web of Science, with further information collected from the disease reporting database, ProMed. The initial search used all possible combinations of key words relating to the traded species (e.g. ''tiger'' or ''Panthera''), infectious disease terminology (including ''zoonotic'', ''zoonoses'', ''infection'' and ''infectious'') and three pathogen categories (including ''virus'', ''viral'', ''bacteria'', ''bacterial'', ''parasite'' and ''parasitic'') . Different combinations of the key words were linked together (e.g. ''tiger'' AND ''zoonotic'' AND ''virus'') to search for information about zoonotic pathogens circulating in wildlife hosts. Specific inclusion criteria utilised surveys (serological and faecal sampling) and disease investigations (post mortem examinations) of free-ranging and captive wild animal populations for pathogens, with negative results excluded. In some cases, insufficient data about the traded species necessitated the use of research from other species within the same taxonomic family or order. Due to the lack of data on sun bears, the search was expanded to other Ursidae species. This approach assumes that taxonomically related hosts would share similar pathogens due to their phylogeny (Davies and Pedersen 2008) . We excluded vector-borne pathogens from this review because of their indirect transmission route to humans, which we considered to be less relevant for wildlife hunters and consumers as an immediate route of zoonotic transmission than handling and consuming carcases. A subsequent search was conducted to find evidence for zoonotic infections in humans from wildlife. It combined the word ''human'' with key words relating to the zoonotic pathogens identified in the initial search (e.g. ''Bacillus anthracis'') or associated human disease (e.g. ''anthrax'') and the wildlife host (e.g. ''deer''). For example, ''human'' AND ''bacillus anthracis'' AND ''deer'' or ''human'' AND ''anthrax'' AND ''deer''. We included disease case reports (occupational exposure to wild animals) and serological surveys of some human populations (indigenous tribes with hunting traditions), which provided information on the transmission routes and infection risks from the hunting, butchering and consumption of wildlife. There was no limitation placed on the date of publication for the searches conducted. We examined publications and databases globally for relevant zoonotic information, but excluded pathogens geographically distributed outside of Asia. Additional references were identified by searching the reference lists of the papers that were obtained from the literature search.
