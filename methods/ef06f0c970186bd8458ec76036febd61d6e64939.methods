We performed a systematic review of English and French articles published from 1952 (first article) to November 2015 via an electronic search on PubMed. We used the keywords "Hajj" AND "infections". The search was limited to studies conducted in humans. We also retrieved the articles in the reference lists of the selected articles. Meeting abstracts published in supplements of medical journal and information available on official websites were included [3,5,7]. We focused on reviews, updates, outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, causes of hospitalization, causes of mortality, and prevention. We paid a particular attention to recent studies on MERS-CoV, respiratory tract infections, and vaccinations against respiratory tract infections. We first identified 281 articles and websites, of which 68 were further selected for extensive analysis mainly based on clinical relevance, study quality and reliability, and date of publication.
