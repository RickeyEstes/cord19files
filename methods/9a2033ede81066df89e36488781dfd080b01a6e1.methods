At the start of the literature search, the following goals were developed to guide and focus the search: (i) to determine whether the seven bovine viruses specified in 9CFR 113.47 [BVDV, REO, Rabies, BTV, BAd, bovine parvovirus and BRSV] are capable of infecting humans or display human host range (e.g., by infecting human cells in culture or producing antibodies in humans), (ii) to determine if, in addition to the 7 specific bovine viruses, there are other bovine viruses that would be detected by the hemadsorption/ hemagglutination and cytopathic effect (CPE) procedures in 9CFR, (iii) to identify porcine viruses (in addition to porcine parvovirus) that have human host range and that could contaminate porcine trypsin, and (iv) if additional porcine viruses were identified, to determine whether the 9CFR procedure for testing of porcine cells [9CFR113.47] would detect them. At the outset, the pathogen search sought to identify all known vertebrate viruses with bovine or porcine host ranges [natural infection, or detection of antibodies, or ability to grow in bovine or porcine cells in culture]. The second criterion for inclusion was that each virus identified also had to have human host range, which includes more than traditionally zoonotic viruses. Searching for zoonotic bovine and porcine viruses was assumed not to be adequate for this study because biological products are frequently injected, bypassing the normal barriers to infection. Therefore, human host range was defined by the presence of any of the following: natural infection [including laboratory accidents], detection of antibodies (with or without disease manifestation), or the ability to infect human cells in culture. These were defined as Viruses of Concern. Literature on viruses with human host range was also analyzed for infectivity among species. Bovine viruses were analyzed for the potential to infect pigs, and porcine viruses were analyzed for the potential to infect cattle. A conservative approach was adopted to ensure viruses posing a potential threat were not inadvertently eliminated from consideration due to uninvestigated properties. The step-wise analysis used is detailed in Fig. 1 below.
