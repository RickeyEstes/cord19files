A systematic literature review, described in Lessler et al. [6] , was performed to identify statements of incubation period and sources of original incubation period data for the following respiratory viral infections: adenovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), SARSassociated coronavirus, influenza A and B, measles virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus. All citations for a given statement were followed to identify the original source of the estimate. For each statement, all citations were recorded. These citations, an instance of one source citing another, make up the branches of the citation trees; the statements and sources are the nodes. Sources that provided no citation and were not themselves cited by another source were only included in the networks if they contained original data. A spreadsheet was used to create a record of all statements of incubation period, whether a citation was provided or not, and all sources of data. A version of this spreadsheet is available in Data S1. This information was used to create the graphs, by hand, using Adobe Illustrator. To visually clarify the presented citations, we incorporated a few design elements. Each citation is designated by two lines of text and an ''incubation period clock''. The clocks encode the incubation period estimate visually, allowing readers to quickly grasp how the estimates change (or not) over time. Arrows indicate a precise statement (median or mean) of the incubation period while shaded blue areas indicate given ranges or confidence intervals. The top line of text succinctly summarizes the stated estimate from that source, using ''h'' and ''d'' as abbreviations for ''hours'' and ''days'', respectively. An asterisk indicates that the source did not provide a stated incubation period, but was included because it did provide original data that could be used to estimate the incubation period. Citations shown in red or orange text are those with original data and those in black are sources that do not contain original data. Also on the first line, the abbreviation ''Obs'' or ''Exp'' appears, indicating whether the study was observational (in orange text) or experimental (in red). The second line of text gives the last name of the first author and the year in which the source was first published. The weight or stroke of the arrow lines pointing to a given source corresponds to the cumulative number of citations that rely on that source for information. We used lightly shaded gray boxes to group multiple editions of the same source and multiple publications from the same study (for example, yearly CDC influenza reports). In the case of influenza the time scale is log transformed (with 1890 as year 1) to accommodate the greater frequency of citations in later years. In all other cases the time axis follows a linear scale. All citation trees were created as described above except for the case of SARS. The literature on SARS had markedly different characteristics from the other diseases. There is a dense and highly-connected citation network for SARS which developed over the course of the few years after the 2002 SARS outbreak. Different methods were required to create this citation network and it is available as Figure S1 for comparison purposes. Additionally, metrics that characterize the connectedness of each network were computed to provide additional insight into the structure of the networks and direct comparisons between diseases. Based on the methods of Kleinberg [7] , hub and authority scores were computed. Hub and authority scores are values between 0 and 1, computed so that the vector norm of each set of scores is Figure 1 . A citation network for the incubation period of influenza A and B. The most cited paper (Cox, 1999) is in the middle of the figure, while the original data that is most often relied upon (Moser, 1979) has the heaviest arrow pointing towards it. Many sources of original data are not cited at all. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0019496.g001 equal to 1. A high hub score value for a particular source indicates that the given paper provides links to many strong authorities on the topic. A high authority score for a particular source indicates that the given paper is cited by many other sources. The results of these calculations and a complete description of the metrics calculated are given in Appendix S1.
