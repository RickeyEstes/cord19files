The data were based on the database of the Science Citation Index (SCI) published by the subscribed from Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science, Philadelphia, PA, USA. The analysis of publication papers was extracted upon a literature search using the online version of SCI. 'Asthmatic children' and 'asthma children' were used as keywords to search parts of titles, abstracts, or keywords. Articles, meeting abstracts, reviews, letters, editorial materials, notes, corrections and additions, and corrections were obtained from the search results for document types. Articles originating from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales were grouped under the UK heading. The impact factor (IF) of a journal was determined for each document as reported in the year 2002 Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Collaboration type was determined by the address of each entry, where 'independent' was assigned if no collaboration was presented. 'International collaboration' was assigned if it was cosigned with researchers from other countries abroad. Once retrieved, records were analyzed by the year of publication, total number of authors, institutions and country, type of publications, language, page count, impact factor of a journal in which the papers were published, and their total citations also included from 1991 to 2002. This effort will provide a current view of the mainstream research on asthmatic children all over the world, as well as clues to the impacts of the topic.
