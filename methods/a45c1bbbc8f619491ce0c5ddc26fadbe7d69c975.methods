We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group trial in the clinical trials unit (CTU), Wellington Regional Hospital, Wellington, New Zealand, between July 2011 and September 2012, spanning two southern hemisphere winter influenza seasons. Participants were referred by doctors in the Wellington region or presented directly to the study site following public advertising and telephone screening. This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12611000497909, URL https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/ TrialReview.aspx?id=336870 This study received NZ Health & Disability Ethics Committee Approval: CEN/10/12/057. More detailed methodology is available in Supplementary Appendix S1. Eligible participants were aged 18-65 years and had symptoms of an influenzalike illness (a history of fever (or documented temperature of ≥37.8°C), and at least one of cough, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, headache, myalgia, fatigue or malaise) for less than 48 h. After obtaining written informed consent, a rapid immunoassay test for influenza A and/or B (Xpect Flu A&B, Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) was used to screen participants. 23 Only those who tested positive were eligible for recruitment. Key exclusion criteria included were the need for hospital admission and the regular use of paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (excluding low dose aspirin). Participants were simple-randomized 1:1 to receive two 500-mg paracetamol tablets, or placebo tablets, four times daily for 5 days (Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Rowville, Vic., Australia). Doubleblinding was maintained by the use of identical paracetamol and placebo tablets. In addition to the study medication, all participants received a course of oral oseltamivir 75 mg one tablet twice daily with food for 5 days. Low dose oral codeine was available as required for pain. All participants were admitted to the CTU for 48 h, during which they received directly observed randomized treatments and underwent standardized clinical assessments. Baseline data were collected. Following randomization the following study assessments were performed: Pernasal flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murietta, CA, USA) were collected into Universal Transport Medium (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) taken for influenza quantitative viral load reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis at Baseline (before the first medication dose), 24 h (Day 1), 48 h (Day 2) and 120 h (Day 5). All baseline samples were tested for the presence of human ribonucleic acid (RNA) to ensure that samples had obtained human tissue; these were positive in all instances. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fast-Track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxemburg) was also performed on Baseline samples for other respiratory viruses. 24 Additional pernasal swabs were taken for viral culture at Baseline, Day 1 and Day 5. Blood samples were taken for analysis of serum cytokines (tumour necrosis factor α, IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-6) at Baseline, Day 2 and Day 5. Details of virology methodology and cytokine analysis are provided in Supplementary Appendix S1. Symptom scores were recorded daily from Baseline to Day 14 or until the total daily symptom score was ≤1 (defined as the resolution of illness). Participants rated their health on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) between 'worst possible health' and 'my health is normal for me', at Baseline, Day 2 and Day 5. Temperature was recorded using an infrared tympanic thermometer (Liberty Health Products, Melbourne, Vic., Australia) every 4 h for the duration of the CTU admission. After discharge from the CTU, participants used the same thermometer to continue recording temperature in their study diary four times daily until a final reading was recorded on Day 5 at the scheduled CTU appointment. Adverse events were recorded by staff during the CTU admission, on medical review on Day 5, and as documented in patient diaries up until Day 14. Adherence to randomized treatment for Days 3-5 was calculated by tablet count from returned medication bottles.
