Material. The coal liquid used in this study was HD (boiling range, 288-454'C), obtained from the Ft. Lewis, Washington plant, which was operated by the Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Company (P&M Co.). The sample was collected on April 3 and 4, 1980 during operation in the SRC-II mode using Powhatan No. 6 coal and was stored at 4째C under nitrogen in Teflon-lined drums. Samples of the stored material were recently evaluated for changes in chemical composition and mutagenicity to determine if changes had occurred since this study was conducted, between April and July 1982. These data indicate that the composition and biological activity for HD have remained constant for up to 4 years after collection . Chemical Analysis. Concentrations of the major HD components are listed in Table 1 ; more detailed chemical analysis for an SRC-II HD sample has recently been reported by Wilson et al. (I 984) and . High-resolution gas chromatography (GC) was used to quantify the concentrations of these constituents: a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5880A equipped with a 25 m X 0.25mm (id.) fused silica capillary column coated with SE-52 (J. & W. Scientific) and flame ionization detection. The oven was temperature-programmed from 50 to 300째C at 3째C min-', and helium carrier gas was used, with splitless injection. Quantitative results were determined from the response factor of an internal standard (n-nonadecane). Identification of the components was achieved by GC/ mass spectrometry (MS) procedures; an HP 5992 benchtop GC/MS system equipped with a 30 m SE-52 fused silica column was used for these identifications. The HD sample was also fractionated into chemical classes, according to the method of Later et al. (1981) . This separation yields aliphatic hydrocarbon (AH), neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), nitrogen-containing polycylic aromatic compound (NPAC), and hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (HPAH) fractions. For the SRC-II HD, the fractional composition is as follows: AH = 1%; PAH = 46%; NPAC = 36%; and HPAH = 25% (overall recovery -108%). Exposure system. The inhalation exposure system used in this study has been described previously (Moss et al., 1982) but has been modified for exposure of animals to coal liquids (Springer et al., 1982a) . Stainless-steel multitiered chambers (Hazelton Systems, Inc., Aberdeen, Md.) with a volume of 2.3 m3 were used. The HD aerosol was generated with two Solo-sphere nebulizers (McGaw Respiratory Therapy, Irvine, Calif.) housed in a 65째C water bath and was introduced into an orifice-controlled manifold delivery system constructed from 7.61 cm (3 in.)diameter stainless-steel pipe and fittings. An appropriate volume of the aerosol was diluted with filtered room air to give the desired concentration within each of the three exposure chambers. A fourth chamber, supplied with filtered air, was used for sham-exposure of control animals. Chambers were operated at a flow rate of approximately 283 liter/mm, with air movement from top to bottom. After each daily exposure, the flow rate for each chamber was increased to approximately 340 liter/min to reduce the time required to clear aerosol from the chamber. To reduce ammonia to less than 5 ppm, Deotized animal cage board (Shepherd Specialty Papers, Kalamazoo, Mich.) was placed on catch pans under each cage unit after the exposure and removed the next morning prior to startup. Temperatures in the chambers were continuously monitored; relative humidity (RH) was recorded three times daily. Means (2 + SD) for temperature and RH during the 13 weeks of exposure were 23 f 1 "C and 68 f 7%, respectively. a Identified by retention time and GCJMS. * Based on 1 mg/ml n-nonadecane internal standard, I:50 dilution, integration of peak areas. Target concentrations, as indicated by previous work (Springer et al., 1982b; Loscutoff et al., 1983) , were 0.70 mg/liter for the high-dose treatment group, with a factor of five between each consecutive treatment group. The concentration in each chamber was determined by collecting aerosol on a Metricel filter (Gelman Science, Ann Arbor, Mich.; 0.45 pm), eluting the HD into chloroform, and determining the ultraviolet (uv) absorbance at 254 nm (Springer et al., 198 1) . Mean daily concentrations of the aerosol from each chamber were determined by collecting triplicate samples at three equal intervals throughout the 6-br exposure period. Mean aerosol concentmtions (a* SD) during the 13-week exposure were 0.69 + 0.030, 0.14 f 0.012, 0.03 + 0.003, and 0.0 mg HD/liter of air for the high-, middle-, low-exposure, and control groups, respectively. In addition to the filter samples, the aerosol concentrations in each chamber were continuously monitored and recorded by a real-time aerosol monitor (RAM, GCA Corporation, Bedford, Mass.), which responds to changes in aerosol concentration by measuring the amount of light scattered by the aerosol particles. If readings from this online monitor indicated that concentrations were outside the range specified (+lO%), adjustments were made by increasing the air pressure to the generator, adjusting the amount of dilution air, or increasing the temperature of the water bath containing the nebulizer. Only minor adjustments were required. During the 13-week study, at least two Mercer cascade impactor samples of aerosol were collected per chamber per week for particle-size analysis. The amount of aerosol present on each stage of the impactor was determined by uv absorption at 254 nm. Since flow rates were uniform, the amount of aerosol on the same stages of the impactors was summed for all runs to give a composite weight for each stage. Using the computer program NEWCAS (Pacific Northwest Laboratory [PNL], 1977) , the calculated mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) were 1.7, 1.7, and 1.8 lrn, respectively, for the low-, middle-, and highexposure chambers; geometric standard deviations (GSD) ranged between 2.0 and 2.3. Animals. Animals were obtained from Charles River (Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) at 9 weeks of age and were quarantined at our laboratory for 3 weeks prior to exposure. Animals were individually identified by ear tags and randomly assigned by weight to an exposure group. The group of 128 male and 128 female Fischer-344 (F-344) rats were distributed equally over the three treatment and the control groups. They were continuously housed in the chambers and exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for either 5 or 13 weeks. Ten male and 10 female rats from each treatment and the control group were killed during the fifth week of exposure; other animals were killed during Week 13. Another group of animals, exposed for 13 weeks, were maintained for 26 weeks after exposure for hematology studies. Animals were observed twice daily for signs of toxicity and weighed weekly. Feed (Wayne Lab Blox, Chicago, Ill.: 24.5% protein) was available ad l&turn during nonexposure hours; animals had free access to water at all times. Serologic tests for common viral agents and Mycophm pulmonis were performed on blood samples collected at the end of the study from I5 rats randomly selected from each exposure chamber. Serologic assays were performed by Microbiological Associates (Bethesda, Md.). Blood samples for hematology and clinical chemistry evaluations were obtained from rats after 5 or 13 weeks of exposure. In addition, blood samples were collected from male rats 26 weeks after completion of 13 weeks of exposure. Samples for hematology were collected from freeflowing tail vein blood of unanesthetized rats into tubes containing EDTA; the samples were assayed using a Coulter Counter Model S. Blood samples for serum chemistry measurements were obtained without anticoagulants, by heart puncture of anesthetized rats. These samples were evaluated using an Abbott VP bichromatic chemistry analyzer. Bone marrow smears were prepared from femurs taken from animals that were killed. A necropsy (35 tissues) was performed on the rats after 5 or 13 weeks exposure, and the weights of heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, thymus, liver, gonads, and adrenals were recorded. All tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered Formalin (NBF). Tissues were obtained from 10 randomly selected rats of each sex from each treatment and the control group after 5 or 13 weeks of exposure and examined histologically. Tissues examined include: brain, pituitary gland, skin, mammary gland, trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, larynx, thymus, tracheobronchial lymph node, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, heart, aorta, kidney, adrenal glands, stomach, duodenum, colon, testes, salivary gland, mandibular lymph node, urinary bladder, prostate, ovaries, uterus, nasal structures, bone marrow, cecum, mesenteric lymph node, and grossly abnormal tissues. The nasal sections were taken at three levels: (1) immediately posterior to the incisor teeth, (2) midway between the incisor teeth and first molars, and (3) through the second molar. Tissues were embedded in paragin, cut at 4 to 6 pm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Bone marrow smears were stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. Selected special stains were used when necessary, and transmission electron microscopy was conducted on selected liver and cecal samples from randomly selected rats. All tissues from highdose and control groups were examined by light microscopy; target organs identified in the high-dose group were trimmed and examined for the next lower dose groups until either no effect was observed or the lowest dose group specimens were examined. Statistics. Body weight growth curves were analyzed by a randomization test (Lindgren, 1963) ; this test is based on the absolute area between two curves defined by connecting successive mean weights (Steel and Torrie, 1960) . Analysis of variance was used to analyze tissue weight, hematology, and clinical pathology data. Treatment means were compared with control means by Dunnett's test (Dunnett, 1955) . Lesion data for each treatment group were compared with control lesion data by Fisher's exact test (Siegel, 1956) .
