Particle production and purification. CAV16 (genotype B), isolated from Zhejiang Province, China, was used to infect Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.21 and incubated at 37°C. The virus was collected a week after infection, centrifuged to remove cell debris and the supernatant was filtered and concentrated 20-fold. It was then inactivated by incubation with 100 mg ml À 1 formaldehyde at 37°C for 72 h, followed by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. Using the above procedures, Sinovac Biotech Ltd and the China National Biotech Group produced two independent batches of samples, B0.6 mg in 600 ml PBS (pH 7.4) and B0.5 mg in 600 ml PBS (pH 7.4). The two batches of samples were loaded onto a 15-45% (w/v) and a 10-40% sucrose density gradient, and centrifuged at 103,614g for 3.5 h and 3 h, respectively, in an SW41 rotor at 4°C. Two sets of fractions from sample 1 were collected, one comprised natural empty particles (containing no RNA) and the other contained 135S-like particles ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). Three sets of fractions were collected from sample 2, the top two bands were composed of natural empty particles (containing no RNA), the other contained 160S mature viruses ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ). These sets of fractions were independently dialysed against PBS (pH 7.4) buffer and concentrated, and then subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation for determination of sedimentation coefficients (Supplementary Fig. S2 ) and SDS-PAGE for protein composition analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). PaSTRy assay. Thermofluor experiments 25 were performed with an MX3005p RT-PCR instrument (Agilent). SYTO9 and SYPROred (both Invitrogen) were used as fluorescent probes to detect the presence of RNA and the exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins, respectively. Fifty-microlitre reactions were set up in a thinwalled PCR plate (Agilent), containing 0.5-1.0 mg of the CVA16 virus, 5 mM SYTO9 and 3 Â SYPROred in PBS (pH 7.4), and the temperature ramped from 25 to 99°C, with fluorescence recorded in triplicate at 1°C intervals ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Crystallization. Crystallization used nanolitre vapour diffusion in Greiner Crystal Quick X plates. Purified CAV16 135S-like particles were concentrated to 2 mg ml À 1 in PBS (pH 7.4). An initial crystallization screen was performed with Topaz crystallization chips (Fluidigm Corp.) by free-interface diffusion. Salt Screen Structure determination. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature (21°C) from crystals in crystallization plates (in situ data collection) using a previously reported method 24 Figure 5 | Cartoon of the early stages of enterovirus cell entry. The two-fold axis channel and off-axis channels are shown. Emerging VP1 N termini are coloured blue and VP4 are coloured yellow. The host membrane is shown in grey. (a) A VP1 N terminus emerges transiently; (b) after receptor binding, the capsid is locked open and the VP1 termini are exposed for longer duration, and if in proximity engage the host membrane, initiating the switch to the off-two-fold position (c). (d) A second VP1 terminus can emerge through the two-fold axis channel, engage the membrane and move sideways (e) to clear the two-fold axis channel for the egress of VP4 (f). Picture is drawn in Crayons and 'Brushes 5 0 . beamsize of between 0.03 Â 0.03 mm 2 and 0.06 Â 0.07 mm 2 , depending on the size of the crystals. On I24, the X-ray beam was homogenized with a 0.25-mm carbon plate and focused downstream from the crystal. Using 0.1 s exposure times and 100% beam transmission, typically 4-15 useful images could be collected from a crystal (Table 1) . Data were analysed using HKL2000 (ref. 34 ). The crystals grown in the lithium sulphate condition belong to two space groups, I222 and P4 2 32 with unit cell dimensions a ¼ 338.4 Å, b ¼ 360.2 Å and c ¼ 366.0 Å (15-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)), and a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 357.0 Å (5-fold NCS), respectively, whereas the crystals grown in the polyethylene glycol condition only belong to the I222 space group. Structures in both space groups were determined by molecular replacement 35 using the coordinates of the empty EV71 particle (PDB code 3VBR) as the search model. Rigid-body refinement followed by cyclic positional, simulated annealing and B-factor refinement used strict NCS constraints with CNS 36 . Averaging used GAP (DIS, J Grimes and J Diprose, unpublished observations) and models were rebuilt with COOT 37 . Models were verified with PROCHECK 38 . X-ray data and structure refinement statistics are shown in Table 1 and a stereo picture of electron density for the P4 2 32 structure is shown in Supplementary Fig.  S7 . Structural comparisons used SHP 39 . Structural figures were prepared with The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5, Schrödinger, LLC.
