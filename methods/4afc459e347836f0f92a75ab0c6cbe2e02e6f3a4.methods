Selection of samples. VP4/VP2 sequences generated from several studies of HRV molecular epidemiology in the UK (Gaunt et al., 2011; Harvala et al., 2012; McIntyre et al., 2010 McIntyre et al., , 2013 Simmonds et al., 2010; Wisdom et al., 2009a, b) (Simmonds et al., unpublished data) (431 HRV-A and 113 HRV-B) were divided into groups based on phylogenetic clustering. Any isolate that did not show a close grouping with a prototype full genome or represented a distinct phylogenetic cluster of HRV-C was selected for amplification of the VP1 region. The procedure for amplification of the VP1 region of HRV-A, -B and -C and initial descriptions of sequences generated have been described previously (McIntyre et al., , 2013 Simmonds et al., 2010) . Sequence alignment, calculation of pairwise nucleotide pdistances and phylogenetic analysis. All available HRV VP4/VP2 and VP1 sequences were downloaded from GenBank in November 2012. The genome regions analysed in this study included the full VP1 region and a fragment of VP4/VP2 (nt 616-1004 numbered according to GenBank accession no. EF582385 for HRV-C4) that is commonly used in studies of HRV epidemiology (Blomqvist et al., 2009; Han et al., 2009; Henquell et al., 2012; Kaida et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2009; Mizuta et al., 2010) . Any sequences that were ,90 % complete across these regions or wereclassified as non-functional were excluded. All sequences were aligned using the SSE v1.0 sequence editor package (Simmonds, 2012) and pairwise nucleotide p-distances were calculated using the program Sequence Distances within the package. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in the MEGA v5.0 software package (Tamura et al., 2011) by the neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987) from 100 bootstrap resampled sequence alignments of maximum composite likelihood (Guindon & Gascuel, 2003) distances, with pairwise deletion for missing data. All phylogenetic analysis was undertaken using the Enterovirus D sequence (GenBank accession no. D00820 for EV-D70) as an outgroup. Analysis of recombination within the capsid region of HRV-A, -B and -C. Phylogenetic trees were inspected visually for evidence of incongruence between the VP4/VP2 and VP1 regions. Datasets containing these two non-consecutive regions were concatenated to give one continuous sequence, which was then additionally analysed for the occurrence of recombination. RDP v4.0 (Martin et al., 2010) analysis was used to screen each HRV species dataset for the occurrence of recombination within the capsid-coding region. Each sequence set was examined using a combination of algorithms implemented in the software package, specifically RDP (Martin & Rybicki, 2000) , GeneConv (Padidam et al., 1999) , MaxChi (Smith, 1992) , Chimaera (Posada & Crandall, 2001) , SiScan (Gibbs et al., 2000) and Bootscan (Martin et al., 2005) . A threshold P value of ,0.05 and detection by at least two algorithms was required for a recombination event to be detected. Each HRV species dataset was further analysed using the GARD program (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) as part of the HyPhy package. Any predicted recombination breakpoints were analysed by construction of neighbour-joining maximum composite likelihood trees for sequence fragments 59 and 39 to the putative breakpoint.
