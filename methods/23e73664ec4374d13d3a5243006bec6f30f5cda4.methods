The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Various subject matter experts (n=9) were identified spanning across the informatics team that supports MEDSS operations, public health program professionals who are users of the MEDSS system and its data, and the Information Technology (IT) team which supports the data exchange process. The focus included both onboarding (process OJPHI of shifting to electronic exchange for either new reporting or migration/upgrade to different standard) and on-going submissions. ELR is unique in that reporting can occur from either EHR or from LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) and can occur from healthcare delivery organization or from reference laboratories and these were taken into consideration. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended/discussion format and were done over time frame of November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. Figure 1 displays the ELR onboarding process and includes the testing and validation suite of tools offered in public domain by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [33] . The six identified key processes that influence quality of data are numbered A through F (A -mapping of tests and results to appropriate codes, B -NIST test bed for testing of messages, C -submit test HL7 messages, D -solicit HL7 messages with test cases (e.g. specific tests, seasonal diseases), E -technical review, F -program review). Figure 2 displays the internal data exchange routing process which includes the PHIN Messaging System (PHIN MS) [34] , a CDC provided software that serves as a transport mechanism for effective movement of messages. This part comprises of four main components numbered G through J (G -PHIN MS, H -Lab code list database validation, I -RhapsodyÂ® Integration Engine [35] rules, J -mapping in MEDSS).
