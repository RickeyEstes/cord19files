This pilot study was a component of an ongoing 5-year community-based ARI/ILI surveillance study, which includes a cohort of 250 households. 7 Participants are from a primarily immigrant Latino population in Northern Manhattan in New York City. Northern Manhattan is one of the most disadvantaged areas in New York City; 43.7% of the population receives federal income support. 8 As part of the ongoing study, families answer twice-weekly text messages to report ARI/ILI-associated symptoms among household members. Phone calls are used by research staff to follow-up on positive reports. If ARI/ILI criteria are met, a home visit is scheduled and a nasal swab is obtained from symptomatic participants by the research staff. 7 From January 7 to 23, 2014, after the swabs were collected for the primary study by the research staff, each participant was asked to obtain a nasal swab later that day, either from themselves (if they were $17 years old) or from their symptomatic child. The Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this study with use of an information sheet and verbal consent. For volunteers, the study team demonstrated how to obtain a nasal swab. Written instructions (English and Spanish) were also provided. Participants were provided with a self-swab kit and a pre-addressed, prestamped mailer that followed the US Postal Service guidelines for biological substances. 9 Participants were advised that if the swab was not sent the day it was obtained, it should be stored in the refrigerator. The research staff followed up by telephone the next day to confirm that the self-swab was obtained and sent. Each participant obtaining the self-swab received a round-trip New York City MetroCard (value US$5.00) when the specimen was received. To assess feasibility, we determined the proportion of households agreeing to perform the self-swab, the proportion returning the swab, and the number of days elapsed between when the participants received the kit and when the swab arrived in the laboratory. All swabs obtained by research staff were analyzed by a commercially available multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 1-200 tissue culture infective dose (TCID)50/mL for influenza, and an LOD of 4-30,000 TCID50/mL for non-influenza viral pathogens, of which only rhinovirus/enterovirus has an LOD of more than 5,000 TCID50/mL. The LOD for bacterial respiratory pathogens ranges from 30 colony forming units (CFU)/mL to 4,000 CFU/mL. 10 If the swab obtained for the primary research study was positive for a respiratory pathogen, the self-swab was also analyzed by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The percent of self-swabs positive for the same pathogen as the corresponding swab obtained by research staff was calculated. Chi-square tests were used to assess if there were differences in demographic factors (age, sex, English proficiency, born in the US/elsewhere, and educational level) between those with a positive research swab who also had a positive self-swab versus a negative self-swab. Finally, the sensitivity of the self-swab using the research swab as the gold standard was assessed. All analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics V22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
