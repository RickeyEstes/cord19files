A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. The study was conducted in the emergency department after obtaining ethical approval from the King Saud University Research Center. All residents were informed regarding the purpose of the study and their verbal consent was given. The study was conducted in four tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: King Khalid University Hospital, King Fahad Medical City Hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City Hospital, and King Faisal Specialist. We included all ERRPs working in these four hospitals between November 2015 and December 2015 after a major outbreak of coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaires were distributed and collected during the regular weekly residents' education activities. The questionnaire contained a brief description of the study's objectives and statements assuring participants of their anonymity and right to stop participating of their own volition. The questionnaire was adapted and modified, based on a review of the literature, from one used in a previous study by Wong et al. [7] . The questionnaire comprised two parts. The first part contained questions about participants' background information, including age, marital status, training level, and knowledge of MERS. The second part comprised four main sections that included an assessment of (1) work-related concerns, (2) non-work-related concerns, (3) the perceived impact of MERS on ERRPs, and (4) their preparedness for a MERS outbreak. All of the descriptive data were summarized as percentages and frequencies. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY).
