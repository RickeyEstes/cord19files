Database Setup: The case records of all SARS patients were reviewed by our investigators and input into a database (Excel; Microsoft; Redmond, WA) statistically designed with uniform fields including patient demographic data, contact history, etiologic investigations, SARS-IgG, SARS-PCR, underlying diseases, symptoms and signs, chest radiography, laboratory investigations, complications, medications and interventions, prognosis, and cause of death. Evaluation of Chest Radiography: Each side of lung field was divided into 9 zones by anatomic thirds from upper to lower and from lateral to medial parts, such that there were 18 zones in total on both sides. 16 Each zone was scored 1 through 4 based on the degrees of pulmonary opacities (1 ϭ hazy, 2 ϭ medium density, 3 ϭ high density, 4 ϭ consolidation), and the sum of these 18 subscores was defined as the total score for pulmonary abnormalities in radiography. Then the total score of pulmonary abnormalities was compared with the previous chest radiograph to determine the tendency of chest radiography abnormality. The tendency of chest radiography abnormality was classified as progressed (1 ϭ 25% increase in total score), stable (2 ϭ Ͻ 25% change in total score), and improved (3 ϭ 25% reduction in total score). Two senior radiologists evaluated and scored the chest radiographs independently and contributed to the mean total radiographic score for each case. Recognition of the Onset: Day 1 of the disease was marked by the first time of fever as reported by the patient or confirmed by measurement. Calculation of the Steroid Doses: Corticosteroid therapy in our study included aggressive treatment for critical patients and rescue regimen for worsened cases. The dosage of steroids was calculated only up to week 3 from onset in an attempt to circumvent calculation of rescue use of very high dosage of corticosteroid before the death of the patients. We defined the rescue use of corticosteroid as the sudden increase of dosage after 3 weeks from the onset and 3 days before the patients died. In this way of calculation, we were able to include 87.3% of the total dosage of corticosteroid and avoid four cases of rescue use of corticosteroid with daily dosage from 1,000 to 2,000 mg of methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone was the major steroid used in most of the patients, while a small percentage were treated with hydroprednisone or dexamethasone, the doses of which were converted into methylprednisolone equivalents by 25 mg of hydroprednisone/4 mg of methylprednisolone and 0.75 mg of dexamethasone/4 mg of methylprednisolone. Recognition of Complications: Complications in our study referred to those occurring during the course of treatment and associated with progression of SARS or treatment interventions. Major complications included pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema, myocardial injury, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, high BP, hypokalemia, secondary lower respiratory or extrapulmonary infections, and GI tract hemorrhage. Recognition of Secondary Lower Respiratory Infections: Secondary lower respiratory infections in the SARS patients were recognized when one of the following was met: (1) histologic evidence of bacterial or fungal infections in lungs; (2) presentation of pneumonia, with pathogen isolated from blood or pleural effusion identical to result of sputum culture; (3) after 2 weeks in the time course of SARS, under the condition of resolution of fever, significant clinical improvement and obvious resolution on chest radiograph, recurrence of fever, cough, and sputum as well as newly development of lung infiltrate on chest radiograph were observed; and (4) apparent purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and confirmed pathogen in sputum by two consecutive culture findings. 17, 18 Recognition of Myocardial Injury: Myocardial injury was referred to as one time or above increase in creatinine kinase-MB. Recognition of Extrapulmonary Infection: The criteria for the determining secondary extrapulmonary infection were as follows: (1) bacteria or fungi infection in a site other than lower respira-tory tract proved by pathology; (2) same isolate of two consecutive culture findings from extrapulmonary fluid.
