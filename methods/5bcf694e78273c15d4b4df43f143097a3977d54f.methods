Nasal wash samples from volunteers were collected as recently described (Al-Nakib and Tyrrell, 1988) . Half the volume of each nasal wash was used to isolate rhinoviruses while the other half was processed for rhinovirus detection by ISH. Mucus from the samples being processed for ISH was removed using a Percoll density centrifugation step. Thus, samples were mixed with 45% Percoll (in PBS) in a ratio of 2: 1 ( 15% Percoll final concentration) and then layered onto a 20% Percoll cushion. Samples were spun for 5 min at 500 x g in a bench centrifuge. This resulted in the mucus remaining at the top of the gradient while the cells had pelleted. The cells were resuspended in PBS and aliquoted out onto 12-well multitest microscope slides (Flow) which had previously been coated with poly-I-iysine. After air drying, the cells were fixed with freshly prepared periodatelysine-parafo~aldehyde ]PLP; three parts buffered lysine (0.1 M lysine, 0.005 M Nal HPOd), one part 8%. paraformaldehyde, 0.01 M sodium periodate]. The samples were fixed for 20 min at room temperature, washed four times with sterile water and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol washes (30. 60, 80 and lOO%, respectively) for 5 min in each. The slides were then air dried and stored at -70Â°C until required. Control slides were prepared by infecting confluent layers of Ohio HeLa cells grown in Lab Tek (Plow Laboratories) eight chamber glass slides with HRV-14. When approximately 50% of the cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE), the slides were washed three times with PBS and fixed with PLP as described for the clinical samples.
