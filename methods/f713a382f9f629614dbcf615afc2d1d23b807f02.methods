The US Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) specifies the following two key ventilation design requirements for dedicated isolation facilities: e increased dilution efficiency through higher air ventilation rates; e the avoidance of air flow from less clean to clean areas, by creating a pressure gradient and providing an air-locking ante room. 6 No such requirements are stipulated for general wards. Most hospital general wards have corridor return airflow without air return duct design, which has the effect of potentially driving air from less clean to clean areas. Hospital general wards accommodating more than 30 patients normally comprise a number of bed cubicles linked together through the ward corridor to a common nurse station. This rectangular, six-bed ward cubicle design is common in hospitals across the USA and the UK. In fact, the UK pioneered this ward cubicle design in 1969, by breaking the long, open Nightingale ward into smaller ward cubicles to reduce cross-infection. 7 The main sources of air supply for most hospitals are natural ventilation and installed air-handling units (AHU) that draw air from outside the hospital building. The current study focuses on hospitals with an AHU, the typical air supply for hospitals with airconditioning systems. The AHU supplies fresh air into the general ward through a high standard air filtering system to maintain reasonably good inflow air quality. As patients mostly stay inside the ward cubicle, the supply air is cleaner than that inside the rest of the ward. This inward air-flow system is also the standard requirement of the CDC for isolation room design. The isolation facility in the general ward should be able to remove and dilute microbes from within the cubicle and prevent the outflow of microbes into the corridor, nurse station and other hospital areas. The design of the ventilation system proposed in this study adapts the CDC guidelines for isolation facilities to the general ward to increase dilution efficiency and to minimise air flow from less clean to clean areas.
