We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and chest radiographic findings of 191 children with MP who were admitted to The Catholic University of Korea, Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital during a nationwide MP epidemic, from January 2006 through December 2007. A total of 1,083 patients with pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections were admitted during this period. Among them, we selected patients with MP using two IgM serologic tests: the indirect microparticle agglutinin assay (MAA: Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Japan; positive cutoff value ≥1:40) and the cold agglutinins titer (positive cutoff value ≥1:32). Following parental consent, both assays and some laboratory indices were routinely performed twice: once at the time of admission and once at discharge (mean: 6.0 ± 2.1 days apart). Subjects were selected for inclusion in the study if seroconversion was shown on both assays during admission, or if increased MAA-positive titers (≥4-fold) with corresponding cold agglutinin titers (including seroconversion) were displayed on the second test. Patients who tested positive in both assays at admission, but did not have increased or decreased titers at discharge, were regarded as having recent past infection and were excluded from the study (38 cases). Blood culture for bacterial pathogens was performed for all pneumonia patients. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or sputum for viral agents (influenza viruses type A and B, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenoviruses) and PCR for M. pneumoniae were examined in the majority of patients (129 patients). The chest radiographic patterns at admission of patients with MP were divided into two groups. Patients with increased nodular densities along the bronchial trees and/or an interstitial pattern on the unilateral or bilateral lung fields were designated as the bronchopneumonia group. Patients with distinctive subsegmental, segmental or lobar consolidation were designated as the segmental/lobar pneumonia group. The chest radiographic findings were reviewed and classified independently by two pediatricians (KY Lee and YS Youn) and one pediatric radiologist (JC Kim). We divided the 191 children with MP into three groups according to age: ≤2 years of age (29 patients), 3-5 years of age (81 patients), and ≥6 years of age (81 patients), and into another two groups according to pneumonia pattern: the bronchopneumonia group (96 cases) and the segmental/lobar pneumonia group (95 cases). In addition, the children aged ≥6 years (81 patients) were classified into three groups based on the severity of pneumonia: the bronchopneumonia group (25 patients), the mild segmental/lobar group (33 patients), and the severe segmental/lobar group (23 patients). The mild segmental/lobar pattern was defined as having an area of consolidation in less than one lobe without pleural effusion, while the severe segmental/lobar pattern was defined as having an area of consolidation over one lobe, including multiple lobe involvement and/or any consolidation with pleural effusion. We also evaluated the pneumonia patients according to diagnostic antibody status. We compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics among the groups. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board.
