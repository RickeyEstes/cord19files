With a cross-sectional design, an exploratory study was conducted from January to March 2018 using face-to-face interviews with a structured questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire was on the demographic characteristics of the participants. The second part included 45 assessment questions that were used to assess the hand hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practices of the participants. The first 29 questions were adopted from the questionnaire of the Centre for Health Protection, while their health literacy was adopted from the Chinese version (HLS-Asia-Q) of the 16-item European health literacy questionnaire (HLS-EU), which covers competencies in understanding, evaluating, and applying health information across the domains of health care, disease prevention, and health promotion. 10 The completed questionnaires were administered by a trained Cantonese-speaking research assistant.
