This study is a secondary analysis of the Brazilian Network for Surveillance of Severe Maternal Morbidity including 27 referral maternity hospitals in Brazil. The study evaluated severe maternal morbidity cases, from a prospective surveillance, according to the 2009 WHO newly publicized criteria for these conditions [6] . The methodological details of the original study have already been published elsewhere [19, 20] . Briefly, this multicenter study included 27 referral maternity hospitals distributed among the five Brazilian geographical regions. From July 2009 to June 2010, all women admitted to participating centers, who were identified as having any life-threatening condition, near miss or maternal death, according to the WHO definition, were included in the study. Data collection, by the study team, was acquired through medical chart review after hospital discharge or death of the patient. If any doubt on diagnosis considered, the treating doctors were further contacted for clarifications. Information was entered into the OpenClinicaÂ® electronic platform (version 2.5.5 -Waltham, MA, USA) through a structured form completed by the local coordinator from each participating center. This was not a population based study, however, there was a concern to reduce the impact of nonrandom sampling and an effort to consider representativeness of the national territory (with health facilities from all five macro-regions of the country) and of facilities from public and private sectors, university and non-university hospitals. All selected hospitals had to provide information concerning their characteristics, including location, complexity of level of care, population covered, number of maternity beds and availability of resources for severe cases. Quality control was carried out during various phases of the study. Initially, training was provided to the entire team participating in the study, using a detailed operations manual, with the definition of each variable. Meetings were held between the local research team and the coordinating team of the study to standardize data. Case review was conducted by the local investigator. Subsequently, the coordinating team of the study performed random reviews of manual and electronic forms for data consistency in visits to monitor the centers' performance. Periodically, review of the electronic system was carried out to check for data inconsistency, along with systematic case review. Some reported conditions were delay or substandard care, which had been previously reported [21] . Reasons for the delay in treatment were the woman or family member (including delay in identifying the condition, seeking care and refusing to accept treatment), health service (difficulties in obtaining equipment or medical supplies) or health professional (delays in identifying the correct diagnosis and providing appropriate patient treatment). Sample size was determined by the prevalence of about 8 maternal near miss cases per 1000 births and a maternal mortality ratio of 140/100,000 live-born infants (95 % confidence interval). It was predicted that 75,000 births [19] needed to be monitored. For the present analysis, we considered severe respiratory disease as a suspected or confirmed case of influenza or acute respiratory failure, defined as incapacity of the respiratory system to promote adequate gas exchange, with arterial blood gas parameters: PaO2 < 60 mmHg or peripheral saturation < 90 %, associated or not with PaCO2 > 50 mmHg. Clinical parameters such as tachypnea (respiratory rate-RR > 20) or bradypnea (RR <6), use of accessory respiratory muscles, nasal flaring, associated with torpor or agitation were also considered. For suspected or confirmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm09, the definition of cases considered only those with severe morbidity, including acute respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, intensive care admission, intubation and others. Cases of H1N1 without severe complications were not included. A review of all H1N1 Influenza cases was necessary to confirm whether laboratory tests had been performed and to obtain the results of these tests, since data in the original study had not been collected in detail. Case review was requested from each local center and new data were distributed into three groups: non-tested, positive and negative cases for H1N1 influenza virus. Initially, the prevalence of PLTC, MNM and MD was calculated per group, as well as the respective health indicators related to maternal morbidity and mortality: maternal near miss ratio, severe maternal outcome ratio, mortality index and maternal mortality ratio, according to the WHO definition [6] . To evaluate the progression of severe maternal morbidity in cases complicated by respiratory disease throughout the study, maternal outcomes (PLTC, MNM and MD) were measured for each month studied. The risk of SMO associated with procedures used to manage the severity of conditions was estimated for the group with severe respiratory disease and other causes of severe maternal morbidity, using Prevalence Ratios plus their respective 95 % CI adjusted for the design effect of cluster sampling. Subsequently, we performed an analysis considering the total number of cases with severe respiratory disease versus cases with other causes of severe maternal morbidity. In each group, PLTC (less severe cases) and Severe Maternal Outcome (SMO: MNM + MD) cases were compared to evaluate the factors potentially associated with more severe disease, including delay in obstetric care, also using the Prevalence Ratios plus their respective 95 % CI adjusted for the design effect of cluster sampling. The prevalence of sociodemographic, obstetric and perinatal factors were evaluated between the two groups using Chi-square tests. Values statistically significant were considered those with a p-value under 0.05. The statistical procedures for analysis were performed with SPSS and Stata.
