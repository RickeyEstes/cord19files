A 16-member research team in Vancouver, Canada, composed of experts in occupational medicine, occupational hygiene, infection control, public health, and epidemiology and clinicians and frontline care providers reviewed the current scientific knowledge on the efficacy of PPE in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of these protective measures when used in clinical practice under working conditions. Literature searches were conducted in 5 databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and OSHROM) for articles published in English in the last 15 years that related to infection control practices, occupational health and safety issues, and environmental factors and other issues of importance in protecting workers against infections in health care settings. This produced an initial list of 841 publications. From the initial literature search results, a series of research topics were developed under 3 broad categories: (1) basic science and efficacy of facial protective equipment, (2) the effectiveness of specific infection control procedures, and (3) organizational and individual factors that influence infection control and occupational health in health care settings. Titles and abstracts were screened to refine the citation list to include only those articles with direct application to these topics, and secondary sources were added from these primary references. The research topics were divided among the research committee members (subgroups) to summarize, using articles from the second iteration of the original citation list. Secondary reference materials, derived from these initial references, were added. Articles were critically evaluated based on the study design (descriptive, analytic, or intervention), the population under study, and the outcomes of interest. This resulted in 168 publications being used in the final report. Drafts from each subgroup were merged, and the compiled version was reviewed by the team as a whole. The results of the organizational and individual factors are presented here. The existing knowledge was then summarized, and recommendations for further research were developed through consensus by the research team.
