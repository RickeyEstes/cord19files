Protein expression and purification. The CesT and CsrA genes of the EPEC O127:H6 E2348/69 strain (accession number: NC_011601.1) were synthesized by the GENEWIZ corporation (codon optimized for E. coli). For CesT (residues 1-156) and its variants including CesT-C del (residues 1-145), CesT-E121A (residues 1-156, E121A), CesT-Y152A (residues 1-156, Y152A), and CesT-E121A/ Y152A (residues 1-156, E121A + Y152A), the DNA fragments were first engineered to contain a coding sequence for an N-terminal 6xHis tag and a PreScission Protease (PSP) cleavage site, and then subcloned into the pET-30a (Novagen) vector via the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. For CsrA (residues 1-61), CsrA-C del (residues 1-44), Re-CsrA (CsrA-C del linked to full-length CsrA via a GGGGSGGGGS linker), and the CsrA tetra-mutant (residues 1-61, R31A + K38A + H43A + R44A), the coding sequences were individually constructed into the pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) vector via the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The primers used for plasmid constructions were summarized in Supplementary  Table 1 . The resultant recombinant plasmids were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expressions, which were conducted with the addition of 500 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) followed by induction at 16°C for 12 h. For protein purification, the E. coli cells were harvested, lysed by sonication in a re-suspension buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mM NaCl, and clarified via centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. For preliminary purifications, the CesT proteins were passed through the Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare) first, washed with the re-suspension buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, and then eluted with re-suspension buffer supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. For the CsrA proteins, the clarified supernatant was passed through the GST column (GE Healthcare), washed with resuspension buffer to remove contaminated proteins, and then eluted with resuspension buffer containing 20 mM GSH. The eluted target proteins were then further purified by gel filtration in re-suspension buffer using a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare) column. For the proteins used for crystallization, the fusion tags were removed in advance by on-column PSP-digestions in resuspension buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT. In vitro GST pull-down assay. The GST-fused CsrA proteins (GST-CsrA and GST-CsrA-C del ) and wild type CesT were individually purified as described above. For the pull-down experiments, 60 μg GST or GST-CsrA or GST-CsrA-C del was first incubated with 200 μg CesT for 2 h at 4°C. The samples were then loaded onto GST-resin columns, followed by washing with PBST to remove the unbound proteins. The bound protein species were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and stained with Coomassie blue. SPR assay. The SPR analyses were carried out using BIAcore X-100 system with the NTA chips (GE Healthcare) at 25°C. For the SPR measurements, all the proteins, including CesT, CsrA, and Re-CsrA, were prepared in a PBST buffer consisting of 1× PBS (136 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) and 0.005% Tween 20. The CesT protein was immobilized on the Ni-NTA chip at~50 response units. The blank channel served as the negative control. When the data collection was finished in each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with 350 mM EDTA and then with 0.5 mM NiCl 2 . Gradient concentrations of CsrA or Re-CsrA ranging from 16 nM to 256 nM were flowed over CesT on the chip-surface at 30 μl/min, and the amount of bound proteins in response units was recorded for comparison. The kinetic analyses were analyzed with BIAevaluation software 4.1. For dissociation constant (K D ) calculations, the data of CsrA binding to CesT were fitted to a Bivalent-Analyte binding model, whereas the data of Re-CsrA binding to CesT were fitted to a Steady-State Affinity model. Analytical gel filtration chromatography. Purified CsrA and Re-CsrA were individually mixed with CesT with a molar ratio of 1.2:1, followed by incubation at 4°C for 2 h. The samples, including the individual CsrA, Re-CsrA, and CesT proteins, as well as the CesT/CsrA and CesT/Re-CsrA mixtures, were loaded onto a calibrated Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column, respectively. The UV-280 curves were recorded and overlaid. The pooled samples were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and stained with Coomassie blue. For CesT and CsrA mutants, the purified proteins and their respective wild-type proteins were individually loaded on the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column for comparative analytical gel filtration analyses. The UVabsorbance curves were recorded at 280-nm for all the proteins except for CsrA-C del , whose absorbance chromatograph was recorded at 215-nm due to the lack of any aromatic residues after deletion of the C-terminal helix. The curves were then overlaid for comparison. Crystallization and data collection and processing. For crystallization experiments, the Re-CsrA and CesT proteins were first mixed at 1:1 molar ratio and then further purified via gel filtration on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare) column to obtain stable CesT/Re-CsrA complex. The resultant protein complex was used to screen the commercial crystallization kits (Hampton Research) via the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The conditions were then optimized. Diffractable crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of the protein complex (at 10 mg/ml) with 1 μl reservoir solution consisting of 20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 8.3, followed by incubation at 18°C for about 1 week. Data collection were conducted at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline BL18U1. The collected data were then processed with HKL2000 44 for indexing, integration, and scaling. Structure determination. The CesT/Re-CsrA structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the Phaser program 45 in the CCP4 suite 46 . The previously reported structures of CesT (PDB code: 1K3E) and CsrA (PDB code: 2BTI) were used as the search models. For CesT, the model structure was first truncated to include only residues I36-G131 prior to molecular replacement. The remaining CesT amino acids, including those consisting of the N-terminal α1loop-β1 module and the extended C-terminal motif, were then manually rebuilt in Coot during refinement. For refinement, initial restrained rigid-body refinement was performed using REFMAC5 47 , which was followed by manual rebuilding and adjustment in COOT 48 . Further refinement was carried out with Phenix 49 . The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed through the program PROCHECK 50 . The final data processing and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . All structural figures were generated using Pymol (http:// www.pymol.org). Indirect ELISA. The indicated CsrA proteins, including CsrA, Re-CsrA, and the CsrA variants, were coated on 96-well plates (Corning) at 2 μg/well in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer overnight at 4°C. The plates were then blocked for 1 h at 37°C with 1× PBST containing 5% skim milk. Following blocking, serially-diluted His-tagged CesT proteins (wild type or variants) were added to the plates to bind to immobilized CsrA proteins for 1 h. The anti-his mAb (1:2000 diluted, mouse origin, Zen BioSicence, Cat. no. 230001) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h, followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse mAb (1:2000 diluted, Zen BioSicence, Cat. no. 511103) and incubation for about 40 min, and then the addition of TMB substrate and incubation for about 5 min at 37°C. In each step, the plates were fully washed with PBST. The chromogenic reaction was then stopped with 2 M HCl and the emission OD450 was monitored using a microplate reader (Thermo). CD spectroscopy. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were carried out on a CIR-CULAR DICHRIOSM SPECTROMETER MODEL 400 (AVIV). Freshly prepared CesT (mutant and wild type) and CsrA (mutant and wild type) proteins were first adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml in ultrapure water, respectively, and then applied for data collection. For each measure, wavelength spectra were recorded in the range of 190 nm to 260 nm at 25°C using a 0.1-cm-path-length cuvette. Data was obtained by taking data points every 1 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. RNA gel mobility shift assay. The gel mobility shift assay was performed as previously described with small modifications 5 . In brief, an RNA molecular derived from nleA 5′UTR was synthesized with the sequence of 5′-CACUAAUAAUAU-CAAUGGAUUGAUAUUAUUAAUG-3′ (Sangon Biotech). The RNA was dissolved in DEPC water, heated to 80°C for 10 min, and slowly cooled down to room temperature before use. For the RNA-binding test, 1 μl pre-treated RNA solution (10 μM) was incubated, at room temperature for 30 min, with WT CsrA or the WT + C del CsrA mixture or Re-CsrA at the indicated concentrations, and then resolved by 12% native TBE PAGE. For the experiments of CesT antagonizing the CsrA/ RNA binding, decreasing concentrations of CesT were added to the pre-incubated CsrA/RNA (WT or WT + C del ) or Re-CsrA/RNA binding reactions and then further incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The resultant reactions were then resolved using 12% native TBE PAGE. In each case, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the RNA bands were visualized with Gel DocTM XR + (BIO-RAD).
