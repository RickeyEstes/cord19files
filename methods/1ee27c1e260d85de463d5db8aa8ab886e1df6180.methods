We counted the number of daily searches that were related to MERS in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from January 1, 2014 to May 16, 2014 and compared them with reported cases during the same period [11] . We also counted the number of daily searches related to MERS in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between March 29, 2014 and May 21, 2014 and compared them with reported cases during the same period [12] . These date ranges were chosen to correspond to the dates reported in published articles. For the outbreak in Jeddah in 2014, for symptomatic cases (191 of 255 cases; 75%), the date given for each case represents the date of onset of illness; for asymptomatic cases (64 of 255 cases; 25%), the date given represents the date of the test for MERS-CoV [11] . For the outbreak in Riyadh in 2014, for symptomatic cases (41 of 45 cases; 91%), the date given for each case represents the date of onset of illness; for asymptomatic cases (4 of 45 cases; 9%), the date given represents the date of virus detection [12] . In addition, we counted weekly searches related to MERS in Riyadh from June 20, 2015 to October 3, 2015 and compared them with cases reported by the World Health Organization [13] . We considered relevant search terms to be those related to MERS, coronaviruses, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or mechanical ventilation. For the 2 outbreaks in 2014, we compared the results graphically by showing the 7-day rolling mean for the number of Up-ToDate MERS searches together with the 7-day rolling mean for the number of reported cases. The 7-day rolling mean for the date of interest was determined by calculating the average of the sum of the daily case counts for the date of interest and for 3 days before and 3 days after the date of interest. In contrast to the analyses of the earlier outbreaks, for the 2015 outbreak in Riyadh, we reported weekly cases and did not calculate the 7-day rolling mean because we only had access to weekly data for reported cases. We calculated the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for each daily (Figures 1 and 2 ) or weekly ( Figure 3 ) comparison of UpToDate MERS searches to reported cases. For a control group, we analyzed UpToDate searches in 4 control cities in Saudi Arabia that were not having MERS outbreaks at the time that the Jeddah and Riyadh outbreaks were occurring in 2014; the control cities were Abha, Buraydah, Medina, and Tabuk. We selected these cities to be the 4 control cities because they did not have MERS outbreaks at the time of 2014 outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh and because the combined search volume of UpToDate searches in these cities was similar to the search volume in Jeddah during the same period. To establish a baseline for the Jeddah and Riyadh outbreaks in 2014, data were selected from January 1, 2014 to February 28, 2014 (considered an outbreak-free period). We calculated the mean and standard deviation for the baseline periods. We used the following formula to calculate the signal (increased UpToDate MERS search activity in terms of number To provide background information about overall UpToDate search volume in Jeddah and Riyadh, we calculated the average number of daily UpToDate searches (for the 2 outbreaks in 2014) or weekly UpToDate searches (for the outbreak in 2015) in the relevant city both before and during the outbreak period of interest.
