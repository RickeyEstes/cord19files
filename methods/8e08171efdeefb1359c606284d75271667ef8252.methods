DNA constructs. The luciferase-reporter promoter construct pGL4-BST2pro was created by PCR-amplifying the BST-2 promoter sequence (SwitchGear Genomics library) using DNA extracted from HOS cells and by cloning its NheI/XhoI-digested fragment into pGL4.10[luc2] (Promega). Lentiviral plasmids, lenti dCAS-VP64_Blast (expressing dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain), lenti sgRNA(MS2)_zeo backbone (expressing sgRNA linked to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein-binding stem loop), and lenti MS2-P65-HSF1_Hygro (expressing MS2 fused to the NF-kB trans-activating subunit p65 with the activation domain from human heatshock factor 1 (HSF1)) 36 were obtained from F. Zhang, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, through Addgene (plasmid ID 61425, 61426, and 61427, respectively). Based on an online tool CHOPCHOP ver.2 52 that can detect the number of mismatches, specific sgRNA target sequences against BST-2 promoter were selected within 200 base pairs of the transcription start site previously mapped 38,53 by avoiding potential off-target sites with up to two mismatches (note that CRISPR-mediated control of promoter activity is highly sensitive to even a single www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ mismatch, probably due to a narrow window of target sequence 54, 55 ) . Six different oligonucleotides encoding the selected sgRNAs were individually inserted into the lenti sgRNA(MS2)_zeo backbone digested with BsmBI to generate the lentiviral sgRNA expression plasmids pLV-sgR-BST2pro-Zeo. The lentiviral packaging vector psPAX2, a vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G) expression plasmid pC-VSVg, HIV-1 Rev expression plasmid pCa-Rev, HIV-1 Tat expression plasmid pLTR-Tat, the HIV-1 proviral construct pNL4-3, its envelope glycoprotein (Env)-deficient HIV-1 proviral construct pNL-E(−), and Env/Vpu-deficient construct pNL-E(−)U(−), pCAGGS mammalian expression plasmid have previously been described elsewhere 56, 57 . The replication-competent Vpu-deficient HIV-1 construct pNL-U(−) was created by introducing a HpaI site at the vpu initiation codon of pNL4-3 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Cell maintenance. HEK293T, HeLa, HOS cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma). H9 human CD4-positive T-cells were maintained in RPMI (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Promoter assays. HeLa cells (7 × 10 4 ) were cotransfected in triplicate in a 96-well plate with 50 ng each of pGL4-BST2pro, lenti dCAS-VP64_Blast, lenti MS2-P65-HSF1_Hygro, and 100 ng of either pLV-sgR-BST-2pro-Zeo or an empty vector control using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of One-Glo Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was determined with a Centro LB960 (Berthold) luminometer. CRISPR lentiviral transduction. HEK293T cells (5 × 10 5 ) were cotransfected with 40 ng of pC-VSVg, 1 μg of psPAX2, and 1 μg of either lenti dCAS-VP64_Blast, lenti MS2-P65-HSF1_Hygro, or pLV-sgR-BST2pro-Zeo (#1 or #2), using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the supernatants were treated with 37.5 U ml −1 DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 37 °C for 30 min and then harvested, and the amount of p24 antigen was measured using an HIV-1 p24-antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (XpressBio). BST-2-negative HOS cells (4 × 10 5 ) or H9 cells (1 × 10 5 ) that lowly express BST-2, were transduced with 300 ng of each of the dCas9-VP64-expressing lentivirus and the MS2-p65-HSF1-expressing lentivirus. After 48 h, the transduced cells were cultured in the presence of blasticidin (10 μg ml −1 , Life Technologies) and hygromycin (300 μg ml −1 , Thermo Fisher) and were selected for 7 days. Cells stably expressing dCas9-VP64 together with MS2-p65-HSF1 were further transduced with the lentivirus expressing an empty sgRNA or an sgRNA against the BST-2 promoter (transduced cells were designated H9-sgCtrl or H9-sgBST2, respectively), and selected by zeocin (200 μg ml −1 , InvivoGen) for another 7 days. The resultant stable H9-sgBST2 cells were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. Immunoblotting assays. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5% n-octyl-β-D-glucoside, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell extracts were then subjected to gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with an anti-BST-2 mouse polyclonal antibody (Abnova). Reacted proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) and monitored using a LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm). Flow cytometry. HeLa or HOS cells were incubated with an anti-BST-2 polyclonal antibody 58 , followed by staining for 30 min on ice with an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed extensively with PBS plus 4% FBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using BD FACS Canto II, and the data were collected and analyzed with the BD FACS Diva Software. Immunofluorescence microscopy. HeLa or HOS cells were collagen-coated plated on 13-mm glass coverslips, and cultured for 3 h before fixation. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 10 min and immunostained with the anti-BST-2 polyclonal antibody 56 . Secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) was used at 5 μg ml −1 . DNA staining with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) was performed at 0.5 μg ml −1 . All immunofluorescence images were observed using Fluoview FV10i (Olympus). Virion production assays and transmission electron microscopy. HEK293T cells (5 × 10 5 ) were cotransfected with 1 μg of the proviral construct pNL-E(−), or pNL-E(−)U(−), together with 40 ng of pC-VSVg and 1 μg of the empty pCAGGS by using FuGENE 6. After 48 h the supernatants were harvested and subjected to p24-antigen capture ELISA. CRISPR-transduced HOS cells seeded at 5 × 10 4 cells were infected with 10 ng each of VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1. Sixteen hours later the cells were washed with PBS and 1 ml of fresh complete medium was added. For virion production assays, supernatants were harvested after 24 h and subjected to HIV-1 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ p24-antigen capture ELISA. For transmission electron microscopy, infected cells were harvested after 24 h with a cell scraper and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then prefixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon 812 (TAAB Laboratories). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then observed under a transmission electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi) at 80 kV. Replication assays. HEK293T cells (5 × 10 5 ) were cotransfected with 2 μg of the proviral construct pNL4-3, or pNL-U(−) by using FuGENE 6. After 48 h the supernatants were harvested and subjected to p24-antigen capture ELISA. H9-sgCtrl and H9-sgBST2 cells (1 × 10 5 ) were infected for 3 h with either wild-type or Vpu-defective viruses (0.1 ng of p24 antigen), washed extensively with serum-free medium and then cultured in fresh complete medium. Supernatants were sampled every 2 to 3 d, and p24 antigen production was quantified using ELISA.
