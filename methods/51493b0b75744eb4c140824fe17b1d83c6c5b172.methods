We conducted a retrospective, case-control study including all NH residents from December 27, 2014 , to January 20, 2015, considering that the incubation period for hMPV is 5-9 days. 25 The NH hosts 79 residents, in single or double rooms, on 3 floors in the same ward, with a common room for meals and activities. We considered every resident presenting at least 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom as a probable case of hMPV infection. Confirmed cases of hMPV infection were residents presenting 1 respiratory symptom or 1 constitutional symptom, with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for hMPV determined from a nasal swab. The controls were all the residents without any respiratory or constitutional symptoms, such that the entire resident population of the NH was included in this study. Nasal swabs from 4 symptomatic patients were tested locally by multiplex RT Following local recommendations, standard precautions to contain the outbreak were reinforced by droplet precautions since diagnosis of the first case. Information was also given to visitors. Droplet precautions in the NH consisted of isolation of probable or confirmed cases. Besides barrier measures, the following organizational measures were added: keeping the residents in their rooms, restrictions on visits, and use of masks for all residents when outside their bedrooms. For this study, data collected from electronic and paper medical records consisted of sociodemographic (age, gender, and activities of daily living [ADL] score) and medical (medical history, comorbidities, cognitive and nutritional status, dates of onset and end of the infectious period, outcome of illness, results of nasal swabs, coinfections, and vaccination status) data. For each resident, we calculated the modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics scores, developed and published by Linn et al in 1968 for the compilation and quantification of health problems in older adults. In addition, we recorded the number of drugs and the number of antibiotics for respiratory infections prescribed during the symptomatic phase. According to the French immunization schedule, an annual influenza vaccination is required for health care workers and NH residents; it is also recommended for regular visitors. Pneumococcal vaccination for at-risk NH residents is proposed at admission. In our health care setting, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were made by the same nurse after a physician had checked the absence of medical contraindications. Informed consent and approval from an institutional review board were not obtained because data were collected as part of a public health investigation. A report of grouped ARIs, defined as the onset of a cluster of at least 5 cases within 4 days among residents sharing the same living environment, was sent to the Agence Régionale de Santé, the French administrative regional health authority. A literature review from the Outbreak Database Website https:// www.outbreak-database.com/Home.aspx was used to compare this outbreak to previous ones. 26 Supplemental Table 1 and Table 3 summarize the reported outbreaks, first those in older adults with clinical descriptions for comparison (Supplemental Table 1 ), then in the general population from a public health point of view (Table 3 ). An epidemiologic curve was used to display the new symptomatic cases, as is usually done in the event of several grouped infectious cases. Cumulative incidence was estimated by a ratio including all declared confirmed and probable cases, divided by the number of residents in the nursing home during the infectious period. Sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities of residents are described by median (25th and 75th percentiles) and interquartile range (IQR) for quantitative variables, and the number and percentage for categorical variables. Groups were compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, and the Pearson chi-square test, or Fisher exact test as appropriate for categorical variables. The potential risk factors for infection were tested by a univariate analysis. Variables with a P value less than or equal to 0.2 in univariate analysis were selected for a multivariate analysis by a logistic regression, as well as the disease status for HMPV infection, as the main criterion of interest. For all of these tests, we used a significance level of 5%. Analyses were performed using Stata, version 12.0.
