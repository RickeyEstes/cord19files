To understand the current practices and standards for the development of RGs, we examined the methods and approaches presented in manuals produced by several guideline development organisations and in published RGs. We developed the protocol in April 2013 (Additional file 1: Appendix 1) and then conducted a systematic survey of published RGs and purposively sampled methods manuals from several organisations to describe current practices and standards for the development of RGs. We focused on identifying the rationale for development, methods and approaches used, as well as the overall quality of the guidelines.
