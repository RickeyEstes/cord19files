The eligibility criteria for inclusion was that studies should compare psychological or non-psychological outcomes in adult patients who are in infective isolation with those not isolated. Purely symptomatic/disease progression outcomes were not included, neither were those looking at those isolated due to immunosuppression. Studies not containing comparative data were also excluded. Information sources were Embase, Medline and Psychinfo, which were searched from inception until December 2018. Reference lists and Google Scholar were also handsearched. Full details of the search and PRISMA flow-chart together with excluded papers are given in the supplementary information. No protocol was published in advance. Where available raw data were extracted and entered into a spreadsheet, and depending upon the nature of the data either the relative risk or standardised mean difference calculated. Results were then presented as forest plots. All calculations and plots were produced using the meta package in R. [14, 15] Where raw data were not provided the summary results are given in the text but not the forest plots. Due to the variety of different settings and methods it was deemed that the methodological and clinical heterogeneity was too broad to pool results; in particular outcomes were measured in a variety of different ways.

This model assumes that the observed effect from each study is estimating a related but different true effect, allowing for between-study variation to be calculated in the form of heterogeneity statistics.

All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as Supplementary File 3. Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the risk ratio or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated. However, again there was wide variation between studies. Data on these outcomes are given in Figures 5 and 6 , and the non-clinically significant risks in the email, text and internet increased these. [53] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [54] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients. [55] Caring for patients in single-rooms does have many challenges, but there is evidence that these can be mitigated in a general population; [9] however the expanding literature on how this can be done in a general population does not necessarily apply  Protocol and registration 5 Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
