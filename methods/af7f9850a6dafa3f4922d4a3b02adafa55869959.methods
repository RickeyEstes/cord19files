The first BAL completed after AHSCT in patients over age 18 between January 2014 and July 2016 at the authors' institution were included. The decision to perform a BAL was at the discretion of the attending physician caring for the patient. BAL fluid was submitted for gram stain, bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, multiplex PCR, AGA, and cytopathology. This study was approved by Virginia Commonwealth University's Institutional Review Board. A positive BAL was defined by a positive culture, multiplex PCR, elevated AGA (optic density (OD) >0.49), and/or cytology (which includes detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii). A positive bacterial culture required species isolation, excluding coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and mixed respiratory flora. A positive fungal culture required the presence of fungal colonies, except non-cryptococcus yeast. The multiplex PCR used was the commercial kit BioFire FilmArray√í that can detect adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenzae A, influenzae B, parainfluenza (subtypes 1e4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) was diagnosed per guidelines [6] . A change in management was defined by escalation or de-escalation of antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals, adaptation of antifungals, or initiation of prednisone within 7 days after BAL since this is the time interval to obtain AGA results at the authors' institution. Deescalation was defined as cessation of one or multiple agents, conversion to oral therapy, or transition to a more narrow spectrum. Escalation was defined as adding a new antimicrobial agent or transitioning to a broader spectrum. Fungal adaptation was a transition to an alternative agent within the same class of antifungals. Antimicrobial use within 7 days of BAL was considered prior therapy. AHSCT was performed on the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at the authors' institution. The conditioning regimen, immunosuppressive, and supportive therapies followed internationally accepted protocols. Levofloxacin and fluconazole were used as anti-infective prophylaxis and prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia were used according to guidelines [7] . A descriptive analysis performed using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables due to nonnormal distributions and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. We used a Fisher's exact test to compare categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analysis was performed using JMP Pro 12 [SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA].
