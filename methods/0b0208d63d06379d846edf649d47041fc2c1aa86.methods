We conducted two population-based surveys in an urban area of Guangdong province (Guangzhou, capital city of the province) in southern China, and another two surveys in Zijin County, a rural area in the same province, covering both the spring 2013 epidemic and the winter 2013-14 epidemic of H7N9. Considering the feasibility and generalizability of the study, we used mobile phone surveys in Guangzhou and door-to-door surveys in Zijin [7] . We investigated human exposure to live poultry or LPMs, risk perception, psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak, and attitudes towards the control of H7N9 through LPM closure using a structured survey instrument [7] [8] [9] . Telephone surveys were conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system, which enabled random generation of mobile telephone numbers and systematic data collection in the city. A later call was arranged if the subject was not currently available. Unanswered calls were repeated up to 4 times at different times of the week before being GM088558), the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Disease, Food and Health Bureau, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (grant no.

First, we classified towns in the county into three categories according to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in that town: high (3 rd tertile among all towns in that county), middle (2 nd tertile) and low (1 st tertile) economic levels based on the 2010 National Census, and randomly selected one town from each category. Second, two villages from each town and then 50 households from each village were randomly selected. Finally one adult who met the inclusion criteria of the study, i.e. at age of 18 years or older and living in the village for at least 1 year was selected for interview from the household. All subjects were recruited after verbal consent was obtained. In both locations, eligible participants were aged 18y and resident in the respective location for at least one year. We collected data from urban and rural residents on exposure to live poultry or LPMs, level of anxiety, psychological and behavioral changes in response to the H7N9, and attitudes towards control interventions on the H7N9 epidemic. Most instruments were measured by Likert-scale responses. Measurement of exposure to live poultry in the questionnaire was different for urban and rural subjects because urban residents were mainly exposed to live poultry through visiting LPMs while backyard poultry was frequently seen in rural households and LPMs were less common in rural areas. Demographic characteristics were analyzed for each survey and compared with chi-squared tests. Population levels of anxiety, exposure to live poultry or LPMs, perceived risk of infection with H7N9, perceived severity of H7N9, behavioral responses to H7N9, and attitudes towards LPM closure were compared between the first and second waves for urban and rural subjects weighted by age and sex of the population distribution derived from the 2010 National Census in China. Multivariate regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with the observed differences between surveys and locations in LPM visits, contact with live poultry, perceived risk of H7N9 infection, worries towards infection, preventive measures adopted and attitudes towards LPM closure as a effective intervention to control H7N9 epidemics. Statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.0.2.
