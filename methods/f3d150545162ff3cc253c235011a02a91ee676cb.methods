Setting ESCAPED was a multicenter, prospective, interventional study, entitled "Early Thoracic CT-Scan for Community-Acquired Pneumonia at the Emergency Department (ESCAPED)" [11] , conducted from November 2011 to January 2013, in four emergency departments (EDs) of four tertiary teaching hospitals in Paris, France, designed to measure the impact of thoracic CT scan on clinical decision. The study was sponsored and monitored by the Paris public health hospitals, and funded by the French Ministry of Health. The French health authorities (Agence nationale de sécurité des medicaments et produits de santé, ANSM) and the institutional review board for the protection of human subjects approved the study protocol and patient informed consent procedures. All enrolled patients provided written informed consent for inclusion. The protocol was registered in the clinicaltrial.gov website under the PACSCAN acronym, the French translation of the English ESCAPED acronym (NCT01574066). The Ethics Committee of Ile de France (Comité de Protection des Personnes. Paris N°2 011-oct-12749) approved the study protocol.
