We performed this analysis using the Outbreak Database, the worldwide database of health careeassociated outbreaks (http://www.outbreak-database.com). This freely accessible database was created to support outbreak investigation in medical institutions. We carried out the database search for this review on January 10, 2012. To investigate the reported outbreaks, we made queries through the "advance search" function using the keyword "newborn" in the "outbreak/setting/age" field and the keyword "virus" in the "outbreak/microorganisms/microorganism/name" field. Items studied included causative pathogens, types of infection, sources of the outbreaks, and measures taken to stop the outbreaks.
