Data collection. We retrieved tweets' IDs via web scraping and then used Twitter Search Application Programming Interface to download the tweet's meta-data to a server at Athens, Georgia, USA. Details of our data retrieval methods can be found in the Online Supplementary Materials. Analysis of #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns data sets. Descriptive statistics was reported, and the respective 10 most frequent Twitter users (Twitter handles) and URL links of the #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns corpora were identified. Univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression models were applied to the two corpora to test if the three variables of interest (hashtag count, mention count, URL count) were associated with retweet frequency, after controlling for four confounders (users' followers count, friends' count, status count, and favorite count.) Analysis by cycle. Each corpus was sub-set into cycles (#CDCGrandRounds: n = 58, #VitalSigns: n = 42). We designated each cycle chronologically starting from '1'. For the #CDCGrandRounds corpus, a cycle was defined as all tweets referring to the specified topic of the specific Public Health Grand Round event. Because CDC might promote a Public Health Grand Round event ahead of time, and tweets might continue to be retweeted after the next event, there was no clear definition for when each cycle started and ended. The dates were obtained by manually reading and grouping the tweets by similar content. Tweets that fell within a cycle corpus but were unrelated to the topic were excluded. The first cycle in the #CDCGrandRounds corpus was 'Newborn Screening: Improving Outcomes' in August 2011, and our data set ended with the cycle on 'Changes in Clinical Diagnostics and Tracking Infectious Diseases' in October 2016. For the #VitalSigns corpus, a cycle was defined as the first day of the publication release, which was the first Tuesday of each month, until the day before the next publication was released. Any tweets that were not related to the assigned Vital Sign publication were excluded. Our #VitalSigns corpus began with the March 2013 cycle, 'Making Health Care Safer -Stop Infections from Lethal CRE Germs Now' and ended with the October 2016 cycle on 'Dental Sealants Prevent Cavities'. Manual coding was then performed on the top 30 most influential tweets, defined as the 30 tweets with the highest number of retweets for each cycle. These were identified in each cycle and manually coded as either containing a form of visual cues (as '1') or not (as '0'). 'Visual cues' here was defined as a still image or a video. Univariable negative binomial regression models were applied to the sub-corpus of each cycle to compute the prevalence ratio (PR) of retweet frequency between tweets with and without visual cues. Multivariable regression models were not applied because of the small sample size of 30 manually coded tweets of each cycle. Statistical language. R, version 3.3.1 [20] , was used via RStudio, version 0.99.903 [21] to perform all analyses. Ethics statement. This project was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Georgia Southern University (H15083) and was determined to be exempt from full review under the exemption category B2. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of both corpora of #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns tweets. We found that 99% of #CDCGrandRounds tweets and 89% of #VitalSigns tweets were categorized as English by Twitter ( Table 1 ). In the #CDCGrandRounds corpus, the top 10 users were all CDC users and the top three URL domains were CDC, Twitter, and YouTube ( Table 2 ). In the #Vital-Signs corpus, @CDCgov and @DrFriedenCDC ranked top number 3 and 5 users respectively and there were 2,058 (18.49% of 11,129) URL links directed to CDC's domain (www.cdc.gov). URL links from Twitter and Instagram were top number 1 and 5 respectively. The @RedneckJournal and @Pirate_journal were the top two Twitter users who posted #VitalSigns tweets and the frequencies of URL links directed to their domains ranked third and fourth respectively.
