Nonvaccine ARD interventions that have been used or considered were identified through communication with senior military preventive medicine officials and the study of peerreviewed literature, military medicine textbooks, and other reports. 15 Reviews focused on population-based studies in communities, as opposed to healthcare settings. Studies that examined other outcomes (e.g., gastrointestinal diseases), were not population-based, were in a healthcare setting, or were not in a final report form or available through DTIC, were excluded from this study. However, some excluded references served as secondary sources of information and are mentioned in the discussion section of this paper. Existing scientific data, applicability, feasibility, and economic impact were considered for selected NOVARDIs. Recommendations were categorized using a modified classification system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (CDC/HICPAC). 16
