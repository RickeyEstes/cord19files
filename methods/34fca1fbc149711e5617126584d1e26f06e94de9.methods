Sampling and specimen preparation. For all capturing, sampling and exportation of small mammal specimens, permission was obtained from the respective countries' authorities. Bats and rodents were identified by trained field biologists. Fresh bat droppings were collected on plastic film below roost sites 12 . Additionally, bats were caught with mist nets at roost or foraging sites, kept separately in bags until individual examination. Sampling relied on faecal pellets produced in bags, vein puncture for serum samples and mouth swabs. For organ samples, bats were euthanised with ketamine and dissected immediately. Rodents were caught with live traps or snap traps, euthanised and dissected. For faecal specimens, ca. 100 mg of faeces was suspended in 500 µl of RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) immediately after collection. Suspensions were homogenised by vortexing, and 50 µl were suspended into 560 µl of buffer AVL from the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) and processed further according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For blood or serum samples, up to 140 µl (depending on the available quantity) were extracted. For solid organs, approximately 30 mg of tissue were homogenised in a TissueLyser (Qiagen) or a ball-mill tissue grinder (Genogrinder 2000, Spex Centripep), followed by extraction of RNA using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) or the ABI PRISM 6100 Nucleic Acid PrepStation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Elution volumes were generally 50 µl for serum/blood and faecal specimens, and 100 µl for tissue specimens. RNA specimens were subjected to molecular screening for PVs using a panel of oligonucleotides and RT-PCR assays listed in Supplementary Tables S9 and S10. Supplementary  Tables S9 and S10 . Virus quantification was done as described previously 55 . Briefly, amplicons from initial nested RT-PCR screening assays were TA-cloned (Invitrogen), plasmids purified and re-amplified with vector-specific oligonucleotides, and finally in vitro transcribed using the T7 promotor-based Megascript kit (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Further details are available upon request from the authors. Next-generation sequencing. Products of random cDNA amplification were loaded on 1.2% agarose gels. Primer dimers and large fragments ( > 700 bp) were removed, and amplicons were extracted from agarose gels. Fragments were endrepaired and a 454 sequencing library was constructed according to the GS Junior Rapid Library Preparation protocol (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Emulsion PCR and sequencing reaction were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Primer sequences were trimmed from each read, and all reads were aligned against the NCBI virus database using the tblastx local alignment algorithm in Geneious. All hits were scored and alignments with lengths less than 50 amino acids and a bit-score less than 40 were excluded. Serological assays. Reactivity of human mumps virus with sera from different insectivorous and frugivorous bats was tested using mumps virus (strain Jones)infected cells (Euroimmun EU38, Lubeck, Germany). Prototype PVs used for comparison included measles virus (strain Edmonston), RSV (RSV B Wash/18537/'62 (CH 18537)), parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1, strain Sendai CPJ-3 13) and PIV2 (EU 18/9, strain Greer). Bat sera were diluted 1/40 and detection was done using first a goat anti-bat immunoglobulin (Ig) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) followed by a donkey anti-goat Ig conjugated to cyanine 3 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Pictures were taken with a Motic fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). NiV indirect immunofluorescence was performed with NiV-infected Vero cells and a strain isolated from human brain tissue (kindly provided to AM by Jane Cardosa, Malaysia). Bat serum was diluted 1/10 and 1/40, and detection was done with the goat anti-bat Ig (Bethyl Laboratories) used for mumps immunofluorescence, followed by an Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). A guinea pig anti-NiV serum was used as a positive control, followed by an Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-guinea pig IgG. Serum chemistry. A total of 119 native sera from E. helvum bats were analysed on a Dimension Vista automated analyzer (Siemens, Munich, Germany). The number (a) Patristic distances within PV genera detected per ordinal host categories (amino acid-based). Blue and orange colours represent diversification before and after inclusion of novel viruses from this study. (b) summary of average host switches over ca. 10,000 trees as modelled by parsimony ancestral state reconstruction in mesquite. symbols on the x axis depict donor (large symbols) and recipient hosts in the level of ordinal mammalian categories (bats, rodents, primates, carnivores, cetartiodactyls) and birds. Before the analysis, the rabies virus outgroup was removed, because this lyssavirus would have to be mapped to a bat host, biasing host state reconstruction for the root of the PV tree toward bats. Four single PV were removed because they were the only available PV in their particular host species (salmon, snake, dolphin, tupaia). (c) summary of results from hypothesis testing using maximum likelihood (mL) ancestral state reconstruction in Bayestraits 34 . After analysis of 1,000 mL bootstrap trees, the trait change model was restricted by one of the ten criteria listed, and the resulting average likelihood of the restricted model was compared with that of the unrestricted model. The list shows the factor (n-fold) by which each restricted model was less likely than the unrestricted model (averaged over 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the underlying mL tree). Phylogenetic analyses. Nucleic acid alignments based on amino acid code were done in Mega4 (www.megasoftware.net). Gap-free coding nucleotide sequence alignments were generated containing the novel viruses as well as reference strains, using the complete deletion option in which any site containing gaps was deleted from the data set (see Supplementary Table S3 for a list of all reference strains with isolation years, host and GenBank accession number). The data set used for inference of Paramyxovviridae phylogenies comprised 559 nucleotide (nt). An additional analysis was done for only those rubulaviruses for which only a shorter 217 nt fragment could be amplified (see Fig. 2a , note that Supplementary Fig. S1 includes only rubulaviruses with complete 559 nt coverage). Bayesian phylogenies were calculated with MrBayes V3.2 56 using amino acid sequences (WAG + G model) and nucleotide sequences (GTR + I + G model). Both analyses yielded identical topologies ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Convergence of chains was confirmed by the PSRF statistic in MrBayes 57 , as well as by visual inspection of individual traces using TRACER from the BEAST package 58 . Outgroups were Rabies virus (GenBank, NC_001542) for phylogenies, including the complete family Paramyxoviridae, Newcastle Disease virus for phylogenies of the genus Rubulavirus (GenBank, NC_002617) and Human Parainfluenzavirus 1 (GenBank, NC_003461) for the genera Henipa-and Morbillivirus. In parallel to the Bayesian analyses, maximum likelihood algorithms (WAG + G substitution model, 5 gamma categories and 1,000 bootstrap replicates) were applied using PhyML V3.0 59 . Trees were visualised with FigTree V1.3.1 from the BEAST package 58 . Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 . Supplementary Fig. S6 summarises the numbers of GenBank entries of PV by ordinal host groups. Threshold amino acid distance values for classifying phylogenetic branches were estimated by comparing the maximum amino acid distances within and between established PV species in the corresponding sequence fragments. Measles virus, mumps virus and RSV were selected to determine the maximum within-species distances per fragment, based on their good coverage in sequence databases. Maximum amino acid diversity within all publicly available mumps virus sequences was 1.6% in the translated 559 nt fragment, 5.4% for measles virus and 6.1% for RSV. For comparison, the amino acid divergence between the species HeV and NiV ranged from 7.0 to 7.5% in this fragment. Only taxa exceeding 7.0% amino acid distance were therefore counted as separate viruses.
