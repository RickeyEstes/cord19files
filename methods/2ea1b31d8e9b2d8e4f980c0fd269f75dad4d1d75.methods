This was a cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire conducted between February and June 2014. The questionnaire was composed of two instruments that were adapted to be consistent with the context of primary care settings. This was done because all the instruments in the literature were designed and worded according to a hospital setting. The first instrument was developed by expert groups from the World Health Organization as a knowledge and perception questionnaire (12) . The second one was adapted because of its wider contextual factors compared with the WHO instrument, such as the social support and norms that could influence the attitudes of HCWs toward hand hygiene practice (13) . Questions related to hospital settings, such as questions about hospital bed contact and peripheral catheter insertion, were excluded. Additional questions were included to gather participants characteristics ( Table 1) . The questionnaire was accompanied by an information sheet explaining the objectives of the study. It was administered in English, without any translation. Two experts in the field of infection control assessed content and face validity of the modified questionnaire. The tool was pilot tested through 30 interviews (not including the sample) to ensure clarity of questions and to eliminate ambiguity. In the knowledge section, the total score was calculated by adding up 28 questions assessing the participant's knowledge, and each correct answer was awarded with 1 point and unanswered questions and wrong answers were awarded 0 points. The maximum achievable score was 28. In the attitude section, all items (nine questions) were scored on a 5-point scale: 1 (fully agree) to 5 (fully disagree), with a maximum score of 45. In the practice section, answers were reported on either ''Yes'' or ''No'' options (two questions) or a 5-point numeric scale (four questions), ranging from 0 to 100%. The study was conducted in primary care settings located in the central region of Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the service of King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). Participants were included if they were physicians or nurses working in the targeted primary care centers. Based on the published literature we used a precision estimate of 10% and anticipated hand hygiene knowledge of 50% (the most conservative value). Using a 95% confidence interval, 277 completed survey forms would be sufficient to accurately assess knowledge, attitude and practice about hand hygiene. Assuming a response rate of 70% and a completion rate of 80%, 400 questionnaires were distributed. 100 participants from each of the four primary care centers were randomly selected using electronic random number generator. The questionnaires were sent in sealed envelopes and placed in pigeonholes of the randomly selected participants in each practice. Data were entered into SPSS v.20 by a professional data entry clerk and revised and cleaned by another clerk. The data were then analyzed using IBM SPSS software (v.20). Categorical variables were described using frequency and percentages. Continuous variables were summarized using mean9standard deviation. Chi-square test was used for comparing proportions. Student t-test/ANOVA was used for comparing means. Statistical significance was set to 0.05 or less and a confidence interval of 95%.
