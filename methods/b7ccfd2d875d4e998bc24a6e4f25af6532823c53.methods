The authors developed the questions for this study. All members of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. (APIC) who were registered for the 2006 National APIC conference were invited to participate in the focus groups, regardless of age, race, gender, or work location (within or outside the United States). The only inclusion criteria were attendance at the 2006 APIC conference and participation in a disaster response in the past. The authors recruited potential participants via phone calls and e-mail. One focus group met each day in a meeting room located in a hotel near the conference site on June 11, 12, and 13, 2006. A meal was provided to the participants as an incentive for their participation. The Nominal Group Method was used to elicit information on the topics of interest. 3 The focus group method of using opening-ended questions was used to elicit details from participants' experience with disaster response as to why those categories were chosen and lessons learned from past disasters. 4 Participants were informed that information collected would remain anonymous and that all responses were voluntary. Focus group sessions were audiotaped, and the tapes were transcribed verbatim. Content analysis included identifying, coding, and categorizing participants' response to the questions of interest. In addition, major themes that emerged were identified and categorized. Quotations that characterize the major themes are reported. The words enclosed in brackets of the quotations are used to explain the respondents' quotes and are not the participants' words. Subjects' demographic data were obtained for descriptive statistics. The institutional review boards of St. Louis University, National Naval Medical Center, and University of Louisville approved this study. APIC Headquarters funded the costs of the focus groups and audiotape transcription.
