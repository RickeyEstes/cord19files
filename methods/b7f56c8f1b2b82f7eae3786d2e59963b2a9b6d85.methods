Potential drivers for disease emergence were identified from literature and from discussions with national and international experts in MERS-CoV. The final list had the following categories: economic development; human demography and behavior; international travel, commerce, sports and leisure; political environment; agriculture and food industry change, including camel demography, husbandry and movement; changes in climate and land use. Data from 1980 onwards were collected from national and international databases. If multiple data sources were available, data from both sources were collected. All data were entered in an excel datasheet and reviewed and discussed with the project team (Supplementary 1). Qualitative information and remaining data gaps were addressed by interviews with a group of 15 experts and stakeholders from Qatar. Criteria to select experts included 5 years or more experience in a camel-related business (farming, trading and racing) or professional services related to camels and being familiar with cultural aspects of the Qatari community. Using a structured interview guide (Supplementary 2) and a moderator, a series of 4 interviews were conducted in Arabic, each lasting approximately for 3 hours. The main themes that were covered during the interviews included: (changes in) people's living conditions; customs and purposes of camel ownership; cultural habits related to camels; educational level and personal behaviors of camel owners and workers; camel movement; demographic distribution of camels in Qatar; camel farming practices: feeding, grazing, and slaughter. A detailed transcript was shared with the experts for authentication. A literature search was done to complement findings from the quantitative and qualitative study, using PubMed, Google Scholar and the local sources of information including the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME), Ministry of Development and Planning Statistics (MDPS), and Qatar Statistical Authority (QSA). The funder had no role in study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the review.
