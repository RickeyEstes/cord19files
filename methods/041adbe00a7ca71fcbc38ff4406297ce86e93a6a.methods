A descriptive study was conducted by using 2009 and 2010 secondary data, considering cases reported to the Brazilian Information System on Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), module pandemic influenza. The definitions of confirmed and discharged cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by influenza as per the directives of the MoH were taken into consideration 1,6 . During the containment phase, Brazil adopted the following case definition for surveillance purposes: fever, cough, and close contact with an infected person or a history of traveling to countries with documented cases within the 10 previous days. In the sustained transmission phase in the country, as of the EW 28/2009, the case definition was changed, and only severe cases, presenting fever, cough, respiratory distress or death were reported. Laboratory investigations were restricted to cases of severe influenza 9 . A copy of the databases was requested to the MoH. Subsequently, the databases were submitted to the duplicity verification process by using the software RecLink III® (http://reclink.sourceforge.net/). When the duplicities were identified, the registrations with the oldest notification dates were kept 10 . It was decided that, if the notification dates were the same, the registration with the most recent closing date would be kept, considering that the case had a greater chance of having a better investigation for its closing. The registrations that did not have the required data filled were excluded from the proportions calculation. Frequencies and proportional distributions of reported cases were presented. When appropriate, the odds ratio of exposure and the 95% confidence interval were calculated. The population data were provided by the 2000-2012 estimates used in the publication "Saúde no Brasil [Health in Brazil] -2012", according to the age group and gender. This information was made available by DATASUS, and was taken into consideration for the cumulative incidence calculation 11 . For the cumulative incidence in pregnant women, the estimate of the number of pregnant women at the time, calculated as the number of live births in the previous year plus 10%, was considered in the denominator 12, 13 .
