Plasmid, C. difficile culture, cell lines The pTRKH2 plasmid [11] , a high-copy-number E. coli-L. lactis shuttle vector, was kindly provided by Klanenhammer TR (Department of Food Science, North Carolina State University). C. difficile VPI10463 was purchased from Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products (Lanzhou, China). The pathogen was cultured in Brain-Heart Infusion medium (BHI) (Difco) containing 5 mg/ml yeast extract and 0.1% L-cysteine at 37°C for 72 h in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). CHO-K1 and T84 cells were purchased from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). The two cell lines were respectively cultured in F12 and DMEM-F12 media (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a CO 2 incubator (5% CO 2 , saturated humidity). Preparation of recombinant L. lactis live vaccine and C. difficile spore suspension Recombinant L. lactis live vaccine was prepared using the shuttle vector pTRKH2 as previously reported by Yang et al. [12, 13] . A slight modification was that the nontoxic tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC) was inserted to the L. lactis expression system as a biological adjuvant. That is, L. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the secretory signal peptide SPUsp45, nontoxic adjuvanted TETC, and 14 of the 38 C-terminal repeats (14CDTA) of TcdA; and L. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying SPUsp45, TETC, 14CDTA, and the cell wallanchored sequence cwaM6. L. lactis cell suspension (5 × 10 9 CFU/ml) was prepared in 0.2M sodium bicarbonate containing 5% casein hydrolyzate and 0.5% glucose. C. difficile was induced on BHIS agar as described previously [14] . Briefly, the overnight culture broth of C. difficile in BHIS medium was diluted in fresh BHIS medium to an optical density (OD, 600 nm) of 0.2. Then, 150 ml of diluted culture suspension was spread on 5 ml of BHIS agar dispensed in each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish, followed by anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 4-7 d. To examine the colony formation from C. difficile spores, samples were taken from the plates containing a mixture of spores and vegetative cells and then resuspended in BHIS medium. The suspension was heated to 60°C for 20 min to kill vegetative cells and then cooled, diluted and plated onto BHIS medium. For use in germination assays, C. difficile spores were purified using the method of Akoachere et al. [15] withminor modifications. The spore-vegetative cell mixture was harvested by flooding each well of the 6-well dish with ice-cold sterile water. After 5 washes with ice-cold water, the mixture of spores and vegetative cells were resuspended in 20%w/v HistoDenz (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), layered onto a 50%w/v HistoDenz solution in a centrifuge tube, and then centrifuged at 15,0007× g for 15 min to separate spores from vegetative cells. The purified spores, collected at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, were washed twice with ice-cold water to remove traces of HistoDenz and then resuspended in distilled water.
