Protein sequences were downloaded from the NCBI web site: CAD36433 for HIV p24 protein (strain OOTCD in Chad), AAT12058 for influenza virus matrix protein (duck/Shanghai/H5N1), AAP41037 for SARS-CoV S protein (strain Tor2 in Canada), AAP41041 for SARS-CoV M protein, and P59595 for SARS-CoV N protein. The epitope prediction methods used here include: (1) ANNPred based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Lata et al., 2007) (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nhlapred/neural.html), (2) ComPred based on combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Quantitative Matrices (QM) (Lata et al., 2007) (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nhlapred/comp.html), (3) BIMAS (BioInformatics & Molecular Analysis Section) based on quantitative matrix (Parker et al., 1994) (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/hla bind/). (4) CTLPred based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), quantitative matrix (QM) and support vector machine (SVM) (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004) (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/ctlpred/index.html), (Peters et al., 2003) (http://zlab.bu.edu/SMM/), (11) SVMHC based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Donnes and Elofsson, 2002) (http://www.sbc.su.se/svmhc/new.cgi), (12) SYFPEITHI based on peptide binding motif (Rammensee et al., 1999) (http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/kxi/). The HLA-A2/A0201restricted 9-residue epitopes of each protein were predicted by the above 12 methods. For each method and each protein we selected the top 20 predicted peptides, and the peptides identified by at least 4 methods were used for further analysis. The tertiary structure of selected peptides was predicted using the PEPstr server (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/pepstr/). The molecular docking algorithm based on shape complementarity principles PatchDock (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2003 ) was used to model the interactions of the peptide with MHC and TCR molecules. The 3D coordinates of MHC (HLA-A0201) and TCR were downloaded from the Protein Database Bank (PDB ID: 1AO7). For the peptides obtained above, firstly, we dock the peptide into MHC molecule and extract top 60 conformations of MHCpeptide complexes. We consider those conformations similar to the native complex 1AO7, i.e. the peptide is docked into the peptidebinding groove with the same orientation as the native peptide in 1AO7 complex (the first amino acid (P1) of peptide is oriented towards C terminus of MHC molecule (residues 181-274)). The binding free energy score of each conformation is predicted by the Dcomplex program (Liu et al., 2004) . Then from these conformations we select a conformation with the minimum binding free energy score as the theoretical model of peptide-MHC complex. Subsequently peptide-MHC complex is docked onto the TCR molecule using PatchDock. Similarly, we extract top 60 conformations of complex and take those conformations similar to the native complex 1AO7, in which the peptide interacts both with the TCR ␣ chain and TCR ␤ chain, the binding free energy scores of the two chains with the peptide are predicted by Dcomplex program. From these conformations we select the conformation that basically has the minimum binding free energy scores for the peptide with both chains, such a conformation is considered as the theoretical model of peptide-MHC-TCR complex. The visualization of all 3D structures was done in PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).
