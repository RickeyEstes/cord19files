Retrospectively and prospectively collected data from adult patients admitted to the Division of Critical Care (Mixed-24 bed ICU) of the Hospital de Base de São José do Rio Preto were analyzed. Data were collected between May 2009 and December 2010 from patients with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by the influenza A virus H1N1 (H1N1). This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee and informed consent was waived due to its observational nature. The infection with influenza A H1N1 was diagnosed using the real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal secretion or respiratory tract specimens. Severe pneumonia caused by influenza A H1N1 was defined in the presence of fever >38°C, cough and clinical, laboratory and radiological conditions compatible with pneumonia and signs of worsening of the disease, which included the following: tachypnea (respiratory rate >25), hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation -SaO 2 ≤92% at room air and ≤94% in pregnant women), cyanosis, oliguria, altered level of consciousness, worsening of chronic disease and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) or the use of vasopressor drugs (dopamine >5 µg/kg/minute or any dose of norepinephrine). (11, 12) H1N1 patients were matched at a 2:1 ratio with cases of severe CAP admitted to the ICU. Thus, the data used for comparison came from consecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU with severe CAP during the same period and for whom the diagnosis of influenza A H1N1 had not been cogitated or the RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal or respiratory tract specimens were negative. Severe CAP requiring ICU admission was characterized by the presence of one major severity criteria (the need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors) or two minor criteria (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or mean blood pressure <70 mmHg, arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen [PO 2 /FiO 2 ] <250, respiratory rate ≥30/minute, urea >19.6 mg/dL, altered mental status, multilobar pneumonia, platelets <100,000 cells/mm 3 , leukopenia -≤4 x 10 9 or hypothermia [body temperature ≤36°C]).
