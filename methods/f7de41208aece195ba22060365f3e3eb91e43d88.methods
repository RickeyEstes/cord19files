Pens, camels, personnel, and infection control. A camel research farm was set up 100 km from Riyadh city, remote from urban areas, with double fences and a secured gate. Inside this farm, three metal pens were set up with 30 m 2 in size. Each pen is 150 cm height and has an infection control entry and exit points 10 m away from each other and from the pen. Two surveillance cameras were installed for each pen. Food and water troughs were placed inside each pen, where they can be filled from outside without entering the pens, supplementary file shows the farm layout. Nineteen seronegative camel calves (negative by ELISA), were sourced and purchased from Jouf province, north of Saudi Arabia, and transported for more than a 1000 km, using disinfected lorries, to the research farm. Additional ten seropositive and MERS-CoV RT-PCR negative camel calves were purchased from a camel market in Riyadh. Ten seronegative and seropositive calves were used in the main study whereas the remaining nine seronegative calves were used in a small follow up study to determine the age effect. Additional ten actively MERS-CoV shedding/infected camels (positive by RT-PCR; Ct value below 30) were purchased from local markets and co-housed with the experimental calves in one pen to serve as a natural infection model of challenge. Overall, a separate pen was used for each of the two studies and the third pen was only briefly used to gather infectious viral shedding camels one day before the challenge. All camels were labelled with paint as well as digital microchips; these two labels were used for the samples to ensure accuracy. Pen keepers, veterinarians, and drivers were trained for infection control practices including fit-test for N95 masks. Each worker used their own specific N95 mask, overall white gown, goggles, head cover, shoe cover, all of which disposable and used once only. The team adhered to utilising the entry and exit point of each pen to ensure infection control; each pen, donning, and doffing area has biohazard waste container, sharp biohazard containers, 70% Ethanol spray and virucidal ANIOSpray (Laboratoires Anios, France) used by the workers. All staff involved in the study were also screened and confirmed MERS-CoV negative by ELISA and PCR prior to, during, and at the end of the study. Biowaste was collected daily and sent for incineration by the Saudi Gulf Environmental Protection Company (SEPCO). Clean sand from a nearby dunes area was used as pen floors, and new sand were added every 3 months. Pesticide was sprayed over the pen floors before starting the study or when new sand is added. The research farm and pens were monitored by surveillance camera to ensure strict adherence to infection control measures and to ensure camels are not exposed to any stray animals (e.g. fox, dogs). Some photographs of this study are included in the supplementary file. Vaccine, vaccination and sample collection. The ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine candidate and ChAdOx1-eGFP vector control were produced by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, UK as previously described 30 . The vaccine and the vector control were transferred in a cold-chain delivery to KAIMRC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They were thawed on ice once for dose preparation and a second time for a few minutes just before injections. Single doses of 1 × 10 9 Infectious Unit (IU) of either the vaccine or the vector control in 1 ml PBS per camel were given intramuscularly into the thigh muscle. In the camel control groups of our studies (groups −C, +C, and AG01), camels were either immunised with ChAdOx1-eGFP (vector control) or PBS (placebo control). Blood samples were collected at different d.p.i. and transferred to the lab in portable refrigerators. For serum, 10 ml blood from each camel was collected at each time point. Blood was left to clot for 1 hr at 4 °C then spun at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and serum was collected, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until testing. Nasal swabs from camels were collected in virus transport media (VTM) and stored at −80 °C until testing. ELISA. Serum samples were screened by ELISA using camel MERS-CoV EUROIMMUN ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Readouts were reported as the ratio of sample optometric density (OD) over the OD of an internal calibrator. Ratios of ≥1.1 and 0.8-1.1 were assigned as positive and borderline, respectively. Positive and negative controls provided with the kit were always included in each run. Endpoint titres of serum Abs were also determined using an in-house indirect ELISA as previously described 43, 44 . Briefly, 96-well Nunc ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific, USA) coated with 50 μl/well of 1 μg/ml of recombinant S1 protein (IVI, Seoul, Korea) overnight, were washed and blocked for 1 h. Then, 50 μl/well from each serum sample was added in duplicates in a 3-fold serial dilution starting from a 1:100. After 1 h of incubation, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-llama IgG (Agrisera, USA) were added at 1:3000 dilution. Finally, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (pNPP) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) was used for colour development and the OD was measured at 405 nm. The endpoint titre for each tested serum was determined as the reciprocal value of the serum dilution with OD value converging with the cut-off determined as the average OD of a seronegative camel serum plus 3 SD as described previously. The fold increase in Ab titres was calculated by dividing titres from each time point over the titre of the same camel on day 0, pre-vaccination titre (0 d.p.i.). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ MERS pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) neutralisation assay. MERS pseudotyped viral particles (MERSpp) were produced and titrated using Huh7.5 cells as described previously 45 . Heat-inactivated camel serum samples and nasal swab in VTM were prepared in a 3-fold serial dilution starting from 1:20, and tested for nAbs in duplicate as described previously 45 . A standard concentration of MERSpp (equivalent to 200,000 RLU) and Huh7.5 cells (10,000 cells) were added to each well. Cells only and cells with MERSpp only (both without serum) were included in quadruplicate as controls to determine 100% and 0% neutralisation activity, respectively. Following 48 h incubation, cells were lysed and the assay was developed using Bright-Glo ™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega, USA) and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. IC 50 neutralisation titres (in Log10) were calculated for each serum sample using GraphPad Prism. Experiments were performed twice independently. The background signal values of non-specific neutralisiation in sera from seronegative camels, pre-vaccination (samples of group -C at 0 d.p.i), were subtracted from all values of all samples (group -V, +C, and +V as well as from -C). Virus neutralisation assay (VNA). A virus neutralisation assay was performed as previously described and the induction of virus nAbs was confirmed according to previously published protocols 30, 46 . Briefly, heat-inactivated camel serum samples were tested for their capacity to neutralise MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 isolate) infections in vitro with nAb titre determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that completely protected Huh-7 cells in all tested wells (MN 100 ). Nasal discharge scoring. As an arbitrary measure to evaluate camel MERS infections, nasal discharges from camels in all groups were observed daily and were given a score for the discharge abundance and severity; a score of 0 (for normal and healthy looking camel), 0.25 (if a camel had recovered from nasal discharge but with little remaining dry discharge), 1 (mild nasal secretion), 2 (moderate nasal secretion), and 3 (severe nasal secretion). Two vets were assigned to document the scores, also utilising camel nasal photographs taken in the first three days post challenge.
