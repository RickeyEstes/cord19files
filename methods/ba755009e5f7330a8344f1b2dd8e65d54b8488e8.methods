Sampling and testing of diarrhea-associated viruses Table 1 ). The intestinal samples used in this study were obtained from the dead piglets and the fecal samples were non-invasively collected immediately after excretion from diarrheal pigs from premises by veterinarians in these farms and then submitted to our laboratory. Total RNA was extracted using RNAplus Reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, first strand cDNA was synthesized by random hexamer primers. The previously established PCR protocols were used to test four major diarrhea-associated viruses, PEDV, PDCoV, TGEV, and PoRV (22) . The newly emerged SADS-CoV was tested by a method previously established in our laboratory (primer sequence information are presented in the Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Data were analyzed based on the discriminations of year, pig growing stage, and sampling area.
