Data were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. The analysis of the database was assessed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Faculdade de Medicina of the Universidade de São Paulo (USP) (number 107,443), and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Data on each patient were collected as previously described (14, 15) using an online worksheet in the REDCap system. (16) The contact was made by telephone by a local team member. Data were stored in an online spreadsheet. The severity of the patient's condition was determined, and the indications and contraindications for extracorporeal support were analyzed. The indication and contraindication criteria were previously described by our group. (17) These criteria were modified slightly because the initial results were suboptimal due to occasional problems in the initial experience. (14, (18) (19) (20) The current criteria are described in the Supplementary Material. Although the contraindication criteria were restrictive, special situations that generated doubts were discussed by our group. In cases in which the indication criteria were fulfilled or in which there were doubts, the remaining members of the team were contacted, and the final decision on whether or not to undertake support was made by the team as a whole. The rescue team was composed of at least three professionals, of whom at least two were physicians (the third professional was a physician, a nurse, or a physical therapist). All the professionals who formed the team were trained to operate the system and to engage in open and direct communication with patients, relatives, and caregivers. All the professionals made an initial assessment of the patients. When there was agreement about the indication, the two physicians were responsible for cannulation, and the third professional was responsible for communication with the patient's relatives and for equipment assembly, including priming the system. Because an adequate transport system was not available, the requesting center was responsible for transporting the hospital staff to the requested location by ambulance or private transport. The team was responsible for carrying some equipment on the mission, including an ECMO system, a voltage stabilizer for the ECMO pump, two infusion pumps, a noninvasive blood pressure measurement system, and an oximeter. The transport of these items was confirmed using a checklist before departure for the mission. The remaining monitoring and support were provided by the ambulance in charge of the return transport. Initial support, initial patient stabilization, and migration to protective/ultraprotective ventilation were performed in the presence of all three professionals. The stepwise technique used in this process was previously described. (14) The ECMO system included a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator connected to the following centrifugal pumps: (1) Rotaflow/Jostra Quadrox-D/Permanent Life Support (PLS; Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany), and (2) a BioPump with campanula and Affinity TM circuit (Medtronic Inc, MN, USA) with a BIOCUBE 6000 membrane (Nipro Ltda, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil). Ambulances could be used to transport critical patients provided these vehicles had a mechanical ventilator capable of delivering at least 10cmH 2 O of positive end expiratory pressure and an inverter with a power of at least 2,000 watts. The latter feature was requested because less powerful inverters were not able to keep the ECMO pump working together with the other required devices. Team workload was reduced during transport by not carrying the ECMO thermoregulator and by carefully keeping the ambulance air conditioner off to avoid excessive cooling of the patient.
