Preparation of target proteins Thrombin, the estrogen receptor alpha, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) have been used as target proteins for testing the newly developed docking algorithms in this study. The coordinates of the X-ray crystal structures of these three proteins were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [47] , including thrombin in complex with Mqpa at 2.2 Å resolution (PDB entry 1ETR) [48] , estrogen receptor(ER) in complex with 4-hydroxytamoxifen at 1.90 Å resolution (PDB entry 3ERT) [49] , and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) in complex with Sc-558 at 3.0 Å resolution (PDB entry 6COX) [50] . All water molecules were removed from the protein structures. After extraction of bound ligands, all hydrogen atoms and the Kollman all-atom charges were assigned to the proteins using the BIOPOLYMER module of Sybyl v6.8 (Tripos Associates, Inc. St. Louis, MO). Finally, for each protein target, the binding site was defined as the residues around the bound ligand within 6.5 Å. Gasteiger and Marsili charges [51] were assigned to the extracted ligand of each protein.
