Screening of all positive laboratory results for hMPV by both direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to identify patients between the ages of newborn to 19 years who were diagnosed at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, WA during the years 2006-2010. Of 368 total patients with positive hMPV laboratory results, we performed retrospective chart review to identify a subset of 55 patients with immunocompromised conditions. We defined an immunocompromised condition as presence of hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, rheumatologic disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant, primary immunodeficiency, receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Using electronic chart review, we abstracted sociodemographic variables, symptoms, laboratory and radiologic values, clinical course, and treatment outcomes for these patients. Respiratory specimens were obtained by nasal washes for patients with suspected respiratory viral infections by attending physicians, or from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) when this was performed. DFA was performed using virus-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and RT-qPCR was performed using previously published methods at the University of Washington Virology Laboratories [12] . Viral load values were obtained on a subset of patients whose samples were tested by RT-qPCR. Estimated viral load data were calculated from cycle threshold values on RT-qPCR analysis using stored standard curve data for hMPV. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was defined as hMPV documented in an upper respiratory tract specimen in a patient with compatible symptoms in the absence of radiographic or clinical evidence of pneumonia. LRTI was defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate or presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms (wheezing or hypoxia) in association with a positive lower respiratory tract specimen or a positive upper respiratory tract specimen if the patient did not undergo BAL. Neutropenia was defined as absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/mL. Lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte count <300 cells/mL (not age-adjusted), and severe lymphopenia as lymphocyte count <100 cells/mL. Infections were defined as nosocomial if the patient was hospitalized within 7 days of diagnosis, and otherwise classified as community acquired. Severe disease was defined as requiring ICU stay and/or use of supplemental oxygen FiO 2 0.28. Mortality attributable to hMPV was defined as death due to respiratory failure from pneumonia during the hospitalization where hMPV was diagnosed, and hMPV was considered a contributor to lung injury. Data were entered into a password-protected Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed using Stata 11.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX). Comparison of clinical characteristics was performed using Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and t tests with unequal variance for continuous variables. This study was approved by the Seattle Children's Hospital IRB.
