The genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV as deposited by Wang et al. was downloaded from the GenBank database (MN908947.3). DNA and protein sequences were compared by using the BLAST program. Multiple sequence alignment was performed by using the Clustal Omega program. Three-dimensional structure was analyzed by using the Cn3D program from the NCBI. Protein structure simulation was performed by using Swiss-model based on the cocrystal structure of human ACE2 with the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein RBD (6, PDB ID 2AJF). ACE2 and RDB interaction was analyzed by molecular docking using the PatchDock and FireDock programs.
