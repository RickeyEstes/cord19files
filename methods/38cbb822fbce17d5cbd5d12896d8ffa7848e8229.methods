The pseudotyped VSV and MERS-CoV were set as unrelated virus controls and prepared as previously described 60, 61 . Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV S protein provided by Dr Lanying Du at the New York Blood Center or VSV-G protein (gift from Dr Yan Wang at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences) and pNL4-3.luc.RE (obtained from NIH AIDS Reagent Program) using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Supernatants containing pseudotyped MERS-CoV or VSV were collected 48 h post transfection. Huh7 cells were infected by these control viruses as described above. After 3 days, the inhibitory activity of Z2 on pseudovirus infection was measured using the luciferase assay system according to the instruction manual (Promega Co., Madison, WI) 62 . Immunofluorescence staining. To determine the inhibitory activity of Z2 on ZIKV infection in BHK21 or Vero cells, cells (1 Â 10 5 ) were seeded onto coverslips in a 24-well plate the day before infection. Then, ZIKV was mixed with equal volume of Z2 serially diluted (20, 10 and 5 mM) or Z2-scr (20 mM) in serum-free DMEM. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37°C, the mixture was added to cells. Twelve hours later, the culture supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS. After 4 days, the cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), perforated by 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 3% BSA (Amresco, LLC, Solon, OH). Then, the cells were incubated overnight with anti-E mAb 4G2 (10 mg ml À 1 , provided by Drs Lifang Jiang and Danyun Fang at Sun Yat-sen University) at 4°C. After five washes, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. After five washes, the coverslips were sealed with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and scanned with the Leica SP8 confocal microscope. To detect the expression of ZIKV E protein, 293T cells (5 Â 10 4 ) seeded on coverslips were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Env provided by Dr Lanying Du at the New York Blood Center, or empty vector pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using VigoFect. After culture for 48 h, immunofluorescence staining was performed using anti-E mAb 4G2 as described above. To test the binding of Z2 to ZIKV-infected BHK21 cells, BHK21 cells seeded in coverslips were ZIKV-or mock-infected, fixed with 4% PFA, perforated by 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 3% BSA. The cells were then incubated with anti-E mAb 4G2. After five washes, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled donkey anti-mouse antibody and Z2-Cy5 at room temperature for 1 h. After another five washes, the coverslips were sealed for scanning with the Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Flow cytometry assay. The 293T cells (2 Â 10 5 ) were seeded into a six-well plate. After culture at 37°C for 16 h, the cells were transfected by pcDNA3.1-Env or pcDNA3.1 with VigoFect for 48 h. The cells were digested by EDTA buffer to obtain a single-cell suspension and then treated with 25 nM Z2-Cy5 for 30 min. The untreated cells were tested as the blank control. After three washes, the data of Z2-Cy5 binding to cells with or without E protein expression were collected with a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. RNase digestion assay and RT-qPCR. The released genomic RNA from the ZIKV particles was detected by RNase digestion assay and RT-qPCR as previously described 28 . Briefly, about 1 Â 10 3 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of ZIKV was incubated with Z2 or Z2-scr at room temperature for 2 h. The released genomic RNA from the treated ZIKV particles was then digested with micrococcal nuclease (New England BioLabs, MA) at 37°C for 1 h. After inactivation of the residual RNase, the undigested genomic RNA in the intact viral particles was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) and reversed by using RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). ZIKV RNA genome was quantified by SYBR PremixExTaqII (TliRNase H Plus from Takara Bio) and the Master Cycler Ep Realplex PCR System (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The following primers were used to detect the RNA sequences in viral genome coding precursor membrane protein (PrM), E and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively (Fig. 3c, Sucrose density gradient assay. Approximately 3 Â 10 5 p.f.u. of ZIKV was treated with PBS containing 1% (v/v) DMSO, 100 mM Z2 or Z2-scr in PBS containing 1% (v/v) DMSO or PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 37°C for 2 h. Then the treated virions were gently loaded to the top of sucrose step gradient (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70%) and then centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (SW41Ti, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) in an Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 3 h at 107,170g at 4°C. Fractions from top to bottom were collected and assayed for viral genomic RNA by RT-qPCR and E protein by western blot. Anti-E mAb 4G2 (10 mg ml À 1 ) was used to detect the E protein 50 . Assay to detect inactivated ZIKV virions. Inactivated ZIKV particles were separated and detected as previously described 36 . Briefly, 100 ml Z2 or Z2-scr at graded concentration (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mM) were added to 100 ml ZIKV (5 Â 10 3 p.f.u. per ml), followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Then, 50% PEG-8000 (Amresco) and 5 M NaCl were added to the treated virus at final concentration of 10% and 0.67 M, respectively. After incubation on ice for 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 20,200g for 1 h. The supernatant containing the free peptide was removed, and the pellet containing the viral particles was washed with 3% PEG-8000 in PBS containing 10 mg ml À 1 BSA (Amresco). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml DMEM containing 2% FBS. The infectivity of the ZIKV particles in the pellet was determined using BHK21 cells as described above. In vivo fluorescence imaging. Six pregnant ICR mice (10-12 weeks old, E12-14) were assigned randomly to two groups and injected intravenously with 100 mg Z2-Cy5 in 100 ml PBS (n ¼ 3) or 100 ml PBS without peptide (n ¼ 3) as control (for background fluorescence measurement). One hour later, mice were imaged for distribution of Z2-Cy5 by the IVIS lumina K series III in vivo imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and the radiant efficiency (p s À 1 cm À 2 sr À 1 ) (mW À 1 cm 2 ) was calculated by Living image 4.4 software 63 . To determine the distribution of Z2-Cy5 in organs, all pregnant mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and the dissected livers, kidneys, spleens, hearts, uteruses and fetuses were imaged and the average radiant efficiency was calculated. The fetuses in the uteruses of two groups were applied to PFA-fixed paraffin sections to demonstrate the distribution of Z2 in the placenta and fetus. Safety of Z2 for pregnant ICR mice and fetuses. Thirty-one pregnant ICR mice (10-12 weeks old, E12-14) were assigned randomly to six groups and injected intravenously with Z2 at 10 (n ¼ 5), 20 (n ¼ 6), 40 (n ¼ 5), 80 (n ¼ 5) and 120 mg kg À 1 (n ¼ 5) of body weight, or PBS (n ¼ 5) as control every day for 3 consecutive days. Body weight changes of mothers at different prenatal and postnatal time points and pups at various postnatal time points were monitored. ALT and creatinine in the sera collected from the tails were measured using the ALT and creatinine assay kits (NJJCBIO, Nanjing, China) before the first injection and 4 h, 1, 3 and 5 days, respectively, after the third injection of Z2. Specific antibody response elicited by Z2 in mice was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 1 or 2 weeks after the third injection of Z2 or PBS. Three weeks after the pups were born, two mothers and their pups in each group were killed and the livers, kidneys, spleens and brains were collected for haematoxylin and eosin staining. All animal studies with ICR mice were carried out according to the ethical guidelines and approval by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at Fudan University (20160927-2). Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in pregnant C57BL/6 mice. Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in pregnant mice was evaluated using the method as previously reported 39 . Briefly, 24 pregnant C57BL/6 mice (10-12 weeks old, E12-14) were assigned randomly to two groups and infected i.p. with 1 Â 10 5 p.f.u. of ZIKV (SZ01). One hour later, the infected mice were i.p. administered with Z2 at 10 mg kg À 1 of body weight (n ¼ 12) or vehicle control (n ¼ 12). At day 1 post infection, mice were retro-orbitally bled to measure viraemia by RT-qPCR. Two embryos of each pregnant mouse were randomly collected and the viral RNA load in placenta and fetal head of each collected embryo was determined by RT-qPCR. Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in A129 or AG6 mice. Antiviral efficacy of Z2 in an A129 or AG6 mouse model was evaluated as previously reported 15, 40, 41 . Briefly, sixteen 4-week-old female A129 mice were assigned randomly to two groups and infected i.p. with 1 Â 10 5 p.f.u. of ZIKV (GZ01). Then, the infected mice were i.p. administered with Z2 at 10 mg kg À 1 of body weight (n ¼ 8) or vehicle control (n ¼ 8) every day for 6 consecutive d.p.i. Mice were observed daily for signs of illness and mortality. Animals that survived to day 21 were deemed to be protected. Meanwhile, viral RNA loads in sera on day 2 d.p.i. were measured by RT-qPCR. Twelve 6-week-old sex-matched AG6 mice were assigned randomly to two groups and infected with 1 Â 10 3 p.f.u. of ZIKV (SZ01) via a subcutaneous route in the footpad. Then, the infected mice were i.p. administered with Z2 at 10 mg kg À 1 of body weight (n ¼ 6) or vehicle control (n ¼ 6) every day for 6 consecutive d.p.i. Then the observation and examination on AG6 mice were done as described above. All animal studies with infectious ZIKV were conducted in a Biosafety Level 2 facility at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology or Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center with Institutional Biosafety Committee approval. Statistical analysis. Statistical methods were performed as follows: the log-rank (Mantel Cox) test to compare the MST between ZIKV-infected mice treated with Z2 or vehicle; Student's unpaired two-tailed t-test to monitor the distribution of Z2 in ICR mice; and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to examine the effect of Z2 on the levels of ALT and creatinine between the Z2 group and PBS group at one time point. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test also to determine differences of viral RNA loads in the sera of mice treated with Z2 or vehicle. Statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS 13.0 and GraphPad Prism Software. *Po0.05; **Po0.01; ***Po0.001. Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors on request.
