A prospective Web-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey instrument to obtain responses from HCWs globally during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed using WHO course materials on emerging respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 [14] . The survey covered the domains of HCW characteristics, awareness, information sources, knowledge and perceptions related to COVID-19. The developed draft survey instrument was distributed to ten randomly selected faculty members to assess its readability and validity before pretesting among 20 randomly selected HCWs for clarity, relevance, and acceptability. Refinements were made as required to facilitate better comprehension and to organize the questions before the final survey was distributed to the study population.
