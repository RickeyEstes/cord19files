The objective was to collect information from a range of countries. Most information was obtained from a semistructured questionnaire (panel 2) sent electronically to individuals identified as key senior figures within the infectious disease community in their country. The questionnaire asked whether infectious diseases was a recognised specialty and if there was a specialist postgraduate training scheme. If so, details of the training were requested (length of scheme, entry requirements, syllabus, governing body responsible, supervision of the trainee, formal examinations/mode of assessment). Information on the number of infectious disease specialists in each country was difficult to collect and is not presented here. All questionnaire respondents were also encouraged to express their personal opinions on aspects of training, in free text. We expected that the senior figures selected to receive the questionnaire would present the consensus attitude towards training programmes. Respondents included those on the editorial board of international journals such as The Lancet Infectious Diseases, presidents of infectious diseases societies, country representatives listed on the WHO website, and individuals identified through medical school and ministry of health websites. If the individual contacted felt it inappropriate for them to complete the questionnaire, they were requested to forward the questionnaire to someone more closely involved in training. Information collated from the survey was tabulated, edited for uniformity, and returned to the original respondents for verification.
