.4nimal.s. Male Sprague-Dawley virus-free rats (Hilltop. Scottsdale, PA) weighing 200-250 g were kept in high efficiency particulate-filtered (HEPA) air on a nor-ma1 diet (RMH-1000, Agway, Syracuse, NY) for 5 to 10 days before exposure. Blood serum samples were taken routinely from at least two rats 2 weeks following the end of each experiment to ensure that the animals had been maintained free from Sendai virus, Kilham rat virus. rodent corona viruses. and mycoplasmal infections(Microbiological Associates, Rockville. MD). Rats were exposed to either air or ozone in separate 700-liter laminarflow inhalation chambers (Baker. Sanford, ME) that were equipped with a charcoal-and HEPA-filtered air supply. The animals remained in the chambers in sepa-rate stainless-steel wire cages with free access to food and water during and following exposures. The air flow to the chambers was adjusted to give at least 20 changes per hour, a relative humidity of 50-654, and a temperature of 20-25째C. Rats were injected twice a day with EDU 01 carrier (control) ( 100 mg/kg body wt. ip) for 2 days prior to air and ozone exposures, twice on the day of 3-hr exposures to 2 ppm ozone, and once on each of the 2 days c~f continuous exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone. EDU injections were prepared by first dissolving 250 mg in 0.5 ml dmethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with the subsequent addition of 2 ml methyl cellulose (0.25%). Ozone grnrration and unalysi~. Ozone-containing air was introduced into the chamber at a rate of 2 liters/mln from an ultraviolet light ozone generator (Orec Corp.. Phoenix, AZ). Chamber ozone concentrations were monitored at different positions within the chamber at regular intervals by an ozone uv photometer (Model 1003AH. Dasibi Inc.. Glendale. CA). which was routinely calibrated against a known ozone source (Model 1008 PC. Dasibi Inc.). Two different ozone exposure pn)tocols were employed. In the first series of experiments. rats were exposed to either air or ozone for 3 hr with an additional 30 min allowed for chamber equilibration. Ozone concentrations were calculated from the averages obtained over each 30-min period. giving mean chamber concentrations of 2.07 +-0.02 and 2.06 I 0.05 ppm ozone (+SEM. )I = 7) for two separate exposures. In the second series of exposures when rats were exposed continuously for 48 hr. ozone concentrations were averaged every 2.5 hr. giving a mean ozone concentration ofO,Xi rt 0.02 ppm (+SEM. n = 30) with values that ranged from 0.78 to 0.94 ppm. Chamber analyses for nitrogen diox. ide, using methods based on the Griess-Saltzmann reaction (Saltzman rl (ii.. 1984) . demonstrated levels that were not significantly different than ambient concenrrations of less than 0.0 15 ppm. Bronchoalwolar lungs. Tracheas of anesthetized rats (sodium pentobarbital. 50 mgikg body wt. ip) were cannukdted. The chest cavity was opened and exsanguinated via abdominal arteries. The lungs were then gently lavaged with a single 7.5 ml vol ofwarm (37째C) phosphatcbuffered saline without Ca" and Mg" (PBS). The 101. ume of lavage fluid recovered was recorded and wa\ found not to be affected by the ozone exposures used in this study. giving a mean value of 6.3 t 0. I ml (tSl,M n = 64). Cells and debris were separated by centrifugation and the resulting supematant was lyophilized and then analyzed for albumin content by standard assay procedure based on its color reaction with bromocresol green (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) that is read at 630 nm (Rodkey, 1965) . The recovery of cells was continued by additional lavages of the lung, employing a total volume of 50 ml of PBS containing 3 mM EDTA. Cells were separated from the lavage fluid by centrifugation and were then combined with the pelleted cells from the first lavage. The number oftotal cells recovered by lavage and the percentage of differential cell counts were then determined by standard procedures (Warrand Jakab, 1983) . Enzyme analyses. Analysis for SOD and CAT activities were separately determined on unlavaged lungs that were first perfused free of blood, trimmed of extraparenchymal tissue, weighed, and then frozen at -80째C prior to analysis. Enzyme assays were determined on postmitochondrial fractions prepared by differential centrifugation (20,OOOg) of tissue homogenates prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. The protein content of the resulting fraction was determined by the dye-binding assay of Bradford (1976) . SOD activity was determined by the method of McCord and Fridovich (1969) based on the inhibition of xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide anion-induced reduction ofcytochrome c. One unit ofSOD activity is defined as the amount of SOD required to inhibit the maximal rate of cytochrome c reduction by 50%. CAT activity was determined by the method of Beer and Sizer (I 952) based on the rate of hydrogen peroxide oxidation monitored spectrophotometrically at 240 nm in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. One unit of CAT activity is defined as 1 ymol HzOz removed per minute. Endothelialcellculture. Bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (ATCC CCL-207) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium, supplemented with 2 XIM glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Grand Island. NY), in a humidified chamber maintained in 5% CO: in air at 37째C. On reaching confluence. the cells were incubated for 24 hr with increasing concentrations of EDU (0, 0.25. 0.5, and 1 .O mM) or with fresh medium only (control). EDU was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to 100 mM with distilled water, with further dilution to required concentrations with Dulbecco's medium without added fetal bovine serum. The final DMSO concentration in culture was <O.l%. Following incubations, cells were rinsed twice with PBS prior to removal from the culture flasks with 0.25% trypsin treatment. Cells were rewashed with PBS, counted, and then disrupted by pulse sonication (Branson Sonilier, Model 350) as previously described (Stevens et a/,, 1988) . The resulting sonicate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 100,OOOg (Model TLlOO mini-ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) prior to analysis for protein and SOD and CAT activities. Statistical anal.vsis. Data were evaluated by two-way analyses of variance and were compared by Duncan's new multiple range test using a level of significance of P < 0.05 (Dowdy and Wearden, 1983) . Logarithmic transformations of the data were carried out in those cases where variances were found not to be homogeneous according to Hartley's test (Dowdy and Wearden, 1983) .
