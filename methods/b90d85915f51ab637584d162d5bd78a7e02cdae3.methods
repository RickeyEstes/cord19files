This research consists of a narrative literature review and critical analysis of the information retrieved. Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Keywords used for the search included vaccines, immunizations, supply, manufacturing, demand, policies, and push-pull solutions. Indices such as Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched and the results augmented with reports produced by government agencies (e.g., Government Accountability Office) and independent think tanks. A variety of sources were reviewed, including reports from academic journals and current texts on vaccine history and policy. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion in the current work.
