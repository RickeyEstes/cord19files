Step one: creation of a hospital shortlist Indonesia has 2,165 public and private hospitals [11] . Before applying the WHO guideline for sentinel site selection, we shortlisted from 2,165 hospitals to a manageable number to enable detailed assessment and final selection. To achieve this, we limited selection to public hospitals that had previously participated in the sentinel pneumonia or SARI surveillance systems. We ranked these 50 hospitals in terms of two performance indicators, timeliness and completeness of data reporting to national level. Ranking of hospitals according to their surveillance performance history enabled prioritization of good sites in subsequent steps of the selection process. Timeliness indicated the proportion of on-time reports received by MOH from the sentinel site, where 100% indicated full compliance with data reporting requirements (by the 10th of each month). Completeness indicated the number of reports made to MOH per year, where 100% indicated full compliance (12 reports received from the sentinel site per year). Timeliness and completeness data for the 50 hospitals were extracted from the MOH surveillance system databases. Hospitals with less than 50% timeliness and completeness were excluded based on poor surveillance performance history. This resulted in 20 hospitals in the shortlist from Step One ( Figure 1 ). Step two: application of WHO guideline The second step was to operationalize the WHO recommended attributes for sentinel site selection; stability, representativeness and feasibility. Since influenza disease burden has not been established in Indonesia, we incorporated this into the selection process. For stability, the WHO guideline recommended calculating the funds needed to cover general costs of surveillance operations for the long term. We operationalized this by calculating the yearly costs of one sentinel site and determining the number of sites that could be established using funds available from MOH and donors for the next three years. Cost calculations were based on previous surveillance system experience and included one training for five hospital staff (2 doctors, 1 nurse, 1 laboratory worker and 1 medical records staff ), four monitoring visits to the site, six-monthly national meetings and costs for stationery and staff incentives. Based on previous SARI surveillance experience, each sentinel site was expected to generate 150 specimens per year. Costs for specimen collection, shipment to NIHRD and testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation (for 10% of specimens) were also calculated. For representativeness, we first considered geographic representation of the hospitals. We ranked the 20 hospitals from Step One according to their geographic location to represent west (Sumatera island, n = 5), north (Sulawesi island, n = 4), central (Java and Kalimantan islands, n = 9), south (East and West Nusa Tenggara islands, n = 1) and east (Maluku and Papua islands, n = 1). For hospitals in the same geographic regions, only the two top-performing hospitals were kept in the list and the others excluded. This resulted in a shortlist of eight hospitalsa number more aligned with the resources available for the surveillance system (Figure 1 ). We developed a sentinel site selection checklist to address the other attributes and criteria. This included five questions to assess representativeness, such as the type of hospital (general versus specialty), accessibility of wards for influenza surveillance and the demographics of the population served by the hospital (Table 2) . For feasibility, we included 13 questions to assess the motivation of the hospital to participate in the system, the infrastructure and human resource capacity available for surveillance activities ( Table 2) . As stated by the WHO guideline, adequate patient volumes and ability to ascertain the hospital's catchment population are needed to calculate influenza disease burden. We added three questions to the checklist to explore these issues. For patient volumes, we requested data on total patient admissions not respiratory patient admissions since hospitals may vary in their disease coding and recording systems. Four teams comprising ARI Subdirectorate, NIHRD and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) staff were trained in the sentinel site selection checklist objective and administration. Each team visited two hospitals where the teams met with the hospital director (or management representative), the medical and nursing staff and the laboratory team. These hospital personnel were targeted as they could answer the various administrative and procedural questions in the checklist. After introducing the concept of SIBI and answering any general questions, one team member administered the questionnaire and the others documented the answers. The teams then toured the hospital facilities including the medical records unit, emergency/patient admission, the laboratory and some patient wards. This enabled visual confirmation of the hospital capacity and likely flow of SARI patient enrolment into SIBI. The teams also reviewed medical records data on the number of monthly hospital admissions. Each sentinel site selection visit took 4-6 hours and all hospitals were visited in a three-week period. Funding for the sentinel site selection visits was made available by WHO. Step three: analysis and selection of sentinel sites Checklist data from the eight hospitals were entered into a spreadsheet and analyzed descriptively ( Table 2 ). The four teams met to determine which hospitals would be enrolled as SIBI sentinel sites based on the visit findings. Hospital management motivation to participate as a surveillance site was deemed a key criterion for selection as solutions to other issues could be addressed as long as the hospital was willing to collaborate. Thus, if hospital management did not welcome the surveillance activity, it no longer qualified for selection.
