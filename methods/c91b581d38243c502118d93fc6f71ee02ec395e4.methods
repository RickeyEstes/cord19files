Probability of pre-symptomatic infection. The probability that infection occurred before onset of symptoms for the infector was estimated for each transmission pair using a Bayesian approach based on the best fit for the generation time distribution (see Supplementary Information) . This estimate assumes independence between generation time and incubation period, but takes into account the available information on period of exposure and onset of symptoms for each case. Exponential growth rate. We identified the dates following consistent early exponential growth as December 28th -January 8th inclusive for Li et al.'s dates of symptom onset for cases not linked with any wet market, and January 18th -26th inclusive for the Chinese CDC dates of case confirmation, as illustrated with the blue and earliest green line in Figure 1 . We fit a single linear model to log(case counts) from both of these periods, constraining both sets of counts to have the same gradient (but different intercept, due to the delay between onset of symptoms and case confirmation). Infectiousness model. Our model for infectiousness ( ) was solved first by fitting the shape of the pre-symptomatic + symptomatic contributions to our inferred generation time interval: these functions are proportional to each other when the transmission pairs analysed for the generation time distribution represent pre-symptomatic and symptomatic exposure in the proportion representative of overall epidemic spread. We make that assumption here. This assumption would be violated by biased selection of transmission pairs for sampling. For example if the infector being in a later, symptomatic stage of infection makes identification of the pair more likely, then a data set of identified pairs will be undersampled for pre-symptomatic exposure and will overestimate the typical generation time. The next step in solving the model was calculating the relative scaling constant of the environmental contribution to ( ) to give the required R E /R 0 , and finally the overall scaling constant of ( ) is determined to reproduce the observed exponential growth rate (see Supplementary Information) .
