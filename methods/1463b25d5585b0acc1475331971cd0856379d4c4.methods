With institutional review board approval, a focus group interview was conducted on March 17, 2017, with infection control nurse (ICN) leaders from major hospitals. Upon participants' consent, a brief survey on demographic characteristics was completed before the focus group interview. Participants' responses and discussions were recorded anonymously. The content was analyzed by theme with additional weighted factors: frequency, specificity, emotion, and extensiveness. 2 A fishbone diagram summarizing the contributing factors to PPE use difficulties and reflecting MERS-specific conditions was created at a consultation with 2 board members of the Korean Association of Infection Control Nurses. All participants approved the theme categories and the fishbone diagram.
