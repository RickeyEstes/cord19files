The surveillance of influenza in Catalonia started during the season 1988-1989 and was modified from season 1999-2000, in order to achieve major geographical and major representativeness coverage, in the obtaining of samples for the viral study. Primary care Surveillance: The number of sentinel doctors participating in the season was of 60 physicians (35 general practitioners and 25 pediatricians), located in 43 primary care centers, distributed across several regions and covering 1.03% of the population of Catalonia. To achieve morbidity and virological indicators, these practitioners collect pharyngeal and nasal samples during the entire epidemic season, and forward data on attended morbidity. Systematic sampling of the first 2 weekly ILI attended by each sentinel physician was carried out. A panel of respiratory viruses is investigated: Influenza virus A (IVA), influenza B (IVB) and C virus (IVC), and other respiratory viruses: Respiratory syncytial (RSV), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4 (PIV) viruses, adenovirus (ADV), coronavirus (CoV), enterovirus (EV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). Morbidity indicators were collected automatically on a daily basis from sentinel practitioners: home calls performed, number of ILI cases diagnosed including data on gender, age and vaccination status. The thresholds for weekly incidence rates of ILI to assess intensity of epidemic activity (baseline, low, moderate, high and very high) were obtained by the Mobile Epidemics Method (MEM) 5
