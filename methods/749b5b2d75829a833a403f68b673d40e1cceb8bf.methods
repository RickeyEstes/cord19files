A descriptive report on exposure criteria and screening results of HCWs acquiring MERS-CoV infection during the June 2017 outbreak at KSMC was produced. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal samples was used to test the traced contacts for MERS-CoV. All HCWs with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure. Two negative results for MERS-CoV obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to stop their isolation and allow them to return to active duty. Further retesting depended on being symptomatic within the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period. Data were collected as part of the post-exposure management process.
