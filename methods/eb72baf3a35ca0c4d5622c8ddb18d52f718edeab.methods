A scoping review is a review of the literature that aims to identify the amount and quality of research on a certain topic. In other words, a scoping review focuses on identifying what is known about a topic and its associated characteristics in the existing literature [6] . The methodology of this scoping review was adopted from that described in The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015, Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews [25] and includes the following: identifying the research objective(s) and question (s); outlining the inclusion and exclusion criteria; identifying search strategies; extracting the results; discussing the results and drawing conclusions, including the implications for future research and practice.
