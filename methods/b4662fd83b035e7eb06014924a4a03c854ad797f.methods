Data collection. The territory of China lies between latitudes 18u and 54uN, and longitudes 73u and 135uE. China's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, and it is diverse from region to region due to the complex topography of China. Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the demographic, economic, and geographic characteristics as well as climatic factors of 31 Chinese provinces. Infectious diarrhoea data from 1 st January 2005 to 31 st December 2012 were collected from CISDCP. CISDCP is the reporting system of nationally notifiable infectious diseases and public health emergencies throughout China 26 . Diarrhoea cases were those who have three or more loose or liquid stools per day diagnosed in the hospital or the local CDC. In this study, we used the weekly reports of diarrhoea cases from CISDCP. Information on the age and residential address of the diarrhoea patients was obtained. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Institutional Review Board of Public Health of Shandong University (China) prior to the data being collected. Patient information was de-identified and thus no written informed consent was obtained. Demographic, economic, geographic and climate information in all 31 provinces from 2005 to 2012, including population, per capita gross regional product (PGRP), latitude, longitude, monthly average mean temperature, monthly average relative humidity, and monthly average rainfall, were collected from China Statistical Yearbook 27 to identify the putative drivers of diarrhoea seasonality. Data analysis. A seasonal decomposition analysis was conducted to assess whether there was a distinct seasonality in diarrhoea occurrence 28 . In this analysis, diarrhoea time-series was decomposed into seasonality, long-term trend, and irregular factors 23 . Heat maps were created to present the peak and trough times of diarrhoea in each age group and province. A cosinor function combined with Poisson regression was used to quantify the seasonal parameters of diarrhoea (ie., peak time, trough time and annual amplitude) 29 . The annual amplitude was expressed as a proportion of mean diarrhoea cases to facilitate the comparisons between different age groups and different regions. To identify the putative drivers of diarrhoea seasonality, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was conducted 30 . CART model is based on simple splits of the data and does not require the assumptions such as the existence of linear regression among and variables and homoscedasticity in variance. CART model was chosen in this study mainly because the potential drivers of diarrhoea seasonality (e.g., latitude and temperature) are highly correlated with each other and CART can potentially better accommodate complex interactions between variables since they avoid some of the assumptions associated with linear regression 31 . More importantly, CART model can identify the thresholds for the independent variables in the regression. Visual maps for the spatial distributions of diarrhoea incidence and annual amplitude were created using ArcGIS version 9.3 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). All the remaining analysis was conducted using the R statistical environment (version 2.15.3), with the ''season'' package (version 0.3-3) to conduct the cosinor analysis and ''rpart'' package to conduct the regression tree analysis.
