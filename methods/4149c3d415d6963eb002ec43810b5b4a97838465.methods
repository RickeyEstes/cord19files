Cloning and expression. The sequence encoding CR-VI þ was PCR amplified using primers that added a C-terminal SGHHHHHH-tag to the translation product, from a synthetic hMPV L gene (hMPV isolate 00-1, GenBank: AF371337.2), codon optimized for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cells (Geneart). The amplicon was cloned into pOPIN-E for expression in HEK293T mammalian cells (following transfection using Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen), in BL21 Star bacteria (Invitrogen) and in Sf21 (insect cells) following co-transfection with (flashBACULTRA) baculovirus (Oxford Expression Systems) using Cellfectin II (Invitrogen) 25 . Mutants were generated by PCR, using primers carrying the mutation (Supplementary Fig. 7) . The CR-VI þ DNA was used as a template for mutagenesis, except for the K 1991 Q/K 1995 Q and K 1991 Q/K 1992 Q/K 1995 Q mutants, which were obtained using the K 1995 Q DNA. For each mutation, the forward primer was combined with a vector-specific reverse primer (5 0 -AGTGGTATTTG TGAGCCAGG-3 0 ), and, in a second PCR, the reverse primer was used together with a vector-specific forward primer (5 0 -CCTTTAATTCAACCCAACAC-3 0 ). The two PCR products thus generated were digested with either BspQI or BtsI (New England Biolabs), restriction enzymes that cut within the CR-VI þ -specific primer regions. The amplicons were then rejoined using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), and the ligation products were PCR amplified using the vector-specific primers for insertion in the pOPIN-E vector. Purification. Seventy-two hours after infection of the suspension cultures with recombinant baculovirus, Sf21 cells were spun down (1,000g, 7 min, 22°C) and lysed in one-fourth volume of buffer L (1.5% triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 50 mM arginine, 300 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole and 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0)). After clarification (10,000g, 25 min, 4°C), the lysate was incubated with benzonase (Novagen; to 0.2 U ml À 1 ) and NiNTA resin (Qiagen; 0.3 ml l À 1 culture) for 5 h at 4°C, with gentle shaking. The beads were transferred to a 10-ml column and washed with 3 Â 10 ml buffer W (20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and 7.5% glycerol) and 1.5 ml of 0.1 M arginine (pH 8.0). Protein was eluted in 0.8 M arginine (pH 8.0). An equal volume of ice-cold 3 M AmSO 4 was added to the eluent, and the precipitated protein collected (10,000g, 10 min, 4°C). Protein pellets were stored at À 20°C. A similar lysis and purification protocol was used to obtain recombinant protein from HEK293T cells. BL21 Star cells were lysed using Bugbuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen). Expression and purification were monitored by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Blots were developed with a 1/10,000 dilution of an anti-histidine tag antibody (Penta Á His Antibody, Qiagen, catalogue number 34660). Supplementary Fig. 1 shows purified protein following SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. An uncropped western blot showing the unreduced, insect-cell-expressed protein next to a BenchMark (Invitrogen) molecular weight marker is also shown. Selenomethionine incorporation. Twenty hours following infection of an Sf21 suspension culture (27.8°C, with an agitation speed of 130 r.p.m./0.25g), cells were collected (70g, 10 min, 22°C) and resuspended in cysteine-and methionine-free SF900II medium (Gibco) supplemented with dialysed fetal bovine serum (Gibco; 7% v/v) and 150 mg l À 1 L-cysteine (Sigma). Following an additional 4 h at 27.8°C in the shaking incubator, 250 mg l À 1 selenomethionine (Sigma) was added. Protein expression was allowed to continue for another 48 h. Proteins were purified as above. Crystallization, structure solving, refinement and validation. Crystallization was carried out by vapour diffusion at 20.5°C using 96-well sitting drop plates (Greiner) 26 . Protein pellets were dissolved in water to 5-6 mg ml À 1 , and initial crystals were obtained by equilibrating 100 nl of protein with 100 nl of reservoir solution C11 of the PGA-HT screen (Molecular Dimensions; pH 6.5) supplemented with guanidine hydrochloride (to 0.1 M), against 0.1 ml of reservoir. Glycerol was added (to 20% v/v) for cryoprotection. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on Diamond beamlines I02, I03, I04 and I24 (Harwell, UK), and processed using the Xia2 programme suite 27 . A single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment allowed determination and refinement of the positions of selenium atoms, as well as calculation of the phases with autoSHARP 28 . An initial model was obtained using MR-ROSETTA 29 , enabling manual model building using COOT 30 . Refinement was performed using autoBUSTER 31 , and validation employed COOT and Molprobity 32 . Molecular replacement (using PHASER 33 ) was used to solve additional CR-VI þ structures. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1 , and a portion of the electron density map is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 . Synthesis of RNA substrates. RNA sequences were chemically synthesized on a solid support using an ABI 394 synthesizer. After RNA elongation with 2 0 O-pivaloyloxymethyl phosphoramidite monomers 34, 35 (Chemgenes, USA), the 5 0 -hydroxyl group was phosphorylated and the resulting H-phosphonate derivative 36 oxidized and activated into a phosphoroimidazolidate derivative to react with either phosphoric acid (for ppRNA synthesis), pyrophosphate (pppRNA) 36 or guanosine diphosphate (GpppRNA) 37, 38 . N7-methylation of the purified GpppRNA was performed enzymatically using N7-hMTase 37, 38 . To prepare monophosphate RNA (pRNA), the 5 0 -H-phosphonate RNA was treated with a mixture of N,O-bis-trimethylacetamide (0.4 ml), CH 3 CN (0.8 ml) and triethylamine (0.1 ml) at 35°C for 15 min, and then oxidized with a tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution (5-6 M in decane, 0.4 ml; 35°C, 15 min). After deprotection and release from the solid support, RNA sequences were purified by IEX-HPLC (495% pure) and their identity were confirmed by MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Fight) spectrometry. MTase activity assays. These were performed by combining 4 mM CR-VI þ with 0.7 mM of the purified and validated synthetic RNAs, 10 mM SAM and 0.33 mM 3 H-SAM (Perkin Elmer) in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Reactions (at 30°C) were stopped by a 10-fold dilution in 100 mM ice-cold SAH and the samples were transferred to DEAE filtermats (Perkin Elmer) using a Filtermat Harvester (Packard Instruments). The RNA-retaining mats were washed twice with 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 8.0), twice with water and once with ethanol. They were then soaked with liquid scintillation fluid, allowing the measurement of 3 H-methyl transfer to the RNA substrates using a Wallac MicroBeta TriLux Liquid Scintillation Counter 13 . Methylation of GTP was determined in the same buffer (minus the 3 H-SAM and RNA), using the EPIgeneous methyltransferase assay kit (Cisbio), which measures the generation of SAH, as it competes with d2-coupled SAH for binding to a Lumi4-Tb-labelled anti-SAH antibody, affecting the TR-FRET signal between these compounds. In practice, MTase reactions were stopped after 16 h by addition of the detection reagents, and 1 h later the TR-FRET signal was monitored using a PHERAstar Flashlamp plate reader. Thin-layer chromatography analysis of cap structures. G*pppGGGACAAGU (in which the asterisk indicates the [ 32 P]-labelled phosphate) was synthesized by incubating pppGGGACAAGU (10 mM) with vaccinia virus capping enzyme (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1.65 mCi [a-32 P]-GTP (Perkin Elmer). The capped RNA was purified by precipitation in 3 M sodium acetate supplemented with 1 mg ml À 1 of glycogen (Thermo Scientific), and submitted to methylation by CR-VI þ (as above), after which it was precipitated again (stopping the reactions), and digested with 1 U of Nuclease P1 (US Biologicals) in 30 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.3), 5 mM ZnCl 2 and 50 mM NaCl (4 h, 37°C). The products were spotted onto polyethylenimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates (Macherey Nagel), and resolved in two steps, first using 0.65 M LiCl, then 0.45 M (NH 2 ) 2 SO 4 as mobile phase. The radiolabelled caps released by nuclease P1 were visualized using a Fluorescent Image Analyzer FLA3000 (Fuji) phosphor-imager. Characterization of RNA-CR-VI þ interactions. Using T4 RNA ligase 1 (20 units; New England Biolabs), [5 0 -32 P]-pCp (1.1 mCi) was ligated to the 3 0 -ends of the RNA substrates (10 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT and 1 mM ATP (16°C, overnight). Ligase was removed by RNA precipitation in 3 M sodium acetate supplemented with 1 mg ml À 1 of glycogen (Thermo Scientific). The radiolabelled RNA was incubated (15 min, 37°C) with increasing concentrations of CR-VI þ , in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 30 mM NaCl. The reaction mixtures were spotted onto nitrocellulose (GE Healthcare) using a manifold-1 dot-blot apparatus (Whatman) and washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM DTT and 50 mM NaCl. Membrane-bound RNA was quantified by phosphor-imaging. Dissociation constants (K D s) were determined using Hill slope curve fitting (Prism). NTPase assay. Samples combining CR-VI þ (4 mM) with 0.5 mCi [a-32 P]-GTP or 0.5 mCi [a-32 P]-ATP in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM DTT and 5 mM MgCl 2 were incubated at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of formamide/EDTA gel-loading buffer, and hydrolysis products were separated over a 20% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel before phosphor-imaging.
