Iterative profile searches with the PSI-BLAST [47] and JACKHMMER [152] programs were used to retrieve homologous sequences in the protein non-redundant (NR) database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). For most searches a cut-off e-value of 0.01 was used to assess significance. In each iteration, the newly detected sequences that had e-values lower than the cutoff were examined for conserved motifs to detect potential homologs in the twilight zone. Similarity-based clustering was performed using the BLASTCLUST program (http:// ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html) to cluster sequences at different thresholds. Multiple sequence alignments were built using the Kalign [153] , MUSCLE [45] and PCMA [154] programs, followed by manual adjustments based on profile-profile alignment, secondary structure prediction and structural alignments. Consensus secondary structures were predicted using the JPred program [155] . Remote sequence similarity searches were performed using profile-profile comparisons with the HHpred program [46] . Gene neighborhoods were extracted and analyzed using a custom PERL script that operates on the Genbank genome or whole genome shotgun files. The protein sequences of all neighbors were clustered using the BLASTCLUST program (http://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ blast/documents/blastclust.html) to identify related sequences in gene neighborhoods. Each cluster of homologous proteins were then assigned an annotation based on the domain architecture or conserved shared domain. This allowed an initial annotation of gene neighborhoods and their grouping based on conservation of neighborhood associations. The remaining gene neighborhoods were examined for specific template patterns such as TA systems. In this analysis care was taken to ensure that genes are unidirectional on the same strand of DNA and shared a putative common promoter to be counted as a single operon. If they were head to head on opposite strands they were examined for potential bidirectional promoter sharing patterns. We also filtered the data using an intergenic distance criterion of 100 nt for genes to belong to a predicted operon. A complete list of Genbank gene identifiers for proteins investigated in this study is provided in the Additional file 1. TM segments were detected using the TMHMM version 2 program [156] and signal peptides and protein localization were predicted using the Phobius program [157] . Structure similarity searches were conducting using the DALIlite program [158] and structural alignments were generated by means of the MUSTANG program [159] .
