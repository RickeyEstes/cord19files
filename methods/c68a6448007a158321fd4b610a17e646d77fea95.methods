This was a retrospective cohort study analysing data from electronic records of patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) from January 2012 to December 2015. SCGH is a large adult tertiary teaching hospital with over 600 beds located in Perth, Western Australia. It treats approximately 93 000 inpatients and 60 000 Emergency Department presentations annually [16] . Patients aged 18 years and above who were admitted to SCGH with a respiratory illness were included in this study. The hospital information system data from that time period were searched using the following codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) to capture all patients presenting with a possible respiratory illness: J00-J06 (acute upper respiratory infections), J09-J18 (influenza and pneumonia), J20-J22 (other acute lower respiratory infections), J40-J47 (chronic lower respiratory diseases), J80 (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and J81 (pulmonary oedema). ICD-10-CM codes were selected to capture all patients who may have received a respiratory viral test. Data from patients meeting the search criteria in their primary diagnosis code, or in up to four further diagnosis/complication codes, were retrieved from the information system. These codes were also used to determine if patients had comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, compromised immunity, asthma or cystic fibrosis. Although pregnancy and obesity are recognised risk factors for severe influenza, they were not included in this study due to very low numbers of patients identified through the ICD-10 codes. Available patient data also included patient demographics, admission and discharge dates, discharge codes and number of hours spent in ICU or on ventilation. Virological testing data were obtained from PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA (PathWest), who perform routine virological testing for SCGH. During the study period samples were tested for A/H1, A/H3, INF-B, PIV and RSV using a tandem multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using primers and probes from a previously described method [17] , with an additional target for the hMPV matrix gene [18] . An SCGH patient record was matched with a PathWest record if the patient received virological testing within 7 days either side of their hospital admission date. Records were matched using either Unit Medical Record Number and date of birth, or name and date of birth. Any patients with multiple samples taken during the same admission were matched to the first sample collected that was positive for a virus. Multiple admissions occurring within 7 days of the first admission date were treated as a single admission for this study, otherwise they were analysed as separate admissions.
