After the first rabid ferret-badger was identified, initial response focused on providing adequate supply of rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) for PEP [15] . Surveillance of rabid animals was established to respond to this reemerging rabies by COA [13] . Pathology and RT-PCR was performed to screen rabies virus among dead mammals and mammals with aggressive behavior, collected by forestry workers, wildlife rescue centers and local animal health agencies. Positive results were confirmed using DFA. Priorities for testing were given to animals with aggressive behavior and those which had bitten humans. Rabies test results were provided to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) daily so public health practitioners could follow-up on bite victims, ensuring the completeness of PEP [14] . Control measures implemented include expanded animal rabies surveillance, animal bite surveillance, revision of human rabies vaccine and RIG recommendations, expanded human rabies PEP service points, health education for the public and mammal bite care training for healthcare professionals.
