Small molecules. GS-5734 and Nuc were synthesized at Gilead Sciences, Inc., and chemical identity and sample purity were established using NMR, HRMS, and HPLC analysis 4 . To determine concentration response curves against each virus, we used either a 7-point or a 10-point 3-fold dilution series, with each compound concentration tested in quadruplicate. 7 was propagated and quantitated as above using Huh7 cells. The rgRSV was propagated and quantitated as above using HeLa cells 12 . Both hMPV-GFP (CAN97-83) 13 and hPIV3-GFP (JS) 11 were obtained from ViraTree.
