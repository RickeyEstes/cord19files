We studied 110 consecutive patients with ALI (n = 18) and ARDS (n = 92) at mean (± SE) age 66 ± 13 years in a clinical follow-up design at a surgical ICU in a university hospital using the American European consensus definition. Respiratory failure was accompanied solely or in combination by sepsis (n = 52), pneumonia (n = 66), malignant disease (n = 25), vascular disease (n = 60) or multiple trauma (n = 10) as concomitant disease. All patients were ventilated intermittently in SP and PP (135° leftside/right-side position) for at least 6 hours/day for supportive treatment of respiratory failure. Data collection included, apart from baseline characteristics, individual oxygenation index and concomitant diseases of the patients. Discussion Especially, patients with ARF and sepsis showed an early and lasting increase in oxygenation after starting PPV, while those with pneumonia, vascular disease or malignant diseases showed a visible increase in oxygenation on the first day after starting PPV, and a more or less clear improvement in the following days. Multiple trauma patients showed only a trend for a better oxygenation but not a significant increase. We studied 16 patients admitted in a trauma ICU during the period January-August 2003. All patients were under mechanical ventilation and without significant pulmonary disease. They were submitted to the systematic increase of PEEP from ZEEP to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 cmH 2 O every 10 min. At the same time, we measured the haemodynamic effects and alterations in the oxygen transportation. Results All were traumatic patients, without significant pulmonary disease. The mean age was 34.3 ± 11.9 years, 87.5% were male, the mean APACHE II score was 26.4 ± 4.5, the mean SAPS II score was 44.9 ± 11.9 and the initial mean SOFA score was 5.8 ± 1.4. The addition of PEEP caused progressive increase of the pulmonary artery pressure, of the central venous pressure (CVP) and of the oxygen extraction rate. At the same time, it caused progressive decrease of the cardiac index (CI) and the right ventricular systolic work index (RVSWI). The CVP increased from 13.3 ± 5.5 to 21.8 ± 4.4, the CI decreased from 5.0 ± 1.6 to 4.1 ± 2.1 and the RVSWI decreased from 10.6 ± 6.2 to 7.0 ± 5.9. All these alterations were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions The addition of PEEP in patients under mechanical ventilation and without significant pulmonary disease can cause progressive right ventricular dysfunction. Haemodynamic care and support should be taken during PEEP increases for recruitment maneuvers and alveolar protection, even if this is done for short periods of time. Introduction Tidal volume limitation and incremental positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) correlates with improved survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] , but the impact on haemodynamic response is not well established [2, 3] . Aim of study To evaluate (1) the haemodynamic and volumetric response to incremental changes of tidal volume and (2) the haemodynamic and volumetric response to incremental changes of PEEP. In 25 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, CO values obtained by the PRAM from the radial artery were compared with bolus thermodilution (TD) before and after ECC, and with the RP readings during ECC before and after aortic clamp. PRAM flow measurements during ECC were based on the analysis of each sinusoidal arterial waveform (the continuous component of flow) produced by the RP. This is a prospective, descriptive study reporting a qualitative assessment of the advantages of, and relative barriers for, two models of EGDT implementation. The models were developed by two tertiary care hospitals. Patients eligible for the EGDT protocol were those with suspected infection criteria and either septic shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 despite 30 cm 3 /kg fluid resuscitation) or lactate (> 4 mmol/l). Implementation at each center included a 1-month initial phase comprised of MICU and ED physician and nursing staff education. The MICU-driven protocol conducted a 2-month baseline data collection period. Results Both models are collaborative, but vary in terms of initiation of the protocol. The MICU-driven model developed and introduced a protocol with ensuing support from the ED. The EDdriven model developed and introduced a protocol with ensuing support derived from the MICU. Timing of patient identification, protocol compliance and ED transfer time to the MICU are continuously evaluated in both models. Insertion of an ScvO 2 central venous oximetry catheter (PreSep) is shared between the MICU and ED teams based on ED acuity, operator skill, and physiologic urgency. The MICU-driven protocol is strongly supported by the intensive care staff; early transfer from the ED to the MICU is a priority. During the course of this study, timing of patient identification and MICU/ED collaboration continues to improve. The ED-driven protocol team has found that early identification and initiation of the protocol, in combination with strong support from the ICU, results in collaborative streamlining based on ED and MICU workloads. Both institutions have found that challenges in patient identification and line insertion present the most time-consuming obstacles to protocol initiation. Conclusion Implementation of EGDT protocols is possible through a collaborative process, whether driven by intensive care unit or emergency department teams. Frequent education and collaborative communication appear to be key elements for success. We retrospectively examined the data of the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Munich, Germany) from 18 patients treated in our neurosurgical intensive care unit. Neurosurgical diagnosis was mainly severe subarachnoid hemorrhage; 10 patients were additionally diagnosed with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome or cardiac failure. Thermodilution measurements consisted of up to five single injections with a bolus of 20 cm 3 iced saline. Data was automatically stored on a laptop connected to the PiCCO system. From a raw data volume of 200 MB, the thermodilution measurements were extracted and analysed for repeatability. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to quantify the disagreement between single measurements. Results A total of 417 thermodilution procedures consisting of 1465 single bolus injections were analyzed for indexed cardiac output (CI), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBI) and extrapulmonary lung water (ELWI). The median difference between the lowest and highest value in a single series was 0.3 l/min/m 2 (CI), 80 ml/m 2 (ITBI) and 1 ml/kg (ELWI), respectively. Calculated from the withinsubject variance of the ANOVA, the 95% repeatability coefficient for two measurements of the same thermodilution sequence was 0,72 l/min/m 2 (CI), 270 ml/m 2 (ITBI) and 3.5 ml/kg (ELWI). This translates to 48% (CI), 180% (ITBI) and 87% (ELWI) of the measured parameters' normal ranges. We prospectively studied 10 patients with septic shock monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and the COLD System (COLD-Z021 Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Germany). Measurements were performed every 8 hours from the study admission until 48 hours. The relationships between variables were analyzed by linear regression. We retrieved 21 patients from our prospective collected data base from January to December 2000. APACHE II scores were calculated at admission and ∆PCO 2 , cardiac output, BE and LAC were recorded at the moment of pulmonary artery catheter insertion and 24 hours after. All four variables had a normal distribution in our sample. Correlation between ∆PCO 2 and the other three variables was performed, using the Pearson coefficient. Sixteen cardio-surgical patients received levosimendan infusion with a maximum duration of 29 hours. Eight infusions were initiated preoperatively and eight postoperatively. Most patients received 0.1 µg/kg/min levosimendan after a bolus of 12-24 µg/kg for 10 min. The main operative indication was coronary artery disease. Seventy-five per cent of the subjects were high-risk patients. Because of cardiac pacing postoperatively, the heart rate was not analysed. The REVIVE I trial was a pilot trial comprising 100 patients with acute HF who were hospitalised for worsening HF and had dyspnea at rest despite intravenous (IV) diuretics. Patients were randomised (double-blind) to receive placebo (PBO) (n = 49) or IV levosimendan (LS) (n = 51), given as a loading dose of 12 µg/kg over 10 min and followed by a continuous infusion (0.1 µg/kg/hour for 50 min and 0.2 µg/kg/hour for 23 hours). Among other measures, the duration of hospitalisations and intensive care (ICU/CCU) were prospectively recorded. We reviewed prospectively recorded transthoracic echocardiograms of seven cardiac failure patients and six critically ill patients before and after 24 hours of levosimendan infusion (bolus 12 µg/kg + 0.1 µg/kg/min) in whom continuous wave Doppler signal (CW) of peak tricuspid regurgitant (TR) flow velocity recordings before and after levosimendan infusion were available. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by the Simpson's method. RV contractility was assessed by the maximal tricuspid annulus displacement during the cardiac cycle by M-mode (six patients only) and/or by a blinded observer. The maximal RV-right atrium gradient (TRmax) calculated from the CW recording (by the modified Bernoulli equation) of peak TR flow velocity in parasternal short axis or apical four-chamber views is regarded as a preload independent estimate of pulmonary artery vascular resistance (PVR) [2] . Values are expressed as the mean ± SD. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to calculate the difference before and after levosimendan infusion. The patient population was: Arm 1, cardiogenic shock patients with low cardiac output defined as a cardiac index < 2.0 l/min/m 2 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCW) > 18 mmHg, or patients with PCW > 18 mmHg and a systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mmHg or in need of inotropes to keep systolic BP > 90 mmHg; and Arm 2: high-risk CABG or high-risk PCI following the Euroscore criteria. Sample size: 20/45 patients are included. Hemodynamics included the assessment of cardiac output (CO), PCW, arteria pulmonalis (AP), arterial BP and intracardiac pump parameters. Biochemistry included free hemoglobin at baseline, each hour during the pump run and 6 hours after removal of the pump. The effect of rhAPC (1-20 µg/ml) on the expression of COX-2-mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was measured by a colorimetric assay (Quantikine assay™). The COX-2 protein content in endothelial cells was determined by western blots. Cell supernantants were assayed for 6-keto-PFG1α, the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, by ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test and ANOVA. Results rhAPC dose-dependently upregulated COX-2 mRNA in endothelial cells after an incubation time of 4 hours (controls, 11.7 ± 0.6 amol/ml; HUVEC treated with 20 µg/ml rhAPC, 18.4 ± 0.8 amol/ml; mean ± SEM, P < 0.001). Western blot analysis revealed an increase of COX-2 protein content after a 10-hour treatment with rhAPC (1 µg/ml). rhAPC dose-dependently increased 6-keto-PFG1α-levels in HUVEC supernatants (controls, 62.5 ± 8.7 pg/ml; HUVEC treated with 20 µg/ml rhAPC, 151.7 ± 16.3 pg/ml, P < 0.001). As shown by antagonists to the thrombin receptor PAR-1 (WEDE 15 and ATAP2) and by a monoclonal antibody (RCR-252) against the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), the effect of rhAPC on COX-2 mRNA upregulation was mediated by the EPCR receptor. We developed a mathematical model of the acute inflammatory response that was calibrated from rat endotoxemia and hemorrhagic shock data. The model accommodates a variety of initiators of acute inflammation, provides a dynamic profile of serum markers of inflammation over time, and expresses outcome in as global tissue dysfunction. Irreversible dysfunction is interpreted as death. We constructed a population of 100,000 cases that differed by level of initial stress and propensity to mount an inflammatory response. Initial stress was chosen to result in 4% cohort mortality and to last less than 6 hours, such as CPB. The intervention consisted of the removal of circulating TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 over a period of 6 hours, during which stress was inflicted and acute inflammation triggered. We equated the degree of removal of cytokines to that observed with the application of a biocompatible adsorbent polymer hemoperfusion column in endotoxemic rats. Results Death correlated to serum IL-6 and to a lesser degree TNF cumulative levels. Patients with the highest levels of IL-6 6-24 hours after the insult are those that will go on to die (Fig. 1) . Examination of the results show that, if the IL-6 levels were decreased by > 60% and TNF levels by > 50% in the period at or shortly after the CPB, over 99% of all patients would survive, compared with 96% in the control arm. Conclusions Global, nonspecific, reduction of inflammation improves outcome in simulations of an acute inflammatory challenge such as CPB. Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/8/S1 Sepsis, complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), is the most frequent cause of mortality in the ICU despite improvements in patient care [1] . Plasmapheresis is a tool to remove endotoxins and inflammatory mediators responsible for pathophysiology. We design a study in a small group of septic patients complicated with DIC to evaluate the changes on coagulation parameters, severity of sepsis and outcome of plasmapheresis. After ethical approval for the trial and written informed consent was obtained, patients were prepared for plasmapheresis. The criteria for entry to the trial were sepsis as described by Bone [2] , and DIC [3] as described by Bick. The exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hemorrhagia, recent (< 48 hours) cardiac surgery, recent (< 48 hours) resuscitation, platelets < 20,000/mm 3 , positive human immunodeficiency virus serology, morbid obesity and pregnancy. After obtaining the laboratory data and scores first, plasmapheresis was performed using fresh frozen plasma as a 1:1 ratio for the calculated plasma volume for each patient. The second plasmapheresis was performed after 48 hours. The severity of illness and mortality rates was calculated using the APACHE II scale and the severity of DIC was calculated by the DIC score. The outcomes at 28 days were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 11.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA), values are expressed as mean ± SD and P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Thirteen patients were treated in the ICU with plasmapheresis from 2002 to 2003. The difference between the calculated mortality rate based on initial APACHE II scores (59.6 ± 21.3), and 28-day mortality of all patients (20%), was significant (P < 0.05). The decrease in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastic time, based on initial results, were significant in 24, 48 and 72 hours (P < 0.05). The enhancement of the DIC score (from 6.2 ± 0.6 to 3.7 ± 0.9) between the baseline and the end of the procedure was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The level of D-dimer before the first plasmapheresis (1333 ± 972) was decreased (638.6 ± 252.9) significantly at the end of the procedure (P < 0.007). The increase in biological markers of sepsis (antithrombin, protein C and protein S activity) was statistically significant (P < 0.01). It was also found that the protein C activity was controversially correlated with 28-day survival (P < 0.02). We thought that repeated plasmapheresis in the early stages of sepsis may be considered a therapeutic method even during progressive sepsis that is complicated with DIC. Introduction High cutoff hemofilters are characterized by an increased effective pore size designed to facilitate the elimination of inflammatory mediators in sepsis. This study compares diffusive versus convective high cutoff renal replacement therapy (RRT) in terms of cytokine clearance rates and effects on plasma proteins. Methods Twenty-four patients with sepsis-induced acute renal failure were studied. A polyflux hemofilter with a cutoff point of approximately 60 kDa was used for RRT. Patients were randomly allocated to either continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with an ultrafiltration rate of 1 l/hour (group 1) or 2.5 l/hour (group 2), or to continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) with a dialysate flow rate of 1 l/hour (group 3) or 2.5 l/hour (group 4). IL-1ra, IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and plasma proteins were measured daily. Results CVVH achieved a significantly higher IL-1ra clearance compared with CVVHD (P = 0.0003). No difference was found for IL-6 (P = 0.935). Increasing the ultrafiltration volume or dialysate flow led to a highly significant increase in IL-1ra and IL-6 clearance rate (P < 0.00001). Peak clearance was 46 ml/min for IL-1ra and 51 ml/min for IL-6. TNF-α clearance was poor for both RRT modalities. A significant decline in plasma IL-1ra and IL-6 was observed in patients with high baseline levels. Protein and albumin loss were highest during the 2.5 l/h hemofiltration mode. Conclusion High cutoff RRT is a novel strategy to clear cytokine more effectively. Convection has an advantage over diffusion in the clearance capacity of IL-1ra but is associated with higher plasma protein losses. Methods One hundred and ten single MARS treatments were performed with a length of 6-24 hours on 39 various pathogenic MODS patients (27 male/12 female) (see Table 1 ). We retrospectively studied patients with ACS (intraabdominal pressure [IAP] ≥ 18 mmHg and at least one organ failure) admitted to our medical and surgical intensive care unit over two consecutive years (2001) (2002) . We focused on organ failure at the time of the raised IAP and on its evolution in patients who did not undergo a decompressive laparatomy. Hemodynamic instability was defined as dependence on vasopressor therapy, respiratory failure as P/F < 300 and renal failure as creatinine level > 2 mg/dl or a 50% increase from baseline. In seven anaesthetized dogs CO and RBF were measured directly using flow probes. The mean artery pressure (MAP) was measured by cannulating the femoral artery. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was derived. Sepsis was induced by injecting Escherichia coli. Each vasopressor was randomly infused at a recommended rate (Table 1) for 30 min. Percentage changes in MAP, CO, SVR and RBF, compared with baseline, were calculated. Data were expressed as mean (SD) and statistical analysis was performed using one-group t tests. Twenty patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery were prospectively recruited. Ten underwent conventional open repair and 10 had endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Mucosal biopsies of the sigmoid colon were taken immediately preoperatively and postoperatively. Microscopic examination was performed using H&E and TUNEL staining for apoptosis, and in situ hybrdisation techniques were used to detect IL-6 mRNA expression. Intraoperatively, systemic and splanchnic blood was sampled in the conventional surgery group. In the EVAR group only systemic blood was taken. Plasma was assayed for nitrosothiols (nitric oxide donors) and IL-6. Open-label treatment with Remi, Fent or Morph was randomised 2:1:1. Remi infusion was started at 9 µg/kg/hour and titrated to effect. Supplemental P (days 1-3) or Mid (days [4] [5] was introduced at an infusion rate of 18 µg/kg/hour to provide optimal sedation (SAS 1-3) and analgesia (none/mild pain). Fent or Morph were administered with P or Mid according to routine practice. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were measured at the time of and 10 min following dose titrations Table 1 Remi  Open-label treatment with Remi, Fent or Morph was randomised 2:1:1. Remi infusion was started at 9 µg/kg/hour and titrated to effect. Supplemental P (days 1-3) or Mid (days [4] [5] was introduced at a Remi infusion rate of 18 µg/kg/hour to provide optimal sedation (SAS 1-3) and analgesia (none/mild pain). Fent or Morph were administered with P or Mid according to routine practice. Study drugs were reduced/stopped for daily scheduled assessments of neurological function. One hundred and five patients were randomised to receive either RBA or HBS. Remifentanil infusion started at 6-9 µg/kg/hour and was titrated to effect to provide optimal analgesia and sedation. Supplemental midazolam (MID) bolus was introduced to remifentanil at a rate of 12-18 µg/kg/hour. HBS (MID + fentanyl or morphine at investigator's choice) was administered according to routine clinical practice. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the treatment and post-treatment period. Study design A prospective controlled study. Setting A general ICU. Objective To prove efficacy of ketamine and midazolam as an alternative for analgesia/sedation in asthma patients after polytrauma. Methods Using a model of Jahangir and colleagues [1] , 14 patients with multiple injuries and history of asthma were included during their ICU stay (nine spontaneously breathing, five mechanically ventilated). Patients were randomised into two groups. Group 1 patients received an infusion of ketamine and midazolam. The two drugs were mixed in one syringe (50 mg ketamine and 5 mg midazolam). The mean rate of infusion for ketamine was 150-250 ng/kg/hour and for midazolam was 0.015-0.03 ng/kg/hour. Midazolam was added to eliminate the side effects of ketamine and for sedation. Group 2 patients received an infusion of ketamine only (0.2-0.4 mg/kg/hour). The following parameters of haemodynamics and ventilation were monitored: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, arterial and end-expiratory PO 2 , arterial PO 2 , transcutaneous oxygen saturation SpO 2 , pulmonary compliance and resistance (in ventilated patients), and subjective perception of pain using the visual analogue scale (VAS 1-10 points), Ramsey sedation scale (wake and sleep levels), and rate of appearance of side effects. Ketamine in a mixture with midazolam led to insignificant changes in hemodynamics and only in group 2 patients were more significant changes noted (tachycardia and mild hypertension). Respiratory function remained well maintained except in some group 2 patients, where mild hyperventilation was noted. We documented an increase in respiratory compliance and a reduction in pulmonary resistance. Midazolam helped to prevent side effects after ketamine administration but after prolonged infusion of midazolam there were signs of an accumulation and an increase in doses was necessary. The VAS score (between 1 and 6) was almost similar in both groups. The Ramsey scale score was also similar (conscious level 3) but with some cases of agitation in group 2 patients. The population was ICU patients requiring IV PRDFG (rectal temperature ≥ 38°C, no enteral route). PRDFG (2 g) was infused over 15-20 min. The temperature, heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure (MAP) were recorded before, during and 15-120 min following infusion. Interventions to correct hypotension were recorded. Results Seventy-two events, in 14 patients, of PRDFG administration were recorded. MAP dropped significantly 15 min following PRDFG infusion. Initiation or increase of noradrenaline occurred in 25% of the events and fluid bolus was given in 8%. Conclusions PRDFG caused significant hypotension, requiring active intervention in 33% of the events. This data substantiated the anecdotal knowledge on the relationship between paracetamol (acetaminophen) and hypotension in the critically ill and associated it with the IV preparation. This prospective, randomized and controlled study aimed to compare the efficacy of two methods for analgesia in patients with chest trauma and rib fractures: continuous epidural catheter analgesia and regional intrapleural analgesia (RIPA). Seventy-three patients with unilateral chest trauma were randomized into two groups. In Group 1 patients we placed an epidural catheter (level -TH 8-10), and in Group 2 patients we placed an intrapleural catheter (level -fifth intercostal space). We used 1% lidocain for analgesia in both groups. The control group received intravenous analgesia with opioid. We applied 10 ml lidocain bolus to the intrapleural catheter four to six times per 24 hours and clamped the catheter for 10 min. For epidural analgesia we applied 50-100 mg lidocain and started continuous infusion at a rate of 2-3 mg/kg/hour, not exceeding a dose 400 mg lidocain per 24 hours. We monitored the level of thermohipanesthesia, the level of analgesia (Visual Aanalogue Scale -10 points), parameters of respiratory and cardiovascular function (respiratory rate, arterial O 2 oxygen saturation [SaO 2 ], heart rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, ability to expectorate). Thermohipanesthesia was unilateral and significantly shorter in Group 2 patients, whereas in Group 1 patients it was bilateral and of longer duration. The level of analgesia was similar in both groups (0-4 points) but in Group 2 patients it was achieved by more frequent applications of lidocain, which potentially is dangerous for toxicity. The respiratory rate decreased, O 2 and SaO 2 increased, and the ability to expectorate was improved. In Group 2 patients the heart rate and arterial blood pressure remained stable, and in Group 1 patients there were episodes of tachycardia and hypotension, which is undesirable in trauma patients. The technique of placing an intrapleural catheter is easier. Conclusion RIPA is an acceptable alternative to epidural analgesia in patients with thoracic trauma. Materials Forty-five patients (patients) were divided into two groups. Group I, 22 patients after CA, 17 men and five women, age 64 ± 13 years. CA was caused by ventricular fibrillation in 14 cases and by asystolia in eight. In 16 patients CA appeared in acute coronary syndrome. Fifty percent of patients died during hospital treatment. Group II, 23 patients, aged 60 ± 11 years, 20 men and three women, with stable coronary artery disease. In group I vein blood samples were taken just after CA and on two consecutive days at 8:00 am. In these patients we assessed the concentrations of hormones: adrenocortycotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (Cort), renin, aldosterone (Aldo), vasopressin (AVP) and N-terminated natriuretic propeptyde type B (NT-pBNP). In patients of group II, concentrations of the aforementioned hormones were assessed once from a blood sample taken at 8:00 am. Results were analyzed by statistical methods. Results Data (mean ± SD) are presented in Table 1 . In patients after CA who died in hospital, compared with patients after CA who survived, a markable higher concentration of Cort and Renin and lower ACTH and AVP were found. In this retrospective study, the electronic records of the 1207 patients who had serum cortisol levels drawn between March 2002 and August 2003 were reviewed and 163 patients who had a short corticotropin stimulation test done during an ICU admission because of septic shock were identified. Our cohort was divided into those who received Etomidate or not before the corticotropin stimulation test. The incidence of relative adrenal insufficiency was compared between these two groups. Data collected included demographics, presence of relative adrenal insufficiency, presence of coagulopathy, the use of steroids or any medication known to interfere with cortisol synthesis, use of Etomidate and the time interval between the administration and the cosyntropin test, history of adrenal/pituitary disease, and mortality. Relative adrenal insufficiency was defined as a response of 9 µg/dl or less after corticotropin stimulation. Septic shock was defined by the ACCP/SCCM criteria. Comparisons between groups were made using the chi-square test. The Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 200-250 g) underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); the cecum was punctured with a 18-gauge needle through and through to obtain two holes, and gentle pressure was applied on the ligated cecum to exteriorize a small amount of feces, followed by closure of the abdominal incision. Five hours later, these animals were then injected intraperitoneally with polyethylene glycol absorbed catalase; scavengers of hydrogen peroxide (A group), dimethyl sulfoxide; scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (B group), polyethylene glycol absorbed superoxide dismutase; scavengers of superoxide ions, or saline (control group). Survival was evaluated for 24 hours after CLP, and then surviving animals were sacrificed with carbon dioxide inhalation for outcome. The lung protein synthesis was evaluated with a nitrotyrosine/tyrosine ratio and oxidative damage in DNA was evaluated with the 8-oxodeoxyguanosine/ deoxyguanosine ratio in the homogenized lung tissue, which were measured by HPLC. Neutrophil accumulation in the lung was evaluated with myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression on these cells in the lung was evaluated with pathological examination. Results MPO, ICAM-1 expression, the nitrotyrosine/tyrosine ratio and the 8-oxodeoxyguanosine/deoxyguanosine ratio were significantly lower in all the scavenger-treated groups (A, B, C) than in the saline-treated group. However, there was no difference in the survival rate in all the groups (A, 33.3%; B, 20%; C, 0%; control, 27.7%). Conclusion Scavengers attenuate neutrophil accumulation and lung injury, but do not improve survival. These results suggest that factors other than lung injury may be responsible for mortality in this rat model of sepsis. However, additional studies of both superoxide in the early phase and late assessment of outcome are indicated. Conclusions As SH after cardiac surgery appears to be common and associated with major morbidity, levels should be routinely monitored. We have followed prospectively 104 cases of sepsis (33 cases of sepsis, 36 cases of severe sepsis and 35 cases of septic shock, according to ACCP/SCCM criteria) among neutropenic children aged from 2 to 16 years, with myeloproliferative diseases and solid tumors. The mean PRISM II score at the time of ICU admission for patients with sepsis was 9.17 ± 5.9, for severe sepsis was 19.46 ± 5.92, and was 28 ± 7.29 for patients with septic shock. We compared the percent of weight loss during the period of chemotherapy before sepsis onset among survivors and nonsurvivors. The control group included 25 children with leukemia and lymphoma, matching by age, gender and duration of treatment, and without septic complications. For the statistical analysis a t test was used. Results A decrease of body mass between 5.2% and 28% (mean 11.7 ± 6.45% weight loss during the previous 3.5 months) was found in 75.8% patients with sepsis, 77.7% with severe sepsis and 87.5% with septic shock. The differences in nutritional condition among survivors and nonsurvivors with weight loss and sepsis are summarized in Table 1 . In the control group weight loss was found in 37.1% patients, and the mean level of weight loss was 4.05 ± 1.48%, which was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in patients with sepsis. There was no mortality in the control group. The mortality rate in patients with sepsis was 21.2%, in severe sepsis was 61%, and in septic shock was 85.7%. The study took place in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the University Surgical Department of Hippocration Hospital. The procedure involves input of patient data such as age, weight, and sex, along with data relevant to the clinical status of the patient, as well as treatment details. Specialized software can then analyze this data, determine nutritional parameters by implementing evidencebased equations, and calculate accurately an individual patient's daily nutritional needs in total energy, protein, hydrocarbons, fat, vitamins, minerals as well as the concentrations of each nutrient and total EN volume that will be administered on a 24-hour basis. The software was designed for monitoring the administered regimen and alarm in any case of mismatched calculation (according to the underlying disease, the clinical status and the nutritional parameters of the patient), and for informing the user about any metabolic complication that is likely to occur (according to the laboratory tests of the patient). For the purpose of this study, computer-calculated EN regimens were administered to 30 randomly selected patients in our unit and were then compared with the regimens, which would be administered without the help of the computer. We reviewed the records of the patients who suffered unexpected cardiac arrest during an 18-month period in a tertiary teaching hospital, in a tertiary trauma hospital and in two secondary hospitals. Data on patient characteristics and observations and interventions during the 8 hours preceding cardiac arrest were collected. The findings were evaluated against the calling criteria of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) [1] . The study took place in a high-fidelity patient simulator. A scenario of a witnessed cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation was used that occurred after a uneventful period of 2 min. Twentyfour teams, each consisting of three physicians, were randomly assigned to one of two versions of the scenario: version R (reality) mimics reality in that the arrest occurs in the presence of one physician and the remaining two physicians are summoned to help; in version A (all present) all three physicians were present at the moment of the arrest. The performance of the teams was rated using videotapes recorded during simulations. The first meaningful measure (FMM) was defined as either precordial thump, ventilation, cardiac massage, or defibrillation. Completion of the initial phase (CIP) was defined as three countershocks, initiation of mask ventilation and cardiac massage, and injection of epinephrine. We retrospectively reviewed the case notes of all children under the age of 16 years who were admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit in Southampton General Hospital following a head injury in whom intracranial pressure monitoring was undertaken over a 4-year period. ICP, CPP and mean arterial pressure were evaluated hourly and means were calculated for the first 6 and 24 hours after ICP monitoring. The primary outcome measure was survival and children were categorised into three groups; Group 1, overall functioning within the normal range; Group 2, survival but with some neurological impairment; and Group 3, died as a result of their injuries. An autologous fibrin-rich clot was introduced in the common carotid artery. Two hours after embolization, placebo, enoxaparin, tirofiban, or enoxaparin/tirofiban was infused intravenously over 30 min. The neurologic deficit was evaluated using a neuroscore 24 and 48 hours after the stroke. The incidences of ICH and infarct volume were evaluated through histologic analysis. We defined the sickest critically ill patients as those with a first day APACHE III predicted mortality rate of 80% or higher. Among 43,605 ICU admissions entered in the APACHE III database from 1994 to 2002, 15,512 stayed in the ICU for 3 or more days and 748 (1.7%) had a first day predicted mortality rate of 80% or higher. Only 308 of the 748 patients (41%) survived 3 days in the ICU. Excluding six patients who did not authorize their medical records to be reviewed for research, 302 admissions were included in the study. Demographics, first and third day APSs and probability of hospital death, and date of death were obtained. We retrieved 333 patients from our prospective collected database from January to December 2000. Age, diagnosis, APACHE II score, BE and LAC at entrance and after 24 hours of admission were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, the former being based on a matrix of collinearity (Pearson coefficient ≥ 0.4 denotes collinearity) and on the results of the univariate analysis. A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve was built to identify the best predictive value for mortality. Conclusion Patients with prolonged stay form a small percentage of ICU patients. There are few early predictors that are universally significant or important when determining prolonged ICU LOS. Many factors appear to be specific to subgroups and thus may limit broad applicability of general ICU scoring systems to specialized populations. Results A total of 2372 mechanically ventilated patients were included (mean age 68 years, 62% male, 42% cardiovascular, 22% pulmonary, 8% neurologic and 28% other reasons for MV), in 74% intubation (ITN) and MV was performed emergently. On the first day 44% of the patients were ventilated with the bilevel positive airway pressure modus and 39% with the continuous positive pressure ventilation modus. Duration of MV was 2 (1-7) days, and length of CICU stay 20.5 (13-32) days. Overall, 47.3% patients died. Figure 1 shows the distribution of HM in 21 CICUs including > 50 patients in the registry (range HM 33-70%). Emergent ITN, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ITN in hospital, shock, sepsis, pneumonia, ventricular tachycardia/ fibrillation and sudden cardiac death were associated with HM in an univariate analysis. Limitations Admission severity of illness was not assessed as well as organ dysfunction during the CICU stay and causes of death. Conclusion Mortality is high in mechanically ventilated patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. The BEAT registry provides important data for benchmarking and is a first step towards quality improvement in this subset of critically ill patients with high mortality and morbidity. Introduction Intensive care physicians are facing a growing number of immunocompromised patients. The evidence on how immunosuppression impacts on ICU outcome is poor. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare immunocompromised patients with immunocompetent patients with regard to their ICU outcome and, furthermore, to identify prognostic factors. Methods Over a period of 36 months, 656 patients were referred to a medical eight-bed ICU of a university hospital. Of these, 190 were categorized as immunocompromised. Immunosuppression was defined as an absolute neutrophil count < 1000/µl (n = 66) at admission, or the administration of immunosuppressive drugs (IS) prior to admission (n = 124). IS used usually were corticosteroids and cyclosporine, more rarely FK 506, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. We recorded demographic data, reason for admission, APACHE III score, occurrence of septic shock and the need and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). The primary endpoint of the study was ICU survival. The groups were compared by Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables (univariate analysis). Using a multivariate logistic regression model, we controlled for several risk factors. We examined all nonfederal hospital discharges in 1999 from six US states. We selected patients hospitalized with SA and defined severe SA as SA with ICU admission. We excluded Medicare patients and focused on working-age adults (18-64 years), classifying insurance as commercial, Medicaid, and uninsured. We assigned comorbidity using the Charlson-Deyo index. We examined the association between insurance status and mechanical ventilation (MV), hospital costs, and hospital mortality. Conclusion A large proportion of patients survived > 5 years and reported a good HRQL. Considering the severity of illness and the patients' outcome, ECPS and costs per QALY were low compared with other therapeutic approaches (e.g. beta-blocker postmyocardial infarction, €20,000 per added life year).
