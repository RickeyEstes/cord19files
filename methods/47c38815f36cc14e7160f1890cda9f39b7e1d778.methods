Google Trends, an online tracking system of Internet hit-search volumes that recently merged with its sister project Google Insights for Search (Google Inc.) , was used to explore Internet activity related to the Ebola epidemic. The portal determines the proportion of searches for user-specified terms among all searches performed using Google. It then provides a relative search volume (RSV), which is the query share of a particular term for a given location and time period, normalised by the highest query share of that term over the time series and presented on a scale from 0 to 100. Each point of the graph generated by GT is divided by the highest point, which is conventionally set at 100. Google Trends was mined from 29 December 2013 to 14 June 2015 to cover the entire period of the Ebola outbreak. "Ebola" and "Ebola"-related terms were searched also in local languages of the three most affected West Africa countries. For each keyword, the queries were performed with a keyword being used both as the "search term" and the "search topic". Using the first option, GT searched the exact string of text typed by the user, while using the second option all searches related to the query and automatically suggested by GT were included; this latter option is still under testing (beta function). It is possible to search for up to five queries each time [21] . We descriptively analysed the changes in web search queries at the global level and in all countries where primary cases of Ebola were registered (namely, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, US, Spain, UK and Italy) over the entire period of the outbreak, and evaluated the correlation with news headlines reported using Google News. Furthermore, we analysed top queries and rising queries related to the search term or search topic, and assessed both the interest at global level and the regional interest at country level in Ebola on the web. Pearson's correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related RSVs with the number of Ebola cases retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, available at http://apps.who.int/gho/data/ node.ebola-sitrep (last accessed on 17 August 2015) [1] . Numbers of weekly and overall cases of Ebola were used for the correlation. In particular, both data from the WHO patient databases and situation reports were analysed. The strength of correlation was measured using the system described by Taylor [22] . Multivariate regression was performed using Ebolarelated RSV as a dependent variable, and epidemiological data (overall number of Ebola cases) and the Human Development Index (HDI) as predictor variables. This led to the creation of different mathematical models. The HDI was used to correct raw GT data, enabling a comparison to be made among the different countries and socio-economic contexts. The HDI was retrieved from the official website of the United Nations Development Programme, available at http://hdr.undp.org/en/2014-report (last accessed on 17 August 2015). The HDI is a composite statistical indicator, which combines life expectancy, education and income indices as proxies of country development. The Index is not based on economic growth alone and is able to capture the potential development of a country. The HDI was preferred to the Internet Penetration Index because the latter underweights the real use of the Internet, especially in low-and middle-income countries, where access to the web is limited and occurs mainly from public places such as Internet points and cyber cafes [23] . Moreover, in recent years, the use of mobile phones has increased dramatically, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, igniting a revolution in Internet access [24] . It has been demonstrated that a strong positive correlation exists between the number of mobile phone subscribers and HDI, especially in African countries [25] . It is also noteworthy that a positive correlation exists between HDI and Internet usage or penetration in Africa, although it is not as significant as it is in Europe and other developed countries [26] . The last available data for HDI (year 2013) were used. Computation was done using SPSS software v21.0.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, US). Values â‰¤0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data on the number of Ebola cases and the GT index are available as supplementary material. Figure 1a shows the first five queries generating the highest RSV values at a global level, namely "Ebola", "Ebola virus", "Virus Ebola", "Ebola 2014" and "2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak". The keyword that yielded the greatest RSV was "Ebola", searched using the "search term" option. "Ebola" was searched seven times more than the second-listed query (data not shown). Considering the term "Ebola", the date of 16 October 2014 had the highest index score of 100: on this particular day, President Obama issued a press release calling upon the National Guard reserves to help to contain the Ebola virus. A smaller peak (RSV = 46/100), registered on 8 August 2014, corresponded with the headline in the Belfast Telegraph "WHO declares Ebola emergency". Despite quantitative differences in terms of RSV, the curves generated by the five listed queries observed a similar trend over time. Other searches conducted using the "search topic" option, or in local languages using the "search term" option, did not yield any detectable RSV (data not shown).
