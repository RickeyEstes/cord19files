The present study was divided into two parts: in the first one, we characterized the symptomatic respiratory subjects attending the ER at Hospital de Cl ınicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), during 1 year (November 2008 to October 2009). In the second part, we included patients with respiratory symptoms ≤5 days to determine the prevalence of RVI; this part was conducted during 2 years (November 2008 to October 2010). In the first year of the study, we also collected climate and air pollution data.
