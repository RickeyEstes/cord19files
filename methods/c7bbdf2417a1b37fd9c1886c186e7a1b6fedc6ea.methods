We performed an in-depth bibliometric analysis of all publications during the first five volumes covering the period from October 25, 2012 to October 25, 2016 through a joint search using the publication name "Infectious Diseases of Poverty" in PubMed, Web of Science (WOS) (formerly ISI Web of Knowledge) and the journal's website. We also compared with two other journals in this area, International Journal of Infectious Diseases and BMC Infectious Diseases. The publication data and metrics of IDP, International Journal of Infectious Diseases and BMC Infectious Diseases were collected using these journals' homepages, submission systems and the WOS Citation Database as of 20th February, 2017. We used ordinary descriptive statistics to analyse the performance of IDP during its first five years supported by BioMed Central's databases [23] .
