The conformational epitopes on the protein surface are predicted by an automated sequence analysis of all phage display sequences and a comparison to the distributions of amino acids on three-dimensional patches on the protein surface. The amino acid compositions of the linear and 3D profiles are compared and quantified in a score function for each patch on the protein surface. The highest scoring patches are listed in the output files and are also displayed on the surface of the protein. An overview of the implemented procedure in EpiSearch is given in Figure 1 .
