Sequences and phylogenetic analysis. The full length sequences of OC43 S gene available in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were retrieved on 30 May 2013, and analyzed together with the sequences identified previously by our group 17 . A total of 96 full-length S gene sequences obtained from clinical samples were used for analysis. The sequences were aligned using Clustal W program implement in MEGA 5.1 26 . The genotypes of these sequences were determined as reported 15, 17 , including 12 genotype B, 18 genotype C, five genotype E and 61 genotype D. The background information of the sequences including accession numbers, collection dates, isolation areas, and genotypes can be found as Supplementary Table S1 online. Evolutionary analysis. The demographic histories and evolution rates of different OC43 genotypes were determined based on S gene sequence data by the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Bayesian MCMC) method implemented in BEAST (v1.8.1), using a relaxed molecular clock (uncorrelated lognormal-distributed model) 27 . The best substitution models were selected using Modeltest (version3.7) according to Akaike information criterion (AIC) 28 . The constant size and exponential growth tree models were used for the inference. Each Bayesian MCMC analysis was run for 100 million states and sampled every 2,000 states. Posterior probabilities were calculated using Tracer (version 1.5). The trees were annotated by the Tree Annotator program implemented in the BEAST package and the MCC tree was visualized using Figtree software (version 1.3.1). Bayesian skyline plots for OC43 genotypes were estimated to depict the relative viral genetic diversity over time.
