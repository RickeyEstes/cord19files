The data presented are part of a prospective study on the aetiology of childhood respiratory infections being carried out at Santa Casa de Misericórdia Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil. Santa Casa is a tertiary reference hospital located in the central region of São Paulo City. From January 2008 to December 2008, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children aged <2 years and screened for respiratory viruses including HBoV. Two groups of children were screened: (1) children on the paediatric ward or intensive care unit (ICU) with clinically suspected LRT infection (either community-or hospital-acquired), and (2) infants who had been in the neonatal ICU (NICU) since birth. On the NICU, NPAs were collected from those with suspected LRT infection, and once a week from asymptomatic infants who were receiving mechanical ventilation. NPAs were stored in liquid nitrogen and sent weekly to the virology laboratory of the University of São Paulo for detection of respiratory virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 9 All samples were tested for the following respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza virus A and B and adenovirus. PCR and reverse transcription (RT)ePCR assays were developed based on previous publications using GeneScan analysis with primers previously described. 10e12 PCR for HBoV was performed using primers previously described targeting the NS1 gene. 13 All HBoV-positive samples were amplified by a second PCR using primers based on a conserved region of the VP1/VP2 gene: HBoVP1 (5 0 4128 ACCACCAAGTACTTAGAACTGG 4149 3 0 ) and HBoVP2 (3 0 4785 AATAGTGCCTGGAGGATGATCC 4765 5 0 ). The expected product size was 657 bp. In most cases these products were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were edited with the sequence navigator program version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and the phylogenetic tree was created by the clustal method using Megalign (Lacergene, DNA STAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Santa Casa de Misericórdia Hospital and by the University of São Paulo. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each child enrolled in the study.
