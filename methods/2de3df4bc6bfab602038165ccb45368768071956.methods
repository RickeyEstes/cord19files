The Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) Library search services team was commissioned to undertake a literature search encompassing all NHP research sponsored by the MRC, Wellcome Trust and BBSRC published in UK scientific or medical journals indexed by Medline from January 1997 to July 2012. Access to full texts was sought using Europe PubMed Central, Internet search engines, Athens and the RSM Library e-journal resource in turn, failing which access was purchased through the RSM Library. Full texts were scrutinised for medical relevance.
