The outputs produced here using the various equations in Table 1 are referred to as models because they allow the effect on K a or vector competence of changing the variables n and temperature together with the thermodynamic/kinetic parameters to be assessed. The model outputs were calculated with Microsoft Excel. The basic thermodynamic and kinetic equations can be obtained from most advanced Biochemistry or Physical Chemistry text books. Nomenclature: The terminology for the "receptor" and "virus" subscripts used in the thermodynamic parameters (e.g. ΔH a_receptor and ΔH a_virus ) is adopted from Xiong et al. (2013) where "receptor" represents the interaction between GP and Cr and "virus" represents the interaction between whole virus and host cell. Thus for example, although Equation 3 does not specifically refer to GP and host cell, ΔH a_virus would formally be defined as the difference in enthalpy between a host cell with a bound whole virus (product) and the sum of the enthalpies of a free whole virus and a free host cell (reactants) while ΔH a_receptor is defined as the difference in enthalpy between the GP.Cr complex (product) and the sum of the enthalpies of an unbound GP and an unbound Cr (reactants). In thermodynamics it is the differences in enthalpies as represented by ΔH a_receptor and ΔH a_virus that are quantified and used rather than the absolute enthalpies of the "reactants" and "products" which are generally unknown. The same applies to the entropy and the Gibbs free energy.
