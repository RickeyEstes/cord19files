To investigate the role of frequent travelers in the exportation of asymptomatic cases during the early stages of an epidemic, we simulated outbreaks of both a SARS-like and an infl uenza-like airborne respiratory infection in a population in which a small proportion of the population make many more trips than the rest of the population. In the early stages of an epidemic, chance events are important because the number of infected persons is small. We simulated these early stages by using a stochastic model for which every simulation is different. We present both the mean behavior of the simulations and the range of possible outcomes across a large number of simulations. In a stochastic model, introduction of 1 infected person has a fi nite probability of resulting in the rapid extinction of an infectious disease. To increase the probability of initiating an outbreak, we introduced 3 asymptomatic persons into the population. We simulated the outbreak in a large extended metropolitan area with a population of 10 7 persons. The structure of the model is illustrated schematically in Figure 1A . The population is divided into 2 subpopulations with different frequencies of taking international fl ights. A small proportion of the population, r, are highfrequency fl iers. Most of the population, 1 -r, are lowfrequency fl iers. Frequent fl iers have contact with other frequent fl iers and with the general population. Similarly, the general population has contact with persons in the general population and with frequent fl iers. Contacts are more likely to be between persons within each group (frequent fl iers or general population), but the level of this assortativeness may vary (parameterized by φ). Contacts may be made completely randomly, with the likelihood of meeting a person from the frequent-fl ying group or the general population being proportional to the number of persons in each population (φ = 1). At the other extreme, persons may only have contact with other persons in the same group (φ = 0). The true mixing pattern is likely to lie between these 2 extremes. The extent to which the high-frequency and low-frequency fl iers mix will determine how quickly a disease will spread from the general population to the frequent fl iers and vice versa. We simulated the model for a selection of mixing parameters, ranging from wholly random (φ = 1) to moderate and high levels of assortativeness (φ = 0.5, 0.25, respectively). For comparison, we also simulated a homogeneous model in which the entire population travels equally frequently. The outbreak is modeled by dividing the population into those who are still susceptible to the disease, those who have contracted the disease and are in the latent stage, those who are infectious and symptomatic, and those who have recovered from the disease ( Figure 1 ). This division is similar to the basic structure used in several recent papers on the role of international travel in the spread of infectious diseases (8, 9, 12) . This model structure can be adapted to many airborne infections because it allows for an asymptomatic period, which may or may not be infectious, followed by a potentially symptomatic period during which transmission can also occur. In our stochastic model, events (such as infection or a person leaving the source area) occur by chance. For example, the time after symptom onset at which a person recovers from infection with SARS is not a fi xed quantity; rather, it is a randomly chosen time from an exponential probability distribution with a mean of 10 days. Table 1 shows the average latent and infectious periods used. The probability of leaving the country is constant for all persons ( Table 1) . The probability of a susceptible person becoming infected increases as a larger proportion of the population becomes infected and is chosen so that the average number of new infections caused by each infected person in the early stages of the epidemic is equal to the basic reproductive number R 0 (2.5 for SARS, 1.8 for infl uenza; Table 1 ). The epidemic is simulated by evaluating the probability that any person is infected, becomes symptomatic, or recovers in any short time interval (we divide time into sequential short intervals of one fi ftieth of a day), and then testing whether that event occurs. The simulation can be thought of as generating a random number between 0 and 1 for each person in each time step. If this random number is less than the probability of a particular event occurring to that person, then the event occurs. Otherwise, the person is left in his or her current state. The model does not store the details of every person separately but keeps track of the number of persons who are susceptible (S), latently infected (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) at any point in time. As events occur, these variables change. For example, when a person becomes infected, S decreases by 1 and E increases by 1. Because the events occur by chance, the total number of persons who are in each state, including the number of infected persons taking fl ights, varies stochastically. In our model, we assume that those who are in the latent stage of the disease are not infectious for SARS and infl uenza. This is generally accepted to be a good model for SARS because isolation of symptomatic persons prevented onward transmission of SARS, which indicated that the latent period has limited or no infectivity (15) . We also assume that all infectious persons are symptomatic. This is a conservative assumption, but serosurveillance studies for SARS have shown low prevalence of seropositivity in persons who did not show symptoms of disease (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . Lastly, we assume that all symptomatic persons are prevented from traveling because of symptom severity or effective screening. The model equations are shown in the online Technical Appendix (available from www.cdc.gov/ EID/content/13/9/1288-Techapp.pdf). The disease course of a possible future infl uenza pandemic is not known. However, studies of previous pandemics and seasonal epidemics suggest a possible scenario in which the latent period of infl uenza may be infectious and not all infected persons will show symptoms (14, (22) (23) (24) . This means that a larger proportion of cases could be allowed to travel on international fl ights, even with 100% effective screening, because they are asymptomatically infected ( Figure 1, panel B) . We have modeled a conservative scenario, in which infl uenza has a disease life history similar to that of SARS, but with shorter latent and infectious periods ( Table 1 ). The inclusion of partially effective screening or, equivalently, the inclusion of asymptomatic cases would lead to more cases being exported than is shown here. Little data are available across a population for the relative frequency of fl ying. The mean probability of fl ying for the whole population can be approximated by the number of airline passengers divided by the population of a country or city. This calculation gives estimates of 0.005 for Hong Kong, 0.0005 for Beijing, and 0.0002 for Thailand (9) . We modeled a population of 10 million persons with a 0.005 probability of fl ying per day as an example of an outbreak in a well-connected city. A study on domestic fl ying in Norway suggested that ≈2% of a survey population who take domestic fl ights in Norway make >20 journeys a year (1). This survey did not include persons who do not take fl ights. Therefore, the proportion of the total population who make this many journeys is likely to be lower. On the basis of this data, we present results for a population in which 1% of the population travel 20× more frequently than the rest of the population and discuss results for different values of these parameters. We investigated the effect of setting where the outbreak is initiated by using 2 scenarios. In the fi rst scenario, the outbreak begins among the general, infrequently fl ying population. Cases subsequently occur among highfrequency fl iers as a result of contact between the 2 subpopulations. The mean time until the fi rst high-frequency fl ier becomes infected is a function of the incidence rate in the main population and level of mixing between the 2 groups. In the second scenario, the outbreak begins among the high-frequency fl iers. The disease again spreads to the main population because of contacts between the groups, with the mean time until this occurs being a function of the incidence rate in the main population and the level of mixing between the 2 groups. Proportion of population who are high-frequency fliers r 0-0.5 Mixing between groups: φ = 1, random mixing; φ = 0, assortative mixing The mean cumulative number of cases exported (across 50,000 simulations) is presented for both SARS-like and infl uenza-like parameters (Table 1) , for initiation of the epidemic among the low-frequency and high-frequency fl iers, and for a range of mixing between the high-frequency and low-frequency travelers. We also illustrate variability in simulated outcomes by presenting snapshots of the distributions of the cumulative number of exported cases.
