Study setting. Consecutive patients undergoing FEVAR or BEVAR between February 2006 and October 2013 in a tertiary vascular unit (Henri Mondor Hospital, Créteil) were included. Patients were treated for CAAAs and TAAAs. CAAAs included short-necked infrarenal, juxtarenal, pararenal, and suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms, considered unsuitable for conventional EVAR. TAAAs were classified according to the Crawford classification. 2 In our institution, all patients with CAAAs and TAAAs are considered for open, hybrid, or endovascular repair in a multidisciplinary meeting including vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and anesthesiologists. Demographic, anatomic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were recorded by means of a prospectively collected database. Preoperative assessment and device sizing. All patients underwent a high-resolution computed tomography scan preoperatively and before discharge. Procedure planning and device sizing were performed with a dedicated three-dimensional vascular imaging workstation (Aquarius WS; TeraRecon Inc, Mateo, Calif) with centerline luminal reconstructions. The aneurysm morphology was assessed by a vascular surgeon (M.M.) and an interventional radiologist (H.K.), both with considerable experience with EVAR. Device designs proposed by the implanting physicians were systematically reviewed and approved by the planning center of the corresponding device manufacturer. Details of procedures. Procedures were performed in an angiography suite (Philips FD20; Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, Ohio) in a sterile environment. An experienced proctor physician was present during the procedure for the first five Cook fenestrated cases, the first two Cook branched cases, and the first fenestrated Anaconda and Ventana cases. Eight physician-modified fenestrated stent grafts were excluded. For each device, the implantation techniques have been described previously. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Control angiograms were obtained once each target vessel was cannulated with a long sheath, after deployment of bridging covered stents in each target vessel, and at the end of the procedure. Each control angiogram was saved and images were stored in a database. Technical problems and subsequent IOAEs were also recorded in the database. Definitions. IOAEs were defined as any intraoperative complication or technical problem occurring during stent graft implantation that required additional and unexpected endovascular manipulations. IOAEs were classified in three distinct types: Type 1: Problems with target vessel cannulation; Type 2: Malpositioning of one of the following graft components: bridging stents, bifurcated component, or iliac extensions; and Type 3: Difficulty with intraoperative access. Complications were defined according to the Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. 10 Only moderate and severe complications were reported in the current series. Study protocol. A radiologist (H.K.) and a vascular surgeon (F.C.) reviewed intraoperative and postoperative data recorded in the prospectively maintained FEVAR or BEVAR database and all intraoperative angiograms for each patient to identify IOAEs. Both clinicians also participated in the majority of the procedures. To evaluate the clinical consequences of IOAEs for postoperative outcome, the composite end point Table II . The mean (standard deviation) number of target vessels per patient was 2.8 6 0.8. Clinical outcomes and IOAEs. The overall inhospital mortality was 8.0% (9 of 113 patients). Inhospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively (Table III) . A total of 28 moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 (18.6%) patients (Table IV) ; 17 complications were related to IOAEs, and 11 occurred without any IOAE. In patients with TAAAs, complete paraplegia occurred in three cases (12.5%). Two other patients presented with paraparesis that resolved completely after spinal fluid drainage. In the CAAA group, one patient with a juxtarenal aneurysm who underwent fenestrated stent grafting with three fenestrations presented with hypoesthesia of both limbs that resolved completely after spinal fluid drainage. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients ( (Table V) . The incidence of IOAEs was not significantly different in patients who underwent a Cook fenestrated stent graft compared with patients who underwent an Anaconda or a Ventana fenestrated stent graft. The incidence of IOAE did not change over time (Fig) . Type 1 IOAEs (problems with target vessel cannulation) occurred in 22 of 113 cases (19.4%), resulting in death (n ¼ 3) or moderate to severe complication (n ¼ 10) in 13 patients (59.1%). They led to target vessel loss in five cases (22.7%). Details of type 1 IOAEs, intraoperative management, and related outcomes are given in Table VI. Type 2 IOAEs (malpositioning of one of the graft components) occurred in 5 of 113 cases (4.4%), resulting in death or complication in two patients (Table VII) . Type 3 IOAEs (related to access site problems) occurred in 10 of 113 patients (8.8%), leading to early postoperative death in one patient and moderate to severe complications in another six patients (Table VIII) .
