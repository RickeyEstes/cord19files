The NICU was a 21-bed unit requiring special access for entry and staffed by 35 nurses and 35 physicians. Infants admitted to the NICU were delivered at the hospital, transferred from surrounding community hospitals, or transferred from other university hospitals when census exceeding capacity. We reviewed records of newborns admitted to the NICU between January 1997 and December 1998. We identified those who met the criteria for definite and advanced NEC, as proposed by Bell 3 : history of perinatal stressor (prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary disease, abnormalities of labor/delivery, multiple birth, maternal or infant infection, umbilical catheter, or exchange transfusion), systemic signs of illness (temperature instability, lethargy, apnea, bradycardia, deterioration of vital signs, shock, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage), gastrointestinal signs or symptoms (poor feeding, increasing pregavage results, emesis, or occult blood in stool, plus persistent blood in stool or marked abdominal distention), and abnormal abdominal radiographic findings (significant bowel distention with ileus, bowel wall edema, peritoneal fluid, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal vein gas, or pneumoperitoneum). We calculated monthly attack rates expressed as the number of NEC cases per 100 admissions to the NICU. Monthly attack rates were plotted as a function of time. We compared incidence densities with a Poisson model, as described by Rothman and Greenland. 5 From medical records and nursing notes, we logged the bed assignments of affected newborns from admission to illness onset and applied the Grimson test for spatial clustering. This statistical test examines the geographic locations of ill and non-ill persons by comparing the observed number of adjacent borders shared by persons in the illness-containing area with an expected number with the assumption (null hypothesis) that ill persons are randomly distributed throughout the area being assessed. 6 We conducted a case-control study categorizing as cases the newborns in the NICU with a gestational age at birth Ͻ34 weeks in whom NEC developed in January 1998. We categorized as control subjects the newborns in the NICU with a gestational age at birth Ͻ34 weeks in whom NEC did not develop. Newborns with a gestational age at birth Ͼ34 weeks were excluded. We abstracted demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data from the medical records of the newborns and their respective mothers by means of a standardized form. Demographic data collected included date of birth, sex, race, weight and gestational age at birth, and birth order, when applicable. Clinical data included Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life; evidence of severe (Ͻ10th percentile of weight for age) intrauterine growth retardation; age at first enteral feeding and type of feedings; administration of antibiotics and duration of antibiotic therapy; administration of total parenteral nutrition, indomethacin, caffeine, surfactant, histamine 2 blocking agents, corticosteroid, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and cardiovascular pressor agents; diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus, and respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease and patent ductus arteriosus; place-ment of umbilical catheter; intubation and duration of intubation; exchange transfusion; and death. Epidemiologic data gathered the names of staff members providing care, as documented in the medical record, to the day of NEC diagnosis for cases and to the day of discharge for control subjects. From the mother's medical record, we recorded age at delivery of the newborn; history of prenatal care, cocaine use during pregnancy, and pre-eclampsia; human immunodeficiency virus status, when known; prolonged rupture of membranes and its duration; administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics; and history of gastrointestinal illness in the 2 weeks before delivery. Stool samples were collected from neonates in whom NEC developed. Bacterial cultures for Salmonella species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species, Aeromonas species, Yersinia species, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were performed, as was an assay for Clostridium difficile toxin. Stools were evaluated with microscopic examination for ova and parasites and with special stains to identify Cryptosporidium. Viral testing included general viral tissue cultures and enzyme immunoassay for rotavirus antigen. Remaining aliquots of stool samples were examined with electron microscopy and subsequently sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia) for viral molecular diagnostics. We compared characteristics of newborns in whom NEC developed during the outbreak with newborns of any gestational age at birth in whom NEC had developed in the 7 months preceding the outbreak. The medical records of these newborns were reviewed, and demographic and clinical data were extracted in a manner comparable with that used in the case-control study. The clinical data collected included more detailed information on illness presentation, course, and outcome. We recorded presence of apnea; occult blood in stools; initial, maximum, and minimum leukocyte counts with corresponding differential values; maximum and minimum platelet counts; evidence of severe growth retardation; emesis; description of physical findings on abdominal examination (distention, tenderness); presence of lethargy; documentation of temperature instability; evidence of pneumoperitoneum and persistently dilated bowel loops on abdominal radiography; documented hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; intubation; surgery; and death. Data from both comparisons were compiled and analyzed with EpiInfo software version 6.04 (Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). The statistical test of significance for continuous variables was Wilcoxon rank sum; for dichotomous variables, we calculated odds ratios with 95% CIs, by using 2 and Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Two-tailed P-values Ͻ.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
