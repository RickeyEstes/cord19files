Daejeon is one of the largest cities located central in South Korea, and its population is 1.48 millions. The Catholic University of Korea Daejeon St Mary's Hospital is one of 5 general hospitals (> 600 beds) in the city and has 670 beds for children and adults. During the epidemic in Korea as the same period of this study (September 1st, 2009 to January 31st, 2010), 5 general hospitals, including our institution in Daejeon, performed the primary care for the outpatient and inpatient cases according to the Korea government policy, as the strategic positional hospitals for 2009 H1N1 flu. Therefore, the policies of patient care, including use of diagnostic tool (RT-PCR) and antivirals (oseltmivir), were similar among general hospitals in large cities in Korea. The subjects of this study were all patients who were positive diagnostic RT-PCR (AccuPower™ in Korea, BiONEER, Alameda, CA, USA) on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and visited our institution during epidemic period in Korea. For the evaluation of epidemiological characteristics of 2009 H1N1 flu, a total of 4,463 patients were analysed. In addition, we reviewed the medical records and chest radiographic findings of 373 inpatients (217 children, ≤ 15 y and 156 adults, > 16 y) for the evaluation of clinical characteristics. To compare the clinical and laboratory findings according to age, we divided the subjects into 4 age groups: the 0-15 y group, the 16-40 y group, the 41-64 y group and the ≥ 65 y group. The patients that were less than or equal to 15 y were treated in the Department of Paediatrics, and the patients that were greater than 16 y were treated in the Department of Internal Medicine. Some data compiled in this study regarding the ≤ 15 group was previously published [16] . The first day of fever and/or severe respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea were regarded as the first day of illness. Fever was defined as greater than 38°C using an eardrum thermometer. Pneumonia was defined as any infiltration on chest radiographic findings with clinical symptoms such as fever and cough. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic University of Korea, Daejeon St Mary's Hospital.
