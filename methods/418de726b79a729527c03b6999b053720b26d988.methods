We used qualitative content analysis as it is able to provide meaningful insights and generalizations that may not be possible in quantitative analysis. This is particularly helpful in evaluating characteristics of professional emergency managers and how they relate to multidisciplines in disaster management (Fig. 1 ). In addition, we used comparative perspective, while focusing on qualitative content analysis. Similarly, we used qualitative data in this paper. Qualitative data are useful in studying disaster management as they may describe qualities, features, or certain characteristics relevant to disaster management including stakeholders' behavior, human relations, effective strategies, and other information (Gorodzinsky et al., 2015) . Further, those qualities are helpful in analyzing the disciplinary status of professional emergency managers or in examining the interaction between emergency managers and disaster management. To elaborate, we primarily used several databases for qualitative data collection. In the case of English data, we relied on traditional scholarly journal articles. In the case of Korean data, we utilized Korean databases to include DBpia, KISS, and government websites. We typed some keywords such as emergency managers, unidisciplinary study, multidisciplinary study, and Korean disaster management, among others. In terms of English data analysis, we evaluated data on the U.S. emergency managers that indicate many significant lessons for Korea. When thinking that Korean data did not directly analyze many things about its emergency managers, we had no choice but to qualitatively interpret them. We maintain that Korea has to transform its current emergency managers' unidisciplinary approach into a multidisciplinary approach. In a unidisciplinary setup, the decision-making process is linear whereas in a multidisciplinary approach, inputs come from multiple areas and there is an opportunity to evaluate before concretizing a decision (as reflected by the 'decision box' in the flowchart). To systematically compare two disciplinary approaches, we initiated listing important stakeholders surrounding emergency managers in Korea by relying on many qualitative techniques, such as analyzing government documents, discussions with experts, Internet searches, and others. The list included the MPSS, local governments, disaster management trainers, industries, job applicants, and others. Finally, we chose four major stakeholder areas, namely government policies, college curricula, NGOs' emergency-manager certification, and mass media coverage. The identified stakeholders and emergency managers are expected to play a number of roles within the field of emergency and disaster management (Kim et al., 2015; Yo, 2014) . For emergency managers, the exercise of their responsibilities will depend on which stakeholder they deal with at a given time in the (disaster) lifecycle. With all the above in mind, we have attempted to draw international implications for many other nations later. When the sinking of ferry Sewol happened around Jindo Island in 2014, unidisciplined maritime policemen attempted to rescue passengers with minimal success. Even though they were accustomed to dealing with maritime accidents, the maritime policemen were unable to consider important issues such as disaster victims' psychological needs, the operation of rapid and complex disaster management, interaction with other institutions, and how to use public information officer(s). After rescuing only 172 out of 476 passengers, the public became angry at the poor disaster management actions of the maritime policemen, causing the President to dismantle the institution, which is the NEMA (Hong, 2016) . The procedures followed by emergency managers during the Sewol ferry incident are considered typical of the unidisciplinary approach. Only three professionals, namely firefighters, civil engineers, and maritime police make up the MPSS, which is a comprehensive disaster management agency in Korea (MPSS, 2016) . Since the ferry Sewol sinking in 2014, the MPSS has placed most of the emphasis on maritime accidents as well as house fires and flood accompanied by typhoon. Therefore, those who are dealing with each hazard have also turned into the emergency managers for those fields or areas. Each professional under the MPSS has strongly wanted to dominate the field of disaster management in Korea. In particular, the competition between firefighters and civil engineers has been fierce in terms of budget allocation. Not much collaboration has been observed among the three professionals. Further, other professionals such as humanists, natural scientists, mechanical engineers, lawyers, sociologists, and public administrators have not been allowed to work for disaster management. Under politics-oriented management, each of the three emergency managers has come to embrace his or her own principles based on their own disciplines or areas of expertise. 4.1.2. College curricula. Korean health workers in college hospitals were heavily involved in dealing with the outbreak of the MERS in 2015. Although health workers knew their responsibilities in terms of medical treatment, they knew relatively little about the phase of medical prevention as part of disaster management lifetime, how to coordinate with other stakeholders to include patients' family members, government officials, and local communities, and other emergency management principles. Consequently, because the unidisciplined health workers in college hospitals were not able to consider the other equally important aspects surrounding the situation, the outbreak claimed the lives of 36 patients (Ha, 2016a) . Many departments in colleges have recently begun offering disaster management programs such as firefighting science, civil engineering, ocean science, medical science, nursing science, public administration, and safety engineering, among others (Ha, 2015) . Each department has maintained that their own academic subject, which is a unidisciplinary approach, is the key major in the field of disaster management. They have not seriously attempted to incorporate other disciplines into their own areas. When analyzing departmental curricula, we can see that they have not put significance to the concept of emergency managers (Kang et al., 2012) . Without emphasizing the role of emergency managers, they have tried to describe how each has operated its own disaster management. In general, many departments have not realized the status of emergency managers as a professional in the field of disaster management Having such certificates is a requirement for some public institutions' recruitment. Nevertheless, many emergency manager certificates have been based on the unidisciplinary approach. It means that they have been taught in only one area of study when a more comprehensive and diverse curriculum/training would be better. Certificates from KFSA, KDPA, MRSA, and LSA are oriented on their own disciplines including firefighting, flood accompanied by typhoon, maritime rescue, and maritime search and rescue. Although the KBCPA has supported multidisciplined emergency managers via classroom sessions, the program towards certification still lacks the aspect of multidisciplinary training. 4.1.4. Mass media coverage Diverse mass media including TV, radio, Internet, mobile phones, newspapers, and others have exerted efforts to cover the occurrence of a disaster as breaking news. Similarly, they have tried to cover the phase of disaster response or that of recovery much more than that of disaster prevention/mitigation or preparedness (Choi et al., 2011) . In general, many mass media networks have not clearly recognized emergency managers as entities in the field of disaster management. Notwithstanding, few mass media such as Arirang TV and YTN TV have just begun to talk about emergency managers. There was realization that with the disasters Korea has faced so far, the role of Korean emergency managers has been neither extraordinary nor maximized. The discussion about the criticality of the profession has not also touched on the needed multidisciplinary approach.
