The Human herpesvirus 1 genome (NC 001798) was screened against the human proteome using the NCBI BLAST server with and without the Entrez Query filters ("Alzheimer" or "cholesterol") [8] . Each BLAST re-turns a large list of human proteins, many of which display homology to several different HSV-1 proteins. A Tag cloud generator was used to quantify these different interactions http://www.tagcloud-generator.com/index.php. This generates tags whose font size is proportional to the number of viral protein hits per human protein. The tag size scale was set from 1 to 20. Antigenicity (B cell epitope
