The octapeptide NH 2 -AVLQ fl SGFR-COOH shows strong inhibiting activity in vitro [12] . However, the use of native peptide for clinical applications has been hampered by their intrinsic metabolic instability (indigestion by enzymes) and poor absorption through membrane. A cleavable peptide of SARS CoV M pro means that it possesses a competent binding with its receptor and a breakable peptide bond in the cleavage site. To convert a cleavable peptide into a stable and effective inhibitor, the peptide has to be modified according to the ''distorted key'' theory [14, 15] . One important step for the chemical modification is a good understanding of the cleavage mechanism, particularly the changes in chemical bonds [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The protease-susceptible sites in a given protein or peptide usually extend to an octapeptide region [14, 15] . The corresponding amino acid residues are sequentially symbolized by eight subsites R 4 , R 3 , R 2 , R 1 , R 1 0 , R 2 0 , R 3 0 , R 4 0 and the eight matching positions in the protease by S 4 , S 3 , S 2 , S 1 , S 1 0 , S 2 0 , S 3 0 , S 4 0 , respectively (see Fig. 3 of [15] ). Occasionally, the susceptible sites in some proteins may contain one subsite less or one more. However, eight amino acid residues are the most common case. Although the protein being cleaved contains much more than eight amino acid residues, only an octapeptide segment fits in the active region of the protease. Therefore, our research will focus on the cleavability of octapeptides. As shown in Fig. 1 , the cleavage point is always on the peptide bond between R 1 and R 1 0 . In Fig. 1A we use the combination of a thin line and a dashed line to represent the conjugate p property in the peptide bond. In Fig. 1B the breakable peptide bond between R 1 and R 1 is converted to a strong ''hybrid peptide bond'' through a chemical modification and hence cannot be cleaved by the protease. The modified octapeptide can still bind to the active site, but it cannot be cleaved by the enzyme, just like a distorted key that can neither open the lock nor be pulled out. The octapeptide thus modified will automatically become a desired inhibitor candidate. The octapeptide AVLQSGFR is the first suggested [9] based on the molecular structure of SARS CoV M pro and has been proved cleavable by experiments. In this research we study the cleavage mechanism, the properties of the relevant chemical bonds, and the catalytic interactions between the octapeptides and the SARS CoV M pro using molecular mechanical and quantum chemical simulations to provide useful insights for the chemical modification. The study was carried out in the following four steps: (1) docking the octapeptide to SARS CoV M pro followed by an energy minimization for the complex structure using molecular mechanics, (2) computing the atomic charge distribution in the binding pocket for the energy-minimized structure using ab initio quantum mechanics, (3) computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the octapeptide with the background charge distribution [23] of SARS CoV M pro using ab initio quantum chemistry, and (4) with the same background charge distribution, computing the molecular energy, chemical bond properties, and atomic charges of the modified octapeptide. The computations have been carried out with the molecular dynamics and standard ab initio quantum chemistry at the HF/6-31G* level [23] .
