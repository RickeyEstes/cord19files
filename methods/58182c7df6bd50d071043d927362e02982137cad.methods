The study hospital, a regional hospital, is located in Southern Taiwan. It has approximately 1000 beds, 2150 employees, and > 40 specialized departments. There are > 3000 patients everyday in the outpatient clinics, > 280 patients everyday in the emergency department, and 25 negativepressure beds available for respiratory isolation. From 2002 to 2005, patients who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB infection with positive cultures in this hospital were included in our study. Pulmonary TB with positive culture was defined as a person who showed bacteriologic evidence of TB disease attained by sputum culture. Five infection control nurses were trained as investigators. The medical charts of patients with culture-positive pulmonary TB were reviewed by these trained nurses. We collected the following patient information: demographic data, occupation, medical history, specialty of the attending physician, and the details of specific procedures or events (including visits to outpatient clinics or emergency department, hospitalization, and respiratory isolation, initial clinical suspicion of TB, sputum microbiologic surveys, available microbiologic results, and prescription of anti-TB medications). The timing of clinical suspicion of TB was defined as the earliest day and time with the coding of IDC-9-CM #011 as the diagnosis, or as the earliest day and time of medical orders of sputum acid-fast stains or anti-TB medication in medical charts if there was a lack of TB diagnosis records. The intervals between patient-hospital contacts and respiratory isolation were recorded. The accumulated TB exposure time was defined as the accumulated period in the hospital for patients with pulmonary TB infection before respiratory isolation in negative-pressure single rooms. Such clinical information about patients admitted from the outpatient clinic or emergency department, or those hospitalized for medical illnesses other than for their respiratory symptoms, were compared.
