Individual patient data from two phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were pooled for this analysis [14, 15] . Main characteristics of these trials are given in Table 1 . Both trials were approved by Independent Ethics Committees of the participating centres and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable local regulations. Main inclusion criteria in both trials were the presence of early symptoms of common cold, with symptoms up to 36 hours before enrollment in the children's trial and up to 48 hours in the adult trial. The severity of the cold was measured using a symptom score [16] . The score was calculated by summing 8 symptoms (headache, muscle ache, chilliness, sore throat, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, cough, and sneezing) with each item rated 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. Patients with a symptom score of 1-9 (children's trial) or 2-9 (adult's trial) at the time of inclusion were enrolled in the study. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment and the test spray and matching placebo were indistinguishable. Patients were randomly assigned using a permuted block schedule (size four). After randomization, patients received treatment with either iota-carrageenan nasal spray (0.12% iota-carrageenan/0.5% sodium saline; "carrageenan") or placebo (0.9% sodium saline; "placebo") three times per day, for 7 days. Presence of common cold symptoms were recorded in daily diaries till day 21 after inclusion in trials. Nasal lavage samples were collected on day 1 (visit 1, V1) before the first application of the medication and either on days 3 to 5 [14] or days 3 to 4 [15] respectively (visit 2, V2) during treatment. In the second trial [15] , nasal lavage samples were also obtained on study days 10 or 11, after treatment. If one of the third samples was virus positive, patients were also included into analysis. Molecular screening and quantitative assessment of viral load in nasal lavage samples were performed for influenza virus types A (InfA) and B (Inf B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1-3, human rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), coronavirus types OC43 and 229E (hCV). A patient was considered to be virus-positive if any virus was detected at least in one sample. For detailed information on the methods used see previous publications [14, 15] . According to study objectives, patient data from all virus-positive patients were included into the pooled analysis. For the assessment of clinical effectiveness the following parameters were determined: (1) duration of disease and (2) number and frequency of relapses. The duration of disease was defined as the time until the last day with symptoms of common cold. Relapses were defined as re-occurrence of symptoms when the patient reported having common cold symptoms again after having reported at least one day without symptoms. For assessment of antiviral effectiveness the following variables were selected: (1) number of different viruses detected at V1 and V2, (2) change of viral titers from V1 to V2 and (3) number of patients with viruses at V1 and V2. Similar to adverse events which can occur several times in one patient, several common cold viruses can infect one patient at the same time. Consequently, for the calculation of the difference of viral titers between V1 and V2 the concept of virus events was applied, this means that calculations are performed for each virus individually. Gender and age were assessed as important demographic co-variables. The analysis of these parameters was performed for the virus-positive (VP) population and for patient subgroups that were positive for a specific virus of the most frequently detected ones (i.e., hRV, hCV and InfA). All findings after the screening visit were documented as adverse effects (AEs) except for any symptoms attributed to common cold (sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, headache, fatigue and chilliness). Nevertheless, if such symptoms were of marked intensity or deemed to be not related to the study disease, these were recorded as AEs. Statistical analysis was performed using statistical IBM software package SPSS Version 20.0. Analysis of duration of disease was done by using the log rank test. All data sets were checked for normal distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Test prior to analysis. Binary or categorical data (e.g. presence or absence of viruses, number of patients with adverse events) were analysed by the Chi-Square test. Viral titer in nasal lavage samples and changes in viral titers between visits were analysed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test due to the fact that the distribution of data was not normal and in addition the data set was highly skewed. In the dataset for this analysis, all viruses detected were included and each virus was accounted for individually.
