To obtain a random sample of obstetric care provider Web sites, we followed the protocol previously described by Chamberlain et al 14 for utilizing www. healthgrades.com. Healthgrades.com is a publicly available database of health care providers in the United States and was chosen because of its accessibility and completeness. 15 The sample was divided among all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The required number of practice Web sites per state was predetermined as a proportion of the providers listed in that state compared with the total number of providers listed on January 29, 2016. All providers listed for a given state were sorted alphabetically and numbered sequentially. Random number lists for each state were generated in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Providers were selected in the order determined by the random number list. We then used the Google Internet search engine to identify each provider's practice Web site. Obstetric providers (and by affiliation, their practice Web site) were excluded from the final sample if (1) a practice Web site associated with the selected provider was unable to be identified, (2) the primary practice location of the provider selected from Healthgrades.com was not in the target state, (3) the practice did not provide prenatal care as determined from information provided on the practice Web site, (4) the practice appeared to be permanently closed, (5) the practice was duplicative of one already selected in the sample, or (6) the practice had an apparent military affiliation. Practice eligibility was again assessed during the August data collection period, where practices were subsequently removed from the sample if their eligibility had changed. The first data collection period took place between January 30, 2016, and February 5, 2016. This time period started 9 days after the release of ACOG's interim guidance for care of obstetric patients during a Zika virus outbreak. 16 The same practice Web sites were reviewed again from August 8, 2016, to August 15, 2016, a period that started 10 days after the initial announcement of localized transmission in Miami, Florida. 17 For both time points, data collection was purposely initiated 9 to 10 days after significant events related to the Zika virus emergency under the assumption that these events would likely influence what information obstetric providers may post on their Web sites. The delay prior to data collection was included to allow adequate time for practices to have considered posting or updating Zika virus-related information on their Web sites. Practice characteristics from each practice Web site were recorded including the practice address, type of practice (independent practices that provided only obstetric care or obstetrics and gynecologic care [OB-GYN-only practices]; independent practices that offered care in a variety of specialties; practices affiliated with nonuniversity hospitals or hospital systems; and practices affiliated with university hospitals or hospital systems), and the apparent presence of practice-sponsored social media accounts (Facebook page, Twitter feed). Social media accounts were included only if they were explicitly linked to and accessible from the practice Web site. During the January data collection period, social media feeds were reviewed back to January 1, 2016. During the August data collection period, social media feeds were reviewed back to July 29, 2016. Practice Web sites were considered to provide Zika virus information if they included any Zika virusrelated content or explicitly linked to information posted by another organization (such as CDC or ACOG). The location of the content (home page, elsewhere on the Web site, Facebook, or Twitter) of the Zika virus information was recorded. If Zika virus information was available on the Web site or associated social media sites, it was reviewed for the presence of specific content themes (Table 1) . These content themes were selected for review a priori based on the latest national guidance pertinent to pregnant women at the time of data collection. In addition, during the second data collection period, we assessed whether or not the Zika virus information was posted in Spanish. Frequencies and bivariate associations were calculated in SAS. P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. There were no human participants in this study.
