Virus. The wild-type PEDV strain ZJ was obtained from intestinal contents of a 2-day-old diarrheic piglet on a farm in Jiangsu in 2012, and this strain clustered with the emerging virulent strain based on phylogenetic analysis. Viruses were purified using discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation 55 . Heat-inactivated viruses were prepared at 56°C for 0.5 h and tested for complete loss of infectivity by inoculation into Vero cells multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1 for CPE observations. Fluorescence labeling of the virus was performed with the fluorescent probe DyLight 633 NHS Ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Unincorporated dye was removed using commercial fluorescent dye removal columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Labeled viruses were stored at 4°C and used within 2 days. Animals. Caesarian-derived and colostrum-deprived xin huai piglets were obtained from a swine herd at the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Science (JAAS) and were artificially fed with milk. The swine herd was seronegative for antibodies against PEDV, PRRSV, PRCV, TGEV, and porcine circovirus type 2. Each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate room in a high-security isolation facility. All animal procedures and experiments were performed according to protocols PEDV intranasal inoculation. Female piglets (5 days old) with similar weight were allocated to 3 groups (3 piglets per group) with a completely random design using the random number generation function (Excel, Microsoft Corporation) and housed in three separate rooms 24 h prior to experiment (acclimation period). The three groups were (I) control, (II) PEDV intranasal inoculation, and (III) PEDV oral inoculation. Piglets in groups II and III were challenged with 1 ml PEDV (10 7 PFU ml −1 ) by nasal and oral inoculation. The nasal spray device used for nasal inoculation is commonly used for vaccine absorption by the nasal mucosa and has good atomization effects. In group I, the same volume of PBS was inoculated as a negative control. The animals were artificially fed with milk every 3 h throughout the experiment to meet or exceed the National Research Council (NRC, 2012) requirements for nutrients and energy for this size pig. After a challenge, the piglets were observed daily for symptoms of diarrhea. The piglets were housed under the conditions of controlled humidity (50 ± 5%), temperature (30 ± 1°C), and light (12-h light/12-h dark cycle, lights on at 8:00 AM). Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups. To further determine the dynamic changes in PEDV in piglets after nasal inoculation, we randomly assigned 18 piglets to two groups (I: control and II: PEDV intranasal inoculation), and the specific methods were the same as those mentioned above. Subsequently, three piglets from each group were euthanatized at 3, 12, and 24 h after virus inoculation. Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups. Generation of T cells and DCs. Porcine PBMCs were isolated from the blood of piglets by density centrifugation using a porcine peripheral blood lymphocyte separation kit (Solarbio). The morphology of DCs is shown in Supplementary  Fig. 3a . To isolate T cells, PBMCs were labeled with APC-CD3 antibody, incubated with anti-APC microbeads and sorted using MiniMACS Starting kits. Swine DCs were obtained from the bone marrow of piglet femurs according to methods that had been optimized by our laboratory 19 : bone marrow was obtained from femurs of 2-week-old piglets by puncture method and treated with red blood cell lysing buffer. The bone marrow cells were differentiated into DCs by resuspending the cells in complete medium Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 20 ng ml −1 porcine GM-CSF, and 10 ng ml −1 porcine IL-4 and plated at 10 6 cells ml −1 in 6-well plates. Non-adherent granulocytes were removed by discarding the culture medium after 60 h. On 6 days culture, the clusters were harvested and subcultured overnight for removing adherent cells. Non-adherent cells were collected after 7 days, washed, and used as DCs for the subsequent studies. Establishment of the NECM and NECM/DCs coculture system. The NECs culture protocol was based on a modified method used for human airway epithelial cultures 56 . The acquired NECs were collected, adjusted to 10 6 cells ml −1 and seeded at a concentration of 2 × 10 5 cells cm −2 onto Transwell tissue culture inserts (3 µm pore size; 6.5 mm membrane diameter; Corning) coated with collagen from human placenta Type IV (6 µg ml −1 ) (Sigma). After the cells reached confluence, the medium was replaced with a differentiating medium, and the cells were brought to the air-liquid interface. When the NECM formed an air-liquid interface and stable TEER, the filters were turned upside down, and the DCs (5 × 10 5 ) were cultured for 4 h on the filter facing the basolateral membrane of NECs to allow the cells to attach to the filter. Medium, DyLight 633-labeled PEDV, and WIV PEDV were incubated on the apical side of the NECs and cultured at 37°C for 1 h. Then, DCs were collected for FACS analyses. Moreover, DyLight 633-labeled PEDV were incubated on the apical side of the NECs at MOI of 0.1 and 0.5, and the coculture system was collected for CLSM analyses. As a control group, DyLight 633-labeled PEDV were incubated at 4°C with a MOI of 0.1. PEDV infection and transmission. DCs were pulsed with PEDV (MOI = 0.1) for 1 h at 37°C and washed extensively to remove unbound virus. PEDV-pulsed DCs were cocultured with autologous positively selected CD3 + T cells that had been maintained at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with IL-2 (10 IU ml −1 ) for the subsequent study. After 2 h, donor DCs were removed from CD3 + T cells using MiniMACS Starting kits (anti-Swc3a-PE and anti-PE beads). PEDV-carrying CD3 + T cells were cultured in maintenance medium for viral RNA titer determination. For TEM studies, the mixtures were centrifuged at 200×g for 1 min to facilitate conjugate formation prior to co-culturing. After 1 h in culture, the mixtures were collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min and fixed in glutaraldehyde/cacodylate buffer. Transfer infection. Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown to monolayers before transfer infection. PEDV-carrying CD3 + T cells were cocultured with Vero cells by two methods (contact and noncontact). In the contact method, T cells were directly cultured with Vero cells, whereas in the noncontact method, T cells were grown in Transwell™ assemblies with a pore diameter of 0.4 μm over Vero cell monolayers. Negative controls, including uninfected T cells, and The numbers of cells shown in (a) were quantified, n = 3 piglets per group. c After the autotransfusion competition experiment, frozen sections of the jejunum from mock-injected and fluorescence-labeled cells injected groups were stained with DAPI (blue) and observed by fluorescence microscopy. PEDV-treated (CFSE) CD3 + T cells were marked with white arrowheads. Bars, 50 μm. d Schematic of the model to study PEDV-carrying CD3 + T cell transmission of the virus to Vero cells. PEDV-pulsed DCs were cocultured with CD3 + T cells for 2 h and donor DCs were removed by MACS. Then, the remaining CD3 + T cells were cocultured with Vero cells by two methods (contact and noncontact coculture). e PEDV + CD3 + T cells in the contact and noncontact groups were detected by FACS at the indicated times. f In addition, viral titers in the supernatant of the coculture system were measured by a plaque assay, n = 3. g PEDV RNA expression in Vero cells was evaluated by qRT-PCR at 96 h, n = 3. h At 48 hpi, Vero cells in the noncontact and contact groups were observed. LM light microscopy. i Vero cells (contact group) displayed thin cell bodies with long, branched membrane protrusions toward the T cells at 24 and 96 h. Bars, 20 μm. j TEM image showing the morphological features of sorted T cells cocultured with medium or PEDV-treated DCs. Bars, 1 μm. When cocultured for 96 h, Vero cells from the contact group were processed for TEM, which revealed an accumulation of virus particles in the cytoplasm. Some virus particles are indicated by a white asterisk. Bars, 1 μm. All data represent the mean ± SD, comparisons performed with t-tests (two groups) or analysis of variance (ANOVA) (multiple groups). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Data were combined from at least three independent experiments unless otherwise stated positive controls, which consisted of an identical number of PEDV viruses placed over the 0.4 μm filters, were used to verify that infectious cell-free PEDV was able to cross the filters in the Transwell™ assemblies. T cells and the medium of the Vero coculture were collected at the indicated times. Vero cells were washed five times with PBS to eliminate the nonabsorbed virus and T cells, followed by culture in maintenance medium for 96 h. In vivo competition experiments. For the in vivo competition assay, CD3 + T cells were isolated from three littermate piglets and cocultured with DCs (treated or not with PEDV). Then, the CD3 + T cells were purified and labeled with CFSE (green) or CM-DiI (red, Molecular Probes), respectively, for long-term cell labeling. Equal numbers of cells (1 × 10 7 ) from the two populations were then mixed and adoptively transferred into piglets (autologous) via front cavity vein injection. The recipient piglets were sacrificed 24 h after the injection. For the flow cytometry analyses, cells were isolated from PBMCs, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. For histological analyses, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were washed with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical). The frozen tissues were cut into 10-μm sections and mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides. The CM-DiI or CFSE-labeled cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Investigators were not blinded to experimental groups. Pathologists interpreting slides were blinded to PEDV-treated and control animal identifiers. Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA from different tissues and Vero cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using HiScript TM QRT SuperMix (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was performed with a SYBR Green qPCR Kit (TaKaRa) in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). The gene expression levels were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PEDV load was determined by detecting the viral membrane (M) gene and analyzed by the double standard curve method. PCR products were cloned into the pJET1.2 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasmids were serially diluted and used as standards for the quantitative analysis. The initial copy number of the PEDV M gene and GAPDH in each group was calculated using the following formula: X0 = −K log Ct + b, where X0 is the initial copy number; and K, Ct, and b refer to the slope rate, cycle threshold, and constant, respectively. All of the amplification primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Flow cytometric analysis. In vivo, after PEDV inoculation, epithelial cells were acquired from the mucosa of the nasal cavity and stained with an antibody against CK18. After surface staining, the cells were resuspended in fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, BD Pharmingen) and stained with PEDV N protein antibody to detect intracellular PEDV. PBMCs were similarly stained with an antibody specific for porcine CD3 and PEDV N protein. The collected DCs were detected by FACS for fluorescent PEDV uptake. In addition, after NECM/ DCs coculture, the cells were stimulated with PEDV for 24 h. The harvested DCs were washed twice with cold PBS and stained with fluorescent mAbs specific for porcine MHCII, SWC3a and CD1a or the respective isotype controls at 4°C for 0.5 h, according to the manufacturer's guidelines. After three washes with PBS, the cells were phenotypically analyzed by FACS (BD FACS Calibur). Cytokine assays by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cytokines were analyzed by ELISA. The production of cytokines (CCL25, CCL20, and CXCL2) was measured using ELISA kit (eBioscience), which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistochemistry and IFA assay. PEDV-infected piglets were anesthetized and sacrificed via an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg kg −1 ) 12 h post intranasal inoculation. After fixation, histological sections of four blocks were selected according to the fractions 1/4, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5, using the landmarks provided in the diagram presented in Supplementary Fig. 1a . Four cross-sections (I, II, III, and IV) taken at the fractions ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) were subsequently selected for assessing the distribution of PEDV by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using primary antibodies directed against PEDV N protein. DCs located in nasal mucosa were immunolabeled with rat anti-Swc3a mAb and mouse anti-MHCII mAb, followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The colonization of PEDV in cross-sectional sections IV was detected by IFA with PEDV polyclonal antibody. Fixed filters were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, the filters were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C,
