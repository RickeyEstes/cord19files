Microbiological methods to study the etiology are culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct immunofluorescence, antigen tests and (paired) serology. Upper respiratory tract (URT) samples (naso-or oropharyngeal swabs) are often used as surrogate markers for the lower respiratory tract (LRT) (sputum, pleural fluid, lung tap, broncho-alvealor lavage fluid, and biopsy). The positive predictive value and specificity of the URT samples might be limited for LRT, since many potential pathogenic organisms also colonize the URT [10] .
