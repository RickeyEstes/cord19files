During August 2011 we conducted a systematic search through PubMed using the terms ''rotavirus'' in combination with ''porcine '', ''swine'', ''pig'', ''piglet'', ''Sus scrofa'', ''hog'', ''bovine'', ''calf'', ''Bos taurus'', or ''cattle'' . Searching for additional studies cited in the identified publications was also conducted. Data referring to porcine and bovine RVA strains were analyzed separately. Studies reported from the same country were cross-referenced by authors, location and time period to ensure the data were not duplicated. No stringent exclusion criteria were defined regarding sampling practice, sample size, length of study period, or typing method, however, we intended to keep only those studies which provided insight into the epidemiologic context. For each study, the following information was inserted in a Microsoft Office Excel database: first author, manuscript title, journal name, year of publication, volume and page numbers, country of study, study period, sample size, typing method, type-specific RV prevalence. G and P type specificities were used as the primary endpoint to describe RVA strain prevalence and any possible shifts in their epidemiologic dynamics (BÃ¡ nyai et al., 2012) .
