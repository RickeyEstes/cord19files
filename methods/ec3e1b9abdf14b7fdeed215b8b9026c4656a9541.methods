This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. 21 Inclusion criteria for studies in this systematic review were: (1) original research, (2) published in peer-reviewed, scientific journals, (3) in English, (4) involved human inpatients, (5) conducted in acute care settings, (6) outcomes were infection or colonization with one or more bacterial organisms identified as multidrug resistant by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), (7) experimental or quasi-experimental design (i.e. interventional), and (8) with intervention of contact isolation precautions (as either the control or experimental exposure). 3 The components of contact precautions required for inclusion were: placement of the infected or colonized patient in a single room or in a cohort facility, application of standard precautions and disposable gown and glove use for close patient contact. 6 Searches were limited to the past 10 years (January 1st, 2004 to June 2014) to target the most recent literature (i.e. with emergent pathogen outcomes), including that published subsequent to national clinical guidelines. Editorials, correspondences, commentaries, letters, or proceeding papers were excluded. Studies in which the effectiveness of isolation precautions was indistinguishable from that of a larger intervention bundle were also excluded.
