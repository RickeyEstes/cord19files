The study included patients ages 2 years and younger who were admitted from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth Revision codes 466.11 (acute bronchiolitis due to RSV), 466.19 (acute bronchiolitis due to other infectious organisms), and ICD 10th Revision codes J21.0 (acute bronchiolitis due to RSV), J21.1 (acute bronchiolitis due to human metapneumovirus), J21.8 (acute bronchiolitis due to other specified organisms), and J21.9 (acute bronchiolitis, unspecified) were used to identify patients with acute bronchiolitis who were admitted to the inpatient service and the PICU. The data were extracted from the Appalachian Clinical and Translational Science Institute-Clinical Data Warehouse. Diagnoses included RSV, viral upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, respiratory distress, or respiratory failure. For diagnoses of pneumonia, radiographic reports were reviewed and words such as "infiltrate," "consolidation," and "pneumonia" were included in the study. The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia requiring antibiotics is a physician judgment based on the following criteria: leukocytosis with left shift, elevated total neutrophil count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated procalcitonin, chest radiograph, and clinical appearance. In a study using procalcitonin levels to guide clinical management, lower procalcitonin levels had fewer clinical features of infection. Procalcitonin can provide valuable information to guide clinical decisions. 4 Viral infections were diagnosed by hospital viral respiratory panel polymerase chain reaction (Table 1 ). Fever was defined as a temperature of ≥100.4°F. In addition to bivariate analysis, considering fever and pneumonia, additional trivariate and bivariate analyses were performed regarding temperature ranges and pneumonia. Pearson χ 2 test was used to analyze results.
