It was decided to conduct the experiments in water, at Reynolds number equivalent lengths and velocities, such that the results obtained in water could be directly extrapolated to the full-scale situation in air [20] . Water was chosen because it was easier to visualize flows, qualitatively, using coloured dye, or, more quantitatively, using neutrally buoyant, suspended, reflective particles for particle image velocimetry (PIV).
