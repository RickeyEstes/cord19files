DNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Blood and saliva collection from breast cancer patients performed in the Institute of Oncology of Moldova 1 -2 hours before tumor resection, and tissue samples -after tumor resection. All samples were stored and transported at +4°C. Time between sample collection and DNA isolation did not exceed 24 hours. DNA from blood and saliva and tumor tissues was isolated using lysis buffer containing 5M guanidinium thiocyanate, 50mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, then extracted with equal volume of phenol:chlorophorm and then chlorophorm. DNA was precipitated by 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 96% ethanol in the presence of 0.3M ammonium acetate. Tumor was grinded in liquid nitrogen with addition of lysis buffer before extraction. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes and primers for the RNA polymerase beta subunit gene (Table 1) . Both rounds were 30 cycles, with 60°C annealing temperature. Each of the samples was analyzed twice. The amplification products were analyzed in 2% agarose gel. 100 bp. ladder (Fermentas) was used as a molecular marker.
