A search was conducted in the PubMed, Lilacs and SciELO databases, using the descriptors: ''Asthma Exacerbation'', ''Viral Infection'', and ''Child'', resulting in a total of 283 references for that period. After selecting the articles published in Portuguese, English, Spanish, or French, 195 articles remained. After reading the titles and abstracts, 42 original articles that assessed respiratory tract viral infection in asthmatic children during exacerbation were selected. Some articles of historical importance or review articles that included the three descriptors were added to generate the bibliography of this review. The list of references was inserted into Endnote X6 (Thompson Corp., CA, USA), a bibliographic citation management software.
