This retrospective study included consecutive adult (ie, ≥18 years old) HSCT recipients treated at the Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation at the University Hospital Essen, Germany. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Duisburg-Essen (EC 15-6446-BO) and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the amended Declaration of Helsinki. Our center performs around 200 adult HSCTs per year in 2 inpatient units with a total capacity of 20 beds. Critically ill patients are treated in a third affiliated unit (ICU) providing 17 closed beds run by trained intensivists and hemato-oncologists. Consecutive adult HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU between May 2013 (introduction of a PCR-based viral panel for respiratory specimen testing) and July 2017 were screened and included in the study cohort (1) if they had a BAL with available results performed during their ICU stay and (2) if the BAL was conducted as part of a workup of ARF (new requirement of supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support during hospitalization) with pulmonary infiltrates documented on x-ray or computed tomography (CT) of the lungs ±7 days from the procedure. Data shown in Tables 1 and 2 were obtained by reviewing the patients' medical charts, radiographic images, and discharge letters. Disease risk was categorized according to Seo et al. [11] . The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII) was used to assess the severity of illness at ICU admission [12] . Absolute neutrophil counts and absolute lymphocyte counts were included if results were available ±2 days from BAL. Standard diagnostic tests performed on BAL included conventional culture for bacteria and fungi; direct microscopy; galactomannan (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany); PCR testing for the detection of 2 fungal, 3 [14] , Maastricht) and for the detection of Mucorales [15] were available from January 2017. Other BAL tests were performed as clinically indicated (Table 3) . Results from blood cultures, serum CMV, and serum galactomannan testing were analyzed if they were obtained ±7 days from BAL. Results of galactomannan testing from BAL or blood are reported as positive using an optical density index ≥ .5 [16] . Viral pathogens were graded as "established" or "uncertain" lung pathogenicity in the setting of HSCT according to Seo et al. [9] . The recovery of Candida spp. or Enterococcus spp. from BAL was not reported in the absence of positive blood cultures. Documented diagnoses of probable invasive aspergillosis were in line with De Pauw et al. [17] . Standard antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole from conditioning start until engraftment [18] . Patients with prolonged neutropenia or on systemic corticosteroids at a dose of >.5 mg/ kg body weight prednisone or equivalent received anti-mold prophylaxis with voriconazole or posaconazole. Prophylaxis against P. jirovecii using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine as well as antiviral prophylaxis using acyclovir or valaciclovir followed national guideline recommendations [19] . Continuous data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR; 25% to 75%) and dichotomous data as number and percentage. Group comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Results were considered statistically significant when P < .05. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustments for multiple testing were made. Statistical tests were performed using the SPSS 23 software package (IBM, Armonk, NY).
