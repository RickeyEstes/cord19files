A literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE (from 1966 through January 2019) with the following terms: 1) "aeromedical isolation," 2) "aeromedical evacuation" OR "transportation of patients" OR "air ambulance" OR "HEMS" OR "Helicopter" AND "ebola" OR "lassa" OR "viral hemorrhagic" OR "highly infectious" OR "highly hazardous" OR "contagious" OR "communicable" OR "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)" OR "SARS" OR "smallpox", and 3) "mobile" OR "transport" AND "high-level isolation" OR "high containment". Authors screened abstracts for the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed literature, written in English, and described AE HLCT of persons with an HHCD. Diseases considered highly hazardous were identified based on the following definition by the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases: "an infection that is easily transmissible from person to person; life-threatening; presents a serious hazard in the health-care setting and the community; and requires specific control measures (e.g., high-level isolation)." 14 This definition is understood to include various viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other easily transmissible emerging infectious diseases. Articles were reviewed if the abstract contained information related to the aim, with those focused exclusively on ground transport or AE of non-HHCD patients excluded.
