This paper describes a prospective study performed at the Academic Medical Centre (AMC), which acts as tertiary referral centre in the Netherlands. Data was obtained by a longitudinal cohort study at the adult hematology ward of the AMC and was performed from November 2008 until April 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion when chemotherapy-induced significant neutropenia (i.e. > 7 days) was expected. A patient could be included for every successive neutropenic episode, assuming that the latter episode was followed by full recovery of the peripheral blood neutrophil count and the patient had been discharged from the hospital in between episodes. Three types of respiratory specimens (a nasal swab, pharyngeal swab and throat gurgle) were collected at 3 different time points: upon admission (i.e. around the onset of chemotherapy), during deep neutropenia (10-14 days after onset of chemotherapy) and, if present, at the start of neutropenic fever. The 3 different time points were labeled as phase A, phase B and phase C respectively. Fever was defined as a single temperature of >38.5°C or a sustained temperature of >38°C for more than one hour. Each patient's symptoms and signs during admission were registered on a case record form. All materials were analyzed by quantitative real time multiplex PCR covering the following viruses; influenzavirus A (InfA) and B (InfB), enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV) and human-metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenzavirus 1-4, human-parechovirus (hPeV), human-coronavirus (hCoV: HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43) and human-bocavirus (hBoV) [16, 17] . This was done at the end of the study; hence treating physicians were not aware of the study results during patient treatment. The local ethics committee approved the study and all participating patients provided written informed consent before entering the study.
