Cells. A549, 293T and MDCK cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). A549 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Gibco). 293T and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin (10,000 units/ml)-streptomycin (10 mg/ml) solution (Sigma Aldrich). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . Ascites and rabbit polyclonal antibodies production. Ascites were produced by injecting hybridoma cells into peritoneal cavities of pristine-primed BALB/c mice. The protocol was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Biological Resource Center, A*STAR, Singapore (Protocol Number: 110694). In order to generate rabbit anti-H5N1-NS1 polyclonal antibody, GST-fusion NS1 protein was purified using the method as previously described 28 . New Zealand white rabbits were then immunized with this protein and bled as previously described 40 . The protocol was approved by IACUC of the Biological Resource Center, A*STAR, Singapore (Protocol Number: 110693). All the animal procedures were performed in strict compliance with the recommendations of the NACLAR guideline in Singapore. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering and euthanasia was performed using carbon dioxide. Protein expression and purification. NS1(RBD) (residues 1-73) of A/chicken/Hatay/2004(H5N1) was PCR amplified from a full-length NS1 gene (Accession NO.: CAJ01906.1) and the NS1(RBD) (residues 1-70) of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) was PCR amplified from a full-length NS1 gene (Accession NO.: ABD77680.1). The expression constructs were generated by inserting PCR product into pET SUMO expression vector (Invitrogen). NS1 mutants expression construct was generated by overlap PCR as described previously 41 . All proteins were expressed and purified as previously described 29 . The purified proteins were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl) and concentrated to 3 mg/ml in a Centrprep-10 (Amicon) for subsequent assays. Crystallization of 2H6-Fab. MAb 2H6 was purified from the ascites by using affinity chromatography and 2H6-Fab was obtained by papain cleavage as described previously 29 . The purified 2H6-Fab was dialyzed against dialysis buffer and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for subsequent crystallization. Crystallizations were performed with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 1 μ l of 2H6-Fab with 1 μ l of reservoir solution and the mixture was equilibrated against 600 μ l of reservoir solution. Crystals of 2H6-Fab were grown against crystallization buffer containing 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 M NaCl and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 6.5. These crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.3 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm over the course of 10 days. Single crystals were obtained by dissecting from multiple crystals. Crystals were flash frozen (100 K) in the above reservoir solution supplemented with 30% glycerol. A total of 360 frames of a native data set with 1 oscillation at 1.5418 Å wavelength were collected for 2H6-Fab. All data sets were processed by HKL2000. Most of the crystals diffracted rather weak and the scaled data sets were anisotropic with strong ice rings and high mosaicities. Nevertheless, one of the data sets displaying Scientific RepoRts | 6:33382 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33382 weak ice ring was able to scale to 2.4 Å at the mosaicity of 1.8°. This data was used for structure determination and refinement with the statistic table listed as Table 1 .
