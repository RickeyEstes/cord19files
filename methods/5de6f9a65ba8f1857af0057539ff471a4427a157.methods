Characteristics of A(H7N9) patients and controls. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority of Acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome were defined with standard criteria 43, 44 . The healthy poultry workers were sampled from multiple live poultry markets located in 10 districts of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. Blood and nasal swab samples were collected from them with the written consent. All experiments were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and approved protocols. Genotyping, quality control and data analysis. Genotyping was genome-widely performed for .890 k SNPs using HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip (Illumina) according to manufacturer's specification. All participants in the dataset had genotype missing rates ,1%. The allelic association P values for SNPs were generated using PLINK v1?07 45 . SNPs with more than 10% missing rate or minor allele frequency less than 5% were removed from the association analysis. A total of 705,459 SNPs remained after quality control. Imputation analysis, pathway-based analysis and LD analysis. All the variants in our GWAS dataset were applied to the artificial imputation test using the SnipSnip software with default parameters (fixed SNP window size, 10 SNPs; partner matrix, multiplicative). The standard imputation was performed using program MACH v1?0 46 , with genotype data for 286 East-Asian samples (CHB, 97; CHS, 100; JPT, 89) from 1000 Genomes Project released in June 2011 as reference panel. The R package qqman was utilized to create Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot and Manhattan plot 47 . Haploview software was utilized to analyze and visualize the LD pattern of the interested variants 48 . The in-house generated program indelLDplot 49 (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/indelldplot/files) was utilized to search for functional SNPs, including indels, in high LD with user-interested variants through mining the publically available 1000 Genomes and HapMap database. A WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) was used to identify the enriched pathways 24 . Cells and quantitative expression assays. Lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) were purchased from Coriell Institute for Medical Research. The cultured LCLs (1 3 10 6 ) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then immune-labelled with Rabbit anti-Galectin 1 (LGALS1, Abcam) and secondary antibody Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 647. The intracellular expression of LGALS1 was determined with a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer and data were analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells preparation, monocyte separation and RT-qPCR assay were performed as described previously 13 . eQTL analysis and lung eQTL dataset. The linear regression analysis incorporated in PLINK was used to examine the correlation of a specific LGALS1 genetic variant and the quantitative expression in LCLs, human cells and tissues, using an addictive model to estimate the effect of one copy increment of the variant. A P value # 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Lung eQTL dataset was generated as described previously 20 . All patients who donated their lung tissue samples for generation of this dataset have provided written informed consent.
