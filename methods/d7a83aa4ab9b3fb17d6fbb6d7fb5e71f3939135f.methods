Bats sample collection and cell isolation. All animal processing work was conducted in accordance with approved guidelines, methods and permits from the Queensland Animal Science Precinct and the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory. All experimental protocols were approved by the Duke-NUS Medical School. Capture and processing of adult bats (Pteropus alecto) was conducted as described previously 12 . To harvest bone marrow (BM) cells, ribs from the bats were collected and muscle tissues were stripped off the bones before rinsing them in ethanol briefly and then in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum FBS. Caps at both ends of the ribs were then snipped off and RPMI media was used to flush out the BM through the ribs using a needle and syringe. Harvested BM cells were subsequently washed with PBS, re-suspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) (FBS) and 7% (v/v) DMSO, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Bat lung cells were prepared as described previously 35 . Generation of recombinant P. alecto GM-CSF, IL-4 and CSF-1. P. alecto CSF2 (coding for CSF-2 also called GM-CSF), IL-4 and (coding for CSF-1 also called M-CSF) genes have been annotated previously 28 . The sequences were sent for gBlock synthesis (IDT) and then cloned into the pcDNA 6.2/EmGFP TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for expression in bat cells. Primers used to subclone P. alecto CSF1 and CSF2 genes from the gene block are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Of note, the CSF1 gene was human codon optimised during synthesis. Endotoxin-free maxipreps of plasmids were prepared using kits (Omega) and transfected into 5 × 10 6 PakiT03 cells 12 using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10 μ g/10 cm dish) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Six hours later the media containing transfection reagent was replaced. After 48 h, media containing cytokines was collected and filtered using a 0.8 μ m filter before storing at − 80 °C until required. Generation of P. alecto FLT3L vaccibodies. Construction of the vaccibody gene construct has been previously described 36 . P. alecto FLT3L (acc.nr. ELK18536 aa 22-276) was synthesised by Genscript and cloned into the vaccibody gene construct using BsmI and BsiWI. mWasabi was cloned into the construct using SfiI, as previously described 36 . To express the vaccibodies, the gene constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells grown in 5-layer tissue culture flasks (Falcon Multi-Flask) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Vaccibodies were purified by harvesting supernatants and applied them onto a Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) conjugated with an antibody recognizing the CH3 domain of the vaccibody (clone HP6017), as previously described 37 . Bound vaccibodies were eluted with 0.1 M Glycin-HCI pH 2.7, dialysed twice in PBS, concentrated using a 50-Kd cutoff Vivaspin column (Sartorius Stedim Biotech), aliquoted, and stored at − 80 °C until use.
