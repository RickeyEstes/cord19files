Cell culture and plasmids NIH 3T3 thymidine kinase-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts [24] , and 293T human embryonic kidney cells [25] were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with a high concentration of glucose (4.5 g per liter) and 10% FBS. CHO-K1 hamster cells (ATCC CCL-61) were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium Alpha at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Clonal NIH 3T3 cells expressing an HA-tagged human ASCT2 (NIH 3T3/ ASCT2 cells) were generated by transduction with the retroviral vector LNCRDRHA, that contains a human RDR (ASCT2) cDNA with a carboxy-terminal HA tag cloned into the LNCX retroviral vector [26] . The expression plasmid containing the myc-tagged murine ASCT1 was kindly provided by David Kabat [14] .
