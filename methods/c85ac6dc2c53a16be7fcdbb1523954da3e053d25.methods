Our investigation evaluated the community-wide bodytemperature monitoring campaign and SARS fever hotline in the city of Taipei, which makes up 11.8% of the population of Taiwan (population of Taiwan, 22.51 million [9]). We analyzed data from three sources: hotline call data reported to the Bureau of National Health Insurance for all of Taiwan; hotline call data for Taipei; and data from a telephone survey of Taipei residents. Data were evaluated for the period June 1-10, 2003, corresponding to the duration of the body-temperature monitoring campaign as well as the first 10 days of the hotline. 2
