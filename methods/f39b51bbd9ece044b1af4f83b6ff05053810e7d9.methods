Cell Culture. Tissue culture cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5% (BHK-21) or 10% (Vero) FCS. Cells were grown at 37 Њ C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Pulse-Chase Labeling. Pulse-chase experiments were performed as previously described (Rosenwald et al., 1992; Weisz et al., 1993) . Briefly, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes the night before the experiment to be 90% confluent the next day. VSV (San Juan strain, Indiana serotype) was adsorbed for 30 min in 0.5 ml of serum-free DME. At 4 h after infection, the cells were starved for methionine for 15 min. Cells were then pulsed for 5 min with 50 Ci 35 S-Pro-mix and chased for the indicated amount of time in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. The isopropanol carrier alone had no effect on the rate of transport of VSV G protein. After the chase, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in detergent. VSV G protein was then immunoprecipitated, treated with endo H as described (Rosenwald et al., 1992) , separated by SDS-PAGE, and visu-alized by fluorography. Endo H-sensitive and -resistant forms of the VSV G protein were quantitated by densitometry. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy. These experiments were performed as previously described (Swift and Machamer, 1991) . Briefly, cells were infected for 30 min with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding IBV M, and the indicated treatments were begun 4 h after infection. For experiments using exogenous ceramides, the soluble short-chain analogues of ceramide were added to cells as a complex with 0.34 mg/ml defatted BSA as described (Pagano and Martin, 1988) . After treatment, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the appropriate antibody. Images were acquired using a microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a CCD camera (Photometrics Sensys, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). All images shown are the raw data collected at 1 ϫ 1 binning with a gain of 1. Lipid Synthesis Assays. Cells were seeded onto 6-cm plastic dishes 2 d before the experiment so that they were 90% confluent the day of the experiment. Cells were incubated in DME supplemented with 50 g/ml cycloheximide, and half of the dishes were also incubated with 5 mM ␤ CA. 1 h later, fresh medium containing cycloheximide and [ 3 H]palmitate (100 Ci/ dish) was added, along with either 1% isopropanol (control and ␤ CA) or 100 M PDMP and 5 mM ␤ CA if indicated. 1 h later, cells were trypsinized and washed off the plate in 0.8 ml cold PBS. To normalize lipid levels, 50 l were removed for a protein assay by the method of Bradford (1976) . Lipids were then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) . Labeled samples were doped with 10 g cold ceramide to allow for visualization. Samples were run on 10 ϫ 10 cm high performance thinlayer chromatography plates with a mobile phase of chloroform/glacial acetic acid (9:1; Abe et al., 1992) . Plates were sprayed with water to visualize the ceramide bands that were scraped and counted after the addition of scintillation fluid. Alternatively, plates were dipped in 10% 4,5-diphenyloxazole in chloroform for visualization by fluorography (Henderson and Tocher, 1992) .
