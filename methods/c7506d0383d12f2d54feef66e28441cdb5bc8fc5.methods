A questionnaire-based survey was conducted from the 1st of November 2011 to the 30th of April 2013. Data collection was performed 2 days each week. Travelers leaving from the departure gates of the Athens International Airport were invited to participate in the survey. The inclusion criteria were being a Greek resident, ≥19 years old, and traveling to Asia or the Middle East. Travelers going to Australia, New Zealand and Japan were excluded from the survey. Therefore, only three airlines were selected. A total of 1666 adult travelers were studied. We sought to study 1500-2000 participants at the beginning of the study, which corresponds to approximately 10% of the total number of travelers to Asian destinations according to Hellenic National Statistics Authority data (personal communication). We aimed for a large sample size was to cover a wide range of destinations in our study. The travelers participated on a voluntary basis, and oral informed consent was obtained. Approval was given by the International Airport Authority, the airlines flying to the above destinations, and the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Data was collected using a standardized anonymous questionnaire that was specifically designed in the Greek language. This questionnaire was administered by 4 trained interviewers and required approximately 10 min. The data included information about demographics, travel characteristics, and pre-travel consultations (vaccination, malaria prophylaxis, general preventive measures, and the source of any pre-travel consultation). Approximately 10 randomly selected travelers were interviewed each per visit in the waiting area for the airport gates according to the inclusion criteria and the selected flights. The interviews were conducted twice weekly (∼20 per week and ∼90 per month throughout the study period). High-risk areas and those with moderate to high prevalences of malaria were defined according to published sources [4, [18] [19] [20] . The definition of high-risk travelers regarding exposure to malaria in endemic areas was also based on the travel characteristics. Adequate vaccines and malaria prophylaxis defined according to the National Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) guidelines, which are in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [21] [22] [23] . Urban accommodation was defined as living in a city with a populations of 5000 or more people, and rural accommodation was defined as living in a village with a population up to 5000 or residence in the countryside (Hellenic Statistics Authority: personal communication). Short-term travel was defined by trips of <1 month duration, and long-term travel was defined by trips of >1 month. An organized trip was defined as a guided, package trip, and these trips were primarily to popular tourist destinations. Outdoor activities included adventure sports, backpacking, hiking, and remote expedition. Travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) were defined as immigrants to Greece who were returning to their homeland, which was lower-income country, to visit friends or relatives according to the definition outlined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [24] . Chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the categorical variables. A standard multiple logistic regression was conducted (with the variables with p-values <0.15 in the univariate analyses) to examine the relations between pre-travel preparation and independent factors. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify the factors that influenced the decision to seek a pretravel consultation. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. Unanswered items were excluded from the analyses. The analyses were performed using STATA v12.1 software.
