Cell culture and virus. Noncytopatic BVDV-free MDBK cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco/BRL) supplemented with 10% (v/v) BVDV-free fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Teddington, UK), 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). The cytopathic (cp) BVDV (NADL strain) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. Reagents and antibodies. Dithiothreitol, L -methionine, protein G-Sepharose, and the protease inhibitor cocktail were from Sigma. [ 35 S]Methionine/cysteine (Tran 35 S-label 1100 Ci/mmol) and the methionine-and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 (starvation) medium were from ICN flow (Thame, Oxfordshire, UK). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimicyn (DMJ), the proteaseome inhibitors N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-Lnorleucinal (N-ALL-N), and lactacystin were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 214 against BVDV E2 glycoprotein were purchased from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge, UK). The polyclonal anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-calnexin antibodies were purchased from Bioquote (York, UK). The anti-mouse and antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham. Infection of MDBK cells with BVDV. MDBK cells were grown to subconfluent monolayers in six-well plates and infected with cp BVDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell, for 1 h at 37°C, as previously described [13] . After the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The incubation continued for 9 h postinfection (pi) in RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were then treated or not with different inhibitors, as detailed in the figure legend, harvested after the times indicated and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA (Triton-TSE buffer). Western blotting. Proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry electroblotter (Millipore) and detected with anti-BVDV E2 antibodies (MAb 214, diluted 1/1000 in PBS containing 1% dry milk), followed by anti-mouse antibodies (dilution 1/2000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In experiments in which detection of actin and calnexin was used as a loading control, polyclonal anti-actin, and anti-calnexin antibodies were used (dilution 1/4000). The proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions. Pulse-labeling and chase. Subconfluent MDBK cell monolayers were infected with BVDV at MOI 1. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, the viral inoculum was removed, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Eighteen hours pi the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in starvation buffer. When the effect of either proteasome or the ER-mannosidase inhibitors was analyzed, the corresponding drugs were included in starvation buffer, at concentrations indicated in the figure legend. After 1 h, the cells were pulse-labeled at 37°C with 100 lCi of Tran 35 S-label per ml, in the presence or absence of 5 mM DTT, for the times indicated in the figures. Following labeling, the isotope-supplemented medium was removed, the cells were washed once with PBS and chased for various times in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mM unlabeled methionine. At the time points indicated in the figures, 5 mM DTT was added to the chase medium and the cells were further incubated in the presence of the reducing agent for various times. After discarding the chase medium the radioactively labeled cells were harvested and lysed in Triton-TSE buffer, and a mixture of protease inhibitors, for 1 h on ice. In experiments in which the association of the BVDV glycoproteins into disulfide-linked dimers was monitored, 20 mM iodoacetamide was included in the lysis buffer to prevent nonspecific formation of disulfide bonds and aggregation. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Labeled cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000g for 15 min, and precleared with 20 ll of protein G-Sepharose, for 1 h at 4°C. The lysates were briefly centrifuged and the supernatants incubated with anti-BVDV E2 MAb 214 antibodies (diluted 1:50) overnight at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose (30 ll) was then added to the supernatants and the incubation continued for 1 h at 4°C. The slurry was washed six times with 0.2% Triton X-100 in TSE buffer and the immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted by boiling the samples for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, in the presence (reducing conditions) or absence (nonreducing conditions) of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and followed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then treated with Amplifier (Amersham), dried and exposed at )70°C to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). The intensity of the bands on the resulting autoradiograms was measured by scan densitometry.
