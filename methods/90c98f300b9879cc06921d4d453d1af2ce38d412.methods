This was a questionnaire carried out over 5 weeks from February 11 to March 18, 2010, at Isra University, Hyderabad. At the time of our study, a total of 528 students were enrolled in first through fifth year. A simple random sampling methodology was conducted using a Texas Instrument (TI)-87 scientific calculator (Dallas, TX) to obtain numbers from the students' enrollment list. The survey was distributed to 264 medical students at a confidence interval of 95% and assuming a margin of error at 4.3%. The self-developed questionnaire assessed knowledge, behavioral intentions, and perceptions of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which was referred to by its vernacular alternative, "swine flu." For this, searches on relevant literature were carried out. A team of medical students carried out the data collection. The questionnaires were pilot tested on a convenience group of 20 students and modified accordingly. The final version consisted of multiple choice questions and was handed out in classrooms after obtaining consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the relevant Ethics Committee. Sociodemographic details of each student included age, marital status, medical year, and locality. Only those who were aware of the H1N1 pandemic were asked (1) mode of transmission; (2) signs and symptoms of H1N1; (3) response if H1N1 symptoms are found; and (4) concern about contracting H1N1. Assessment of the responses of recommended precautionary measures was in accordance to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All randomly selected medical students of Isra University were included. Students who were absent during the study duration or who refused to participate were excluded. The data were analyzed using the SPSS version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). We regarded a P value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant. Descriptive statistics were employed to determine the demographic and clinical variables.
