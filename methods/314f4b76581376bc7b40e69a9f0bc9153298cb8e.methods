We conducted a retrospective review of four different types of outbreaks that recently occurred in Illinois: a restaurant-associated foodborne illness outbreak; the introduction of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV) to the United States; a large rash outbreak; and a healthcare-associated cluster of New Delhi metallobeta-lactamase (NDM). Using these four case studies, we evaluated how REDCap may have impacted the response to each outbreak using six criteria: 1) magnitude of cases and contacts across jurisdictions; 2) self-reporting of symptoms and exposures; 3) storage and multisite access to lab reports; 4) reuse of templates for future outbreaks; 5) repeated measurements; and 6) ability to perform long-term case follow-up.
