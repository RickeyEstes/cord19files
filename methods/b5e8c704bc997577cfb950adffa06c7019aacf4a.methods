Computational analysis. Virus sequences were obtained from GenBank initially in Feb 2007 and again in Nov 2010. Arterivirus nucleotide sequences with coverage of the ORF5 region were identified by applying NCBI TBLASTN (Altschul et al., 1990) to the GP5 amino acid sequences from the five reference sequences shown in Fig. 2(b) . In total one SHFV, five LDV, 435 EAV and 10 359 PRRSV sequences with full or partial coverage of ORF5 were retrieved. PRRSV sequences were separated into PRRSV-NA and PRRSV-EU genotypes (with respect to GP5), based on the TBLASTN results. Using a 76 % cut-off threshold on the TBLASTN 'maximum identity' score, all but eight of the 10 359 sequences were cleanly separated between the two genotypes. Within each group, ORF5 sequences were translated, aligned and back-translated to nucleotide sequence alignments using EMBOSS and CLUSTAL (Rice et al., 2000; Larkin et al., 2007) . Flanking nucleotide sequences, where available, were similarly extracted, aligned and combined into the alignments. Patent sequences and constructs were removed prior to analysis, and sequences annotated as defective (found by using the search terms 'non-functional', 'truncated' and 'defective' in GenBank records) were inspected and removed from the analyses where appropriate. MLOGD statistics were calculated as described by Firth & Brown (2006) . The synonymous site conservation statistic was calculated as described by Firth & Atkins (2009) . Prior to these latter two analyses: (i) sequences with premature termination codons in ORF5 or ORF5a were also removed as being presumed-defective sequences (these amount to ,1 % of sequences and are not obviously clustered phylogenetically), (ii) one EAV sequence with nine ambiguous nucleotide codes -indicative of poor sequence quality -was removed and (iii) since there was no shortage of PRRSV-NA sequences, PRRSV-NA sequences with any ambiguous nucleotide codes (~10 % of sequences) were removed. Cells and plaque assays. EEC cells (Hedges et al., 2001) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Mediatech) with 110 mg l -1 sodium pyruvate, 10 % FBS (HyClone; Thermo Scientific), 100 U penicillin ml -1 and 100 mg streptomycin ml -1 (Invitrogen), and 200 mM L-glutamine. BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL10) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 10 % ferritin-supplemented bovine calf serum and 100 U penicillin ml -1 and 100 mg streptomycin ml -1 . Plaque assays on BHK-21 cells were performed for 3-5 days as described previously (Nedialkova et al., 2010) , whereas EEC cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.75 % carboxymethyl cellulose and incubated for 4 days. Engineering of EAV ORF5a knockout mutants and reverse genetics. ORF5a knockout mutants D5a-1 and D5a-2 (Fig. 2b) were created as follows: point mutations were introduced in an appropriate shuttle vector by standard site-directed PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit; Agilent Technologies). Using suitable restriction sites, the desired mutations in the ORF5acoding sequence were transferred into EAV full-length cDNA clone pEAV515 or into pEAVrVBS, an infectious cDNA clone of the virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV (Balasuriya et al., 2007) . pEAV515 is a derivative of the EAV cDNA clone pEAV030 (van Dinten et al., 1997) , in which the BglII site at position 5217 in ORF1a was knocked out by using a translationally silent substitution. EAV515 virus has a wildtype phenotype, as determined by comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth-curve experiments and plaque assays. BHK-21 or EEC cells were electroporated with in vitro-synthesized full-length RNA transcripts of wild-type and mutant cDNA clones as described previously (van Dinten et al., 1997) . For IF assays, cells were seeded on coverslips, paraformaldehyde-fixed and double labelled for EAV nsp3 and N protein as described by van der Meer et al. (1998) . Analysis of revertants was done by infecting fresh BHK-21 cells with supernatant harvested at 40 and 72 h post-transfection. Total RNA was isolated after 24 h by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the ORF5a region was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced using standard protocols. Generation of ORF5a-expressing BHK-21 cells. The coding sequence of ORF5a was PCR amplified using sense primer E1036 (CGTACGCGTCCATGGGGTTCTTTTACGACTGGTACGTTG; MluI site underlined) and antisense primer E1037 (CGTGCATGCTCA-TATCGCAGCAAATTGGCAATA; SphI site underlined), and cloned between the MluI and SphI sites of the pSinRep19 multiple cloning site (Agapov et al., 1998) . To obtain EAV ORF5a-expressing BHK-21 cells (BHK-SinRep19-ORF5a), in vitro-transcribed SinRep19-ORF5a RNA was transfected and puromycin selection (5 mg ml 21 ) was applied from 24 h post-transfection onwards. A SinRep19 vector expressing GFP was used to produce a control cell line (BHK-SinRep19-GFP).
