Our analysis of newspaper reports utilised the online newspaper archive, Nexis UK, to identify all articles referring either to 'H1N1' or its earlier appellation -'swine flu' -anywhere in the text. 5 The period searched was from 25 April 2009, when the UK press first reported this story, to 4 September 2009, when the first purported pandemic 'wave' had subsided. Due to the high volume of the material available, it was not possible to perform a single analysis covering the entire timeframe. Consequently, individual searches -using the same terms -were conducted for whole months (i.e. April, May, June, etc.), with the exception of July where, due to the size of the dataset, two searches were undertaken (for periods 1-15 July and 16-31 July). The timeframe incorporated reporting on: the emergence of an influenza-like illness in Mexico and California (25 April 2009), its arrival in the UK (28 April 2009 6 ) and its subsequent spread to various UK regions, the WHO declaration of the pandemic phase 6 7 (11 June 2009), the first reported UK death from the disease (14 June 2009), the peak of the ostensible first 'wave' of the pandemic (week ending 23 July 2009 (HPA, 2009f)) and its subsequent decline (August 2009). All articles, from main features to editorials and opinions, were included in the study. Duplicates were removed. Accompanying descriptive data, such as title, author (and affiliation, where relevant), recurring themes and use of expert opinion were collected and recorded. Fig. 1 gives an indication of frequency of reporting on the virus during this period, whilst Fig. 2 details the rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) 8 in (i) England and Wales and (ii) Scotland 9 during this timeframe. Following a single mention in the Northern Echo on 25 April, interest in the H1N1 virus surged, in both the national and regional press. Indeed, newspaper reporting during first 2 weeks accounted for over 20% of the total coverage on the disease throughout the timeframe. Following the initial surge in press coverage, the curves for UK newspaper reporting and ILI in England and Wales (by July experiencing significant higher rates than Scotland) are closely matched, indicating that the newspapers wish to both shape the agenda and foster public understanding during periods of increased influenza activity. Fig. 3 depicts the curve of reporting published during the first 14 days of UK newspaper coverage of the virus. As can be seen, the initial 'surge' in press interest, evocative of Chan's 'tidal wave' metaphor, peaked at 368 articles on 5 Our approach contrasts with methodologies being used by public health authorities, particularly in the United States, which make increasing use of webmining tools that monitor 'hits' on infectious diseases, for example, Google Flu Trends (Google Flu Trends, WWW). Moreover, mobile phone technology is being developed to allow for further patient input into public health surveillance through global positioning systems, text messaging and 'micro-blogging' applications such as Twitter (Brownstein et al., 2009 Thursday, the 30 April. Reporting during this early phase was fairly consistent across the national and regional press. National titles such as The Guardian and The Times, and including tabloid publications such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, comprised just over 40% of the stories published. The regional press accounted for the remainder, with 35 titles reporting on H1N1 at least 10 times during this 14-day period (see Fig. 4 ). The virus was given particularly prominent coverage in the initial hotspots in and around Birmingham (Birmingham Evening Mail, Birmingham Post, Coventry Evening Telegraph) and in parts of Scotland (The Herald, Scotsman and Scotsman on Sunday). Other locations reporting widely included Belfast (Belfast Evening Telegraph), Newcastle (The Journal) and London (Evening Standard).
