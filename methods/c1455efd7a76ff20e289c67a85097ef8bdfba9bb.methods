A 10-question nonanonymous survey was developed by us and distributed by the Children's Hospital Association during fall and winter 2012-2013. Questions focused on specific airborne isolation capacity and perceptions of adequacy during routine management of endemic respiratory infections. Hospitals that received the survey were 43 primarily free-standing children's hospitals. SurveyMonkey (www.SurveyMonkey.com) was utilized and some hospitals not responding were directly contacted and interviewed by telephone. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board waived the consent requirement for this survey.
