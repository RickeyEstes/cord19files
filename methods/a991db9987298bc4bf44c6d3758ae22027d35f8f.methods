An anonymous survey comprised of 5-point, Likertscale items was conducted in early June 2003. Medical staff (obstetricians), nursing staff, medical students, and supporting staff working in the labor ward and the obstetrics operating theater were asked about the necessity for and their satisfaction with each of the universal precautionary measures. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS for PCs, Version 11.5 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Bivariate correlation procedures and one-way analysis of variance tests were used, with statistical significance defined as P < 0.05.
