Epidemic spreading on the network model of recurrent epidemic patterns. We take the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) as an example. We first construct the UCM network with a power-law degree distribution ( ) − p k k 3 by following ref. 48 . We let its size be = N 1000, average degree be = . k 6 5 , and let k be limited in the range ∈ ( , ) k N 4 . Then, we consider the case that each node of the UCM network is occupied by a person and take the SIRS model for the epidemic spreading, see the schematic plot in Fig. 3 . We let a susceptible person have two ways to be infected. One is the infection by a small probability p 0 , representing the natural infection from environment or unknown reasons. The other is the infection by a contagious rate β, representing the infection from contacting with an infected person. When a susceptible node has k inf infected neighbors, it will become infected with probability β − ( − ) 1 1 k inf . At the same time, the infected node will decay into a refractory one with probability μ. For the process from refractory to susceptible state, ref. 47 assumed that a person will stay at the refractory state for a constant time τ and then go back to the susceptible state. However, in reality, individuals may have different habitus and thus may need different τ to recover. To overcome this defect, instead of the fixed τ, we here let each refractory person have a small probability δ to recover from the refractory to susceptible state. In numerical simulations, we fix µ = . 0 2 and δ = . 0 02. We choose the dependence of β ( ) t on time by the following way: we divide the time t into T intervals with equal length and let T = 52, corresponding to the 52 weeks in one year. We let β ( ) t be a constant in each interval and different constants in different intervals. The value of the constant is randomly chosen from the Gaussian distribution with average β and standard deviation σ. Once a negative β ( ) t is chosen, we discard it and then choose a new one.

The second term stands for the probability that node i is changed from the refractory to susceptible state. Similarly, we have the same explanation for the second and third equations of Eq. (2). Substituting Eq. (1) into Eq. (2)
