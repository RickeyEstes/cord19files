The study was performed in the Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, which situates in Zhejiang province, East China, with over 1000 beds and one mixed ICU of 13 beds. Since 1996, the hospital started an infection control program, including collection of data on infections acquired in the hospital. In the present study, data from January 2003 to December 2007 for patients in the ICU were retrieved by the Infection Control Team since completed raw data of the patients in ICU were available only after 2003. This retrospective study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College. All patients admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours were monitored for nosocomial infections, which were defined according to the American CDC. [1] Infections developed within 48 hours of discharge from the ICU were also considered to be ICU-acquired unless there was an identified cause after discharge. The major nosocomial infections, including lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), urine tract infections (UTIs), bloodstream infections (BSIs) and gastrointestinal tract infections (GIs) were defined as followings. LRTIs refer to lower respiratory tract infection, other than pneumonia, i.e. bronchitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheitis, without evidence of pneumonia. BSIs refers to laboratoryconfirmed bloodstream infections, UTIs refers to symptomatic urinary tract infections and GIs refers to gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel, and rectum) infections excluding gastroenteritis and appendicitis. The detailed criteria to diagnose these nosocomial infections were described in the CDC documents [1] . Data on the date and site of infection, patient demographic information and device use were collected for each infection. Moreover, data on the isolated pathogens and their susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents, if available, were also collected. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate was calculated by dividing the total number of patients with nosocomial infections by the total number of patients in the ICU (×100) during the defined period of time (i.e. each year). The incidence density rate of nosocomial infections was calculated by dividing the total number of nosocomial infections by the total patient days (×1000) during the defined period of time. The total patients days were calculated by summating the days of each patient in the ICU. In the meantime, the length of stay, which was defined as the overall days of a patient spent in the hospital including the ICU and another department to which the patient was transferred from ICU after stabilization of the conditions. The excess length of stay was then calculated by subtracting the average length of stay for patients without nosocomial infection from that of patients with nosocomial infections. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 13.2 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA). Chi-square test and Spearman's rank-correlation coefficients were applied where appropriate. For all analyses, a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
