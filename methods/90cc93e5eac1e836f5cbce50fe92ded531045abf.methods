Preparation of 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite. 59-(4,49-Dimethoxytrityl)-6-N-benzoyl-6-N-methyl-adenosine,29-O-methyl-39-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite) was prepared as follows: tetrabutylammonium bromide (260 mg, 807 mmol) and aq. NaOH (1M, 7 ml) were added to a stirring solution of 2'-OMe-Bz-A-CE phosphoramidite (Link Technologies, 708 mg, 797 mmol) and iodomethane (200 ml, 3.21 mmol) in dichloromethane (7 ml). After vigorous stirring for 30 min, ether and water were added and the resulting layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether, the combined organic extracts were dried over Na 2 SO 4 and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite was readily purified by column chromatography (1:1 petrol/etherR9:1 ether/methanol) affording 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite (403 mg, 56%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers) and 2'-OMe-Bz-m 1 A-CE phosphoramidite (182 mg, 25%, white foam, 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers). Data for 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite and for 2'-OMe-Bz-m 1 A-CE phosphoramidite are presented in Supplementary Table S1. online. Synthesis of oligoribonucleotides SK-524 and SK-526. Oligoribonucleotides SK-524(AmGGGCUGCU) and SK-526(m 6 AmGGGCUGCU) were synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultraflex III mass spectrometer via MALDI-TOF. Columns (SynBaseTM CPG 1000Ã… , RNA: 0.2 mmol), apart from the 2'-OMe-Bz-m 6 A-CE phosphoramidite, standard RNA-phosphoramidites and reagents for the synthesizer were purchased from Link Technologies Ltd., MeNH 2 solution (33 wt.% in ethanol) was obtained from Fluka, NEt 3 N3HF, N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (HPA) and DowexTM 50WX8-200 were purchased from Aldrich, illustra Nap TM -10 columns were obtained from GE Healthcare Europe GmbH. Dichloromethane and acetonitrile were freshly distilled from CaH 2 before use on the synthesizer. The RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a standard 0.2 mM scale protocol, but with a 15 min coupling time for each nucleotide addition step. The polymer-bound oligoribonucleotide was transferred from the synthesis column to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and suspended in MeNH 2 solution (1 ml). The mixture was heated to 65 uC for 10 min, cooled to room temperature (water/icebath) and centrifuged for 1 min (10,000 g). The supernatant was separated from the CPG beads, the beads were washed with RNase free water (2 3 0.25 ml), all supernatants were combined and dried (2 h under nitrogen stream, then freeze dried). The oligoribonucleotide was resuspended in anhydrous NEt 3 N3HF/NEt 3 /NMP solution (250 ml of a solution of 1.5 ml NMP, 750 mlNEt 3 and 1.0 ml NEt 3 N3HF), heated to 65 uC for 1.5 h, cooled to room temperature and quenched with 3M NaOAc solution (25 ml). n-BuOH (1 ml) was added to the mixture, which was then thoroughly mixed, cooled to 270 uC for 1 -2 h to encourage further precipitation and centrifuged for 30 min (4 uC, 13 000 g). The supernatant was removed, the pellet washed with 70% EtOH (2 3 500 ml) and then dried in vacuo (30 min). The dry precipitate was dissolved in RNase free water (1 ml) and desalted using a Nap TM -10 column following the standard protocol. The resulting solution was freeze dried over night leaving the oligoribonucleotide as a white foam/powder. Samples for MALDI-mass spectrometry were prepared as follows 36 : Dowex TM ion-exchange beads were rigorously cleaned with dilute HCl, washed with water, then treated with dilute NH 3 and finally washed with water again to generate Dowex-NH 4 1 . Diammonium citrate (DAC) (100 mg) was dissolved in water (1 ml) and HPA (34.8 mg) was dissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile/ water (1 ml). The HPA solution was filtered through Dowex-NH 4 1 and the DAC solution (100 ml) was added to prepare the matrix stock. Prior to MALDI-MS acquisition, matrix stock (20 ml) was mixed with Dowex-NH 4 1 (5 ml) and each oligoribonucleotide sample (1 ml) was mixed with Dowex-NH 4 1 (19 ml). After 30 min the matrix, and after drying, the sample solution (0.5ml) were spotted onto the sample well and allowed to dry prior to confirmatory analysis by MALDI-MS. RNA purification. Total RNA was prepared from mouse (C57BL/6) tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The poly(A) RNA was purified twice using oligo(dT) cellulose (Fluka) followed by oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen). All samples were quantified and assayed for poly(A) purity using an Agilent Bioanalyser. Analysis of gene-specific mRNA cap structures. Regions corresponding to the first 300 to 500 nucleotides of the target messages were PCR amplified from cDNAs using the following oligonucleotides: Apoa1forward GCTCCGGGGAGGTCACCCACACCT and Apoa1reverse CAATGGGCCCAGCCGTTCCTGCAGC; Albforward CCCCACTAGCCTCTGGCAAAATGAAGTG and Albreverse GGCTGGGGTTGTCATCTTTGTGTTGCAG; Prm2forward GCTGGGTGTGCGCGAGTCAGGGGCTC and Prm2reverse CTTGTGGATCCTATGTAGCCTCTTACG; Pabpc1forward CGGCGGTTAGTGCTGAGAGTGCGGAG and Pabpc1reverse GAAGTTCACGTACGCGTAGCCCAAGG. Prior to amplification, the forward oligonucleotides were 5' phosphorylated, the amplification products were subsequently digested with lambda nuclease (New England BioLabs) to leave the single stranded antisense DNA strand. 100 ng of this ssDNA (2 ml) was spotted onto 2 mm 3 2 mm teeth cut from a Hybond N 1 membrane ( Amersham) (Fig. 2B,C) , and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker). Membranes were prehybridised at 42 uC in 40 % formamide with 5 3 Denhardt's, 3 % SDS, 0.3 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.1 mg ml 21 sonicated salmon sperm DNA. 600 ng of poly(A) RNA was digested with 20 units of Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Epicentre) for 30 minutes at 37 uC. The 5' phosphate of the exposed cap adjacent nucleotide was removed by the addition of 10 units of Alkaline Phosphatase (Fermentas) and incubation for a further 15 minutes at 37 uC. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA samples were resuspended in 20 ml of sterile distilled water and 5' ends were labelled using 30 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK, Fermentas) and 7.4 MBq [c-32 P] ATP at 37 uC for 30 minutes. The PNK was heat inactivated (70 uC for 15 min) and the reaction made up to 60 ml with sterile distilled water then passed through a P-30 spin column (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated isotope. A 1 ml aliquot was taken, added to 9 ml of nuclease P1 buffer and digested with P1 (Sigma) for one hour at 37 uC. 1.5 ml of the released 5' monophosphates from this digest was then analysed by 2D TLC as described previously 25 . The remaining end labelled RNA was fragmented to lengths of approximately 120 nt by the addition of Na 2 CO 3 to a final concentration of 60 mM and NaHCO 3 to a final concentration of 40 mM followed by incubation for one hour at 60 uC.12 ml 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 was then added and the RNA precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of pre-hybridisation buffer then added to the membranes (final volume 2 ml) and hybridised overnight at 42 uC. Membrane washings were carried out with 2 3, 1 3 and 0.2 3 SSC, 0.1% SDS. Two final washes were carried out at 60 uC, with 0.2 3 SSC but with the SDS omitted. Hybridised membranes were exposed to storage phosphor screens (K-screen; KODAK) and imaged using Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX in combination with Quantity One 4.6.3 software (Bio-Rad). Individual teeth containing the target mRNAs end labelled at the cap adjacent position were cut off and digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in a final volume of 3 ml. All of this digestion mix was applied to a cellulose coated TLC plate (20 3 20 cm, MERCK) and developed as described previously 25 .
