This study included 124 infants aged between zero and six months with diagnoses of bronchiolitis that were admitted to the Pediatric Clinic Division of the University Hospital of the University of São Paulo between 2013 and 2015. The infants were enrolled in the study by one of the authors (MP) who collected nasopharyngeal secretions after written consent was obtained from the child's parents. On examination, the clinical and socioeconomic backgrounds, clinical signs/symptoms, and diagnosis at admission were recorded on a standard form. Diagnosis of bronchiolitis was defined as the first wheezing crisis, beginning no more than 3 days before hospital admission. For clinical analysis, infants diagnosed with or suspected of having bacterial or fungal infections and those who received antibiotics, macrolides, or antifungals prior to or during hospitalization were excluded. Infants with codetection of respiratory viruses were also excluded from the clinical analysis. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the University of São Paulo (1011/10) and was funded by Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (12/22854-9) . Nasal wash fluid was obtained after washing the nostrils with 3 ml of a saline solution and collecting the suctioned specimen in a cup within a maximum of 24 hours after admission. HRSV-positive samples were amplified by traditional PCR in two steps for DNA sequencing: cDNA was synthesized using the Super Script III kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The second hypervariable region of the G protein gene PCR was carried out with the primers Gr5_fwd (5 -CTGGCAATGATAATCTCAACTTC-3 ) and FV_rev (5 -GTTATGACACTGGTATACCAACC-3 ) in a 10 L mixture that contained 5 L of 10x PCR buffer, 25 mM of each dNTP, 25 pmol of each primer, and 1.5 U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for a final volume of 50 L. The amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A second step with Seminested PCR was carried out using the F1AB_rev (5 -CAACTCCATTGTTATTTGCC-3 ) primer corresponding to bases 3-22 of the F gene. The traditional PCR assays were performed with the following program: 95 ∘ C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles, each composed of 30 sec at 95 ∘ C, 30 sec at 55 ∘ C, and 45 sec at 72 ∘ C, and finally 7 minutes of extension at 72 ∘ C. The amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. The amplified products of gene G were ≈490 bp, were purified by ExoSap-IT (Affymetrix, Inc., USA), and were submitted to a cycle sequencing reaction (Sanger) using the Bigdye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and GR5, FV or F1AB primers in a 3100 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Both strands of each amplicon were sequenced at least twice. Sequence editing, alignments, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with MegAlign 5.03 v software (DNAStar, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Standard published sequences from subgroups A (accession numbers from KY828387 to KY828428) and B (accession numbers from KY828374 to KY828386) were downloaded from GenBank as references of different lineages and genotypes.
