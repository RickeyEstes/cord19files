The study involved a total of 278 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate which originated from Wenling hospital in China between February 2005 and December 2006 after informed consent was obtained from patients. The study population consisted of children ≤5 years old with acute LRTIs (median age of patients = 3 years). Respiratory symptom and signs were recorded on a standardized form during the emergency department visit or while the patient was hospitalized. The RNA and blood samples were originally screened for nucleic acid and antibodies by using RT-PCR and an indirect immunofluorescence assay as described (Lin et al., 2007) . DNA from each respiratory specimen was extracted by use of QIAamp nucleic acid purification kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and detected for WUPyV, human bocavirus and KI virus. The genomic DNA extracts were identified for WUPyV by PCR with primers targeting the VP2 and LTAg gene according to Gaynor et al. (2007) and Han et al. (2007) . Human bocavirus was detected by using the method as described (Allander et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007) . Then KIPyV was detected by nested PCR assays that used primers POLVP1-39F, POLVP1-363R, POLVP1-118F, and POLVP1-324R, as described (Allander et al., 2007; Han et al., 2007) . The sequence of primers corresponding to WUPyV VP2 gene was AG0044 and AG0045; the sequence of primers corresponding to WUPyV LTAg gene for confirmation was AG0048 and AG0049 (Gaynor et al., 2007) . Meanwhile, the genomic DNA of WUPyV was amplified by using five primer sets, respectively. The sequence of each primer was shown as follows: 82-1440 bp, 5 -TTT TAG CCA ATT AGC AGC C AC AAG-3 , 5 -TAG TCT TTG AGT TGC ATC TCT TAC-3 ; 1333-2521 bp, 5 -TTA CAA ATA GCT GCA GGT CAA CC-3 ; 5 -AAATCTGGAAAGCCCTGTATGTACTC-3 ; 2451-3582 bp, 5 -GAT TGT ACA TAA CTT GTG CTG ACC-3 , 5 -AAA ACT ATT AAA GGT GAG CAA GAT G-3 ; 3521-4582 bp, 5 -CCT AAA TAC CAG GCT ACA CCA G-3 , 5 -TAT TTC TTA CAA CCA TGC AAG G-3 ; 4559-155 bp, 5 -TAA TAA AAA CAT GCT TAC CTG G-3 , 5 -TGC CCG GAA ACT TTA AAA GGT CAC-3 , according to the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. EF444549). PCR mixture contained (50 L) 1× PCR buffer (TaKaRa), 200 mol/L dNTPs, target template was 2 L, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). PCR conditions were used as follows: 1 cycle of 94 • C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 • C for 30 s, 56 • C for 30 s, 72 • C for 30 s; and a final extension of 72 • C for 5 min; cool down to 4 • C forever. PCR conditions for genome DNA of WUPyV were used as follows: 1 cycle of 94 • C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 • C for 1 min, 50 • C for 1 min, 72 • C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 • C for 10 min. All PCR products were purified on a 1% agarose gel and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced using the T7 and SP6 primers on a DEQ 2000XL autoanalyzer (Applied Biosystems).
