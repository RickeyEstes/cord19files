Validation. The proposed analytical method was validated as per the recommendations laid down by International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline [23] . For linearity test, stock standard solution was prepared by dissolving 20.0 mg of (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin in 10 mL methanol (2.0 mg/mL), respectively. For precision test, the intraday and interday variation for determination were carried out at three different concentration levels: 0.0003, 0.1, and 2.0 mg/mL. Three replicates were performed for each concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were separately determined at a signal to noise ratio ( / ) of 3 and 10.
