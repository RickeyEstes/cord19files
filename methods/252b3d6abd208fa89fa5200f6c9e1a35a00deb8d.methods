All new staff members at Vancouver General Hospital and its affiliated long-term care and rehabilitation facilities are required to take a 30-minute online infection control course as part of a 4-day orientation program. The course uses graphics, videos, and text to teach the principles of infection control, hand hygiene (HH), and PPE use. 13 To assess whether or not the course actually improves PPE selection and use by HCWs, observational analysis was used to assess the transfer of learning from the course to the HCWs√ï behavior. 14-17 From March to June 2007, nurses, care aides, and allied health staff attending the orientation program were invited to participate in a structured observation of PPE use before and after taking the infection control course. A total of 145 HCWs were recruited (100% of all orientation program attendees), but only 117 complete observations precourse and postcourse were collected. All of the HCWs provided informed consent before participation.
