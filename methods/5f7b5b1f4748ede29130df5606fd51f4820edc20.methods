Site-directed mutagenesis, expression, purification, and activity detection. The mutants G11A/ L141T/R298A (GRQ) and G11A/L141T/R298A/Q299A (GLRQ) of SARS-3CLpro were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using pET 3CLP-21h 20 or its derivatives as templates. The primers for all mutations are listed in Supplemental Table S3 . The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen, Beijing, China). All resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. The recombinant SARS-3CLpro and its mutants were prepared using ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation and chromatography, as previously described 20 . Enzyme activity was determined using a colorimetric substrate, Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA, as previously reported 20 . Substrate (200 μ M) was mixed with 18 μ M GRQ, 1.8 μ M GLRQ, or 1.8 μ M 3CLpro at 37 °C to compare their reaction rates. K m and k cat of GLRQ were studied by adding the preheated substrate to a reaction mixture to obtain a final concentration of 40.6 μ M GLRQ and 100-400 μ M substrate. Values of K m and k cat were calculated by the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Enzyme activity dependence of GLRQ at different concentrations was measured by fixing peptide-pNA substrate at 200 μ M and varying the enzyme concentration from 1.85 to 28.7 μ M. Inhibition assay. The isatin derivative, 1-(2-naphthlmethyl) isatin-5-carboxamide (5f) 26 , is known to inhibit SARS-3CLpro. 5f was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to test inhibition efficiency towards GLRQ. GLRQ (18.5 μ M) and 5f (160 μ M ) or control 2% DMSO were pre-incubated in 40 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) at 37 °C for 5 min, and then 200 μ M of the substrate (Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA) was added to the mixture and allowed to react for 750 s.
