This study was performed in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. A standardized MRI was taken of patients, including their bilateral joints. The apparatus was a GE Sigma Profile/Gold, and T1 weighted, coronal STIR, and transverse T1WI sequences were used. The parameters of the scan included a layer thickness of 5 mm and a distance between layers of 5 mm. The T1WI were obtained with a TR from 416~440 ms and a TE of 15 ms, and the STIR images were obtained with a TR of 1512 ms and a TE of 80 ms. If an abnormal signal was found, then a T2 weighted scan was added, and for some of the patients, we also performed fat suppression and water-fat separation sequences. We only used T1 and T2 sequences for the other joints of the patients. Osteonecrosis was defined as either a subchondral or an intramedullary area demarcated by a distinct marginal rim with low signal intensity that encompassed the medullary fat on the MRI images. In addition to the MRI, all patients were subjected to an X-ray that included the affected joints. Our general survey on the bones and joints of post-SARS medical workers who used corticosteroids revealed that the corticosteroid dose was approximately 2000 mg in unifocal osteonecrosis patients. By contrast, the dose was > 5000 mg in all MFON patients except for one patient who received 2000 mg, with the highest dose at 31,000 mg. The MFON patients also had prolonged corticosteroid treatment (â‰¥ 30 days) 3 . Of the 17 MFON patients diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2009, one had a 30-year history of alcohol abuse (average daily alcohol consumption of 500 g). The remaining 16 patients had a history of intensive steroid use for the following diseases: SLE (7 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4 patients), chronic nephropathy (3 patients), anaphylactoid purpura (1 patient) and pulse steroid therapy for traumatic shock (1 patient). Therefore, we summarized the high risk factors for MFON to include: a medical history of SLE, chronic nephropathy, hematological diseases or coagulation abnormalities (especially leukemia); total corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) dose > 5000 mg, especially for patients with a history of intravenous pulse therapy; and a total corticosteroid administration time of > 30 days. Between January 2010 and June 2015, a total of 1507 osteonecrosis patients were admitted to our center, and only 48 of them were diagnosed with MFON (3.1%) upon admission. A radiological investigation was performed in patients with a negative diagnosis of MFON but who had a high risk of MFON and complaints of pain in other joints. For patients found to have osteonecrosis of both the hip and knee, MRI was performed on their bilateral shoulders and ankles, and also their bilateral wrists and elbows when necessary, regardless of whether other joints were symptomatic. For patients with a history of corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse and who were found to have osteonecrosis of one or more joints in the shoulder, ankle, wrist and elbow, MRI was performed on their hips and knees and their other joints when necessary. The results were analyzed by a chi-square test the using SPSS 17 software. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
