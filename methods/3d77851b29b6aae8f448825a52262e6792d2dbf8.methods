Preoperative and postoperative serum ACE2 levels in 320 NSCLC patients who underwent major pulmonary resection were measured. The serum ACE2 levels on postoperative day 1 were divided into quartile categories. (Ang I) to form angiotensin II (Ang II), which exerts direct trophic actions on cardiovascular cells [6] . Local Ang II production is of key importance in the pathophysiology of the RAS in cardiovascular system [7] . Recently, ACE2, a new member of the RAS, was found to function as a negative regulator of the Ang system by metabolising Ang II to a putatively protective peptide Ang-(1-7) with high efficiency [8] [9] [10] . ACE2 is expressed and active in most tissues. The highest expression of ACE2 is observed in the endothelium, the lungs, and the heart [11] . It has been widely accepted that ACE2 is critical in balancing the activity of the ACE-Ang II axis and thus plays a pivotal role in the body as an endogenous regulator of the RAS [10] . In the present study, we for the first time explored the association between serum ACE2 levels and postoperative morbidity and mortality after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.
