As we know, a protein sequence is usually composed of 20 kinds of amino acids. Every amino acid has its own particular physicochemical properties. Therefore, to mine essential information from a protein sequence, we propose an effective graphical method combining physicochemical properties of amino acids and the BLOSUM62 matrix. Evolutionary Bioinformatics that one amino acid is replaced by other amino acids. In their scoring scheme, a positive score represents a higher similarity between 2 amino acids and a negative score represents a lower similarity.
