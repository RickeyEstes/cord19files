Samples were collected from several cities within Saudi Arabia where repeated MERS-CoV cases were recorded. Our team immediately visited these cafés for sampling hoses once primary MERS-CoV cases were announced by the Saudi Ministry of Health. Sampling protocol aimed to randomly swab waterpipe hoses at various cafés within each city, with emphasis to visit cafés close to camels market or located on highways leading to a camels market. Since the majority of customers prefer to smoke waterpipes in the evening, samples were collected in late evenings. Sterilized, individually wrapped swabs with a long plastic stack (Copan Diagnostics Inc., USA) were used to swab waterpipe hoses. Whenever a waterpipe was brought back from a customer to the café back rooms, a sample was taken from both ends of each hose then immediately immersed into a tube containing RNAlater (Qiagen). Tubes were placed in a dry shipper (MVE CryoShipper, 3A-CRYOGENIC FZE, United Arab Emirates) containing liquid nitrogen then transported to the laboratory for further investigation and screening. Samples were stored at the laboratory at À80°C prior to extraction.
