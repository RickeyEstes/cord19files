Viruses, cells and regents. The influenza Aichi2 virus was prepared from allantoic fluids of infected eggs at 2 days post-infection (dpi). The influenza PR8 wild-type and mutant viruses were generated by reverse genetics as described previously 40 . Additional information about plasmid construction and reverse genetics is provided in the Supplementary Methods. These viruses were similarly inoculated into eggs, except the inoculum of the NA R103K virus contained 1.5 mU Clostridium perfringens NA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). These viruses were isolated from allantoic fluids at 3 dpi. All viruses were purified by differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A549, MDCK, and 293T cells were subcultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Zanamivir was provided by GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development Ltd. (Stevenage, UK).
