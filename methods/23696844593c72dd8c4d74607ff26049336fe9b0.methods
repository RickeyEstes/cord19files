We performed a cross-sectional analysis of high capability severe acute respiratory failure center geographic access for the adult population based on previous resource allocation models [21, 22] . As many patients with severe ARDS are initially treated at community hospitals [8] , we created a two-level population geographic access model using high capability center locations and referring hospital locations. We defined geographic access as the percentage of the adult population living within a one-hour driving radius of a high capability center, plus the percentage of the adult population living within a one-hour driving radius of hospitals that may refer patients to these centers. We used a onehour driving radius to liberally estimate the hospital catchment population, based on prior studies that show 95% of emergency department patients live within 12 miles of the hospital [23, 24] , but also expecting that patients with more severe symptoms will be willing to drive farther for emergency treatment [25] . For interhospital transport access, we performed separate analyses for both one-hour and two-hour transport intervals. We examined state-level, regional and national geographic access when patient transport between referring hospitals and high capability centers was conducted using ground or rotary air transportation.
