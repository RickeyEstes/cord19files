Animals. CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ pairs (C57BL/6J ϫ 129/Ola background) were a gift of Gary Huffnagle (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich). Male B6129PF2 wild-type, C57Bl/6 (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine), and male CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were housed under laminar-flow hoods with HEPA-filtered air in the Veterinary Medical Unit, fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Antigen. S rectivirgula was prepared as previously described. [9] [10] [11] Study design. Our primary outcome was measurement of the extent of pulmonary histologic abnormalities, but we also measured BALF cell types and counts. BALF cytokine and chemokine measurements were used to characterize the inflammatory milieu within the lung. To measure the effect of anti-MCP-1, we administered 0.5 mg of polyclonal rabbit anti-MCP-1 or phosphate-buffered saline solution intraperitoneally in 0.2 mL 1 hour before and 24 and 72 hours after 7.2 g/g of intratracheally administered S rectivirgula to C57Bl/6 mice. Animals were killed at 96 hours. This schedule was based on previous work that demonstrated effectiveness of in vivo treatments with anti-MCP. [12] [13] [14] We generated polyclonal rabbit anti-MCP-1 by immunizing rabbits with murine recombinant MCP-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) in multiple intradermal sites with complete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was purified in a protein A column. To assess the direct effect of intratracheally administered S rectivirgula on CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ and wild-type mice, we anesthetized mice and injected lyophilized S rectivirgula, suspended in sterile pyrogen-free normal saline solution, into the trachea by mouth. Mice were killed 3 days (cytokine and chemokine levels) or 4 days (histologic study and BALF cells) thereafter. These times were chosen because cytokine levels peak 72 hours after intratracheal administration of S rectivirgula 5 and because histologic changes peak at 96 hours. 15 We also measured the ability of cultured cells from sensitized CCR2 Ϫ/Ϫ and wild-type mice to transfer EHP to mice of the same strain. Mice were immunized with 1 intratracheal injection of S rectivirgula and killed 4 days thereafter. Spleen cells were cultured with S rectivirgula (30 g/mL) for 72 hours. The cells of RPMI-1640 media (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Pa) were then injected into naïve recipients, which were challenged 8 days thereafter with intratracheally administered S rectivirgula and killed 6, 24, 48, or 96 hours thereafter. BALF. BALF cells were obtained by means of lavage with 6 washes (1 mL each) of normal saline solution. The supernatant from the first 3 combined washes was frozen at Ϫ70°C for later chemokine and cytokine analysis. Cytokines and chemokines. Cytokines and chemokines were measured with the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Unknown samples were compared to a standard curve of corresponding recombinant mouse cytokine or chemokine. Histologic study. The lungs were inflated with formalin under 20 cm of water pressure for 48 hours and embedded in a single paraffin block, after which a 5-m section waqs cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The slides were evaluated without knowledge of treatment. The area covered by an eyepiece grid (0.99 ϫ 0.99 mm at a magnification of 100ϫ magnification) was judged to be normal or abnormal. An abnormal field is one with increased number of cells in the interstitium or alveoli or both. An average of 300 fields was evaluated from each mouse (50% of the area under the coverslip). This method yields reproducible results (r ϭ .89 for duplicate readings of 301 animals). 16 Data analysis. We analyzed BALF cellular data, cytokines, chemokines, and the extent of histologic changes with the use of ANOVA and Tukey's conservative HSD procedure for post hoc testing. We considered P values of less than .05 significant. Post hoc tests of significance with multiple ANOVA were then applied. 17
