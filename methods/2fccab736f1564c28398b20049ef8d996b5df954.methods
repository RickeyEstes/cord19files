A cross-sectional study was performed on 2 occasions (October 2012 and August 2013) on a total of 99 ID badges and lanyards from pediatric HCWs (6 medical students, 24 junior and 34 senior medical staff, and 35 nursing and allied health staff) working on pediatric medical wards or the pediatric emergency department at Monash Children's Hospital, Australia. The study was repeated over sequential years to account for seasonal variability. Sampling was performed in the middle of the day to allow for maximum opportunity for pathogen transfer during morning clinical activities. Only lanyards worn around HCW's neck were sampled because these were purported to have maximum contact with patients compared with ID badges fastened to a belt without a lanyard. All lanyards were hospital issued cloth based and 2-cm wide. ID badges were of uniform design and made from white polyvinyl chloride, with additional laminated cards attached to the lanyard behind the ID cards in some staff. One swab sample was collected from each HCW using a flocked nylon nasopharyngeal swab, premoistened with viral transport media (BD, Sparks Glencoe, MD). The use of flocked nasopharyngeal swabs is known to have a sensitivity of 98.4% when compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates 7 and 79%-89% when compared with respiratory washings. 8 The front and back surfaces of ID badges (regardless of the number of badges they carried) and distal 2 cm of lanyards were sampled with the same swab and placed in universal transport media. For comparison, total respiratory and fecal results on pediatric patients in Monash Children's Hospital during January 2012-December 2013 were obtained using the clinical laboratory information system. During the study period, a total of 2,977 respiratory swabs and 2,425 fecal swabs were sent, with a total of 1,688 and 112 positive respiratory and fecal swabs, respectively. Clinical samples taken during this period were used for direct comparison with study results. All laboratory samples were not processed by the study team, but by routine pathology laboratory staff as per protocol subsequently listed and by the enteric virus laboratory at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute for the enteric virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.
