Plant material, P. syringae pv. actinidiae inoculations and experimental design. Two-yearold, self-rooted, pot-cultivated A. deliciosa "Hayward" plants and the pandemic PSA strain CRA-FRU 8.43 were used in this study 21 . This bacterial strain was originally isolated from A. chinensis leaf spot and further characterized 57, 58 . Plants were maintained in an aseptic room with 95% relative humidity with natural light and no further fertilization after their transfer from the nursery. They were watered regularly. Inoculation took place in spring (i.e., May). The strain was grown for 48 h on nutrient agar (Oxoid) with 3% sucrose added (NSA) at 25 ± 1 °C. Subsequently, a low (1-2 × 10 3 cfu/ml) and high (1-2 × 10 7 cfu/ ml) dose of bacterial inoculum, determined using spectrophotometry, were prepared in sterile, distilled water. To avoid wounding, the inoculation occurred by gently spraying the suspensions on the abaxial surface of fully expanded, healthy, young leaves, until the appearance of homogenous water-soaked areas on the whole leaf lamina. Twenty plants per dose were inoculated. Artificial inoculations were performed separately, according to the dose. Control plants were treated in the same way with sterile, distilled water. After inoculation, plants were maintained separately and were kept for 24 h in a moist chamber (100% humidity), which was required for optimal infection. During the experiment, the multiplication and growth of the pathogen was assessed as previously described 21 . Leaves were collected after one day post-inoculation and at intervals of three days for 13 days, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until RNA isolation. In the same treatment group (inoculated and mock inoculated), each biological replicate was obtained by pooling three leaves from different plants harvested at random. Three independent biological replicates were performed for each sample with three technical replicates each. Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was isolated from A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with PSA as well as from control leaves as described by Rubio-Piña and Zapata-Perez 59 . Residual genomic DNA was digested by RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Jasco V-530 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The purity of all of the RNA samples was assessed at an absorbance ratio of OD260/280 and OD260/230, while its structural integrity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Only high-quality RNA with OD 260/280 and OD 260/230 > 2 was used for subsequent steps. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μ g of total Scientific RepoRts | 5:16961 | DOI: 10.1038/srep16961 RNA using an iScript ™ Select cDNA Synthesis Kit and oligo(dT)20 primers (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
