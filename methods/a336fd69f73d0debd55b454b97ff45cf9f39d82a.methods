Description of the Delphi process used to select the six topics of the scoping reviews This study is part of a larger series of six scoping reviews conducted by the "VEctor boRne DiseAses Scoping reviews" (VERDAS) consortium following a call from the Vectors, Environment and Society unit of the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The integral protocol of the VERDAS consortium has been published [8] . We used an eDelphi survey (a Delphi survey conducted via electronic mail) to select the six topics considered of highest priority by a panel of 84 international expert participants (43% researchers; 52% public health decision-makers; 5% from the private sector). The eDelphi consisted of a three-round process: 1) we invited participants to suggest any topic to be considered; 2) more than 80 topics were rated from "1-eliminate" to "5-top priority"; and 3) the 20 topics rated 4 or 5 by more than 65% of the participants (i.e., the most highly voted items) were rated for a second time. By the end of the third round, six topics had been selected, with the present topic having obtained the mean rate of 4.00 Â± 1.02 and being ranked fifth out of six in terms of importance (71.4% of the participants rated the topic 4 or 5).
