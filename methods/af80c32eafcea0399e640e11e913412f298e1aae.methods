We obtained demographic data and travel-related information (last port of embarkation and fl ight times) by direct interview and retrospective review of clinical notes. Duration of travel, which was calculated from fl ight times and transit time within airports, was categorized into 4 groups: short haul (<3 hours), medium haul (3-6 hours), long haul (6-15 hours), and extra-long haul (>15 hours). Clinical data were collected for symptoms and date and time of symptom onset (to the nearest hour in most instances and to the nearest 8-hour block [midnight to 7:59 AM, 8:00 AM to 3.59 PM, or 4:00 PM to 11:59 PM] if the patient was unsure). Symptom onset time was further categorized as before embarkation, during travel, or after disembarkation in Singapore. We also categorized hospitalized case-patients on the basis of whether their symptoms met US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ILI criteria (body temperature >37.8°C with either cough or sore throat in the absence of an alternative diagnosis) and WHO ILI criteria (body temperature >38°C with either cough or sore throat in the absence of an alternative diagnosis) (11, 12) . A confi rmed case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was defi ned as an ILI in a patient with a temperature >37.5°C, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or myalgia and with laboratory confi rmation of infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR performed on respiratory samples (sputum or combined nasal and throat swab specimens). An imported, travel-associated case was defi ned as above but occurred in a person with recent travel outside Singapore who had arrived in Singapore during the containment period and had illness onset within 10 days of arrival. We compared proportions by using the χ 2 test. Means were compared by use of t tests for dichotomous variables and 1-way analysis of variance for multichotomous variables. Stata 10.0 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
