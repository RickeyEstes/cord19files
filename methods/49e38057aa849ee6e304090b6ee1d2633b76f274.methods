Virus and cell line. An Indian isolate of Chikungunya virus, DRDE-07 (GenBank Accession number: EU372006) was propagated in C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus larval cells) using standard virus adsorption techniques. The Chikungunya virus was handled in a biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were used for viral quantification and antiviral assay 38 . Cloning and expression of nsP2pro. Viral RNA was extracted from CHIKV infected C6/36 cells using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. The genomic region coding for nsp2pro was amplified employing the designed primers (FP: 5′CCCATGGAGGATACATTCCAAAATAAAGCC3′ and RP: 5′TGCTCGAGACATCCTGCTCGGGTGAC3′) by two-step RT-PCR using M-MLV RT and Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, USA). It was cloned into NcoI and XhoI sites of the pET41a expression vector. The plasmid was transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3) and transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Expression was induced at OD 600 = 0.6 with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), culture was further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and expression profile was studied by SDS-PAGE.
