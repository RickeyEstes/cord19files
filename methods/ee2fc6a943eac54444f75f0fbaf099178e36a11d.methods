PCR primers. Where noted, the following primers were used for quantitative PCR amplification of C. parvum 18s rRNA: Cp18s forward-TAGAGATTGGAGGTT GTTCCT, and Cp18s reverse-CTCCACCAACTAAGAACGGCC 53 . Compound characterization. The chemical identity of AN7973 was established through 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectral (HRMS) analysis. Compound purity was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Instrument and column: HPLC-01 Venusil MP C18 5 µm 4.6 × 50 mm). In vitro activity of compounds against Cryptosporidium. A high-content microscopy assay was used to measure activity of compounds against C. parvum 32,54 . Screening was performed at the University of California San Francisco using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type 2 (ATCC CRL-2936) cells grown to confluence in clear-bottomed 384-well plates in 50 µL per well of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The concentration of FBS was reduced to 1% prior to the addition of parasites. C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts used for screening were purchased from the Sterling Laboratory at the University of Arizona and stored at 4°C until use. Oocysts were induced to excyst by treatment for 10 min at 37°C with 10 mM HCl and then 10 min at 15°C in 2 mM sodium taurocholate, washed in the above medium with 1% FBS, and then added to cell monolayers in the presence of compounds. The number of oocysts added to each well was dependent on the viability of the parasite stock, and varied between experiments. Compounds were screened at a concentration of 1 µM. After incubation at 37°C under 5% CO 2 for 48 h, the cells were fixed for at least 24 h by adding an equal volume of 8% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were blocked with 0.1% Titron X-100, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in saline, which was also used for all subsequent steps. Cells were incubated with 0.5 µg per mL of biotinylated Vicia villosa lectin (VVL, Vector Laboratories, catalog# FL-1231) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, and stained in the dark for 1 h at room temperature in 0.5 µg per mL Cy3-streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog# 016-160-084) containing 1 nM DAPI [2-(4-amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamide]. After incubation, the plates were washed three times and 50 µL per well of the above blocking buffer was added. Plates were stored at 4°C in the dark until processed. Images were acquired using a GE InCell 2000 automated microscope, and GE InCell Developer (version 1.9) image analysis software was used to quantify the parasites and host cells. Confirmation by 8-point dose response curve was performed in triplicate, with half-log serial dilutions starting at 10 µM. Follow-up assays were performed at the University of Vermont (UVM) and Cell-based mode of action and time-kill curve assays. The invasion assay, DNA replication assay, asexual to sexual stage conversion, and time-kill curve assays were performed using fluorescence microscopy to enumerate parasites and host cell nuclei. Staining protocols are individually described for each assay. Unless noted otherwise, the details of image acquisition were as follows. An inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti2000 microscope with an automated stage and Perfect Focus was used with NIS-Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon, USA, version 4.30.01) to image the wells. The microscope was programmed to focus on the center of each well and then take a 3 × 3 composite image per well using a 20 × (0.45 NA) objective. Images were exported as .tiff files and parasites and host nuclei counted using a custom macro on ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, version 1.52a). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism (version 6.01). Host cell invasion was assayed by allowing C. parvum to invade host cell monolayers in the presence of compound, and enumerating parasites and host cells after just 3 h (i.e., before completion of a parasite division cycle) 38 . HCT-8 cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 120 U per mL penicillin and 120 μg per mL streptomycin and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (complete media) and C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts from Bunch Grass Farms (Deary, ID) were used for infection. When cells reached a confluence of >99%, media was removed and replaced with 25 µL per well of fresh media containing twice the indicated concentrations of compounds and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified CO 2 incubator. In the meantime, oocysts were induced for excystation by first treating with 10 mM hydrochloric acid (diluted with distilled water) for 10 min at 37°C followed by 2 mM sodium taurocholate (in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium) for 10 min at 16°C. Before and after each treatment, oocysts were spun down at 14,000 × g for 4.5 min and supernatant was removed. Oocysts were then diluted in complete media and added to cells at 5 × 10 4 oocysts in 25 µL per well such that the final concentration of compounds was the same as the indicated concentration. Oocysts were allowed to excyst and sporozoites allowed to invade in presence of indicated compound concentrations for 3 h after which cells were washed three times with PBS containing 111 mM D-galactose, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.25% triton X-100 for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% tween 20 and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Invaded parasites were stained with 1.33 µg per mL of fluorescein-labeled Vicia villosa lectin (Vector Laboratories, catalog# FL-1231) for 1 h at 37°C followed by nuclei staining with 0.09 mM Hoechst 33258 (AnaSpec, catalog# AS-83219) for 15 min at 37°C and then washed five time with PBS containing 0.1% tween 20. Each of the negative controls were treated the same, except for one of the following additional pre-steps. Heat killed oocysts were first heat killed at 70°C for 30 min before being induced for excystation. For fixed host cells, HCT-8 cells seeded in 384 well plates at >99% confluence were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by 3 washes with warm complete media before the experiment. Measurement of DNA replication was used as a surrogate marker of Cryptosporidium development within HCT-8 cells 38 . For this, glass bottom 96-well plates were coated with 50 µg per mL fibronectin (BD Pharmingen, catalog# 354008) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then HCT-8 cells were grown to >90% confluence in the wells. All mode of action and time-kill curve assays were performed in 10% FBS. C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts (Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, ID) were triggered for excystation and added at a density of 5.5 × 10 4 per well. After a 3-h delay, AN7973 was added at ∼2 × EC 90 (0.42 µM) followed by incubation for 6 h and then addition of 10 mM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU). After incubation with EdU for 2 more hours, the cells were washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in saline. Cells were then permeabilized and stained for incorporation of EdU using the Click-iT assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog# 10340). Images were acquired by focusing on the parasite focal plane, which is on top of the host cell monolayer, using a ×40 objective (0.7 NA) and EdU and lectin numbers were quantified using ImageJ software. The effect of AN7973 on asexual vs. sexual stage Cryptosporidium was assessed by comparing its potency for reducing the percent of host cells infected during the first 48 h of development within HCT-8 cells, which reflects asexual parasite development, to its effect on expression of the meiotic recombination protein DMC1, which is a previously identified sexual stage-specific marker 38 . For this, AN7973 was added after 48 h of culture (the approximate timing of sexual differentiation) and its effect on appearance of DMC1 positive parasites was measured using high-content microscopy, after staining with FITC-conjugated Vicia villosa lectin and DAPI as above, and with an anti-C. parvum DMC1 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 1H10G7 (IgG2b, kappa) used as undiluted culture supernatant) with a secondary Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, catalog# A-11004) at 1:500 dilution (4 µg per mL). Amphotericin B (Sigma, catalog# A2942) was added to the culture media at 0.1 to 0.5 µg per mL for the DMC1 dose response assays. Time-kill curve assays were used to assess if AN7973 is parasiticidal or parasitistatic for C. parvum 19 . C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts (Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, ID) were treated to induce excystation and added to >90% confluent HCT-8 cells in 384-well plates. AN7973 was added at the EC 50 Pharmacokinetic studies. Single-dose oral and intravenous murine PK studies were performed by WuXi Biologics (Wuxi, China) in female CD-1 mice in compliance with animal care guidelines. AN7973 was formulated at 1 mg per mL in 50/ 20/30 PEG300/propylene glycol (PG)/water for IV administration, and at 2 mg per mL in 1% carboxymethylcellulose in water with 0.1% Tween 80 for oral administration. Single-dose oral calf PK studies were performed at the University of Vermont in compliance with animal care guidelines and with approval from the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Holstein bull calves were acquired within 24 h of birth and group-housed. AN7973 was formulated as a suspension at 25 mg per mL in 1% carboxymethylcellulose in water with 0.1% Tween 80, which was then diluted with water to achieve a concentration needed for a 10 mL dose. Doses were squirted into the calves' mouths during interruptions in bottle feeding. Fecal samples were collected at the indicated times by manual anal stimulation. For both mouse and calf studies, plasma samples were analyzed for AN7973 by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); sample concentrations were calculated using a standard curve of compound added to control plasma. Fecal AN7973 was measured by extracting AN7973 from homogenized feces with acetonitrile. For this, feces were added to 4 volumes of acetonitrile (4 mL per g), mixed by vortexing for 5 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged. One hundred microliter samples were then dried under nitrogen, reconstituted in 250 µL 50/50 acetronitrile/water, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The fecal extraction method was validated with a standard curve of compound added to control feces. AN7973 mean plasma and feces concentrations and nominal time were used to construct semi-logarithmic plasma concentration versus time curves ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Non-compartmental analysis of the mean concentrationtime profiles was performed using Phoenix version 6.4 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Concentrations below the limit of quantitation were assigned values of zero for generation of mean concentrations. Predictions of multidose exposures were generated by non-parametric superposition of the singledose PK data using Phoenix version 6.4 ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Murine models of cryptosporidiosis. NOD scid gamma mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) 55 (NSG) were used to model chronic Cryptosporidium infection 19 . All NSG mouse studies were performed in compliance with animal care guidelines and with approval by the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. NSG mice with normal flora were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed for at least a week for acclimatization. At the age of four to five weeks, mice were infected by oral gavage with ∼10 5 C. parvum Iowa isolate (Bunch Grass Farms) oocysts. On days 7 to 11 following infection, mice were treated once daily by oral gavage with AN7973 or paromomycin (positive control) at the indicated doses with each compound dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 1% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) to a final concentration of 5% DMSO and final volume of 100 µL. Fecal parasite shedding was measured using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, and the primers named above as Cp18s forward and Cp18s reverse 53 . Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) knockout mice were used to model acute Cryptosporidium infection 19 . All IFN-γ knockout mouse studies were performed in compliance with animal care guidelines and were approved by the Explora BioLabs (San Diego, CA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Four-week-old female C57BL/6 IFN-γ −/− mice with normal flora were purchased from The Jackson laboratory and acclimated for 3 days prior to infection by oral gavage with ∼10 6 C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts (Sterling Laboratory, University of Arizona) suspended in sterile distilled water. At the indicated times following infection, mice were treated with compound vehicle alone, clofazimine (positive control), or once daily AN7973 at the indicated doses. Fecal parasite shedding was measured by isolating oocysts using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Sheather's sucrose solution was freshly prepared by dissolving 156.25 g sucrose and 2.5 mL phenol in 100 mL water. Two sucrose solutions were prepared: (A) specific gravity of 1.103 (33% Sheather's and 0.1% Tween 80 in PBS) and (B) specific gravity of 1.064 (20% Sheather's and 0.1% Tween 80 in PBS). In a 2 mL microfuge tube, a gradient was prepared by laying 0.75 mL of solution A, then carefully laying 0.75 mL of solution B, slowly as to prevent mixing of the two layers. Fecal pellets were removed from storage, and homogenized by vortexing and pipetting. 0.2 mL fecal homogenate was overlaid on top of gradient in each microfuge tube. Oocysts were floated from feces by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20 min and collected with a pipet tip from the 1.064/1.103 specific gravity interface between solutions A and B. Oocysts were rinsed once in cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in PBS. Isolated oocysts were then stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-Cryptosporidium antibody (Bio-Rad catalog# 2402-3007 F; 0.25 µg per sample) and quantified using a Guava EasyCyte flow cytometer and CytoSoft data acquisition software (version 5.3; Guava Technologies, Inc.). Oocysts per milliliter of sample were normalized to counts per milligram of feces. Neonatal calf model of cryptosporidiosis. All calf efficacy studies were performed as previously described 43 . These studies were approved by the University of Vermont Institutional animal Care and Use Committee, and conducted in compliance with the USDA-APHIS "Blue Book", available at www.aphis.usda.gov/ animal-welfare. Holstein bull calves were acquired at birth from Green Mountain Dairy (Sheldon, VT), given synthetic colostrum with 200 g of IgG (Land O'Lakes, Ardent Hills, MO) and bovine coronavirus and Escherichia coli antibodies (First Defense Bolus, Immuncell Corporation, Portland, ME) within 2 h of birth, and transported to UVM. Calves were group-housed initially, and infected at 24-48 h of age during an interruption in bottle feeding by oral administration of ∼5 × 10 7 C. parvum Iowa isolate oocysts (Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, ID) suspended in 10 mL of water. They were then moved to individual raised pens, and observed twice daily at feeding times for clinical signs, which were quantified according to a previously described standardized scoring rubric 43 . Data on fecal consistency, dehydration and overall health were collected, in each case with a score of 1 being normal and 3 being severely abnormal (scoring rubric in Supplementary Table 2) . Clinical microbiologic studies for adventitious infectious agents including Salmonella culture, aerobic bacterial culture with E. coli genotyping, rotavirus, and coronavirus testing were performed on all calves at the onset of diarrhea by the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center (Ithaca, NY). Animals with severe diarrhea or other symptoms were supported aggressively, including with administration of oral electrolytes, intravenous fluids and flunixin meglumine (Banamine, Merck) as needed. AN7973 was suspended as for the PK study in 1% carboxymethylcellulose in water with 0.1% Tween 80 at a final volume of 10 mL per dose, and was administered orally by squirting doses into the calves' mouths during interruptions in bottle feeding. Daily fecal samples were obtained from collections bins located under each pen. Fecal samples used for parasite quantification were dried at 90°C until stable in weight, and C. parvum abundance per gram of fecal dry matter was measured using qPCR and the primers Cp18s forward and Cp18s reverse 53 . In vitro safety profiling and rat toxicology. In vitro safety profiling studies were conducted by Ricerca Biosciences (Taipei, Taiwan) and WuXi AppTec (Suzhou, China). Ricerca performed a Lead Profiling and Adverse Reaction Enzyme panel of 109 off-target enzymes and receptors. This included the hERG K+ ion channel, which is associated with cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and used a radioligand binding competition format with 10 µM test compound for 1 h at 25°C. For the enzyme and receptor panel, competitive inhibition at 10 µM of test compound was the most common assay format. The AMES bacterial reverse mutation assay detects point mutations in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium as an indicator of mutagenic activity. Bacterial strains were obtained from Molecular Toxicology (Boone, NC). WuXi tested AN7973 against five strains with and without S9 (Aroclor 1254 induced rat liver S9) in triplicate. AN7973 was tested for mutagenic activity at doses ranging up to 5000 µg per plate. An in vitro micronucleus genotoxicity assay was performed to assess the clastogenic/aneugenic potential of AN7973. WuXi tested AN7973 against human lymphocytes with and without S9 for 3 and 28 h using a range of concentrations from 0.25 to 260 µg per mL, in duplicate, and observed by microscopy for induction of micronucleated human lymphocytes. A repeated oral dose toxicity and separate toxicokinetics (TK) study were performed in male rats by WuXi AppTec Company (Suzhou, China). These studies were reviewed and approved by the WuXI AppTec Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and a staff veterinarian monitored them for animal welfare issues. Animals were individually housed in solid bottom plastic cages with bedding in compliance with the US Animal Welfare Act. All rat studies were performed using ∼8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats (Rattus novegicus)/Crl: CD[SD] VAF/Plus weighing between 243.22 and 276.57 g at the start of compound dosing. A 7-day repeated oral dose toxicity study was performed using 5 vehicle (0.5% (w/v) methyl cellulose and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in purified water) control and 5 treatment group rats dosed AN7973 80 mg per kg once daily oral gavage for 7 consecutive days. Cage side clinical observations of condition and behavior (i.e., gait, stool, activity level, atonia, coat soiling and grooming, skin turgor, posture, priapism, piloerection) were performed twice daily during the dosing phase, and weights and food consumption were measured daily. At termination, all study animals were evaluated for erythrocyte count, absolute reticulocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, and triglycerides by fasting the animals overnight and obtaining blood from the abdominal aorta at necropsy as a terminal procedure under deep anesthesia (pentobarbital). A complete necropsy and histopathologic studies (hematoxylin and eosin staining) of large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and any gross lesions were performed on all animals on day 7 of dosing. A TK study was performed in parallel to determine exposure, using 3 vehicle control animals and 6 experimental animals dosed 80 mg per kg AN7973 by oral gavage once daily for 7 consecutive days. Serum was collected from vehicle-control animals at 1 h and 4 h after dosing on days 1 and 7. The AN7973 recipient group was divided into two, with serum collected according to the following schedule: first 3 of 6 animals (pre-dose, 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 72 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (72 h time point day 7 only)); and second 3 of 6 animals (0.5 h, 2 h, 8 h, 48 h post dosing on days 1 and 7 (48 h time point day 7 only)). Following completion of blood collection, TK animals were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation and exsanguination without necropsy. AN7973 was quantified using a qualified liquid chromatographic triple quadruple mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method that had a lower limit of quantification of ≤5 ng per mL. Statistical information, and figure preparation. GraphPad Prism software (version 6.01) was used to prepare all graphs, calculate compound EC50 values, and perform statistical analyses.
