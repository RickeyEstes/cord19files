The WHO guidelines were developed according to the requirements described in the WHO handbook for guideline development [12] . The first source of evidence was the review published by the "Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes" (SIGHT) group [11] , which included publications from 1996 to 2012. This review was updated to include literature published up to 23 November 2015. An additional systematic review with the same objectives was performed, but with a focus on the national level. Key research questions were identified and formulated according to the PICO (Population/Participants, Intervention, Comparator and Outcomes) process. In addition, an inventory of national and regional IPC action plans and strategic documents was undertaken as part of the background to these guidelines.
