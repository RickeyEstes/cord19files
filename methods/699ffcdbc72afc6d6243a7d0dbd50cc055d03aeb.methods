In February 2010, nine pteropodid bats were mist-netted from an established roost of approximately 12 bats in a peridomestic structure (a storeroom behind a kitchen) at the edge of Kibale National Park, western Uganda 43, 47 . Blood, oral swabs, urogenital swabs, and ectoparasites were obtained from bats, and bats were immediately released thereafter. All protocols for animal and sample handling were approved in advance by the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, Makerere University, McGill University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and were performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. Bat flies (the only ectoparasites found on sampled bats) were kept separate by bat and were stored whole at −20 °C in RNAlater solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Swab samples were also stored in RNAlater solution at −20 °C. Blood was separated by centrifugation into components for long-term storage at −80 °C. Single bat flies and swab tips were homogenized by bead beating using a portable homogenizer (Terralyzer; Zymo Research Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). RNA was extracted from all sample types and converted to cDNA in the field using lyophilized reagents (RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premix, TaKaRa Bio USA Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and then converted into double-stranded cDNA (NEBNext Second Strand Synthesis Module, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). DNA was stabilized for long-term storage and transport to the USA at ambient temperature (DNAstable, Biomatrica, San Diego, CA, USA). DNA was reconstituted, and libraries were prepared for NGS as previously described 48, 49 ; this method is approximately as sensitive as real-time quantitative PCR for detecting viruses 11 . Briefly, DNA was purified using Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Approximately 1 ng of DNA was prepared for sequencing on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina). Sequence data were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench version 8.5 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Low-quality bases were trimmed (phred quality score < 30), short reads (<75 bp) were discarded, and the remaining reads were subjected to de novo assembly. Assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) were analyzed for nucleotide-(blastn) and protein-level (blastx) similarity to known viruses in GenBank. All sequences generated in this study were deposited into GenBank. All sequences used for analyses and their accession numbers are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . Genetic similarity between Kanyawara virus (KYAV) and its relatives was assessed using pairwise sequence comparisons in the computer program MEGA7 50 . Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted on codon-based alignments of concatenated virus genes, with poorly aligned regions removed. Alignments were created using the MAFFT algorithm 51 implemented in Translator X 52 , with the Gblocks algorithm 53 applied to remove poorly aligned regions. Trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in PhyML 54 , with best-fit models of molecular evolution estimated from the data using jModeltest 55 . Trees were displayed using FigTree 56 . The same phylogenetic methods were applied to mitochondrial gene sequences of bats Scientific RepoRts | 7: 5287 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-05236-w (COI and CYTB) and bat flies (COII and CYTB nucleotide sequences) extracted from deep sequence data to investigate the taxonomy of sampled bats and bat flies. Based on coding-complete virus genome sequences detected in the course of bioinformatics analysis (see Results), PCR primers KYAV-10368 (5′-GCGAACCCGACGATCATAGT-3′) and KYAV-10695 (5′-GCTGTGCATTCCAGTCTCCT-3′) were designed to amplify a 327-bp region of the KYAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) gene. PCR conditions were optimized using bat fly cDNA samples known to be positive and negative for KYAV infection by NGS. The optimized PCR was used to test cDNA extracted from swab samples. PCRs were conducted using the HiFi kit (Kappa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA), with 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 sec, 56 °C for 15 sec, and 72 °C for 15 sec. Amplicons were visualized on 2% agarose electrophoretic gels stained with ethidium bromide. The relative frequency of CpG dinucleotide pairs was calculated for each of the canonical rhabdovirus genes (N, P, G, M, and L) from KYAV and related rhabdoviruses using the R Biostrings package 57 . Rhabdovirus sequences included in this analysis were selected objectively, using all coding-complete genomes from major rhabdovirus clades (genera) with at least four members available in GenBank and the Virus Pathogen Resource database 58 as of December 12, 2016. Differences in mean CpG depletion among groups were evaluated for statistical significance using ANOVA, with pairwise differences between groups examined using the Holm post-hoc method, which adjustments for multiple testing 59 . Variances in CpG depletion among groups were compared using Levine's test 60 . Statistical analyses were performed in the computer package R 61 . Data Availability.
