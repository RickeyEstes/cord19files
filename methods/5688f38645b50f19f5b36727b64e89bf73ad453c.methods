We present a case series of IMI in children affected by hematological malignancies treated with CAT at the Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Pediatric Department, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy, from 2011 to 2016, with the aim of describing their clinical characteristics, types of infections, clinical outcomes, and treatment safety. All patients with diagnosis of possible, probable, or proven IMI as defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria were included [7] . Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to describe patients' characteristics, outcomes, and treatment safety. For each patient we recorded the clinical outcome 12 weeks after diagnosis of IMI: among living patients we distinguished those with complete response to treatment (full recovery) and those with partial response (major improvement of symptoms and radiologic findings).
