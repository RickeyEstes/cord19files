Between October 2012 and February 2013, 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls were recruited at the Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany. For this study, the diagnosis of CF was based on at least one clinical manifestation of CF, sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/l and the presence of two CF-causing mutations [1] . Pancreatic sufficiency (PS) was defined as fecal elastase >100 μg/g stool. Healthy controls had no clinical manifestation of CF and a sweat chloride value <60 mmol/l (Non-CF). Smoking was defined as any active or passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Exclusion criteria were participation in another medical clinical trial during the past 30 days, acute respiratory symptoms, intake of ivacaftor, known hemorrhoids, or bleeding diathesis. The ethics committee of the Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen approved the protocol (AZ109/12). The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant aged 18 years and older. For participants younger than 18 years of age, written informed consent was obtained from each participant's parents or legal guardian, and age-appropriate consent was obtained from each participant. The sweat test, NPD, and ICM were performed on the same day for each subject. The sweat test was performed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [19] . For sweat stimulation and collection, the Macroduct® system (Wescor, Data are shown as ratios or the mean ± standard deviation incl. median (minmax). *p <0.001 (CF-all versus controls); **p = 0.003 (CF-PI versus CF-PS). Inc., Logan, USA) was used. Chloride was measured by chloride titration. A sweat chloride level ≥60 mmol/l was interpreted as within the CF range, 30-60 mmol/l as equivocal, and ≤29 mmol as normal [1] . NPD was performed by one operator who was accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundations' (CFF) Therapeutic Developments Network (TDN), and followed the CFF TDN SOP (version: January 2009) [8] . We used terbutaline as a substitute for isoproterenol in accordance with the SOP. The chloride-free and isoproterenol response (Δ0Cl − + Iso) (NPD CFTR response) and the Wilschanksi score (defined as e (response to chloride-free and isoproterenol/response to amiloride) ) [20] representing the CFTR response were calculated as the average or best result from both nostrils. The Δ0Cl − + Iso was interpreted as normal when < −12 mV, as in the CF range when > −7.7 mV, and as equivocal for results between −12 and −7.7 mV [6] . The Wilschanski score was interpreted as normal (<0.65), in the CF-range (>0.70), or equivocal (0.65-0.70) [20] . If the mean Δ0Cl − + Iso was > −7.7 mV in healthy controls, the NPD was repeated on a different day. Only the measurement with the highest Δ0Cl − + Iso was reported. If both measurements confirmed a Δ0Cl − + Iso in the CF range, CFTR genotyping (sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) was offered as part of the participant's clinical care and reported as part of the baseline data. Genotyping of all healthy controls was not ethically approved. The For ICM, at least 4 superficial rectal biopsies were obtained by suction biopsies (aspiration biopsy instrument according to Wilital (UE7605); ulrich GmbH, Ulm, Germany) without prior bowel preparation. Biopsies were immediately stored in ice-cold buffer solution (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline and indomethacin, final concentration 10 μM) and mounted on adequate tissue sliders. After mounting the sliders in the heated and slightly sparged (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) 4-chamber system, each basal resistance was measured by applying short current pulses (15 μA) and registering the corresponding change in V t (typical range 15-30 Ohm × cm 2 ) with the VCC MC4S Multi-Channel Voltage Current Clamp (Physiologic Instrument, San Diego, USA). After that the voltage was clamped at 0 mV and the raw short circuit current ( r I sc ) was recorded from then on. Due to different sliders with different areas (P2407C [1.5 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.018 cm 2 ] or P2407B [1.2 mm diameter aperture slider; area 0.011 cm 2 ]); Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, USA), the raw r I sc was converted to I sc (μA/ cm 2 ). After applying 100 μM carbachol (which stimulates cholinergic Cl − secretion by opening basolateral K + channels) to the serosal compartment, an I sc response was evoked for quality control of the biopsy. After a 40-min equilibration in Meyler buffer, the basal I sc was noted and 2 μl amiloride (to block amiloride-sensitive sodium channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 5 min or when the I sc was stable, 10 μM forskolin and 100 μM IBMX (to stimulate cAMPdependent CFTR-Cl − transport) were added to the mucosal and serosal compartments (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX ). After a minimum of 10 min, 10 μM genisteine (CFTR-potentiator) was added to both compartments. After a minimum of 5 min, 100 μM carbachol was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, carbachol ). After a minimum of 10 min, 200 μM 4,4′-Diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) (blocking non-CFTR-Cl − channels) was added to the mucosal compartment. After 10 min, 500 μM histamine (to stimulate Ca 2+ and proteinkinase Cmediated CFTR Cl − secretion) was added to the serosal compartment (ΔI sc, histamine ). In the open circuit, the final transepithelial voltage and final resistance were measured by applying short current pulses as in the beginning. Preliminary data suggested that the average ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine is the best diagnostic ICM parameter for chloride secretory response (ICM CFTR response), but reference ranges have not been established [10] . Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) (normally distributed variables), respective the median values, and 25th and 75th percentiles (nonnormally distributed variables). Group comparisons were performed using the Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test for normally or non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (release 21; IBM, Armonk, USA).
