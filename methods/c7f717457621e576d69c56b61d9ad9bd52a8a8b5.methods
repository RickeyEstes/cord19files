Background to the respiratory service in place during April-July 2009 During April-July 2009 all respiratory samples submitted from patients with a clinical diagnosis of H1N1/2009 (as stated on the specimen request form), were initially tested using a universal influenza A real time rtRT-PCR assay and a H1N1/2009 specific real time rtRT-PCR assay [7] . If the sample was negative on these tests and was from a hospitalised patient, a patient deemed at risk of severe respiratory infection (e.g. an immunocompromised or a pregnant patient), or a patient attending GP services taking part in local or national surveillance schemes, a full respiratory screen was carried out (see below for details regarding the full respiratory screen). Note that this information was derived from the sample request form. With regard to (i) samples from GP services not taking part in the surveillance schemes mentioned above, (ii) follow-up samples from known H1N1/2009 positive patients, and (iii) samples from patients with no clinical/setting details, only the initial screening test was conducted.
