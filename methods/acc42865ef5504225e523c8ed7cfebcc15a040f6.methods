Hospitals with EDs in the metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky, area were contacted by the project leaders (IC/UL) and were invited to participate in the project. They were asked to report basic demographic and syndromic data. They could use either their current computerized information system (referred to as computerized record group or CRG) or an alternative method for surveillanceda simple, inexpensive system that used a PDA (referred to as the PDA group or PDAG). The UL/IC personnel designed software for use with the PDA. The data collection period began April 17, 2002, and ended May 15, 2002. The highlight of the festival, the running of the Kentucky Derby, occurred on May 4, 2002; therefore, surveillance was continued for 11 days following that highly publicized event. The extended time period would give the study the ability to evaluate the health of the community after an acceptable incubation period. UL/IC personnel visited each participating hospital to identify key contacts, methods for initial and ongoing training, and information transfer processes. Site visits were done at least weekly at all 12 facilities during the 4-week data collection process.
