Infectious disease and respiratory physicians in, or recently retired from, public sector hospital practice were identified through personal knowledge, professional directories and specialists in active practice. At the beginning of 2007, these physicians were sent a self-administered postal questionnaire. Respondents were asked to choose from set answers for most questions, while in other questions, they were allowed free-text responses.
