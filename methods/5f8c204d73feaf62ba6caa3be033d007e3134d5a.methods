Animals. Wildtype male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories at 5-6 weeks of age. Mice were acclimated to housing conditions (23 °C, 12:12 light:dark cycle) for several weeks before studies were initiated at 9 weeks of age. AT 2 receptor-deficient mice and littermate controls maintained on the FVB/NCrl background strain were obtained from an in-house breeding colony, originally obtained from Drs. Victor J. Dzau and Richard E. Pratt (Duke University). Animals were allowed ad libitum access to water and various diets throughout all studies except for acute measurements as described below. Selected mice underwent subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps under isoflurane anesthesia to deliver a non-pressor dose of angiotensin II (Ang II; 100 ng/kg/min), the Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist, losartan (22 ug/hr), or the Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist, PD-123,319 (0.55 μ g/hr). All animal experiments were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all methods were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 71 . Diets. Mice were maintained on a standard rodent chow (Teklad 7013) unless otherwise stated. Custom high-fat diets (BioServ) were developed to provide a high fat content (45% of kcal from fat) with varied concentrations of NaCl (0.25% to 4%). Compositions of all diets are described in Table 1 . Body Composition. Body composition was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; Bruker LF90II) 9, 70 . Briefly, awake/unanesthetized animals were placed into a polycarbonate restraint tube and placed inside the scanner for roughly 1 minute to perform the analyses. Animals were immediately returned to their home cage. Food Intake and Preference. Food intake was assessed in home cages under standard housing conditions. Food preference assessments were also performed in home cages, with two food options presented simultaneously in identical hoppers on opposite ends of the cage. Intake of each food was assessed daily for one week and averaged within animal before making group comparisons. Total Calorimetry/Resting Metabolic Rates. Aerobic and total (i.e. -aerobic + anaerobic + nitrogenous) resting metabolic rates (RMR) were assessed simultaneously using a combined or "total" calorimeter system, as recently described in detail 31, 70 . This system consists of a custom-fabricated gradient-layer direct calorimeter (to directly measure total heat dissipation and retention by the mouse) and a conventional push-pull respirometry system (to estimate aerobic RMR using empirically derived equations, as below). Animals were individually tested by placing a single mouse in the chamber at 8 AM (2 hours into the light phase) and continuously monitoring total heat dissipation and gas exchange for roughly six hours. Total and aerobic RMR were calculated when the animal was stably asleep in the chamber. RER was calculated as the ratio of CO 2 produced (VCO 2 ) versus O 2 consumed (VO 2 ). Aerobic heat (in kcal/hr) was calculated using the equation derived from Lusk 72 , with STP-corrected gas consumption/ production rates (in mL/min) 31 OxyMax/Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). Respirometric heat production, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), physical activity by photoelectric beam break, and food intake/patterning were assessed using a 16-chamber OxyMax CLAMS system (Columbus Instruments). Animals were housed individually in specialized OxyMax home cages for four nights in total. Ambient temperature was maintained at 30 ± 1 °C throughout the testing period. Animals were acclimated to the system for 48 hours, and data were recorded and analyzed from the remaining 48 hours of the testing period. Data from 17 minute bins were averaged across days within animal before group comparisons were made. Aerobic heat was calculated by the system using the Lusk equation, as above 72 . Blood Pressure. Blood pressure was assessed by tail-cuff plethysmography (Visitech). Testing was performed daily five days per week, and involved restraining the animals on a warmed heating surface. Animals were instrumented with a pneumatic occlusion cuff proximal to an infrared pulse oximeter. Flow was occluded by pressurizing the cuff, and the pressure at the loss of pulse detection was noted. Thirty occlusion cycles were performed over thirty minutes, once daily. Data from the first week of testing were discarded as training; remaining data were averaged within animal, within day, and then within week before group comparisons were made. RAS component mRNA. Animals were sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation. Kidneys, brain, and intestinal sections were removed by blunt dissection and frozen on dry ice. Tissue was later thawed and RNA was isolated by trizol followed by use of PureLink RNA kits (Ambion). RNA was then examined for specific gene content by realtime RT-PCR (SYBR green method) as previously 34, 73 , using primer pairs previously reported 74 . Importantly, as two distinct isoforms of renin are expressed in the brain 75 , we used a primer set for renin (Forward 5'-TGAAGAAGGCTGTGCGGTAGT-3' , and Reverse 5'-TCCCAGGTCAAAGGAAATGTC-3') which spans exons 7 and 8 of the renin locus, and thereby detects mRNA for both intracellular and secreted isoforms of the enzyme. Fold changes in gene expression were calculated using the Livak 2 -ΔΔCt method 76 , and analytical statistics were performed on Δ Ct values. Circulating Angiotensin II (and III). Trunk blood was collected at sacrifice into tubes coated with EDTA, and plasma was isolated and frozen at − 80 °C after centrifugation for 5 minutes at 5,000 × g. Plasma was subsequently thawed and then extracted using a commercially-available C18 SEP-Column kit per manufacturer's instructions (Peninsula Laboratories International, Inc.; Catalog Number S-5000). 100 uL of plasma was extracted, lyophilized, and stored at − 80 °C. The dried extract was then reconstituted in 150 uL of EIA buffer and analyzed using a commercially-available EIA kit per manufacturer's instructions (Peninsula Laboratories International, Inc.; Catalog Number S-1133). Fecal Acid Steatocrit. Mice were individually placed into glass beakers at 10 AM (4 hours into the light phase), and fresh fecal pellets were collected until eight pellets were collected per animal 20 . 50 ± 1 mg of fresh fecal material was then isolated from each animal. This 50 mg sample was then pulverized and dissolved in 200 μ L of freshly prepared 1 N perchloric acid. Next, 100 μ L of 0.5% Oil-Red-O was added to the mixture. The slurry was then loaded into non-heparinized micro-hematocrit tubes and spun for 10 minutes at 10,000 × g. Tubes were then aligned and digitally photographed. The proportion of red-stained oil layer to the total sample length was calculated using ImageJ software from the NIH. Statistics. Throughout, ANOVA-based analyses (with repeated measures as appropriate) and independent t-test were utilized. Tukey multiple-comparisons procedures were used for post-hoc analyses. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± 1 sem, throughout.
