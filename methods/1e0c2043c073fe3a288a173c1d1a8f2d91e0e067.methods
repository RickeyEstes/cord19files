A comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic databases to retrieve English language papers on bioaerosol sampling within hospitals and the wider environment. The databases searched were Science Direct, Medline (Web of Science), ProQuest, and Taylor & Francis Online. The primary search criterion was bioaerosol with secondary search criteria being sampling, hospital, pathogen, infection, environment, cyclone, impactor, impinger, and aerosol. The final search was on January 16th, 2016. Initially papers were included from 1994 to present day; however, having received expert advice, the search was revised to included papers from 1940 onwards. Patents and foreign language papers were excluded from the literature review. The search yielded 314 publications, of which 131 were included in the review. The software programme EndNote was used for reference management.
