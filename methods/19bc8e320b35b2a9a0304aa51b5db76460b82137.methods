We conducted a cohort study, comparing frontline HCWs with intensive patient contact (clinical) and staff with no patient contact (nonclinical). Frontline HCWs were defi ned as those who worked >1 shift per week and had likely exposure to patients with pandemic infl uenza infection. These workers included doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists, as well as others in the emergency department, intensive care unit, infectious diseases units, and respiratory and other wards where patients with suspected pandemic infl uenza were housed. Staff members who had no clinical contact were chosen as a convenient surrogate for a community control group. These workers included university and hospital staff in nonpatient contact areas such as the library, information technology, and administration. This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at each of the hospitals and all participants gave written informed consent. The study was conducted from August 24, 2009, through December 16, 2009. Four tertiary referral hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne were involved: Royal Melbourne, St Vincent's, Austin, and Alfred Hospitals. At all sites, patients with suspected or confi rmed pandemic infl uenza infection were cared for in negative pressure isolation rooms when they were available, and in private rooms when they were not. Institutional infection control policies directed that gloves, gowns, goggles, and masks be used when caring for these patients. Use of N95 masks was initially recommended in all hospitals, although hospital 1 changed to surgical masks after June 16, 2009 . Hand hygiene with an alcohol-based product and respiratory etiquette were promoted at all hospitals. The progression of the pandemic in Victoria is shown in Figure 1 . The original research plan was to obtain 2 serum samples, 3 months apart, from all participants to test for seroconversion and also to obtain weekly nose swabs for pandemic infl uenza detection by using real-time PCR. By the time the study commenced, the pandemic was waning, infl uenza cases were decreasing in Victoria, and following the original study plan was not considered feasible. The plan was thus modifi ed. An initial serum sample was obtained from all participants to measure for pandemic infl uenza antibodies. At study entry, participants completed a Web-or paper-based questionnaire that requested information on demographic characteristics, known infl uenza exposures outside the workplace, and any history of fever or respiratory symptoms occurring during the pandemic but before the study. In addition, the clinical group was asked about work exposure to patients with suspected pandemic infl uenza and their usual use of PPE when caring for these patients. Participants were also asked about use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) and specifi cally whether they received prophylaxis after exposure to a patient with confi rmed infl uenza. Participants were instructed to provide nose swab specimens for viral testing if they experienced signs and symptoms, including cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, laryngitis, fever, myalgias, or headache. All were asked to complete a weekly questionnaire regarding symptoms, infl uenza exposure, and use of NIs. If a participant reported respiratory illness, a second serum sample was requested for antibody testing to document possible seroconversion. Serum was tested for antibodies to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza virus by using the hemagglutination inhibition assay with A/California/7/2009 virus and turkey red blood cells (10) . A titer of <40 was defi ned as negative and >40 as positive. Nucleic acid detection was performed on nasal swabs by using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for infl uenza-specifi c and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus-specifi c sequences on swabs; kits were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) (11) and an ABI-7500FAST instrument at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Infl uenza in Melbourne.
