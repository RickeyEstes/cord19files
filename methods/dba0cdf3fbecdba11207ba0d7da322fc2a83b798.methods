The IHR PoE program designed three systematic assessments (self-assessment, preliminary external assessment, and follow-up external assessment), together with the implementation of action plans that addressed the identified gaps. Each assessment applied the 95 assessment indicators and scoring system provided in the WHO tool (7). The self-assessment Before investing resources for establishing core capacities, the PoEs must have an overall idea of its present status. Therefore, the TIA and PoK had respectively completed self-assessments during March 2011, by a PoE Taskforce. At the first stage, the secretariat of the taskforce led the introduction of the 95 assessment indicators, so that members could thoroughly understand the implication of the IHR core capacity requirements. Following this, members were asked to report their field activities concerning the IHR core capacities. In addition, a field visit was arranged for, if necessary. For instance, the TIA taskforce visited the airport cargo terminal services to understand the operation of the transportation of dangerous goods according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations. Finally, members worked together to complete the WHO assessment tool, by describing any measures, facilities, and approaches available at the PoE, and listed documents which can provide evidence on the compliance of the core capacity requirements. Based on the information collected, the taskforce jointly decided the perceived stage of implementation (fully implemented, partially implemented, not implemented). The preliminary external assessment Through the self-assessment, both the TIA and PoK obtained the baseline information of their existing core capacities, and then implemented some improvements to address the identified gaps. Yet, in order to avoid bias due to subjective judgments, an external expert was invited from Japan to conduct an in-depth review of the designated PoEs, from an international perspective, in August 2011. During the preliminary external assessment, the reviewer carefully verified the documents that evidenced the compliance of assessment indicators. Sites were visited to investigate facilities, equipment, and practices implemented in the field. In addition, the reviewer interviewed key personnel, raised inquiries, and obtained feedback during the assessment. To facilitate the assessment, a pre-designed assessment protocol was provided to the reviewer and the PoEs to prepare them for the same. In addition, background materials such as self-assessment reports and a brief introduction of both the PoEs, were provided to the reviewer in advance. The reviewer was requested to predesignate the document and the potential sites to be assessed. The follow-up external assessment In order to ensure the PoE's efforts for improvement were already consistent with the IHR requirements, two experts were invited from the Australia Government's Department of Health and Ageing to undertake a follow-up external assessment in mid-March 2013. Similar assessment 1 In Taiwan, a Minister without Portfolio refers to a minister who does not head a particular ministry. Being the premier's key aides, such ministers are responsible in managing and reviewing the affairs of different government ministries and commissions, to enhance the competencies and governance quality of the Cabinet. procedures (document reviews and on-site visits) were applied in the two external assessments to ensure that their results were comparable. Improvement intervention on unfulfilled core capacity requirements Based on findings discovered from the self and the preliminary external assessment, a series of activities were identified to improve the designated PoEs in Taiwan. Firstly, both the PoE Taskforces respectively prioritized the identified gaps, while taking into account factors such as urgency, resource availability, and achievability. Subsequently, action plans that described practicable approaches and resource investments, and which set a defined timeline with checking points, were developed. As improvement is always a dynamic process, regular monitoring and feedback is crucial to ensure progress and that outcomes are in line with expectations. The PoE Taskforces were allowed to adjust the scope and timeline of the plans according to current need and performance (Fig. 2) .
