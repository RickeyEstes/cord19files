Selection and production of N-terminal VP1 peptides. VP1 amino acid sequences of RV strains representing the three RV species (RV-A: n = 76; RV-B: n = 25; RV-C: n = 6) were retrieved from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/) (Supplementary Table 1 ). Multiple sequence alignments of the VP1 N-terminal peptides (aa 1-40) were performed using ClustalW2 software available at the EMBL-EBI website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/clustalw2) to determine amino acid sequence identities among the peptides. Peptide sequences showing sequence identities greater than 87.5% (i.e. differences of ≤5 aa) were grouped together into clusters (Fig. 1) . Sequences among the clusters (Supplementary  Tables 1 and 2 , A1-A17, B1-B9, C1-C3) were re-aligned using GeneDoc software (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/ibmpc/genedoc-readme.html) and each amino acid mismatch was analyzed regarding physicochemical properties of the amino acids. This procedure led to re-clustering of the peptides (Supplementary  Table 2 , AI-XVIII, BI-BIX; CI-CIII). From each re-clustered group one representative RV strain peptide was selected for printing onto the chip (Fig. 1b, Sup- plementary Tables 2 and 3 : RV-A: n = 18; RV-B: n = 9; RV-C: n = 3). An enterovirus-derived peptide was also included (Fig. 1) . For the set of peptides to be printed a multiple sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW2 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighbor-Joining (N-J) method using MEGA 6 software (www.megasoftware.net) (Fig. 1c) . The evolutionary distances between sequences were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates. Additional 36 peptides spanning the RV89VP1 protein (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 4 ) were selected to detect antibodies towards VP1 epitopes other than the N-terminal portion. The peptides as well as the non-structural 3B protein from strain 89 (VPg: GPYSGEPKPKSRAPERRVVTQ) were produced by solid-phase synthesis with the 9-fluorenyl-methoxy carbonyl (Fmoc)-method (CEM-Liberty, Matthews, NC, USA and Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on PEG-PS preloaded resins (Applied Biosystems). After synthesis, peptides were washed with dichloromethane, cleaved from the resins using 19 ml trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 0.5 ml silane, and 0.5 ml H 2 O and precipitated into pre-chilled tertbutylmethylether. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in a 10-70% acetonitrile gradient using a Jupiter 4 μm Proteo 90 Å, LC column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and an UltiMate 3000 Pump (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) to a purity >90%. Their identities and molecular weights were verified by mass spectrometry (Microflex MALDI-TOF, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) 49 . For the unsupervised analysis of antibody responses to RV peptides and proteins, unsupervised K-means clustering (K = 4) was used to define clusters of peptides with similar antibody response measurements. The K number of clusters was pre-determined in order to match the number of the peptide homology groups. The peptides' amino acid sequences were aligned with a Gap open cost of 10.0 and a Gap extension cost of 1.0. Based on the alignment, a homology distance cladogram was built using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm and 1000 bootstrap replicates. The peptides were then color-coded based on the antibody response cluster that they belonged to. Data were processed using the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC, CLCbio, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The heat map representing RV-specific antibody responses was generated by Qlucore Omics Explorer (Qlucore, Lund, Sweden). Expression and purification of recombinant RV proteins. Recombinant histagged structural (VP1-4) proteins from five representative RV strains (RV-A2, -A16, -A89, -B14, and -CYP) and MBP fusion proteins containing fragments thereof (VP1-3) as well as non-structural (2A, 2C, 3A, 3C, and 3D) proteins from RV strain 89 were expressed in Escherichia coli as previously described 33, 36 . DNA sequences coding for the complete genes or fragments thereof (accession numbers are shown in Supplementary Table 5) were codon optimized for bacterial expression, synthesized with the addition of the 3′ sequence coding for a Cterminal hexa-histidine tag and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of plasmid pET27b (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were induced with 1 mM isopropylβ-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cells were harvested at time-points of maximal expression. Recombinant proteins were purified by Nickel-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions as previously described (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Refolding of recombinant proteins was achieved by a stepwise dialysis against 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 for structural and non-structural proteins and 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA for MBP fusion proteins, respectively. The purity of recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and the identity by immunoblotting using a monoclonal mouse anti-His-tag antibody 1:1000 diluted (Cat: DIA-900, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Bound antibodies were detected with 1:1000 diluted alkaline phosphatase-coupled rat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cat: 557272; BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). The secondary structure of the proteins was measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy on a Jasko J-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan) at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 . Detection antibodies and printing of microarrays. Anti-huIgG (Cat: 309-005-008; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) and anti-huIgA (Cat.: 555885; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were labeled with DyLight 650 (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Customized printing of RV microarrays was done by Phadia-ThermoFisher using ImmunoCAP ISAC (Immuno Solid-phase Allergen Chip) technology 50, 51 . Spotting was performed by slow pin mode printing using the Aushon 2410 Printer (Aushon, Billerica, MA, USA). Stock solutions of peptides (5 mg/ml) were diluted 1:4 in a phosphate buffer, pH 8.4 and then used for spotting. Antigens were spotted in triplicates on a glass surface coated with an amino-reactive organic polymer, each spot containing 50-200 fg of microarray component, corresponding to 1-5 attomol. Allergens used for the calibration and other control proteins spotted on the microarray are listed in Supplementary Table 6 . Cohort of pre-school children with acute wheeze. Serum samples examined in this study were from a cohort of 120 pre-school children who had been admitted to the Paediatric Emergency Ward as a result of acute wheeze, at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden (Table 1) . This cohort and the genotyping of RV strains in the nasopharyngeal swab samples of 108 of the 120 children by nested PCR and sequencing have been previously described 35 . A molecular diagnostic platform for the rapid detection of 15 respiratory strains was used in 118 of the 120 children. The following respiratory viruses were found: Adenovirus: 7 children; Bocavirus: 8 children; Coronavirus: 6 children; Influenza A/B: 1 child; Metapneumovirus: 3 children; Parainfluenzavirus: 4 children: RSV: 22 children 52 . For 108 of the 120 children nasopharyngeal swabs had been available for the RV PCR targeting VP4/2 sequences. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or by the legal guardians and the study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Peripheral blood samples had been obtained within 24 h of presentation in the emergency unit and sera were stored at −80°C. In addition to blood samples, nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained at the acute visit and again at the follow-up visit by the research nurse and stored in the biobank at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital 35 . Follow-up samples were obtained between 6 and 30 weeks after the initial recruitment (median 11 weeks) at a scheduled visit after recovery. Although this study was not planned as a prospective study for the assessment of increases of RV-specific antibodies, the time interval of 6-30 weeks was suited for this purpose because we found in an earlier study that increase of RV-specific IgG responses emerge 42 days after experimental inoculation 36 . At the follow-up visit, the guardians also filled out a standardized questionnaire concerning the number of days the child had suffered from respiratory symptoms at home (i.e., 'cough and/or wheeze'), use of medication (i.e., β2-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonist), as well as about any emergency visits between the acute and follow-up visits. The chip analysis of the anonymized sera was performed with the approval of the ethics committee of Medical University of Vienna (EK1721/2014) 37, 50 . Microarray-based determination of antibody profiles. Microarrays were washed in a washing buffer (Phadia-Thermo Fisher) for 5 min by stirring. After drying by centrifugation (1 min, 1000 g, RT), 35 µl of serum samples were applied on each microarray and the slides were incubated for 2 h at gentle rocking (RT). For the detection of RV-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, serum samples were diluted 1:300 and 1:20 in a sample dilution buffer (Phadia-Thermo Fisher), respectively. Microarrays were then rinsed with washing buffer and washed for 5 min as described above. After centrifugation, 30 µl of fluorescence-labeled antibodies (1 µg/ml) was added and the slides were incubated 30 min at gentle rocking (in dark, RT). After further rinsing, washing and drying, microarrays were scanned using a confocal laser scanner (LuxScan-10K microarray scanner, Capital-Bio, Beijing, People's Republic of China) and the image analysis was evaluated by Microarray Image Analyzer v3.1.2 software (Phadia-Thermo Fisher) 50 . For calibration and determination of background signals, a calibrator serum (i.e., a pool of allergic patients sera, diluted 1:10) and sample diluent were included in each analysis run. Calibration and variability of the microarray. The Phadia Microarray Image Analysis software was used to process images, to calculate the mean fluorescence intensities (FI) of triplicate analyses and to calibrate the results. A calibration curve was generated by relating fluorescence intensities obtained by scanning the Pre-Dicta microarray with allergen-specific antibody levels measured by ImmunoCAP. Results were reported in ISAC standardized units (ISU) 50, 52 . Background reactivities of fluorescence-labeled α-huIgG antibodies towards all microarray components were determined by testing six replicates of a sample diluent alone. For the characterization of the assay variability, one calibrator serum and three normal sera were profiled at 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, and 1:1000 in order to find a dilution at which the broadest spectrum of reactivity levels were covered. To assess intra-assay (i.e. within experiment) variability, six replicates of four serum samples were used to measure IgG reactivities towards all microarray components on the same day. To assess inter-assay (i.e. between experiments) variability, four serum samples were evaluated in experiments conducted on five consecutive days. The evaluation of four different samples allowed determining whether the inter-assay variability was sample-dependent. For each microarray component, the mean ISU-G, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV % = SD/mean ISU-G) across the six replicates and five different experiments, respectively, were calculated for each sample. Microarray components were classified according to the ISU-G level (>50, and averages across all components within these groups on the array were also calculated for each of these quantities. Data analysis. Initial data processing was performed with Microsoft Excel. Frequencies (i.e., the number of reactive sera) and intensities (i.e., ISU-G levels) of peptide-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Median values of peptidespecific IgG levels (ISU-G) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA). The cut-off for a positive IgG reactivity was set at 1 ISU-G. The numbers of IgG-reactive peptides in Fig. 2d , e were calculated for specific IgG levels >15 ISU-G. Increases of RV-specific antibody responses were calculated as differences between ISU-G values measured at the follow-up (F) and the acute (A) visits (ΔISU-G = ISU-G F − ISU-G A ) followed by subtraction of the double coefficient of variation (2 × CV%) calculated from the baseline values (ISU-G A ) for each of the antigens. For IgG levels of 1-5 ISU-G and >5 ISU-G, 25% and 12.5% were determined as CV% for intra-assay variability and subtracted from the data, respectively. RV-specific IgM antibodies were not measured because we found in an earlier study that no increases of RV-specific IgM antibody levels were detectable on days 4, 7, and 42 after experimental RV inoculation 36 . Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 6 (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to evaluate all statistical parameters. Correlation between the number of reactive peptides and age was evaluated by calculating the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ). Differences between groups in number of reactive peptides and in number of days the children spent with respiratory symptoms, medication use, or with both were assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test (two-tailed). Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
