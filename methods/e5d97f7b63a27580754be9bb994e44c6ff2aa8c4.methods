A total of 510 consecutive LRT samples, including 329 sputums (SP), 165 endotracheal aspirates (EA) and 16 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), were collected from 433 adult patients, admitted to three Italian hospitals, during April 2004-May 2005. All specimens were screened with a molecular panel for detecting 12 respiratory viruses. Of the 510 samples tested, 220 (43.1%) were positive for one respiratory virus and 33 (6.5%) were positive for more than one virus. The detailed prevalence for each of these pathogens is published elsewhere (Minosse et al., 2008) . HCoV-NL63 was detected by nested RT-PCR, targeting a 237 bp fragment of the ORF1b (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . As a positive control, a clinical sample positive for HCoV-NL63 by RT-PCR and confirmed by sequence analysis, was used. As negative controls, water and a nasopharyngeal swab from an individual without respiratory symptoms were used in each analytical session. The sensitivity of our RT-PCR protocol, established by probit analysis of serial replicate dilutions of a plasmid containing the RT-PCR amplicon as the insert, was 1 copy/reaction, corresponding to 42 copies/ml of the starting sample. The RT-PCR assay was validated through participation in an external quality assessment (QCMD 2006 Rhinovirus & Coronavirus RNA EQA Pilot Study, Glasgow, UK), where HCoV-NL63 was detected in all positive samples included in the panel. For phylogenetic analysis, two different genomic regions were amplified and sequenced: a 523 bp fragment of S gene and a 525 bp fragment of ORF1a, by using primers previously described (Bastien et al., 2005a; Vabret et al., 2005) .
