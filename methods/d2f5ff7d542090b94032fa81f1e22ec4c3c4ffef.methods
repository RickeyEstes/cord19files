This investigation focused on healthcare workers at highest risk for infection, in other words, those who had known unprotected exposure to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-positive patients. An exposure was defined as any healthcare worker-patient interaction that occurred within droplet range (i.e., 3 feet). Exposures were categorized as either unprotected or protected, depending upon whether full personal protective equipment was used. Full equipment was defined as the use of all the personal protective equipment recommended for the care of SARS patients, i.e., a full-length gown, gloves, N95 or higher respirator, and eye protection with goggles or a face shield (7, 8) . Healthcare workers were identified by hospital infection-control practitioners and public health officials through informal interviews with hospital staff, by review of employee records, and by self-identification. In addition to the healthcare workers at highest risk, other healthcare workers of interest were included, such as those with multiple protected exposures and any who requested inclusion because of concerns about exposure. This investigation was conducted as part of the public health response to the SARS outbreak. Informed consent was obtained from healthcare workers before epidemiologic and clinical information and biologic specimens were collected. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, occupation, exposure characteristics, use of personal protective equipment, patient events to which the healthcare workers were exposed (e.g., coughing or vomiting), and presence during medical procedures. In addition, information was collected regarding any clinical signs or symptoms in the worker up to 10 days after exposure, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, or radiographically confirmed pneumonia. A single convalescent-phase serum sample was collected from healthcare workers at least 28 days after their last exposure to the patient. In some situations early in the outbreak, samples were collected between days 22 to 28 early in the outbreak, consistent with CDC recommendations at the time. Serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV serum antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (9) . Data were entered into Microsoft Access and statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Univariate analysis was performed by using two-sided Fisher exact or Mantel-Haenszel chisquared test, as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
