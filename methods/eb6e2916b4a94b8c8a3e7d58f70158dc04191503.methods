A survey was performed of healthcare workers in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2015. The questionnaire was developed by the primary author and pilot tested on a small number of healthcare workers. Participants were recruited from 9 September 2015 to 8 November 2015. The survey was administered on paper in either Arabic or English according to respondent preference. The responses entered into an electronic database for analysis. The content areas included MERS coronavirus knowledge and sources of information; personal experiences with MERS-CoV; opinions about the location of management of patients with emerging infectious diseases; attitudes of the HCWs to infection control practices; the educational needs of the HCWs about emerging infectious diseases; and self-reported infection control practices of the HCWs. All responses were anonymous. A Chi Square test was used to compare differences in the proportions of categorical variables. Significance was determined at the 0.05 threshold. Ethical permission to conduct the survey was obtained from the department of medical research and studies, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (approval number A00298). This department is registered in Saudi National Committee for Biomedical Ethics (Registration number H-02-J-002).
