The R estimator of this model deals with 3 variables. E and I are viral constants representing the lengths of the Exposed and Infectious stages respectively, in terms of time. K is the logarithmic growth rate, which is affected by many statistical factors, but bears the simple definition of being the rate of growth in the natural logarithm of the infected population. With these variables, R is defined as This model is also the one chosen by Cao et al in their preprint "Estimating the effective reproduction number of the 2019-nCoV in China". E and I, as mentioned, are viral constants, and this paper will use the same values (E = 7 and I = 9). However, their methodology's estimation of K is relatively static, and historical, using 6 timeframes over the course of the outbreak to create an average logarithmic growth factor. 3 However, this method is prone to a couple flaws and insufficiencies. First, as a methodological error, using an average over 6 different timeframes of different length weights the K values in different time periods, producing a warped K-value, producing a final K-value closer toward the K-values during the shorter timeframes than an unweighted average. However, adopting timeframes of similar length would patch the flaw. Secondly, more paradigmatically, this method does not allow for the "dynamic indicator" approach to the R value. One key novelty, of the method presented in this work, therefore, will be in its dynamic estimation of the K value. Similar models have also been used to try to find the instantaneous R values at any time t. Some models use regression to first perform curve-fitting on the dataset, before utilizing differentials of the curve equations to find the R values at any instance. This idea was first presented in Nishiura and Chowell's "Fitting dynamic models to epidemic outbreaks with quantified uncertainty" and reused and refined in other works. 4, 5 However, this method presents several flaws. First of all, any changes in trends are not modelled by the curve fit. For example, if public health policies are implemented, and the rate of transmission drops significantly, a .
