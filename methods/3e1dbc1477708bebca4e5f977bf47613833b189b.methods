This was a prospective cohort study including 14 tertiary hospitals throughout Chile, eight in the capital, Santiago, and six in other regions of the country. Every child five years of age or older who was hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation between August 16th, 2015 and August 16th, 2016 was eligible for inclusion in the study. Asthma exacerbations were defined as acute episodes of increased shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness or a combination of these symptoms that require the use of rescue bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. In each center, members of the research team identified eligible patients in hospital admission records on a daily basis from Monday to Friday. Patients were enrolled during the first 72 h of admission, after obtaining written informed consent from the parents, and from the child if he/she was over 12 years of age. Prior to discharge, researchers gathered information on the length of stay, days with oxygen supply, pharmacological treatments received, isolated infectious agents and the presence of any complication from the clinical chart. To estimate the average hospitalization costs for a single patient we defined a basic asthma hospitalization basket which included the costs of ward bed days, Intensive Care Unit bed days, medications and laboratory testing. The costs of each of these items were obtained from a price reference list published in a 2011 study by the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile on the expenditures of health care services. 4 Prices were adjusted for inflation as of December 1st, 2016 and converted to U.S. dollars. The total value of the hospitalization basket was obtained from the sum of the quantity-frequency-price multiplication for every single service, supply or medication included in the basket. Six months after discharge, patients received a phone call from the researchers to evaluate their clinical outcome, inquiring on new visits to the Emergency Room, new hospitalizations for asthma exacerbations, use of systemic corticosteroids, reported adherence to the controller treatment and attendance to medical checkups with a specialist in pediatric respiratory diseases. To evaluate if there were any differences in asthma exacerbation treatments among the different centers, we made a comparison between public and private hospitals and between hospitals in different geographical regions. In Chile, the public health system covers the health expenditures of almost 80% of the population, including people of lower and middle income, while the private system covers the 20% of highest income. 5 The public system has serious deficits in terms of infrastructure, equipment, supplies and medical staff, in particular specialists, compared to the private system. For the geographical comparison, hospitals were grouped into three different zones: north, central and south. These three zones differ in terms of climate, urban development, population density and medical infrastructure. The north zone has a desert or semi-arid climate and contains 11.8% of the population, the central zone has a Mediterranean climate and contains 60.5% of the population, while the south zone has a rainy temperate climate and contains 27.8% of the population. Health infrastructure is concentrated in the central zone, followed by the south and north zones. Asthma hospitalization rates for the selected ages were compared by geographical area and expressed per 10,000 inhabitants. The study was approved by the ethics committee of each participating center.
