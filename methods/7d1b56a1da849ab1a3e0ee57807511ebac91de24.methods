We conducted a retrospective review of electronic medical records. The following variables were reviewed: onset age, sex, infec tion and vaccination history, laterality, severity of facial palsy, laboratory findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, treatments, and outcomes. All patients were also examined by an otolaryn gologist and an ophthalmologist during the initial work up. The differences in age, sex, laterality, infection or vaccination history, degree of facial nerve palsy, and prognosis after treatment between the groups were analyzed. The HouseBrackmann score was used to classify the severity of facial palsy (Table 1) . Severity improvement was defined as a decrease in the grade by 2 or more points, or the achievement of grade I. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Pusan National University Hospital approved this study (1810002 071). The requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the IRB.
