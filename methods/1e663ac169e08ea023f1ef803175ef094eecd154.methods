Mortality data (including suicides) in Hong Kong, SAR during the period 1998 to 2003 were made available by the Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner's Court. All suicide deaths, coded in the range of E950-E959 were classified and recorded according to the ICD-9 standard (World Health Organization, 1978) . With the consent of the Coroner's Court we examined the case files of people who died by suicide in 2003. The files included information on socio-demographic variables, psychiatric illness, police investigation files and suicide notes (where available). For comparison, we selected the case files of people who died by suicide during the first six months of each year between 1998 and 2002. The suicide rate in Hong Kong has increased markedly in recent years, rising from 13.2 per 100,000 in 1998 to 18.6 per 100,000 in 2003 (Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2005) . Therefore to allow a robust comparison of the monthly distribution of suicides against the background of this increasing trend, we detrended the monthly suicide numbers by subtracting the mean of the first six months in the corresponding year from the monthly figures. (Kaiser and Maravall, 2001; Harvey and Proietti, 2005) . The number of suicides in April 2003 was compared with the average for the first six months of the year, the average for the immediately preceding three months (January-March 2003) , and with the average for April in the preceding 5 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) . A chi-square test was used to examine the significance of differences in distribution. In addition, we also examined the Coroner's death reports as well suicide notes for suicide deaths in 2003, and identified those which mentioned Cheung's death. Tables 1a and 1b suggest that the increase in suicides in April 2003 was most marked for suicide by jumping from a height and among males aged 25-39 years. In that month, 42 male suicide deaths involved jumping from a height, which was 11 more than monthly average for the first six months of 2003. It was also 72% greater than the monthly average for the previous three months of 2003 (24.3 cases) (p b 0.01). A significant but smaller increment significance was also found in May 2003. On average about 6 males in this age group committed suicide by this method each month during the months of January to March 2003 and there was about 10 cases in this subgroup in April each year during the period 1998-2002, whereas 15 males used this method in April 2003. Moreover, the corresponding detrended figure was about 3.5 times higher than that of the average detrended figure for April in the preceding 5 years.
