Our estimation process consists of calculating an age-specific susceptibility profile based on epidemiological data from China and the estimated China-level contact matrix [3] . This susceptibility profile can then be combined with the estimated country-level contact matrices from the other countries in Prem et al.'s study [3] to produce age-stratified transmission matrices for these countries. The dominant eigenvalue from these transmission matrices (which are linear scalings of the next-generation matrix) provides a relative estimate of the basic reproductive ratio for that country. We assume that we have a population divided into K discrete age classes C 1 , ...C K . Suppose we have a set of outbreak data in the form x = (x 1 , ..., x K ), where x i is the cumulative number of cases so far in age class C i , expressed as a fraction of all the cases, so that i x i = 1. Denote by k i,j the expected number of contacts with individuals of age class C i made per day by a single individual of age class C j . The matrix K = (k i,j ) will be asymmetric, with the ith row corresponding to an average individual of each age class's contacts with age class C i , and the ith column corresponding to the contacts made per day by an average individual of age class C i . Let p i be the conditional probability that a susceptible individual in age class C i becomes infected, given that they have had contact with an infectious individual. We assume that this probability depends only on the age class of the recipient, and not on that of the infector, i.e. we have age-dependent susceptibility but homogeneous infectivity. The expected number of infections generated in age class C i in a single day by an infectious indvidual in age class C j is given by p i k i,j . Defining z i = p i γ −1 , the expected number of cases in age class C i generated by a single infectious individual in age class C j over its entire infectious period is given by These age-stratified reproductive ratios define a matrix R (often called the next generation matrix), whose leading eigenvalue is the basic reproductive ratio of the entire system [4] . The corresponding magnitude 1 eigenvector is the distribution of cases by age in the early stages of the epidemic. Thus, given the dataset x and an estimate R 0 of the associated basic reproductive ratio, the matrix R should satisfy If we look at the ith row of this set of equations, we have The age-specific susceptibility z i can thus be estimated as To estimate the equivalent of the matrix R for some new population with age-structured contact matrix k = (k i,j ), we assume that z i is constant across populations (i.e. in every population we see the same dependence of susceptibility on age). Then our desired matrix has (i, j)th entrỹ and the eigenvalue of this matrix gives us the estimated basic reproductive ratioR 0 for the new population. Since Equation 3 tells us that every z i term is linear in R 0 , and every entry ofR contains one of the z i terms, it follows that the eigenvalueR 0 is also linear in R 0 . We can thus writeR 0 = σ R 0 for some population-specific scaling factor σ, which we can calculate by carrying out the estimation of z with R 0 2 .

Gray countries are those not included in Prem et al.'s study [3] . set to one. We can therefore calculate a full set of scaling factors for every country without requiring an estimate of the basic reproductive ratio in China; these scaling factors provide a measure of transmission relative to that observed in China, and can be used to generate country-specific basic reproductive ratios given a reliable estimate for China. Although we note that estimates for China differ widely depending on the time-scales examined ( R 0 = 2.2 [1] , R 0 = 2.3 − 2.6 [5] , R 0 = 2 − 2.7, [6] , R 0 = 2.35 [7] , R 0 = 3.11 [8] ).
