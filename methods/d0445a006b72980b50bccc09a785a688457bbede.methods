A conceptual framework for epidemic preparedness and response Epidemic preparedness reflects the capacity of institutions-public health authorities, health systems and emergency response bodies-to detect, report and respond to outbreaks. Government institutions must detect and assess potentially consequential outbreak events, report outbreaks and their causes to relevant national and international organisations and networks, and respond with measures to reduce the health, societal and economic impacts of outbreaks. 5 7 While preparedness for public health emergencies is typically considered in terms of surveillance, response and health capacity, these functions in turn rely on a broader set of institutional, financial and infrastructural factors. 6 7 Accordingly, we developed a multidisciplinary framework to holistically evaluate a broad set of capabilities, and identify five general types of capabilities that are required for effective epidemic preparedness (figure 1).
