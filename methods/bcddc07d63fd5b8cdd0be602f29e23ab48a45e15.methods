Earlier methods for side-chain modeling often put less emphasis on the energy or scoring function. The function was usually greatly simplified, and consisted of the empirical rotamer preferences and simple repulsion terms for nonbonded contacts. 138 Nevertheless, these approaches have been justified by their performance. For example, a method based on a rotamer library compared favorably with that based on a molecular mechanics force field, 146 and new methods continue to be based on the rotamer library approach. 147, 148 The various optimization approaches include a Monte Carlo simulation, 149 simulated annealing, 150 a combination of Monte Carlo and simulated annealing, 151 the dead-end elimination theorem, 152,153 genetic algorithms, 142 neural network with simulated annealing, 154 mean field optimization, 155 and combinatorial searches. 138, 156, 157 Several recent papers focused on the testing of more sophisticated potential functions for conformational search 157, 158 and development of new scoring functions for sidechain modeling, 159 reporting higher accuracy than earlier studies.
