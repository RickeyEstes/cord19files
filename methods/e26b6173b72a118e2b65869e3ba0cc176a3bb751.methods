Sources of data. For the outbreak in South Korea, we retrieved publicly available data from multiple sources, including the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, the World Health Organization, and local Korean news reports to compile a line list of all confirmed cases that had been reported by 27 July 2015. We used the most updated information from official reports that have been published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health and Welfare on a daily basis during the outbreak. The official reports included a brief description of each of all confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics (e.g., age and sex), dates of exposure, onset of symptoms and outcome. The information on exposure was mostly recorded as intervals of 2 to 15 days during which transmission was thought to have occurred rather than exact dates of presumed transmission. Table 3 . Factors associated with the incubation period of MERS-CoV infection. 1 The coefficients (β ) of the multiple linear regression were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (10,000 runs) with incubation period as the outcome variable and age, sex and location as predictors. Moreover, 10,000 samples from the posterior distributions of the incubation periods T for each patient estimated with were used here in the multiple regression model. 2 10,000 samples of the incubation periods T for each patient were drawn using MCMC. Scientific RepoRts | 6:35839 | DOI: 10.1038/srep35839 Information on cases of MERS-CoV infection in the Middle East were retrieved from four published studies that provided individual patient data from Saudi Arabia [11] [12] [13] [14] . We selected only the cases with available exposure information and collected data including demographic characteristics (e.g. age and sex), dates of exposure and onset of symptoms, geographical location of the exposure, and final outcome. For both locations, the day of symptoms onset was defined as the day when clinical symptoms related to MERS-CoV infection first occurred, including non-specific symptoms such as fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, sore throat, myalgia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting 1,11-14,20,21 . Statistical analyses. The incubation period T k for each case k is defined as T k = S k -X k , where S k is the symptom onset time and X k the infection time. Infection events are rarely observed but rather interval-censored. If case k reported that exposure to infection occurred in a period between times L k and U k , where L k ≤ X k ≤ Uk, the incubation time therefore is bounded by the interval (S k -U k , S k -L k ). These interval-censored data are a special type of survival data, and it is possible to "reverse" the time axis considering S k as the origin and X k as the outcome time, if the density function for infection is uniform in chronologic time 22 . This condition should be reasonable here in the setting of MERS-CoV infections, with each exposure interval being relatively short, and reversing the time axis allowed us to use standard approaches for interval-censored data. We added + 0.5 to each upper bound and − 0.5 to each lower bound to give appropriate intervals in continuous time and to account account for uncertainty in the reported exposure times 23 . For example, an exposure that was reported two and three days before illness onset would be written as an incubation period censored on the interval (1.5, 3.5) instead of (2, 3) . To deal with interval-exposure data, the most basic approach is to impute the infection dates as the midpoint of exposure intervals, but this leads to overestimation of the incubation period distribution, which tends to be right-skewed 24 . Non-parametric estimation of a distribution based on interval-censored data can be done with the generalized non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator developed by Turnbull 25 . The incubation period can often be appropriately characterized by different parametric distributions that have been previously used such as gamma 9,26 , Weibull 9,27,28 , lognormal 9,18 , log-logistic, and exponential distributions. We fitted five different distributions and estimated the parameters of each distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian framework. The incubation period distribution was estimated using first the interval-censored data and compared between the different parametric models (using Bayesian Information Criterion) and the Turnbull non-parametric estimate 25 . To evaluate potential factors such as age, sex and geographic location that could be associated with the length of the incubation period, we used a linear regression model on the log of the incubation period (assuming that incubation periods generally followed lognormal distributions), which can also be referred to as a log-linear model. The multiple linear regression model used in this study is based on the following equation: where IncP i is the length of incubation period for individual i, β i 's are the regression coefficients, estimated with MCMC using flat priors, X i 's the explanatory variables labeled directly in the equation above and ε I the disturbance factor, normally distributed, independently and identically with E(εi) = 0 and V(εi) = σ 2 for all i. We used two different approaches to estimate model parameters, including an exact likelihood method and a resampling method 29 . Approach 1: exact likelihood approach. The equation (1) and consequently using equation (2) we can define the following pdf of the normal distribution: We defined the probability q i as: i L i U is the range of incubation period for case i and where (k, θ) is the couple of parameters of the gamma distribution. We estimated θ = (β 0 , β 1 , β 2 , β 3 , β 4 , k, θ, σ 2 ) simultaneously using MCMC and the following likelihood: where f and F are the pdf and cdf of the gamma distribution with parameters k and θ , respectively. Approach 2: resampling approach. We defined another multiple linear regression model using incubation times resampled from the 10,000 posterior samples. In this approach, the probability P(ε i ) was similarly defined as in equation (3) and for each patient with interval-censored exposure data, we estimated 10,000 posterior samples for the incubation time using MCMC in order to simulate the incubation period distribution for each patient. We used the same likelihood as defined in equation (5) using the resampled incubation time for each patient.
