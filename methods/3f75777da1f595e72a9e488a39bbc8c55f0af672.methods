The study protocol was approved by the University of North Carolina's Biomedical Institutional Review Board (Study 05-2856), and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study population was individuals working as health care providers. The inclusion criteria for enrollment were age >18 years, not pregnant, no latex allergy, no active skin disorders, and previous fit testing for an N95 respirator. Experiments were performed in a patient care room in the University of North Carolina Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center. The experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1 . Each experiment comprised 2 phases: a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase. Before beginning, participants were shown a poster presenting of the CDC's PPE removal protocol and given an opportunity to read it and ask questions. The doublegloving phase was performed first. Participants changed into a scrub shirt and pants and donned a full set of PPE, consisting of a contact isolation gown, an N95 respirator, eye protection, and 2 pairs of latex gloves. The first (inner) pair of gloves was put on so that the wrist of the glove was under the elastic cuff at the wrist of the gown sleeve. The second (outer) pair, one size larger, was worn over the first pair so that the wrist of the glove was over the elastic cuff at the end of the gown sleeve. Although the CDC protocol calls for donning and doffing PPE at the door of the patient's room, participants carried out these activities in the center of the room, to minimize the possibility of accidental touching of room surfaces or objects. After donning, PPE was contaminated with bacteriophage MS2 suspended in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline. Sites of contamination were the front shoulder of the gown, right side of the N95 respirator, upper right front of the eye protection, and palm of the dominant hand. Each site was contaminated with a total of 5 log 10 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MS2 in 5 drops of 5 mL each to simulate droplet contamination. To simulate typical physical movement that would occur while wearing PPE, the participant then performed a routine health care task (assessing neck and wrist pulses on a mannequin). The participant then removed the PPE according to the CDC protocol, with modifications. The participant was verbally instructed to remove the outer pair of gloves first and discard them, then remove the remaining items of PPE according to the protocol. Once the gown, eye protection, and respirator were removed according to the protocol, the inner pair of gloves was removed last. The protocol was available to the participant for reference at all times during PPE removal. During the removal process, the investigator observed the participant and noted any deviations from the CDC removal protocol on a data sheet. After removal, the inner gloves were immediately placed in containers of eluent liquid. The participant was instructed to stand in the center of the room without touching the hair or face. Hands were sampled using the glove juice method. 12 Each hand was placed inside a bag containing 75 mL of stripping solution (0.4 g of KH 2 PO 4 , 10.1 g of Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.0 mL of Triton-X/L of reagent water) and massaged for 60 seconds to cover all hand surfaces with solution. The nondominant hand was sampled first, followed by the dominant hand. The face was sampled by dipping a polyester-tipped swab in stripping solution and swabbing a 1-cm 2 area of each cheek where the edge of the N95 respirator had rested. The swab was immediately placed in a tube of eluent liquid. The hands were decontaminated by washing with soap and water and rubbing with 70% ethanol. The removed scrub shirt and pants were collected for sampling immediately and placed in containers of eluent liquid. The participant took a shower with full body washing and then donned a clean pair of scrubs. The single-gloving phase was performed next. The participant donned a single glove on each hand and followed the CDC removal protocol as written. Sampling was identical to that in the doublegloving phase. The hands were decontaminated by washing with soap and water and rubbing with 70% ethanol, and the participant showered before changing back into street clothes. The removed scrubs were collected for sampling in the same manner as in the double-gloving phase. Samples were transported to the laboratory and assayed within 4 hours of collection. No more than 20 minutes elapsed between application of virus and placement of hand, face, glove, and scrub samples in eluent liquid. Gloves and scrubs were assayed as described previously. 13 Items were immersed in 0.5-2 L of 1.5% beef extract (pH 7.5) and agitated on a shaker for 20 minutes. Eluent from hands, face, and PPE was assayed by a most probable number (MPN) enrichment infectivity assay. 14 To prevent cross-contamination, only one participant was assayed and processed each day, and individual eluent samples were processed separately in a biological safety cabinet, with UV light decontamination between samples. Using an a priori value of 20% for the acceptable 95% upper confidence limit for the probability of virus transfer by a given participant when P (transfer) ¼ 0, the minimum sample size was determined to be n ¼ 15. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad, LaJolla, CA). All statistical tests were 2-tailed and used a significance level of
