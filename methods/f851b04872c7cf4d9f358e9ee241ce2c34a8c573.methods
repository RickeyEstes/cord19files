A prospective collection of 510 lower respiratory samples from 433 adult patients with pulmonary diseases, admitted to three Italian hospitals was performed. Clinicalepidemiological data were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Patients with suspect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection were not included in the analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees, and informed consent signed by participants. The selection criterion for patients' enrolment was to have any one of the following samples sent to the laboratory for routine microbiological evaluation: sputum (SP), bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs), or endotracheal aspirate (EA). To minimize the possibility that positive results reflected contamination from the upper respiratory tract, only samples containing more than 25 polymorphonuclear leucocytes per field (40×) were processed (Murray and Washington, 1975; Geckler et al., 1977) . Less than 4% of the samples did not meet this criterion and were discarded. Half of each sample was submitted to standard microbiological analysis (common microbiological culture and, in case of positive result, identification and antibody susceptibility test), while the remainder was stored at −80 • C for the molecular analysis. During April 2004-May 2005, a total of 510 consecutive lower tract respiratory samples (329 SP, 165 EA and 16 BAL), which were considered appropriate on the basis of microscope inspection, were analyzed. The samples were thawed and liquefied by using 1:1 Sputasol (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, England), and then underwent DNA/RNA extraction (Boom et al., 1990) . RNA was reverse transcribed with random primers with a Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Control DNA ((globin DNA) and RNA (MS2 phage genome) preparations were spiked into the samples before the extraction, to control their suitability for PCR/RT-PCR. The molecular diagnostic panel included: FLU-A and -B, hMPV, AdV, PIV-1, -2 and -3, RSV, HRV, hCoV-OC43, -229E and -NL63. Specific primers and PCR or RT-PCR conditions were as previously described (Allard et al., 1994; Pitkaranta et al., 1997; Echevarria et al., 1998; Gröndahl et al., 1999; Allard et al., 2001; Steininger et al., 2001; Maggi et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2004; Bastien et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2005; Minosse et al., 2007) . The sensitivity of the assays ranged between 1 and 10 copies for FLU-A, AdV, PIV-1, -2 and -3, RSV, HRV and hCoV-NL63; between 10 and 50 copies for FLU-B and hMPV A; and about 300 copies for hCoV-OC43. These sensitivity values, established by probit analysis on plasmids containing the target region as the insert, were confirmed by participation in the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics External Quality Assurance (QCMD EQA) programmes (Glasgow, UK). From the hMPV QCMD EQA programme MPV.RSV06, we determined that the sensitivity for hMPV B of our test was much lower (>1000 times) than for other respiratory viruses. The amplified products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and UV-visualized after ethidium bromide staining.
