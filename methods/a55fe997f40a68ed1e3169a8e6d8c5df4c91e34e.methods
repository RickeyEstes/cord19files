All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, and informed consent was obtained from all participants for the chart review and to use blood samples to check hepatitis B status. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH), Taiwan, and it was also funded by a grant from CGMH (CMRPG8A0031) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (NMRPG8F0261). Retrospective study. All parturients who delivered between January 2001 and April 2010 at the Department of Obstetrics of CGMH in southern Taiwan were recruited. Serum HBsAg and HBeAg were tested routinely at the prenatal clinic in all parturients at a gestational age between 28 to 32 weeks. Therefore, some of the parturients who delivered in early 2001 may have been tested for HBV at the end of 2000. We retrospectively obtained data including date of birth, nationality, parity, date of delivery, and the results of HBsAg and HBeAg tests during pregnancy from their medical records. In order to compare the HBsAg and HBeAg positive rates over time and according to four different coverage strategies of HB vaccination (before June 1979, from July 1979 to June 1984 (5 years before universal immunization was given to infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers), July 1984 to June 1986, and after July 1986 (when nationwide vaccination was given to all newborns), we performed analysis stratified by age, parity, date of birth, and relevant time periods. Follow-up study. In April 2011, we invited 263 mothers confirmed to be HBeAg-positive during pregnancy from 2001 to 2010 to return to check their hepatitis status. All of the women provided informed consent, and all provided blood samples to measure the level of HBeAg, titer of HBV DNA and genotype of the HBV. HBeAg was analyzed using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (AxSYM, Abbott GmbH & Co. KG, Wiesbaden, Germany), and HBV DNA was detected by real-time PCR (TaqMan HBV analyte-specific reagent, ASR; Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). HBV genotypes were determined using a restriction fragment length polymorphism on the surface gene (between nucleotide positions 256 and 796), which was amplified by PCR using nested primers as described in our previous study 41 . Women negative for HBeAg who were previously HBeAg-positive were defined as having HBeAg clearance 42 . We defined the subjects who were negative HBeAg and an HBV DNA level <2000 IU/ml as the "success" group, and we excluded those who had received antiviral therapy for HB. Statistical analysis. Continuous and categorical data were presented as mean, standard deviation, and percentage. Comparisons between groups and linear trends between variables were analyzed using the chi-square test and chi-square test for trends, respectively. In univariate analysis, Fisher's exact test was also used to examine group differences for categorical variables. Independent factors possibly associated with HBeAg prevalence and clearance were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
