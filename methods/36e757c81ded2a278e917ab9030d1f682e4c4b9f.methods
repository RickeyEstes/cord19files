Hajj 2013/1434H: Due to expansion projects underway in the Holy Mosque at Makkah, the quota for pilgrims from within the KSA and from outside Kingdom was markedly reduced. Still 1,980,249 registered pilgrims performed Hajj in 2013, 37 % less than the previous year. 5 As explained earlier, all of these pilgrims did the mass movement from Mina to Arafat on the second day of Hajj before leaving for Muzdalifa on the same day after sun set. Nimra Hospital, where this study was done is one of the four hospitals situated in Arafat. It has a bed capacity of 90, with an ER and 15 clinics. Arafat has three other relatively bigger hospitals, namely Arafat General, Jabal-ur-Rahma and East Arafat hospitals with bed capacities of 300, 140 and 236 respectively. Nimra Hospital along with other three hospitals, being well equipped and staffed, rendered services throughout the Hajj season. However, the present study is concerned specifically to the Day of Arafat. All patients reporting sick to the Nimra Hospital on the Day of Arafat were included and documented. A detailed Performa was required to be filled by the medical staff. This included details related to patient, his/her illness and disposal. The documents were collected by the Department of Quality and Patient Safety, MOH, Makkah Region and have been analyzed in the study using SPSS version 19.0.
