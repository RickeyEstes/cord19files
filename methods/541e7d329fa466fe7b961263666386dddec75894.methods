We developed a quantitative framework to determine the timing of an EO declaration, which divides the outbreak into three phases: the outbreak phase; the onset-to-outcome delay phase; and the EO declaration phase (Figure 1 ). The outbreak phase encompasses the outbreak trajectory which includes all detected cases up until the time that the EO analysis is about to be conducted. The onset-tooutcome delay phase is the period between the onset of the last detected case to the outcome (recovery or death) of that case. In this phase, there is a risk of undetected cases sustaining transmission beyond the last detected case due to underreporting. Accounting for these potential 'invisible' sources of transmission is important to determine the EO with confidence, irrespective of potential underreporting. The EO declaration phase starts the day after the outcome of the last case. In this phase, the probability of cases arising in the future is calculated for each day until a predefined probability threshold, here fixed at 5%, is reached. .
