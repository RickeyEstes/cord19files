Cell lines, viruses, and plasmid construction. BHK-21 cells (ATCC no. CCL-10), Vero (ATCC no. CCL-81), and 293T cells (ATCC no. CRL-3216) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). BSRT7 cells (kindly provided by Sean Whelan), which stably express T7 RNA polymerase, are clones of BHK-21 cells. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS. ZIKV Cambodian strain (FSS13025) was provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (University of Texas Medical Branch), propagated in Vero cells, and titrated using a standard plaque assay 71 . Plasmids encoding VSV N (pN), P (pP), and L (pL) genes, and an infectious cDNA clone of the viral genome, pVSV1(+), were generous gifts from Gail Wertz 72 . Plasmid pVSV1(+) GxxL, which contains SmaI and XhoI at the G and L gene junction, was kindly provided by Sean Whelan. The full-length envelope (E) gene (from amino acids 1-504) and E truncation mutants [E404 (amino acids 1-404); E414 (amino acid 1-414), and E415 (amino acid 1-415)] lacking the predicted stem-transmembrane domain (TM) were amplified from an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV Cambodian strain (GenBank accession no. MH158236) by high fidelity PCR. These DNA fragments were digested with SmaI and XhoI and cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at the same sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-E404, pVSV(+)-E414, and pVSV(+)-E415. Using the same strategy, the anchor C (signal peptide) with E, E404, E414, and E415 were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at SmaI and XhoI sites resulted in construction of pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-aE404, pVSV (+)-aE414, and pVSV(+)-aE415 respectively. In addition, the anchor Cpremembrane-envelope (prM-E), and anchor C-prM-E truncation mutants (prM-E404, prM-E414, and prM-E415), and anchor C-premembrane-envelopenonstructural protein 1 (prM-E-NS1) genes were cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at SmaI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmids were designated pVSV(+)-prM-E, pVSV(+)-prM-E404, pVSV(+)-prM-E414, pVSV(+)-prM-E,415, and pVSV (+)-prM-E-NS1. Similarly, the anchor C-NS1 gene (amino acids 1-352) was cloned into pVSV(+)GxxL at the SmaI and XhoI sites, and the resultant plasmid was named pVSV(+)-NS1. To further attenuate the VSV vector, we took advantage of a point mutation, G1670A, in the large (L) polymerase protein, which rendered a recombinant virus that is specifically defective in mRNA cap G-N-7, but not 2′-O methylation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, G1670A mutation was introduced into pVSV(+)-E, pVSV(+)-aE, pVSV(+)-prM-E, pVSV(+)-prM-E-NS1, and pVSV(+)-NS1 which resulted in the construction of pVSV(+)-G1670A-E, pVSV (+)-G1670A-aE, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E, pVSV(+)-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, and pVSV(+)-G1670A-NS1 respectively. To prepare DNA vaccine plasmids, the anchor C-prM-E and anchor C-NS1 genes were cloned into pCI vector (Promega) which resulted in the construction of pCI-prM-E and pCI-NS1 respectively. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Recovery of recombinant VSV expressing ZIKV antigens. Recovery of recombinant VSV (rVSV) from the infectious clone was carried out as described previously 72 . Briefly, rVSV was recovered by cotransfection of plasmid encoding VSV genome, and support plasmids encoding VSV nucleocapsid complex (pN, pP, and pL) into BSRT7 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expressing T7 RNA polymerase (kindly provided by Dr. Bernard Moss). At 96 h post-transfection, cell culture fluids were collected and filtered through a 0.2-µm filter, and the recombinant virus was further amplified in BSRT7 cells. Subsequently, the viruses were plaque purified as described previously 72 . Individual plaques were isolated, and seed stocks were amplified in BSRT7 cells. The viral titer was determined by a plaque assay performed in Vero cells. RT-PCR. Viral RNA was extracted from recombinant VSVs by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ZIKV genes were amplified by a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) using primers annealing to VSV G gene at position 4524 (5′-CGAGTTGGTATTTATCTTTGC-3′) and L gene at position 4831 (5′-GTACGTCATGCGCTCATCG-3′) (numbering refers to the complete VSV Indiana genome sequence). The amplified products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Single-cycle growth curves. Confluent BSRT7 cells were infected with individual viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. After 1 h of absorption, the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fresh DMEM (supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum) was added, and the infected cells were incubated at 37°C. Aliquots of the cell culture fluid were removed at the indicated intervals, and virus titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. Analysis of the expression of ZIKV antigens by VSV. Confluent BSRT7 cells were infected with rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens, parental rVSV, or rVSV-G1670A at an MOI of 3.0 as described above. After 3 h post-infection, cells were washed with methionine-and cysteine-free (M -C -) medium and incubated with fresh M -Cmedium supplemented with actinomycin D (15 µg/ml). After 1 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with M -Cmedium supplemented with EasyTag 35S-Express (4 µCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). After 4 h of incubation, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously 70 HEK293T cells were transfected with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or pCI-NS1 using lipofectimine 2000. At the indicated times post-infection, cell culture medium was harvested and clarified at 4500 × g for 15 min and further concentrated at 35,000 × g for 1.5 h. In the meantime, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 5% βmercaptoethanol, 0.01% NP-40, and 2% SDS. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) in a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The blot was probed with rabbit anti-ZIKV E (Cat. No. ZEND20-A, Alpha diagnostic Intl Inc., San Antonio, TX) or NS1 antibody (Cat. No. ZNS111-S, Alpha diagnostic Intl Inc.) at a dilution of 1:2000, followed by horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cat. No. sc-2030, Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:5000. The blot was developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. All original uncropped images of western blot are shown in Supplementary  Figs . 16-23. Production and purification of ZIKV VLPs by a VSV vector. Purification of ZIKV. Ten confluent T150 flasks of Vero cells were infected with ZIKV Cambodian strain at an MOI of 0.01 in a volume of 2 ml of DMEM. After 1 h of absorption, 20 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum) was added, and infected cells were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. When extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, cell culture fluids were harvested for ZIKV purification, which was the same procedure as VLP purification mentioned above. Transmission electron microscopy. Negative-staining electron microscopy of purified VLPs and ZIKV was performed as described previously. Briefly, 20 µl of VLP or ZIKV suspension was fixed in copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc.) and negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate. Virus particles were visualized by using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 80 kV at the Microscopy and Imaging Facility at The Ohio State University. Images were captured on a MegaView III side-mounted charge-coupled-device camera (Soft Imaging System, Lakewood, CO), and figures were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Animal experiments. All mice were housed within ULAR facilities of The Ohio State University under approved Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines (protocol no. 2009A0160). Each inoculation group was separately housed in rodent cages under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Experiment 1: determine whether VSV constructs are immunogenic in BALB/c mice. Sixty 4 to 6-week-old specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were randomly divided into 12 groups (5 mice per group). Mice in group 1 were inoculated with parental rVSV (with no insertion). Mice in groups 2-10 were inoculated with nine different rVSVs expressing ZIKV antigens (rVSV-E404, rVSV-E414, rVSV-E415, rVSV-E, rVSV-prM-E404, rVSV-prM-E414, rVSV-prM-E415, rVSV-prM-E, and rVSV-prM-E-NS1). Mice in group 11 were inoculated with DMEM and served as uninfected controls (the normal control). Mice in group 12 were immunized with DNA vaccine pCI-prM-E. For VSV, each mouse was inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU in a volume of 50 µl. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 µg of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose two weeks later. After inoculation, the animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. The severity of clinical signs associated with VSV infection was scored based on the following criteria: grade 3 (severe) was characterized by ruffled fur, hyperexcitability, tremors, circling, and paralysis; grade 2 (moderate) was characterized by ruffled fur with neurological symptoms such as circling; grade 1 (mild) was characterized by ruffled fur but no neurological symptoms; grade 0 was defined as no symptoms. The body weight of each mouse was monitored every three days. Blood samples were collected from each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized. Experiment 2: determine antibody and T cell immune responses triggered by mtdVSV in BALB/c mice. Thirty 6-week-old SPF female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into six groups (5 mice per group). Mice in group 1 were inoculated with DMEM and served as unimmunized controls (normal control). Mice in groups 2-6 were immunized with rVSV, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, and rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. All mice were immunized intranasally at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. After immunization, the animals were evaluated daily for body weight, mortality, and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. Blood samples were collected from each mouse weekly by bleeding facial vein, and serum was isolated for antibody detection. At week 5 post-inoculation, all mice were euthanized, and whole blood and spleens were isolated from each mouse for a T cell assay. Experiment 3: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice against viremia until day 24 after ZIKV challenge. Seventy 4-week-old SPF BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (10 per group, 5 female and 5 male). Mice in groups 1-5 were immunized with DMEM, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-E, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. Mice in group 6 were immunized with DNA vaccine. Mice in group 7 were served as normal control (immunized with DMEM and unchallenged). For VSV, mice were inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 µg of pCI-prM-E, and boosted with same dose 2 weeks later. After immunization, the presence of any VSV symptom induced by mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated twice a day. At week 5 post-immunization, mice in groups 1-6 were challenged intravenously with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. At 24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered 1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO) blocking antibody. After challenge, the animals were evaluated twice daily for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of ZIKV infection. The body weight for each mouse was monitored daily. At day 24 post-challenge, all mice from each group were euthanized. The blood, brain, lungs, liver, and spleen from each mouse were collected for virus quantification and histologic evaluation. Experiment 4: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine can protect BALB/c mice against viremia until day 7 post-challenge. Mice (6-week-old) in groups 1-5 were immunized with saline, rVSV-G1670A, rVSV-G1670A-aE, rVSV-G1670A-prM-E, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. The mice in group 6 served as a normal control (unimmunized unchallenged). The experimental procedure was identical to Experiment 3 except the mice were euthanized at day 7 after challenge with ZIKV Cambodian strain. Experiment 5: determine whether mtdVSV vaccine and DNA vaccine can protect A129 mice against ZIKV challenge. Thirty five 6-week-old female A129 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were randomly divided into 7 groups (5 per group). Mice in groups 1-3 were immunized intramuscularly with pCI, pCI-prM-E, or pCI-NS1 at a dose of 50 µg DNA per mouse. Two weeks later, mice in groups 1-3 were boosted intramuscularly with the same plasmid at the same dose. Mice in groups 4-6 were administered intramuscularly using a single dose (1 × 10 5 PFU per mouse) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1, rVSV-prM-E-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. Mice in group 7 were served as unvaccinated unchallenged control. After immunization, mice were evaluated every three days for body weight. The safety of mtdVSV-based ZIKV vaccine candidates was evaluated twice a day. Blood samples were collected at week 1 and 3 from each mouse for detection of antibody. At week 4 post-immunization, mice in groups 1-6 were intraperitoneally challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 10 5 PFU per mouse. After challenge, the animals were evaluated twice every day for mortality and the presence of any symptoms of ZIKV infection. The severity of clinical disease was scored based the following criteria: 1 = heathy; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; and 4 = severe, and early removal is required. The body weight for each mouse was monitored daily. Blood was collected at days 3 and 7 for the detection of viremia. At day 7 post-challenge, all mice from each group were euthanized, and brain, lungs, uterus/ovary, and spleen from each mouse were collected for virus quantification and histologic evaluation. Experiment 6: determine whether NS1 alone can protect BALB/c mice against viremia. Twenty five 4-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (5 per group). Mice in groups 1-5 were immunized with DMEM, pCI, pCI-NS1, rVSV-G1670A-NS1, or rVSV-G1670A-prM-E. For VSV, mice were inoculated intranasally at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. For DNA vaccine, mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 µg of plasmid, and boosted with same dose two weeks later. At week 4 post-immunization, mice in groups 2-6 were intravenously challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 10 6 PFU per mouse. At 24 h prior to ZIKV challenge, mice were intraperitoneally administered 1.8 mg of anti-IFNAR1 (Leinco Technologies) blocking antibody. At days 3 and 7 post-challenge, blood was collected from each mouse for detection of viremia by real-time RT-PCR. Experiment 7: validate the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 in A129 mice. There were three groups in this study. Mice in group 1 were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose (1 × 10 5 PFU per mouse) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1. Mice in groups 2 and 3 were served as unimmunized challenged control and normal control (unimmunized unchallenged). Blood was collected from each mouse weekly for antibody detection. At week 4, mice in groups 1 and 2 were intraperitoneally challenged with ZIKV Cambodian strain at a dose of 1 × 10 5 PFU per mouse. After challenge, mice were monitored for body weight changes and viremia every 1 or 3 days for 21 days. Detection of ZIKV E or NS1-specific antibody by ELISA. Ninety-six-well plates were first coated with 50 µl of highly purified ZIKV E or NS1 protein (MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA) (4 µg/ml, in 50 mM Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.6) per well at 4°C overnight, and then blocked with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, 1% W/V in PBS, 100 µl/well) at 37°C for 2 h. Subsequently, individual serum samples were tested for ZIKV-specific Ab on antigen-coated plates. Briefly, serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted and added to E or NS1 protein-coated wells. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the plates were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-Tween (0.05%), followed by incubation with 50 µl of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Abs (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h. Plates were washed, developed with 100 µl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), stopped by 100 µl of H 2 SO 4 (2 mol/L), and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined by BioTek microplate reader. Endpoint titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had an absorbance value 2.1-folds greater than the background level (DMEM control). Ab titers were calculated by the geometric mean titers (GMT). Detection of ZIKV neutralizing Ab. ZIKV-specific neutralizing Ab was determined using a microneutralization (MN) assay as described with modifications 17 . Briefly, serum samples were serially diluted twofold in 96-well micro-plates, and 100 μl of virus solution containing 50 PFU of ZIKV-Cambodian strain was added to 100 μl of each serum dilution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The mixtures were then transferred to 24-well plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers. After incubation for 60 h at 37°C, cells were fixed with 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. After permeation by 0.4% (vol/vol) Triton-X 100 at room temperature for 20 min and washed for three times, a ZIKV E monoclonal antibody (MyBioSource, Inc.) was added to each well at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated at 37°C for 2 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:2000 was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS for three times. The plates were then developed with 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate for 1 h at room temperature and stained plaques in each well were counted under light microscope. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of neutralizing antibody in mice serum was calculated based on the number of plaques in each well compared with the average value of DMEM group. Analysis of ZIKV-specific T cell responses. To determine the nature of T cell responses that supported the development of ZIKV-specific Ab responses by rVSV expressing ZIKV antigens, we analyzed cytokine production by ZIKV E-specific spleen T cells. More specifically, spleen cells were aseptically removed from mice 35 days after immunization, and minced by pressing through a cell strainer. Red blood cells were removed by incubation in 0.84 % ammonium chloride and, following a series of washes in RPMI 1640, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. The cell concentrations were adjusted to 3 × 10 6 cells/mL and 100 µl were added into each well (3 wells per spleen sample) of a 96-well microtiter plate and cultured either alone or in the presence of 20 µg/ml of ZIKV E protein for 5 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Culture supernatants were collected from each well and frozen at −80°C until analysis of secreted cytokines using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine Standard 23-Plex, Group I (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) per manufacturer's instructions. The frequencies of ZIKV-specific Th1 (IFN-α + CD4 + CD3 + and TNF-β + CD4 + CD3 + ), Th2 cells (IL-4 + CD4 + CD3 + , IL-5 + CD4 + CD3 + ), Th17 (IL-17A + CD4 + CD3 + ), and Tfh (IL-21 + CD4 + CD3 + ) cells were determined by intracellular staining with the corresponding anti-cytokine Abs (at a dilution of 1:5000) after additional incubation in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. Cytokine-specific antibodies including Alexa Fluor Measurement of viral burden. At indicated time points after ZIKV challenge, blood was collected and organs were recovered. Organs were weighed and homogenized using a bead-beater apparatus (MagNA Lyser, Roche). The total RNA was extracted from tissue samples and blood by using TRIzol Reagent (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription (RT) was conducted using a primer (5′-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATTGA-3′) targeting the capsid (C) gene of ZIKV and the Superscript III transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The RT products were then used to perform real-time PCR using primers specifically targeting the E gene of ZIKV (forward, 5′-CATCAGGATGGTCT TGGCGATTCTAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCGTCTCTTCTTCTCCTTCCTAGCATT GA-3′) in a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve was generated using a serial dilution of ZIKV RNA extracted from known PFU titer of infectious virus. Amplification cycles used were 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. The threshold for detection of fluorescence above the background was set within the exponential phase of the amplification curves. For each assay, 10-fold dilutions of standard viral RNA were generated, and negative-control samples and double-distilled water (ddH 2 O) were included in each assay. Viral burden is expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per gram or per milliliter. Similarly, total RNA from brain tissues was used for quantification of VSV RNA using primers annealing to the VSV L gene and shown as RNA copies per gram, using a plasmid encoding VSV genome as a standard curve. Histology. Half of the tissues (brain, lung, uterus/ovary, and spleen) from each experiment were preserved in 4% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for the examination of histological changes by light microscopy. The pathologist was blinded to each group. Quantitative and statistical analyses. Quantitative analysis was performed either by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs or by using a phosphorimager (Typhoon; GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). All experiments were three replicates. No animals or samples were excluded from the analysis. Data were collected and assessed blindly for each group allocation during the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way multiple comparisons using SPSS 8.0 statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A P value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
