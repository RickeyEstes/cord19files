A cross-sectional study was conducted among resident doctors who were working in MOH and university teaching hospitals in Jordan during the period September 2017 to January 2018. The 4 main MOH hospitals out of 32 hospitals and 2 teaching hospitals that have residency programs were selected. All residents in the selected hospitals from all specialties including emergency medicine, internal medicine, pediatric, and family medicine were visited by the researcher and invited to participate in this study. A self-administered paper-based questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic and practice-related characteristics of physicians and included 11 (yes or no) questions, 9 multiple-choice questions, and 21 case scenarios to assess their knowledge of surveillance and reporting practices. Their knowledge and awareness of surveillance was assessed by specific questions with a multiple-choice format. They were asked about the purpose of surveillance, sources of public health surveillance data, characteristics of surveillance data, and physician's role in public health surveillance. In another section of the questionnaire, the physicians were presented with 21 selected conditions and were asked whether they report that condition immediately or weekly or don't report it. The list of conditions was obtained from the MOH, and the case definition of all events in the questionnaire was set according to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Guide, Jordan, MOH, 2015. Questions in the questionnaire varied between cases that should be reported immediately and those that were reported weekly and which should not be reported. Moreover, they were asked about the barriers of not reporting mandatory diseases. The content validity of the questionnaire was assessed by 3 experts in the area. The questionnaire was pilot tested among 50 physicians who were not included in the study sample and was revised accordingly. Data were described using percentages and means (SD). The differences between the proportions were compared using chi-square test. Data were analyzed using IPM-SPSS version 23. A P value of less than .05 was considered as statistically significant.
