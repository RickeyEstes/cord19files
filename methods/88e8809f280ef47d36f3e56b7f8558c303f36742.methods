The response to the upsurge in cases of MERS-CoV required the formation of a task force that would take on a six-pronged approach to meeting the needs of faculty, students and staff. The following plan was enacted: 1. Establishing a helpline to inform anxious nursing students their families about risk and offer support; 2. Developing policies to direct the response to the infection, emergency planning, attendance/absence and return to work; 3. Providing additional resources (WHO correct hand washing diagrams) to highlight the need for frequent hand washing and hand sanitization; 4. Initiating information sessions offered to all faculty, nursing students and support staff (these were mandatory). Key information was made available on the WHO website which highlighted epidemiological data and infection control information; 5. Administering pre and post questionnaires to the Faculty, students and support staff about their current knowledge and feelings about the virus, with a follow up email with further information; and 6. Displaying visual imagery from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health in prominent places. The mandate of the Task Force was to meet the educational and emotional needs of the faculty, students and staff at the College of Nursing. This was initiated in response to concerns brought to the senior faculty by people inside and outside the university. The Task Force decided to offer mandatory information sessions for all faculty and staff, using information that had been confirmed from the published literature and reputable national and international websites. Task force members consisted of two senior faculty (one from the UK-JH and the other from Canada, BVS) and two junior Saudi faculty members. The two senior faculty had experience in controlling respiratory infectious disease outbreaks in the past. Two administration staff members were called on to translate information into Arabic and provide oral translation during the sessions. The questionnaires were back-translated into English to ensure accuracy. The senior faculty members completed the literature search, highlighted and summarized information from the KSA Ministry of Health website and documents, and prepared all of the learning materials. They organized the training sessions, drafted the policies for approval by the College Council, and communicated with Faculty and staff. Communication was made with the Interns and the Hospital Nurse Educators (through the Internship Unit) and communication with parents and concerned students was done through the Student Services Department. Due to the urgency of the situation and the senior faculty's desire to be responsive, the pre and post questionnaire was developed by the Task Force. The purpose was to capture existing knowledge and any changes of current behaviour (pre-test) and in the post questionnaire acquired knowledge and intended changes in their behaviour. Questions were written by the committee to capture the participants' awareness of the most important facts, identify gaps in the participants' knowledge and to guide the follow-up activities. Table 2 outlines the different content provided to each group of participants. The main messages that the MERS-CoV task force at the Princess Nourah University wanted to get across was the following: Take the epidemic seriously, but do not be afraid Use only accurate information to guide your practice from reputable sources Share that accurate information with your family and community Follow hospital and university infection control policies and protocol Stay home if you are sick Use droplet precautions with all patients of suspected MERS-CoV or any respiratory illness, and to use airborne precautions when you are involved in any treatment or activity that aerosolizes the virus. The Student Services department fielded all calls and concerns, responding to student and family emotional and information needs regarding exposure to the virus in clinical settings. During the information sessions, students and staff were reminded of their role as health educators and the need to continually update themselves with information from credible sources (especially the World Health Organization and the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health), and inform their family and community as needed. Another important aspect of infection control during an epidemic is the movement of large groups of people between areas of high concentration of infected people to areas of high concentration of susceptible and uninfected people. Movement between hospitals serving MERS-CoV patients and the universities therefore should be limited. Where a respiratory virus outbreak in hospital occurs, hospital services may be under increased pressure and the risk of infection to the general community is greater. Therefore a rapid and effective containment of hospital staff including students should be a priority [8] . It was decided while the cases in the city were disseminated over all of the hospitals, to remove our students for the last week of clinical work and bring them back to the clinical skills lab for more practice with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and infection control procedures. Since then, the Ministry of Health has concentrated the confirmed cases of MERS-CoV into designated hospitals. When students returned to clinical practice in the Fall, they worked in all hospitals, except those designated for MERS-CoV and not with patients who are confirmed or probable cases of MERS-CoV. Intern students are in their final year of study and do not go back and forth between the hospital and the university. They stay within one hospital for a year, working in different departments. It was decided that the Interns should continue their training at the hospitals. Contact was made with each hospital to establish what protection was being provided (PPE) and also what training was being offered to the Intern students. The Interns were invited to attended a workshop to inform them on the latest clinical advice and to remind them of infection control precautions. Students were able to discuss their concerns and were advised appropriately. Additional resources were provided with constant reminders to students and staff to increase hand sanitization and hand washing. Additional materials for the clinical labs were purchased to ensure correct infection control measures would be taught. The Task Force sought research ethics approval from the College of Nursing the Ethics Committee and developed informed consent procedures and forms. Participants completed informed consent forms (which were in both Arabic and English) and the voluntary nature of the study was explained. Prior to start of the session, a pre-test questionnaire was given to all attendees. Information about their existing knowledge was asked, if they had experienced MERS-CoV in the hospital setting and some information about how they were prepared within the clinical setting. During the sessions, students and faculty were presented by means of a lecture on what the virus is, how it spreads and how to protect themselves in the hospital setting, the university setting and the hospital. Information was clearly presented about who the virus is affecting, the location and spread of the virus and confirmed data. The aim was to increase clarity about what we do know and what we do not know in order to minimize the risk of inaccurate information being spread. The lecture was supported by visual images and messages on PowerPoint slides, as well as a question and answer period. It is vitally important that nursing students understand under which conditions the virus might aerosolize in the hospital setting. During certain clinical activities and treatments, the virus might aerosolize, thereby becoming spread by the airborne route, rather than the droplet method. Past studies looking at the SARS CoV showed that healthcare workers are more at risk of becoming infected with that coronavirus while participating in certain nursing procedures [9] . For example, the pooled odds ratio for risk of transmission for healthcare workers exposed to suction before intubation is 3.5 (0.5, 24.6). Healthcare workers exposed to tracheal intubation had a 6.6 OR pooled (4.1-10.6). For the support staff working at the College of Nursing, another information session was developed, with a lecture and PowerPoint slides translated into the Arabic language. The focus of these sessions was on understanding what the virus was and how to protect themselves in the university environment and the community. The Task Force created a handout for the students with relevant information developed from the literature. This handout was created in the English language. The students learn all subjects in English, so they have at least a basic understanding of the English language. An Arabic version of the handout was also developed for support staff members (administration, security etc.) who might have limited ability to understand English. In order to understand baseline knowledge of students and staff, questionnaires were distributed before each session. The questionnaires were voluntary. All people who participated in the questionnaires signed or acknowledged informed consent as per the College of Nursing's Ethics approval policy. All questionnaires were written in English for students and faculty. The support staff completed questionnaires in the Arabic language. Following each session, students and staff were given follow-up questionnaires to establish what was learned through the information sessions. All participants were also asked what educational needs still needed to be addressed. A follow-up e-mail to all staff, students and faculty was prepared to address those further information needs. Another job of the Task Force was to ensure that all resources from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health were being utilized to their fullest. These included making sure that posters were prominently displayed in both Arabic and English, and ensuring that videos made by the Ministry of Health were played for all of the students to hear. Faculty were encouraged to emphasize the use of Ministry of Health MERS-CoV telephone hotlines. Clinical staff reinforced hand washing procedures and drew attention to the newly installed hand sanitizer dispensers. Infection control methods for respiratory virus are well studied in the scientific literature [10, 11] .
