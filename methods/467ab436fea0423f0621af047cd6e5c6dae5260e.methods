Cells. Fcwf-4 (felis catus whole fetus-4) cell line was purchased from ATCC and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. U937 cell line was purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. All the culture reagents were purchased from Gibco. Viruses, plaque assays, and quantitative RT-PCR. The serotype II FIPV strains NTU156 49 and NTU204 isolated at National Taiwan University were used in this study. The viruses were propagated and titrated in fcwf-4 cells. The titrated viral stocks were stored in −80 °C. For plaque assays, fcwf-4 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 2 × 10 5 cells/well one day prior to experiment. Right before experiment, media were removed and cells were washed. Virus-containing samples were ten-fold serially diluted with media, and 500 μl of the diluted samples were added to cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 hr, media were again removed and cells were washed. 1 mL of DMEM containing 1.8% methylcellulose (Sigma) and 2% FBS was added to each well. After 3 days, the plates were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 1% crystal violet at room temperature for 10 min. Upon drying, the viral plaques were counted, and the plaque-forming unit (PFU) per ml of virus was determined. For FIPV infection in U937 cells, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for virus quantification. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted using a viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). cDNA was synthesized using a previously described P1b primer, and qPCR was performed using the primer set P009 and P010, and the fluorescence probe P9/10 50 . The cycling protocol in a thermal cycler (Biorad CFX Connect) consisted of 3 min of preheating at 95 °C, and followed by 35 cycles of 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of primer annealing and extension at 60 °C. 2 μL of plasmid DNA containing various copy numbers of membrane-nucleocapsid protein gene of FIPV was used for standard curve construction in qRT-PCR for viral load quantification. Two replicates were performed for each samples or standards. Diphyllin and diphyllin-encapsulated nanoparticles. Diphyllin (ChemDiv, San Diego, CA) and bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). For nanoparticle preparation, diphyllin was dissolved in chloroform at 1 mg/ml with 20 mg/mL of PEG-PLGA (Sigma). 1 mL of the solvent mixture was added to 5 mL of deionized water and probe sonicated for 1 min and 45 sec. The resulting emulsion was then placed in a fume hood for chloroform evaporation for 3 hr. For the vehicle control, empty PEG-PLGA nanoparticle was prepared in the absence of diphyllin. Particles were washed for 3 times using the Amicon Ultra 15 mL Centrifugal Filters (100k MWCO; Millipore) at 2000 × g for 4 min. Nanoparticle size distribution was measured by DLS (Malvern Instruments Inc., UK) based on the manufacturer's instructions. The washed particles were then resuspended in 10% sucrose and stored at −80 °C.
