Faecal samples were :obtained during a 9-month period, October .to May, from 20 successive cases of gastroenteritis admitted to one ward of the Children's Hospital, Sunderland. The ages of the children ranged from 2 weeks to 5 years. Samples from patients with gastroenteritis were screened for the absence o f bacterial pathogens before virological examination, and control samples were obtained from patients hospitalized .for reasons other than suspected infection, for example, treatment for hernia or circumcision. Specimens w e r e coded by a third party, transported from hospital t o laboratory in ice, and were stored for not more than 48 h r at 4 Â°C before processing. Where .they were obtainable, samples from members of the patient's family we're obtained as soon as confirmation was made that the original infection was viral in origin. 0038--3506/78/060285 + 06 $01:00/0 (~-) I 978 The .Society of Community Medicine
