The dual-probe CPV-2 qPCR assay consisted of a tandem simple-MGB probes, amplifying a 340 bp-long amplicon with the forward primer and first probe according to Streck end colleagues 30 , and the reverse primer and the second probe according to Decaro end colleagues 31 . The thermo-profile started at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min, with a signal acquisition in the FAM channel. The dual-probe EAV RT-qPCR assay delimited a 399 bp-long region 32 and included a pair of simple probes 32,33 in opposite orientation. The thermo-profile started with reverse transcription of 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 30 s, with a signal acquisition in the FAM channel at the end of the annealing/extension step. The primers and the probe sequences for the CPV-2 and EAV assays are listed in Supplementary Information 3, Table 3 .1. All of the reactions were run in triplicates on a CFX 96 (BioRad) thermal cycler. The Cq values were estimated by analysing the data as a single pool, using the automatic threshold and baseline cycle option of the CFX Manager Software v3.1. The reactions of interest were subjected to electrophoretic analysis by using ethidium bromide-containing 2% agarose gel in a TAE buffer and 10 V/cm. Sequence Analysis. The amplicons of interest were purified by using a High Pure PCR Purification Kit (Roche). Sequencing reactions were prepared using a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 and evaluated on 3130 or 3500 Genetic Analysers (all from Life Technologies). The sequences were aligned manually. The graphical alignment was generated in a BioEdit sequence alignment editor 34 . Scientific RepoRts | 7:41392 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41392 Evaluation of Reaction Parameters of Dual-probe TaqMan qPCR Assay. Dilution and calibration curves were constructed on the basis of a 10-fold dilution gradient of the synthetic DNA standard, covering a quantitative range of six magnitudes (from 1e2 to 1e7 NA standard copies per μ l of template) in triplicates including three non-template controls. To evaluate the effect of the second probe on the TaqMan reaction, each individual run was set up in three subsets. The first subset represented the dual-probe reaction (0.2 μ M of each probe), while the second and third ones contained the corresponding single probes (0.2 μ M) in separate reactions. For each subset, the efficiency E, slope k, and the equation and R 2 values of the calibration curve regression line were determined. To infer the comparability of the two probe assays with the single-probe counterparts, the Δ Cq slope approach was used 35 . First, the Δ Cq between the dual-probe and corresponding single-probe reactions was calculated according to the formula: Δ Cq = Cq(dual-probe) -Cq(simple-probe), and plotted against the logarithm of the template concentration. Then, the slopes of the resulting straight lines were compared between the reactions. If the slope values were < 0.1, the reaction efficiencies were comparable. Evaluation of Reaction Fluorescence of Dual-probe TaqMan qPCR Assay. The relative fluorescence unit (RFU) values of the amplification curves gathered in the FAM channel were compared between the subsets. We defined two parameters: the d(RFU) and the steepness k. The d(RFU) represents the fluorescence value at a specific point of the sigmoidal trajectory, which corresponds with its first derivative maximum. The steepness was defined as the slope of the linear regression line driven along the exponential region of the amplification curve. The exponential region was determined from those RFU data points that provided the highest correlation (R 2 > 0.995) of the regression line. Repeatability and Reproducibility of Dual-probe TaqMan qPCR Assay. The repeatability or intra-assay variation of the two probe TaqMan assays was estimated from the mean Cq and standard deviation (SD) values obtained from three dilutions of the NA standard, 1e2, 1e4, and 1e6 copies per μ l of template in three replicates in a single run. The reproducibility, i.e. inter-assay variation of the two probe TaqMan assays was inferred from three independent runs of the above three NA standard dilutions prepared by three distinct operators and run on three different CFX 96 instruments. Then, the mean Cq, SD, and relative standard deviation as a percentage (%RSD, also known as the coefficient of variation) were calculated. Sensitivity of Dual-probe TaqMan qPCR Assay. The relative sensitivity of the dual-probe TaqMan qPCR assays was tested on six opposite probe and three tandem-probe assays by using various NA standard dilutions to reach Cq values ≥ 30. The particular Δ Cq values between the corresponding dual-probe and single-probe assays were estimated according to the above formula and compared.
