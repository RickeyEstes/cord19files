The studies were done with unrestrained, freely moving, male, Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River. Supply Co. Inc., NY). Animals recovered in a bedded Plexiglas chamber (dimensions 12" x 12"~ 18"). Animals were treated with physiological saline (body weight in cc/kg i.p.) immediately after surgery. . . In Vivo Electra-(Microvm: The methods for the manufacture of the three in vivo electrochemical microelectrodes are published by this laboratory (Broderick, 1989) . A review of the historical and technical aspects of the field of in vivo electrochemistry is cited (Broderick, 1990) . The ability to distinguish between DA and NE, by in vivo microvoltammetry has been published (Broderick, 1988) . In viva electrochemical current was measured in picoamperes (pA) as a function of the semidifferentiation of time in seconds. Current was directly proportional to the concentration of each neurotransmitter according to the Cottrell Equation, which equates concentration of molecules oxidized with the amplitude of the oxidation peak which denotes electrochemical current. Logarithmic regression analysis indicated that the lowest detection limits for NE and 5-HT in vitro, approached 6 nmoles and 3 mnoles, respectively in the first preconcentration step (Broderick, 1989; Broderick, 1993; Broderick, 1997) . The current produced by the oxidation of NE within CA, region of hippocampus was detected in lo-15 seconds whereas that produced by 5-HT was detected in lo-12 seconds in each in vivo microvoltammetric scan. NE release and S-HT release, at each data point, represented a measurement in pA of NE and S-HT current within CA, region of hippocampus. Current for NE and 5-HT, was detected within the same synaptic environment. In vivo microvoltammetric (semidifferential) studies on freely moving and behaving Sprague Dawley rats were begun approximately 18 to 21 days after the aseptic surgical procedures were performed. On each experimental day, an animal was placed in a faradaic, Plexiglas chamber (dimensions: 24"~ 18"~ 23.5"). The three microelectrode assembly, enclosed within the animal's prosthetic acrylic cap, was connected to a CV37 detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN) by means of a mercury commutator (Br. Res. Instr., Princeton, NJ), a flexible cable, and a mating connector (BJM Electronics, Staten Island, NY). The CV37 was electrically connected to a Minigard surge-suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY) , which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. In vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and for 5-HT release within CA, region of hippocampus in the freely moving and behaving animal were detected every five minutes; each five minute period included a two minute cell deposition time. Stable in vivo electrochemical signals for NE release and 5-HT release were evident before either adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, 2 mg/kg ip., second hour) or diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p., first hour, 3 mg/kg i.p., second hour) was administered. Adinazolam (Pharmacia and Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) or diazepam (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in doubly distilled water; solutions were made fresh on the day of each study. The behavioral chamber was novel to each animal, although each animal was habituated before either adinazolam or diazepam was injected, i.p. The behavioral chamber was equipped with side-by-side double doors (dimensions 15.75" x 23.5") to enable a facile injection procedure. A series of infrared photobeams was encased in aluminum frames around the chamber's perimeter. When activated with an IBM computerized circuit, the infrared photobeams detected the animal's position in the behavioral chamber on an x-y axes positional basis. Thus, multiple concurrent measures of the animal's activity were simultaneously assayed. The specific activities of each animal assayed were: (1.) Ambulations (running-forward locomotion interacting with the maintenance of a horizontal position of the head without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ), (2.) Rearing (maxima1 upward vertical movement of the head, without lateral turning (Teitelbaum et al., 1990) ). Ambulatory behavior is called anti-agoraphobic (anti-thigmotactic) behavior; the behavior indicates a reduced fear on the part of the animal (Geyer, 1990) ]. Mesolimbic 5-HT release has been shown to be closely temporally allied with natural open-field movement (Broderick and Phelix, 1997) . The status of the infrared photobeams was sampled every 100 msec. Our system is a modified version of an Activity statistically analyzed, using the same statistical tests, described above. Behavioral results are expressed as frequency of events. Each animal was used as its own control. Statistics revealed the most dramatic differences between adinazolam and diazepam in the directional response occurred with the monoamine, 5-HT. Therefore, 5-HT results are presented first. and 5-HT. Figure 1 shows the effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an additional 2 mg/kg i.p., second hour) on synaptic concentrations of 5-HT within the CA, region of hippocampus of the freely moving and behaving, male, Sprague Dawley rat. Adinazolam significantly increased the in vivo electrochemical signal for 5-HT (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks: p<O.OOOl, H=19.9, d+2 (N=4) (unequal variance)). Post hoc analysis further showed that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the second hour of study (Dunn's Method: pcO.05, q=4.06 (second hr.)). Serotonin release was increased to 115% over baseline (baseline=lOO%) within 10 minutes and was maximally increased to 209% above baseline within 90 minutes after adinazolam administration. Further post hoc analysis, which delineated one-half hour effects of adinazolam on 5-HT release in hippocampus, showed that each of the four one-half hour effects was statistically increased over Adlnazolam Figure 2 shows the effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an Behavioral chamber was novel to each animal; animals were habituated before adinazolam injection. and Frewcv of Central m Figure 6 shows the concurrent effect of adinazolam (10 mg/kg i.p., first hour, and an additional 2 mg/kg i.p., second hour) on the frequency of Central Ambulations (anti-agoraphobia) in each animal in which 5-HT release and NE release were detected on line, with in vivo microvoltammetry, and in which Ambulations, Rearing, and Fine Movement frequencies were monitored concurrently. Adinazolam increased and subsequently decreased the frequency of Central Ambulations; this biphasic effect was statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks, pcO.0197, H = 11.7, df=4 (N=4) (unequal variance)). Although an increase in the Central Ambulatory behavior occurred in the first half-hour, the Dunn's Method "q" value was 2.0069 (p>O.O5). Adinazolam began to exhibit anti-agoraphobia behavior ten minutes after injection, at which time, the increased response was approximately three-fold higher than the mean baseline for the Central Ambulatory response. Photobeam interruptions, which denote anti-agoraphobic behavior, are increased Ambulations (locomotor activity) into the center of the faradaic, behavioral am and Fremv of AX&&&XL Figure 9 shows the effect of diazepam (lmglkg i.p., first hour, and an additional 3 mg/kg Lp., second hour) on the frequency ( Post hoc analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in both hours Ambulations remained below baseline values throughout the two hour period of study. Diazenam and Frequencv of Rearinas, Figure 10 shows pcO.05, q=2.52 (first hour and q=3.24 (second hour)). No statistically significant difference occurred between the two dose effects (Dunn's Method: p>O.O5, q=l.Ol). Therefore, the effects of diazepam on Rearing behavior were not dose dependent at the doses studied. It is noteworthy that the initial effect, i.e. the first four time points after diazepam injection were similar to baseline values, but the standard errors were correspondingly high; the unusual response effect of one animal contributed to this effect. m and Frequency of Fine Moveme& Figure 11 shows the effect of diazepam (lmgikg i.p., first hour, and an additional 3 mgikg i.p., second hour) on the frequency (number) of Fine Movements in each animal in which 5-HT release and NE release were detected, on-fine, with in vivo microvoltammetry, and in which ambulatory and rearing activity patterns were monitored concurrently, Each data point represents the mean +/-SE of natural Fine Movement behavior (N=5) followed by mean +/-SE of changes in Fine Movement behavior produced by diazepam (N=5; same animal control). Behavioral chamber was novel to each animal; animals were habituated before diazepam injection. analysis revealed that the statistically significant decrease occurred at the 3 mgikg dose of diazepam (Dunn's Method: ~~0.05, q=2.90). There was no statistically significant difference in effects between the first hour dose (1 mg/kg) and the second dose (3 mgikg) (D unn's Method: ~~0.05, q=1.90). The initial Fine Movement response to diazepam, at the 1 mgikg dose. occurred similarly to the Rearing response to diazepam at the 1 mgikg dose of diazepam. It was again, the unusual response of one animal which contributed to this behavioral effect; it was, in fact, the same animal who had provided the unusual Rearing response. q=2.481). Since increased Ambulations in the center of the chamber has been associated with a fear reduction response [anxiety reducing (anxiolytic) effect] of a drug (Geyer, 1990) , it is noteworthy that diazepam produced a marked sedation which masked its anxiolytic properties in this Central Ambulatory paradigm.
