To eliminate possible confounding effects due to yearly changes in total attendances, total costs, and mean cost per patient between 2002 and 2003, the mean yearly change in total ED attendance was calculated based on a rate of increase In the ED, patients were categorized into nontrauma, trauma, pediatric (age < 15 years), and others ( Figure 2 ). As patients in the first three categories comprised approximately 97.4% of patient visits among total ED attendances, and there was no significant variation between the "others" category and the three main categories, the others category was not displayed in the graphical analysis for convenience. During the epidemic, all categories of patients decreased to their lowest levels in May, with a maximum mean decrease of 40.8% in non-trauma patients (Figure 2A ; 95% CI of mean difference, 35.5-46.0%; p < 0.01), 57.6% in trauma patients ( Figure 2B ; 95% CI of mean difference, 48.3-67.0%; p < 0.01), and 80.0% in pediatric patients ( Figure 2C ; 95% CI of mean difference, 64.2-95.9%; p < 0.01). The proportion of non-trauma patients increased during the early epidemic period ( Figure 2D ) in comparison with those in 2002. The World Health Organization officially removed Taiwan from the list of SARS epidemic countries on July 5. 7 The number of trauma visits returned to pre-epidemic levels in July ( Figure 2B ). To reduce interobserver bias in validating the triage categories (2002-2003), we compared individual percentages of four triage categories monthly by using one-way ANOVA with Scheffe's post hoc test. No significant differences were found in the percentages of patients in the individual triage categories except in May 2003, at the peak of the SARS epidemic, when the percentage of triage patients was significantly higher than in the other months (p < 0.05). The percentage of patients in all of the triage categories significantly decreased during the epidemic, with a maximum mean percentage decrease in triage 1 patients ( Figure 3A ) of 18.1% (95% CI of mean difference, 5.6-31.0%; p < 0.01), triage 2 patients ( Figure 3B ) of 55.9% (95% CI of mean difference, 49.6-62.3%; p < 0.01), and triage 3 patients ( Figure 3C ) of 53.7% (95% CI of mean difference, 44.8-62.5%; p < 0.01). The percentage of patients categorized to triage 4 was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.7-1.9%), and this category was not included in the figures due to the lack of a significant change and for convenience in presentation. At the peak of the epidemic in May, the proportion of triage 1 patients increased by a mean of 96.4% ( Figure 3D ; 95% CI of mean difference, 62.6-130.2%; p < 0.01). As shown in Figure 4A , daily total expenditures for total visits decreased significantly, with a maximum mean decrease of 37.7% (95% CI of mean difference, 30.2-45.3%; p < 0.01) in May, and returned to levels similar to pre-epidemic ones in July. The mean costs for each patient increased from March to August, with a maximum mean increase of 35.9% (95% CI of the mean difference, 26.3-45.5%; p < 0.01) in June ( Figure 4B ). The mean cost of each admission ( Figure 4C ) and discharge ( Figure 4D ) were higher than in 2002. The mean costs of each admission ( Figure 4C ) showed a maximum mean increase of 35.5% (95% CI of mean difference, 25.5-45.5%; p < 0.01) and corresponded to similar increases in the mean cost per patient ( Figure 4B ) during the epidemic period. During the epidemic, there were increased laboratory costs of 31.4% ( Figure 5A ; 95% CI, 16.3-46.5%; p < 0.01), increased radiography costs of Figure 5B ; 95% CI, 12.2-31.6%; p < 0.01), increased costs of ancillary procedures of 20.4% ( Figure 5C ; 95% CI, 9.5-31.2%; p < 0.01), and increased costs of prescription medications of 29.5% ( Figure 5D ; 95% CI, 19.1-40.0%; p < 0.01).
