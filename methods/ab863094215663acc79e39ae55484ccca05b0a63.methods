Cell culture. Three populations of cultured human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines were used. Enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and parental, mainly undifferentiated HT-29 cells, referred to as HT-29 Std, were obtained from Dr. Jorgen Fogh (Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, Rye, N, USA) [20] . The pluripotent HT-29 Std cell line grown under various metabolic stress conditions is able, after an initial phase of mortality, to undergo growth adaptation to these conditions [62] . This growth adaptation is followed by the emergence of differentiated populations of either absorptive or mucus-secreting cells. Differentiated HT-29 cells, obtained by selection through glucose deprivation [5 l l , maintain their differentiation characteristics when switched back to standard glucose-containing medium, and are referred to as HT-29 glc-'+. Caco-2 cells spontaneously differentiate in culture under standard conditions, i.e., in a standard glucose-containing medium [50] . Cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM; 25 mM glucose; Eurobio, Paris, France), supplemented with 10% (HT-29 Std, HT-29 glc-I+) or 20% (Caco-2) inactivated (30 min, 56" C) fetal calf serum (Boehringer, Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany) and 1 % nonessential amino acids (Caco-2). For adhesion assay, monolayers of Caco-2 cells and HT-29 subpopulations were prepared on glass coverslips which were placed in six-well Corning tissue culture plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY, USA). Cells were seeded at a concentration of los (HT-29) and 7 . 4~1 0~ (Caco-2) cells per cm2. For maintenance purposes, cells were passaged weekly using 0.25% trypsin in Ca2+Mgz+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.53 mM EDTA. Maintenance of the cells and all experiments were carried out at 37" C in a 10% CO2/9O% air atmosphere. The culture medium was changed daily. Cells were used between 2 0 4 0 (HT29) and 60-90 (Caco-2) cell passages. Differentiated cells were used for adherence assays at late post-confluence, i.e., after 15 days (Caco-2) and 20 days (HT-29) in culture. Caco-2 cells were used at confluence (5 days, undifferentiated cells), at post-confluence (7 days, when differentiation commences, and 10 days, when differentiation develops), and at late post-confluence (15 days, when differentiated is complete). INT407 cells (human embryonic intestine; ATCC CCL 6) were from stock culture of the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids and 10% inactivated (30 min, 56" C) fetal calf serum (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) at 37" C in a 5% C0,/90% air atmosphere. Cells were used for adherence assays at confluence, i.e., after 4 days. Human intestinal T,, cells (7) were routinely grown in DMEM (50%) and Ham's F12 medium (50%) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 50mM HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids and 10% inactivated (30 min, 56" C) fetal calf serum (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) at 37" C in a 5% C0,/90% air atmosphere. Cells were seeded at 3x1OS cells per cm2. Cells were used for adherence assays at late post-confluence, i.e., after 10 days. Determination of cell-associated and cell-invaded bacteria. Before the adhesion assay, the cultured intestinal cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The adherence of EPEC strain to cultured cells was examined as described previously for enterotoxigenic E. coli [5] . To quantify cell-associated bacteria (adhering+invading bacteria), I4C metabolically radiolabelled bacteria were used [30] . Bacteria were suspended in the culture medium and a total of 1 ml (10, CFU cells/ml) of this suspension was added to each well of the tissue culture plates. Incubations were conducted with 1 % D-mannose, which inhibits type 1 pili-mediated adhesion. The plates were incubated at 37" C in 10% c0,/90% air for 180 min. The monolayers were then washed three times with sterile PBS. Cell-associated bacteria and cultured cells were dissolved in a 0.1 N NaOH solution. The level of bacterial adhesion was evaluated by liquid scintillation counting. Bacterial internalization was determined by quantitative determination of bacteria located within the cells using unlabelled bacteria and an aminoglycoside antibiotic [3] . Bacteria were suspended in the culture medium and 2 ml (108 CFU/ml) of this suspension was added to each well of the tissue culture plate. The plates were incubated at 37" C in 10% C0,/90% air, for 180 min. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with sterile PBS and afterwards incubated for 60 min in a medium containing 100 pg per ml gentamicin. Extracellular bacteria are rapidly killed by this method whereas those located within the cells are not. The monolayer was washed three times with PBS and lysed with sterile H,O. Appropriate dilutions were plated to determine the number of viable intracellular bacteria. Each assay was conducted in triplicate with three successive passages of cultured cells. The number of circumscribed EPEC clusters over the cell surface of cultured intestinal cells was determined. After incubation, the monolayers were washed five times with sterile PBS, fixed with methanol, stained with the Gram stain, and examined microscopically under oil immersion. Each adhesion assay was conducted in duplicate with cells from three successive passages. For each glass coverslip monolayer, the number of EPEC clusters was counted in 20 random microscopic areas. Indirect immunofluorescence. The state of Caco-2 cell differentiation was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining of the cells with antibody directed against the brush-border-associated marker sucrase-isomaltase (SI) [55] . Cell layers were prepared after cells were grown on glass coverslips, and monolayers were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on unpermeabilized Caco-2 cell layers. Immunoreactivity of SI was detected using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against sucrase-isomaltase purified from Caco-2 cells, obtained from Dr. Alain Zweibaum (INSERM U 178, Villejuif, France). Anti-rabbit fluorescein-coupled goat antiglobulins were from Institut Pasteur Productions (Paris, France). Cell monolayers were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-sucrase-isomaltase (diluted 1:200 in PBS) for 45 min at room temperature, washed, and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G. Immunolabeling was examined using a Leitz Aristoplan microscope with epifluorescence. All photographs were taken on Kodak T-MAX 400 black and white film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY, USA).
