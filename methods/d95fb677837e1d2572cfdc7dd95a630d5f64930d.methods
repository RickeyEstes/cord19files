To evaluate the quality of the articles that were included in the review, the authors adopted one of the strategies proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) , which was to consider authenticity, informational value, representativeness of sources, and methodological quality of each document that was included in the review. To analyze and synthesize the data from these diverse sources, the authors reviewed all papers, wrote annotated summaries of each paper, and then developed a system for classifying the articles, displaying the data, comparing the themes that emerged from each paper, and drawing inferences and conclusions, using the methods proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) . The review is organized according to the main themes that emerged from analysis of the papers: historical development of global health diplomacy, definition and components of global health diplomacy, challenges in global health diplomacy, and preparation of global health diplomats. The review concludes with the authors' recommendations and implications for nursing practice, education, and research.
