Participants were drawn from a cross-sectional survey in 2000 that revealed high infection prevalence (ranging from 3% to 73%) in 20 villages distributed in the hilly terrain of Sichuan Province in Southwest China where irrigated agriculture for the cultivation of rice, wheat, corn and tobacco is the primary source of S. japonicum infection [23] . As part of the survey, all residents aged 4 to 60 years in 20 villages Xichang County, Sichuan Province, China were invited to be tested for S. japonicum infection and to answer a brief questionnaire. We used a random number generator to select approximately 30% of the population, stratified by village and occupation, for ultrasound examination. Ten villages with high infection prevalence in 2000 were selected to be followed longitudinally using infection surveys and ultrasound examinations over the next five years. Participants in our cohort included individuals who had an ultrasound examination in 2000 and lived in one of the ten villages followed through 2005.
