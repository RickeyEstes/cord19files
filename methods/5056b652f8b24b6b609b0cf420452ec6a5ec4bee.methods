The Taiwan Longitudinal National Health Insurance Research Dataset 2005 is a very large (one million), random, and anonymous sample of the Taiwanese population in 2005. It includes information on all medical visits and diagnoses from 2000, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). From this dataset, we followed 128 651 children from birth to their fifth birthday or December 2005, whichever was earliest. All outpatient and emergency visits with a primary diagnosis of acute respiratory infection (ICD-9 460-466), acute intestinal infection (001-009), and herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) (074.0, 074.3) were identified, and the incidences of these three infectious diagnoses were estimated for each year-month throughout the follow-up period (January 2000 to December 2005). Only the first visit in each month was counted. All incidence estimates were adjusted for sex, age, or region, as appropriate, to the distribution as of January 2002. For all analyses we compared three broad geographic regions along the west coast: northern (from Keelung to Miaoli), central (Taichung, Changhua, and Nantou), and southern (from Yunlin to Pingtung) Taiwan. Objectives: Information on seasonal synchrony of influenza activity between neighbouring regions has been found useful for planning infection control measures. Seasonal synchrony of other infectious diseases is less known. We describe the seasonality and seasonal synchrony of three common childhood infectious diagnoses among three regions in Taiwan. As indicators of an annual cyclic pattern, i.e., seasonality, we used intra-class correlations (ICCs) to describe year-on-year consistency in monthly incidences by introducing month of the year as a random-effect term and year as a fixed-effect term in a multilevel mixed-effect linear regression model using STATA 13.0 (command mixed and estat icc). To estimate between-region seasonal synchrony in diseases with different patterns of seasonal trends, ICCs were also used to describe between-region consistency in incidence estimates across all year-month strata by introducing year-month as a random-effect term and region as a fixed-effect term.
