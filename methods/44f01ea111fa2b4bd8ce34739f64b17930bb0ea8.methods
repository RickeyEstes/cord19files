Census and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [17] together with field collected data was used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were represented and persons allocated to them according to age category, so connecting households and hubs. Using transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model and data extracted. These captured the day-to-day infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity. Census and country-wide data from the PNG National Statistics Office [27] together with data collected in a field survey in Madang were used to construct the Madang model. Following the methodology used to construct the Albany model, each household is explicitly represented, with occupants in one of 7 age categories. Schools, workplace and other mixing hubs were also explicitly represented. Individuals were allocated to these mixing hubs according to their age category, so connecting households and hubs as shown in Figure 1 . Using virus intrinsic transmission characteristics calibrated with the Australian model, simulations were performed using the Madang model. These simulations captured the day-to-day susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/immune infection profile of the population following introduction of a novel strain of influenza into the modelled community, assuming no existing immunity.

[28] Madang Demographics Madang model development used the most recent census data from 2001, other PNG government data and additional data collected in our field survey. [17] Census data provided the location groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census and each individual is uniquely identified in the model. From July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on the number of people working in smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of schools and colleges, the human resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal These data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to workplaces and schools, as with the Albany model [10] .
