The infection study was conducted on 7 healthy parasite-free piglets obtained from a local herd at 3 days of age. Piglets were housed in individual stainless-steel cages and fed a mixture of pasteurized cow's milk and enriched white bread at a AM, 12 noon, and 5 PM daily. Park, Ill.). Recordings were made with the low-frequency cutoff at 5.3 Hz and the high-frequency cutoff at 100 Hz. Recordings commenced at 9 AM daily, 1 h after the morning meal and lasted for 7 h; piglets were fed in the recording box at 12 noon. Four to six preinfection (control) recordings were made from each piglet. At 8 PM on the evening of the fifth or sixth postoperative day, the piglets were infected with a l-ml oral dose (12 x 10" plaque-forming units] of a 0.1% bacteria-free gut suspension obtained from TGE-infected piglets (OARDC pool [M-61, S-2, AB, 10117179). Postinfection recordings were continued in a similar manner to the preinfection studies, beginning at a AM the next morning and continuing for the next 3 days. Records were kept of the response to infection, specifically noting attitude, appetite, and any vomiting or diarrhea. At the end of the third day the piglets were killed by an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbi-tal. The small intestine was immediately removed and sections of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were fixed for histologic examination. In addition to the control recordings in fed piglets, five or six daily recordings were made from each of 4 separate but similarly prepared piglets after an overnight fast of 17 h. In a separate study, each of these animals was also given an identical oral dose of ether inactivated viral preparation. Each recording was analyzed visually to assess (a) slow wave frequency; (b) frequency (periodicity), duration, and conduction velocity of phase 3 (the activity front) of the migrating motility complex (MMC), (c) the duration of phase 1 and phase 2 of the MMC, (d) the percentage of abnormal (nonconducted) phase 3 activity, and (e) the frequency and propagation velocity of short, rapidly aborally propagated migrating bursts of intense spike activity, henceforth referred to as MAPCs. To facilitate analysis, patterns of spike activity were coded for each study using a modification of the technique described by Code and Marlett (6). For this, the number of slow waves with associated spike activity was converted to a percentage and coded to give a histogram of spike activity for each electrode and minute of recording. Phase 1 of the MMC was defined as a period 2 min or longer in which slow waves had no associated spike activity; phase 2 was defined as any period in which slow waves were associated with irregular or random spike activity. Phase 3 (the activity front) was defined as a distinct period 2 min or longer when all slow waves were associated with intense spike activity that appeared sequentially over adjacent electrodes. The duration (periodicity) of each cycle of the MMC was determined as the time from the end of one activity front to the end of the next. Data from each piglet and electrode were pooled, and relationships between fed control, fasted control, and infected periods were evaluated by Duncan's multiple range test using the SAS user's guide for 1982 (7). All results were expressed as the mean + SEM and were considered significantly different if p < 0.05.
