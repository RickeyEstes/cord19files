Chest radiography to detect pneumonia, culture of a pharyngeal swab for assessment of bacterial pathogens, and blood chemistry were performed by a technician in all patients on admission, and a second blood chemistry was performed on the second hospital day. Patients were admitted on consecutive days. Those who were admitted on an even day received an IV drip infusion of 40 mL of glycyrrhizin (0.2%) and 500 mL of lactated Ringer's solution daily during hospitalization (glycyrrhizin group). Patients who were admitted on an odd day received an IV drip infusion of 500 mL/d of lactated Ringer's solution without glycyrrhizin during hospitalization (control group). The infusions were prepared in the hospital pharmacy and were labeled identically to maintain blinding. Patients also were treated with PL ® (Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) 3 g/d by mouth 13 (1 g of PL contains salicylate amide 270 mg, acetaminophen 150 mg, caffeine 60 mg, and promethazine methylene disalicylate 13.5 mg) and/or dextromethorphan hydrobromide 45 mg and povidone-iodine to disinfect the oral cavity 14 until URTI signs and symptoms subsided. A suppository of diclofenac sodium 50 mg was provided if the patient's body temperature exceeded 38.5°C. All study medications were administered by a nurse. The treating physician changed the medication regimen to include PL, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, loxoprofen sodium, mefenamic acid, diclofenac sodium, tipepidine hybenzate, and/or ibuprofen as needed during the study. Patients were discharged when body temperature (as measured 4 times a day by a nurse) was <36.9°C and signs and symptoms improved sufficiently to allow the return to military duty. The primary end point was tolerability, and the secondary end points included improvement of signs and symptoms of URTIs and cost.
