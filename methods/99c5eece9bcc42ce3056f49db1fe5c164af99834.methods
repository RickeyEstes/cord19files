A questionnaire was designed to address the capacity, quality, operational specifics (guidelines and algorithms), technical and interpretation issues and other possible difficulties related to ZIKV diagnostics. National reference laboratories for ZIKV diagnostics were asked to complete the online questionnaire through the 30 EU/EEA ECDC National Focal Points for Microbiology (NMFPs) [15] . The questionnaire was sent to the NMFPs on 4 May 2016 and closed on 23 May 2016. As most questions in the questionnaire where not obligatory to answer, the sums in the presented data may vary as non-replies are not listed.
