Ethics statement: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Dentistry, KAUH. Administrative approvals were taken and a written consent was taken from each accepted participant. A cross-sectional design was conducted at the dental clinics of KAUH, during 2014. The study enrolled adult patients aged 18-60 years of both genders, who attended the dental clinics at the day of the interview and accepted to participate. The exclusion criteria included patients with severe illnesses and patients with mental diseases. A non-probability convenience sample method was used. The sample size was calculated according the established formula for calculation from a cross-sectional study [14] . The minimum calculated sample size was 267 participants. A validated, confidential interviewing questionnaire was used. The face and content validity of the questionnaire was assessed by 2 experts. The internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach's ␣ and was found to be 0.84. The questionnaire contained 50 questions asked about: Personal and socio-demographic data: as age, sex, education, etc. Source of knowledge: about infection and infection control in dentistry. Knowledge about dental cross-infection and infection control in dentistry: Knowledge was assessed by asking twelve Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs); as an easy method for assessing patients' factual knowledge, understanding and interpretation [15] . The questions asked about infections that can be transmitted through dental practice; as HIV/AIDS, HBV, HCV, TB, MERS-CoV (modes of transmission, availability of vaccine if any, and infection control measures to prevent transmission in dentistry, etc.). Patients' attitudes towards the required measures for prevention of cross-infection during dental care: attitudes were determined through patient's response to seven statements on a three-point Likert scale. These statements inquired about participants' opinions regarding the importance of dentists wearing gloves, face mask and eye goggles (glasses) during dental practice. In addition, they were asked about their perceptions regarding the importance of replacing gloves after treating each patient, and after receiving phone calls, etc. Participants were inquired also about their opinions regarding protective measures and cross-infection during dental practice Patients' self reported practices: participants were asked nine questions about their self-reported practices in some suggested situations. These situations as accepting receiving dental care from a dentist who is not immunized against HBV, or from dentist who treated other infected patients with HIV, HBV or HCV, or treated by a dentist who has HIV. In addition, they were inquired about their self-reported practice supposing that they catch infection(s) after visiting dental care. Participants were also asked about dentist's practice regarding asking them about having any infectious disease. Statistical methods: Data were analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). For each knowledge question, a score of ''1'' was given for the correct answer and ''0'' for the incorrect or unknown answers. A total knowledge score was calculated and it ranged from 0 to 12. It was then classified into three tertiles: • Poor score: <50% of the correct answers (<6/12 questions) • Fair score: 50% -two-thirds of the correct answers (6-8/12 questions) • Satisfactory score: >two-thirds of the correct answers (>8/12 questions). • Descriptive and inferential statistics were done. Chi-square test was conducted to determine the associations between the categorical variables. All p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
