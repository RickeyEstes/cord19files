Study population. We recruited a community cohort and inpatients from TTSH between April 2012 and December 2013. The community cohort was recruited by contacting community-dwelling adults who participated in pre-existing prospective cohort studies conducted by the National University of Singapore (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Consenting individuals were then enrolled through home visits, where we also opportunistically recruited other members of the household, including children. At enrolment, participants contributed demographic and health information through a baseline interview at enrolment, and then followed-up for up to 1.5 years, with instructions to notify the study team within 24 hours on developing ARI symptoms (community-ARI). Once notified, research staff would obtain nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom data from the participant on the next working day. For inpatients, on each working day, we would screen through the list of adults admitted to TTSH within the last 72hrs who had undergone routine diagnostic testing (by SRT-PCR) for influenza. We then enrolled and collected nasopharyngeal swabs from consenting inpatients fulfilling the same ARI criteria (inpatient-ARI) used for the community cohort. To better characterise influenza, we intentionally oversampled influenza to obtain a ratio of approximately 1 influenza positive to 2 influenza negative patients. Additional swabs were taken on days 3 to 5 and days 7 to 9 post-onset (community-ARI) or post-enrolment (inpatient-ARI) for influenza positive episodes where possible. In addition, we retrieved historical influenza data from a prospective study of admissions to TTSH testing positive for influenza between May 2009 and September 2009 (historical-FLU). This included ARI patients with medical indications who were admitted alongside ARI cases referred to TTSH for public health indications (clinically suspected to have influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 based on epidemiological risk factors like travel and contact history). Ethics approvals were obtained from NUS Institutional Review Board and the National Healthcare Group (Singapore) Domain Specific Review Board, in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. A written informed consent was signed by each study participant. Laboratory analysis. Three assays were performed. SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR assays were conducted at the NPHL on all available samples while PathChip assays were performed at GIS using RT-PCR negative samples. SRT-PCR. This assay was only used to detect influenza virus types A and B at a higher sensitivity than might be achieved using multiplexed PCR assays, and to further subtype influenza A positive samples. The protocols had been adopted from the studies by Spackman et al. 28 and Krafft et al. 29 and, respectively, with cycle threshold (Ct) values documented for positive samples (samples with a Ct value less than 40 were considered as positive). Influenza A positive specimens were then subtyped with subtype specific primers and probes that targeted at haemagglutinin (HA) gene of A(H3N2)3, and HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of A(H1N1)pdm09 30 PathChip. This assay was used to detect additional viruses beyond what was covered by the primers within the MRT-PCR panel used. For each sample, the cDNA was amplified from extracted nucleic acid. The novel platform from the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) then automatically detects which pathogens' recognition signatures are present, based on a proprietary algorithm constructed based on genetic sequences of viruses clinically relevant to humans (downloaded from the NCBI Taxonomy data-base, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/ taxonomyhome.html/) 18 To evaluate how the GIS-PathChip might add to detection above routinely available MRT-PCR assays, viruses were grouped into panel viruses (i.e. virus group represented in SeeGene RV12), non-panel viruses for which ARI is a common presentation 19 and non-ARI viruses.
