Chemotoxicoinformatic Analysis: Properties calculations and data visualization was determined using the freely available software DataWarrior-Cheminformatics Program for Data Visualization and Analysis [81] . For chemical clustering and heatmap calculations and visualization, we used ChemMine tools, which is an online service for analyzing and clustering small molecules. Numerical data clustering was performed accordingly to Euclidian distance between column z-scores for calculated properties, based on a single linkage method and numerical data (properties based on JoeLib descriptors). Target search of compounds: A chemoinformatic analysis of possible targets was performed on SwissTarget prediction online server [82] , (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ accessed on 01.03.15).
