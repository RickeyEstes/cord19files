The data we use in this paper come from the Hartford, CT component of the larger study using the first two of seven research methods from a 5year qualitative and quantitative study of communication and negotiation about barrier contraceptive use for STD and pregnancy prevention among low income, inner city African American and Puerto Rican self-identified heterosexual young adults (age 18-25) in Hartford and Philadelphia. The major goal of this project is to understand strategies and patterns of communication and negotiation surrounding condom and other barrier contraceptive use in these sexually active at-risk populations. The study weaves together a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus group discussions, systematic cultural assessment techniques (Bernard, 2001) , in-depth individual sexual and romantic life history interviews, sexual behavior diaries, scenario drama discussions, and structured interviews staged over 4 years of data collection (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . The aim of this design is to collect a variety of data that will be triangulated to yield a detailed and contextualized understanding of sexual and romantic relationships in light of social and cultural factors, and to use these data to inform the development of targeted risk-reduction strategies. Participants for all methods are recruited through street outreach at two kinds of venues: general street settings and specialized activity sites. The first of these includes places with heavy pedestrian traffic in areas identified through prior research. The latter refers to the local community college, adult education centers, youth and young adult programs, and park and recreation sites. To recruit participants, project outreach workers approach individuals who appear to meet inclusion criteria and engage them in conversation about the goals of the project, screen for inclusion criteria, and invite participation. In this paper, we use data from the first two methods: focus group discussions (FGDs) and indepth, individual sexual and romantic life histories (SRIs). These two methods elicited data on the socio-cultural context of relationships, the local terms used by participants in discussing sexual and romantic relationships and sexual behavior (FGDs), and the natural history of sexual and romantic relationships (SRIs). Participants in the FGDs were allowed to participate in the SRIs, as the former method collected group-level and the latter collected individual-level data. Eight percent of SRI participants were also FGD participants. While we will report some difference across gender, for the issues of concern to this analysis ethnicity did not appear to be a significant factor. The FGDs included free listing and ranking of salient terms and a guided discussion surrounding six domains of interest: (1) types of sexual and romantic relationships; (2) types of sexual behavior and understandings/thoughts/ideas about monogamy and abstinence; (3) understanding of birth control methods, condoms, and safer sex; (4) factors considered when contemplating initiation of a new sexual relationship; (5) the physical and emotional risks of involvement in heterosexual relationships; and (6) the socio-cultural and economic factors that affect sexual and reproductive behavior. In Hartford, eight FGDs were convened with African American and Puerto Rican males and females (i.e., two groups within each ethnic/gender group of interest). A total of 61 people participated in the eight, 5-6 h FGDs. Unusually long FGDs were used as a means of gathering rich data that would assist in the development of subsequent methods such as the SRIs. Participants received $60 for their time. 1 The SRIs were open-ended interviews with 60 individuals at each site (i.e., 15 each African America and Puerto Rican males and females). Interviewers used a written guide to elicit a detailed history of each respondent's self-determined most important romantic and sexual relationships. The goal was not to obtain data about contraceptive use/risk reduction strategies in the past, but rather to understand the range of sexual and romantic relationships that are meaningful to inner city young adults and the patterning of entry into and exiting relationships over time as well as a general sense of risk prevention behaviors. The SRI interviews lasted about 2 h and participants were paid $30. In many ways, the in-depth, personal SRI interviews provided a counterpoint to the FGDs in that they elicited information about relationships (from purely sexual to committed) and their personal, emotional meaning to the participant. While the FGDs provided a ''universe'' of relationship types and sexual behaviors in which participants engage, as well as what they think about and how they decide about potential relationships, the SRIs provided knowledge of what is important with respect to feelings and emotional attachment in relationships at the individual level. Together, these methods provide an emic or insider view of sexual and romantic relationships. Each participant also completed a form that collected basic demographic information. Table 1 provides the sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants for the focus groups and sexual and romantic history interviews in Hartford. The research protocol for all methods in the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at the CDC, the University of Connecticut, the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford, and the Family Planning Council of Philadelphia. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Participants in the two samples were quite similar across all of the characteristics reported in Table 1 . The mean age of participants was just slightly over 20 years. While a majority of the individuals in both groups had graduated from high school, a sizeable percent in each group (40%) had dropped out of high school or earlier. While very few of the
