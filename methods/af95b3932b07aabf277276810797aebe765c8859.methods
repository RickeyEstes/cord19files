We chose a study area extent, occurrence data, and environmental variables, following the previous publication 20 , but excluding the Piedmont area in Italy, as those occurrences were not made available (Fig. 4) . Occurrences were resampled to one occurrence point per grid cell at 2.5′ resolution. The area across which models are calibrated affects performance of ecological niche models based on correlative algorithms requiring background data or pseudo-absence data for calibration 34 . Thus, for a replicate experiment our M was based on previous evaluations for the Americas and Europe 20 : we included the area from Central America (Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador) and the Greater Antilles (Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti) north to northern Canada and Alaska; in Europe, we focused on Ireland and the United Kingdom. Occurrence points for both native and invasive populations were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (http://www.gbif.org), Mammal Networked Information System (http://manisnet.org/), and the online specimen databases of the American Museum of Natural History (http://www.amnh.org/) and U.S. National Museum of Natural History (http://www.mnh.si.edu/). We removed duplicates and included 1754 occurrences falling within the native geographic range 46 Considering that our aim was to compare two modeling approaches, as environmental information we used the same data layers as in the original article 20 : WorldClim climate data at 2.5′ resolution 47 , including mean temperature of the wettest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. These data were checked for nonlinear relationships and converted to principal components 27 , and environments on each continent were extracted to establish overlap with respect to the first three components (Supplementary material S1), which jointly explained 97% of the variance in the data. Components 1, 2, and 3 were displayed and analyzed using NicheA version 3.0, an open-access software platform that allows design, exploration, and analysis of geographic and environmental spaces simultaneously 48 . We also identified areas with non-analogous environmental conditions using three methods. First, we used NicheA to identify environmental combinations shared between the two continents. NicheA generates two convex-polyhedrons each around the range of climatic conditions in the native and invaded range respectively, and then determines the similar environments in the form of conditions overlapping between both polyhedrons; overlapping environments were projected from environmental space to geographic space to determine the study area and subsets of occurrences to be used to establish presence or absence of niche shifts. Secondly, we used the Mobility-Oriented Parity (MOP) metric that measures environmental similarity between native and invaded areas 28 . MOP estimates Euclidean distances between the native and invaded ranges in multivariate environmental spaces; MOP then identifies and excludes the values outside of the environmental range of the calibration region. The similarity values of MOP are comparable to the distances estimated by the multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS), but the latter measures distances to the centroid, rather than the near edge, of the reference environmental background 49 . Finally, we employed ExDet to identify similar or novel environments between native and invaded area 50 . ExDet measures Mahalanobis distances between environmental conditions in the native and invaded areas and identifies areas presenting conditions outside the univariate range of values in the other area (i.e., novelty Type 1). ExDet also identifies the most influential environmental variables leading to non-analogous environments between the areas compared 50 . We used NicheA to assess niche similarity via the Jaccard index 51 in analogous and non-analogous multidimensional environments based on components 1, 2, and 3 [ref. 48] . We also used ENMTools 1.4.3 [ref. 12] to develop background similarity tests of niche similarities in geographic dimensions. We measured the D similarity index to compare similarity between Maxent models generated using occurrences available from the native range (North America) against occurrences in the invaded range (i.e., British Islands), restricted to occurrences falling in analogous environments between European and American accessible areas. This analysis was also done across the entire (original) areas as in Di Febbraro et al. 20 . We compared observed similarity between the invasive population and the native range against a null distribution generated from comparisons of the invasive population and occurrence points placed at random within the native population in analogous environments 12 . Specific features in ENMTools were use of binary outputs from minimum-training presence, 100 replicates to build the null distribution, α = 5%, and sample sizes for background points matching available numbers of points, using the principal components (see above) to summarize environments. Additionally, we used ecospat 29 to evaluate niche similarity in environmental dimensions, using the first two principal components from the original environmental variables, occurrences from native and invaded ranges with analogous environments, and identifying the 50% and 100% of environmental conditions available in each range.
