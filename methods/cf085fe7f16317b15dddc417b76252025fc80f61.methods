Isolation and production of monoclonal antibodies from PAP patients. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from five PAP patients with high levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies. Determination of the serum level of GM-CSF autoantibodies was performed in the Laboratory of the Rare Lung Disease Consortium at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, as described 17, 37 . Briefly, ELISA plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc) were coated with 1 mg ml À 1 of recombinant human GM-CSF (Miltenyi Biotec), blocked with blocking solution Stabilcoat (Surmodics, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) and incubated with titrated sera (1/101, 1/3,001, 1/6,001 and 1/12,001), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG F(ab 0 )2 fragment. Plates were then washed, substrate (tetramethylbenzidine; T4444, Sigma-Aldrich) was added followed by 1 N H 2 SO 4 and the plates were read at 450 nm. Serum concentration of GM-CSF autoantibodies was determined from a GM-CSF-autoantibody polyclonal reference standard by quadratic regression analysis using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Seattle, WA, USA). The Disease Severity Score, a combination of presence and ARTICLE absence of symptoms and degree of PaO2, was determined according to the classification previously described 38 . Memory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved or fresh PBMCs using anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following staining of PBMCs with CD22-FITC (BD Phamingen), and were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus and CpG in multiple wells as described previously 19 . Culture supernatants were tested for binding to recombinant human GM-CSF (Gentaur, 04-RHUGM-CSF) using ELISA. cDNA was synthesized from positive cultures and both heavy chain and light chain variable regions were sequenced. All monoclonal antibodies were produced recombinantly as IgG1 by transient transfection of HEK 293 Freestyle Cells (Invitrogen) using polyethylenimine, and tested for binding to GM-CSF using ELISA. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Ethics Committee of IRCCS San Matteo Hospital Foundation of Pavia, Italy. All patients gave informed consent. Sequence analysis of antibodies and reversion to germline. The usage of VH and VL genes and the amount of somatic mutations were determined by analysing the homology of VH and VL sequences of mAbs to known human V, D and J genes by the IMGT database 20 . Sequences of UCA were determined by reverting mutations to the germline sequence while retaining the original CDR3 junctions and terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase N nucleotides. UCA sequences in which putative mutations of the HCDR3 were not removed were also determined. VH UCA, VH UCA (HCDR3 WT) and VL UCA nucleotide sequences were synthesized by Genscript, and their accuracies were confirmed by sequencing. Four different versions of seven selected mAbs were produced recombinantly: UCA, UCA-HCDR3 WT, and shuffled mAbs either with VH UCA þ wild-type VL or with wild-type VH þ VL UCA. Antibody purification and ELISA assays. Human mAbs and total IgG from PAP sera were purified by protein A or protein G chromatography (GE Healthcare). Total IgG from healthy donors were purified using the HiTrap Protein A HP columns (GE Healthcare) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra filter units (100 K, Millipore). Total GM-CSF antibodies were affinity-purified from PAP sera using magnetic beads (Invitrogen) conjugated with human GM-CSF. Total IgGs were quantified using ELISA plates coated with anti-human IgG (SouthernBiotech) using Certified Reference Material 470 (ERMs-DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as standard. Binding to GM-CSF was tested by ELISA using 384-well SpectraPlates (PerkinElmer) for primary screenings or 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) for any following test. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with 1 mg ml À 1 of recombinant human GM-CSF (Gentaur), blocked with 1% BSA and incubated with titrated antibodies, followed by AP-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibodies (SouthernBiotech). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm. EC50 (ng ml À 1 ) was calculated for every sample by nonlinear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism 5 software. Size-exclusion HPLC. Three non-cross-competing mAbs were diluted in PBS singularly or as a three-antibody-combination (10 mg of total antibody amount) and were mixed with GM-CSF (1:1 or 10:1 molar ratios) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Samples were analysed with the Agilent 1100 HPLC machine using TSK-GEL G3000SW columns (Tosoh, bed volume: 13 ml, void volume: 4.6 ml) with PBS as the mobile phase (flow rate: 1 ml min À 1 ). A universal solvent 2-mm filter (Agilent) was put between injector and column. Detection was performed using a Variable Wavelength Detector (Agilent) with ultraviolet absorption at 220 nm. TF-1 proliferation bioassays. TF-1 cells (Cell Lines Service) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% GlutaMAX, 1% Penicillin/Streptavidin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (all from GIBCO), 5 ng ml À 1 human GM-CSF (Gentaur) and 10 ng ml À 1 human IL-3 (ImmunoTools). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . A GM-CSF neutralization assay was performed by serially diluting mAbs (or a combination of mAbs, total IgG or affinity-purified antibodies) in growth medium with neither GM-CSF nor IL-3, adding GM-CSF at a concentration of 100 pg ml À 1 , and preincubating in 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plates (Costar) at 37°C for 1 h. TF-1 cells were washed five times, diluted in the growth medium with neither GM-CSF nor IL-3, and 10,000 cells per well were seeded (final GM-CSF concentration equal to 50 pg ml À 1 ). In other tests, GM-CSF was used at the final concentration of 500 and 5,000 pg ml À 1 , and 1,000 cells per well were seeded. Cells with or without GM-CSF in absence of antibodies were used as control to determine maximum and minimum levels of cell proliferation. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 for 72 h, and cell proliferation was measured after 6-h incubation with 0.2 mCi per well of [3H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer). GM-CSF neutralization was calculated as percentage of inhibition of TF-1 growth with the following formula: [1 À (CCPM of a single well À average CCPM of control cells grown without GM-CSF) Â (average CCPM of control cells grown with GM-CSF À average CCPM of control cells grown without GM-CSF) À 1 ] Â 100 (CCPM ¼ corrected counts per minute). IC90 (mg ml À 1 ) was calculated for every sample by a nonlinear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism 5 software. In some experiments mouse sera were titrated in TF-1 growth medium and preincubated at 37°C for 30 min. TF-1 cells were washed and seeded (1,000 cells per well). A titration of GM-CSF (60,000-0.3 ng ml À 1 ) was added as growth control. CCPM of each single well were plotted against the serum titration. In vivo clearance of GM-CSF immune complexes. BALB/C mice were supplied by The Jackson Laboratory, USA; Harlan, Italy; Charles River, Germany, Italy. Animal experiments were approved by the Cantonal Autorithies of Cantone Ticino. Groups of 6-to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with 100 mg of purified mAbs or 2 mg of total IgG purified from PA96 patient. After 16 h, 2 mg of human GM-CSF were injected. Serum samples were collected on day 1 and day 5. GM-CSF was quantified with a sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 10 mg ml À 1 of an antibody that bound to site II of GM-CSF was used to coat 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc), which were then blocked with PBS þ 10% FBS (Gibco). All sera and GM-CSF, which was used as standard (range 3.4-600,000 pg ml À 1 ), were titrated and tested in parallel under different conditions: in one plate all samples were supplemented with 25% (vol/vol) of an alkaline dissociation buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 2 M ethanolamine, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 11.6), in the other plate all samples were supplemented with 25% (vol/vol) of PBS þ 10% FBS. Plates were left overnight at RT. Detection of captured GM-CSF was made with 1 mg ml À 1 of a biotinylated antibody that bound to site I of GM-CSF for 1 h at RT, followed by binding of 0.5 mg ml À 1 streptavidin-AP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at RT. Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm. Binding of GM-CSF immune complexes to FccR. Four TZM-bl cell lines (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) each transfected with a specific Fcg receptor (FcgRI, FcgRIIa, FcgRIIb or FcgRIIIa) were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.025 M Hepes, 10 mg ml À 1 Gentamicin and 20 mg ml À 1 Blasticidin. Untransfected TZM-bl cells were used as negative control and were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 2% Penicillin/Streptavidin. Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Expression of specific FcgRs was assessed by staining TZM-bl cells with FITC-conjugated anti-CD64 (anti-FcgRI), anti-CD32 (anti-FcgRIIa and anti-FcgRIIb) and anti-CD16 (anti-FcgRIIIa) antibodies (all from BD Pharmingen). Untransfected and transfected TZM-bl cells were washed with staining buffer (PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM EDTA) and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well. A single anti-GM-CSF mAb (GCA21) or a combination of three noncross-competing mAbs (GCA21, GCA7 and GCB59) at a final concentration of 2.5 mg ml À 1 were mixed with 0.05 mg ml À 1 GM-CSF, or staining buffer (PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM EDTA). The LALA versions of all antibodies and a mAb with a different specificity were included as controls. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min to allow the formation of immune complexes and then cooled down to 4°C before adding them to TZM-bl cells for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with anti-human IgG Fcg fragment specific F(ab 0 ) 2 fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Samples were analysed on BD FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and the median intensity fluorescence was analysed and compared between samples.
