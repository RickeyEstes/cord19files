Expression and Purification of MERS-CoV PLpro-Ubl2 and PLpro-ΔUbl2. The genes encoding was incorporated at the C-terminal end (before residue C320) of PLpro-Δ Ubl2 by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting pEV-L8-PLpro-Δ Ubl2 (Fig. 1b) plasmid DNA was subjected to DNA sequencing using the Purdue Genomics Core Facility to confirm that the correct construct was generated. Two liters of Super Broth media 9 was inoculated with 10 ml of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with either pEV-L8-PLpro-Ubl2 or pEV-L8-PLpro-Δ Ubl2. After centrifugation (6,750 g, 4 °C, 20 minutes), the harvested cells (16-18 g) were frozen at − 80 °C. On the day of purification, the frozen cell pellets were thawed and then resuspended in 74 ml buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10 mM BME, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 μ g/ml DNase I. The resuspended cells were lysed on ice by sonication using a Branson Digital Sonifier (70% amplitude; 15 minutes, 10 s pulses, 10 s delays). The lysed cell debris was then removed by centrifugation (27,200 g, 4 °C , 60 minutes). The clarified lysate was then loaded onto a 5 ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-charged with Ni 2+ and equilibrated with 3% buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole, 10 mM BME, and 5% glycerol). After washing unbound proteins with 5 column volumes (25 mL) of 3% buffer B, PLpro was eluted with a 110 ml linear gradient (3% to 100%) of buffer B at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The His 8 -tag was then removed by addition of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (1 mg TEV: 6 mg PLpro). After incubating for 4 hours at 25 °C and then 4 °C overnight, the enzyme was passed over the same HiTrap column and the unbound, untagged PLpro was collected in the flow-through. Untagged PLpro was then concentrated to 2-5 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultrafiltration Centrifugal device (10 kDa MW cutoff) while buffer exchanging into S75 buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol). The final purified protein (Fig. 1c) was flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen in 100 μ l aliquots and stored at − 80 °C. week. Crystals were harvested using pins with nylon loops, transferred briefly to a cryo-protectant solution containing reservoir solution that was supplemented with 20% glycerol and then immediately flash-cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Crystals were placed into SPINE pucks for transport to the Advanced Photon Source Synchrotron (APS), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). X-ray data were collected on crystals using beamline 21-ID-F at the Life Sciences-Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT).
