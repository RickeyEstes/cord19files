Dynamical systems Framework. Here we present a mathematical framework for the study of the delay system (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 20 . Time delay implies that this system is infinite-dimensional, i.e. its state can be described by the history function, where the variables S, I, E, Q, R are prescribed on an interval of the length σ + τ + κ of maximal time delay. More specifically, let   σ τ κ = − − − C : ([ ,0], ) 5 be the Banach space of  5 -valued continuous functions with the sup-norm. Given an initial function φ ∈ , the solution  φ ∈ x t ( , ) 5 , t ≥ 0, to the initial value problem exists and is unique 20 . Using the notation www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The conservation of mass property, namely S′(t) + E′(t) + I′(t) + Q′(t) + R′(t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0, implies that if φ = (φ S , φ E , φ I , φ Q , φ R ) and x(t; φ) = (S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t)), then S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + Q(t) + R(t) = φ S (0) + φ E (0 ) + φ I (0) + φ Q (0) + φ R (0) for all t ≥ 0. To obtain biologically relevant solutions we further restrict to the subset on which S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t) ≥ 0. In Results, we considered initial conditions φ representing the sudden appearance of a small group of infectious individuals. These initial conditions should be near (1, 0, 0, 0, 0), the disease-free equilibrium with constant coordinate functions. Two examples are Numerically, DDEs are solved using the method of steps: Given an initial function φ we obtain the solution x(t, φ) to the DDE in the interval [0, τ + σ + κ] as the solution of the nonautonomous Ordinary Differential Equation using a 4th order Runge-Kutta with integration step 10 −3 where the initial function is a known time-dependent input. Disease-free states. For fixed α, σ, p, τ and κ, the set of initial conditions φ for which all component functions are constant and φ I is identically equal to zero defines the "disease-free" equilibria. These comprise the two-parameter family of constant functions (S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t)) = (S(0), E(0), 0, Q(0), 0) for all t, where S(0) + E(0) + Q(0) = 1. To investigate the stability of a given equilibrium solution, we linearize the system to obtain the following quasi-polynomial characteristic equation Two zero eigenvalues correspond to directions along the manifold of equilibria. An analysis shows that all disease-free equilibria are linearly stable if S(0) ≤ 1/r(1 − ε), and unstable otherwise. At this bifurcation value, a third eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis with nonzero speed and gives rise to a different class of endemic (nonzero infected) equilibria. If S(0) ≤ 1/r(1 − ε) no further bifurcations occur, so that these disease-free equilibria are linearly stable independently of the incubation time and isolation protocol. The analysis above is carried out for fixed α, σ, p, τ and κ. We now turn the question around and ask for which values of these parameters is ≡ S E I Q R ( , , , , ) (1, 0, 0, 0, 0) a stable equilibrium. This is how the minimum isolation probability p c and critical identification times τ c (p) announced in Results were deduced. endemic states. In addition to the disease-free states, system (1) where I(0) and Q(0) can be considered as the free parameters. One sees immediately that S eq is not affected by the recovery rate α, the incubation period σ and isolation time κ. In particular, it is constant for the whole family of endemic equilibria. The linear stability analysis of these equilibria is very challenging from an analytical point of view. They are stable for reasonable values of κ, destabilizing as κ increases. A detailed analysis will be published elsewhere. The formal limiting case α → ∞ (immediate waning of immunity) has been studied in detail 22 . The main concern of this paper is the effect of isolation on disease outcome starting from a small outbreak. To this end, the following conserved quantities will be of major help:
