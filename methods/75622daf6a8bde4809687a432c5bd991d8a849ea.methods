Protein expression and purification. MERS-CoV Eng1 RBD with a C-terminal HRV-3c cleavage site and His6x purification tag was expressed in GnTi À / À cells 41 . The MERS-CoV RBD protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography using 1 Â PBS as buffer. The m336-gH mutant was generated using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the m336 IgG1-expressing plasmid as a template; the m336 F54L, K73E, V95A, N100dA, R100eA and G100fA mutants were generated with the m336 Fab-expressing plasmid as a template. The light chains of m336-gL-FR and m336-gL were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and inserted into the m336 IgG1-expressing plasmid, respectively, to replace the original light chain of m336. The antibodies were expressed and analysed, and protein purity was estimated as 495% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoVue, GE Healthcare). Crystallization and data collection. The antigen-binding fragment of antibody m336 was prepared using Lys-C (Roche) digestion with an IgG/Lys-C ratio of 4,000:1 (w/w) 2 . The RBD protein was then mixed with the m336 Fab in a 1:1.5 molar ratio and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200; GE Healthcare) and concentrated to B8 mg ml À 1 for crystallization screening. Initial crystallizations were carried out at 20°C using a Mosquito crystallization robot (TTP Labtech, UK) and commercially available Hampton (Hampton Research), Precipitant Synergy (Emerald Biosystems) and Wizard (Emerald Biosystems) crystallization screens. Droplets were allowed to equilibrate at 20°C and imaged at scheduled times with Rock Imager (Formulatrix, MA). Robotic crystal hits were optimized manually using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method and crystals of diffraction quality were obtained by mixing 0.5 ml of protein complex and 0.5 ml of reservoir solutions containing 20% mono-Methyl polyethylene glycol 2000 and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Diffraction data of the m336/RBD crystals were collected under cryogenic conditions with a buffer containing 20% mono-Methyl polyethylene glycol 2000 and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant, at beamline ID-22 (SER-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, with 1.0000 Å radiation. The 2.65 Å resolution data set was processed and scaled with HKL2000 (ref. 42) in P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group. Structure determination and refinement. The structure of the m336:MERS-CoV RBD complex was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser 43 in the CCP4 Program Suite 44 . To place the two copies of m336/MERS-CoV RBD complex in the asymmetric unit, MERS-CoV RBD from PDB ID 4KQZ was used as the initial model to locate the MERS-CoV protein. CDR-loop-trimmed variable domain of Fab VRC-PG04 (PDB ID 3SE9) and its constant domain were used separately to locate corresponding domains of Fab m336 in the structure. Refinements were carried out with PHENIX 45 with a cross validation (R free ) test set containing 5% of the data. Starting with torsion-angle simulated annealing with slow cooling, iterative manual model building was carried out in COOT 46 with maps generated from combinations of positional, individual B-factor and TLS refinement algorithms. Ordered solvents were added during each macro cycle. Structure validations were performed periodically during the model building/refinement process with MolProbity 47 . Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . ELISA. Binding of antibodies to the MERS-CoV S1 protein (Sino Biological Inc.) was measured by ELISA. Serial fivefold dilutions of antibodies starting from 1 mM were diluted in PBS and assayed for binding to MERS-CoV S1 protein. After washing, bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated goat anti-human IgG Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. A0170) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. A8592). Surface plasmon resonance binding. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore X100 instrument (GE Healthcare). MERS-CoV S1 protein (Sino Biological Inc.) diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip using a primary amine coupling method. The running buffer was allowed to flow through the cells at a rate of 30 ml min À 1 . The analytes consisted of serial dilution of proteins between 500 to 0.05 nM (500, 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 nM). Neutralization assays. For measuring the neutralization activities of m336, m336-gH, m336-gL-FR and m336-gL, Huh-7 cells were infected with MERS-CoV-S pseudoviruses in the presence of serial dilutions of antibodies at indicated concentrations. The culture was re-fed with fresh medium 12 h post infection and incubated for an additional 72 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using lysis reagent included in a luciferase kit (Promega). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well flat-bottom luminometer plates (Costar), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units were determined immediately using the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan USA). Immunogenetic analysis. Antibody cDNA libraries constructed from peripheral blood B cells of 10 and 59 healthy donors 48, 49 were sequenced using the 454 sequencing technology 35 . Informed consent was obtained from all human participants. Details of quality control and 454 high-throughput sequence analysis of IgM antibody variable domains consisting of all three CDRs along with FRs were elaborated elsewhere 37 . Briefly, IMGT/HighV-QUEST 50 was used for immunogenetics and SAS JMP10 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analyses. The output results from the IMGT/HighV-QUEST analysis were stored at a local PostgreSQL database. Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to retrieve the IGHV1-69 and IGKV1-17 lineage sequences for immunogenetic analysis. Sequence alignments were made with ClustalW2. Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using Archaeopteryx.
