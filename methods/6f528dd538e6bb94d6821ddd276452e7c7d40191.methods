This study used a 2-phased approach. Phase 1 was a crosssectional survey of nurses who were regularly required to use FPE at work. Phase 2 was a direct observational study of nurses using FPE in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Funding for the study was granted by the Research Advisory Council of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario. Six acute care hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area participated. Ethics approval was obtained from the administering hospital and all participating hospitals. The chief nursing executive at each hospital identified units where FPE was regularly worn by nursing staff including ICUs, emergency departments, and in-patient medical units that regularly received patients with respiratory symptoms. The researcher conducted 4 visits to each unit, each 2 to 4 hours in length, to recruit participants. Consent for phase 1 of the study was implied when participants agreed to complete the questionnaire. In all units except the ICUs, the survey was anonymous. During phase 1 of the study, written consent was obtained from ICU nurses for participation in phase 2. One to 3 months after phase 1, a trained research assistant attempted to covertly observe participating nurses on 2 separate visits to evaluate adherence to FPE. If an opportunity for observation did not occur after 2 attempts, the observer identified themselves and requested a demonstration of donning and doffing FPE for a patient requiring airborne precautions. These demonstrations allowed an evaluation of competence (the demonstrated ability to apply knowledge and skills) but not an evaluation of adherence (the degree to which an individual follows a set of guidelines in real life). 10, 11 Measures Survey tool For this study, 3 measures were added to our previous survey tool, 9 resulting in an 8 page, 84-item questionnaire (available on request).
