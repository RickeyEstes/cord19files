Published literature on the clinical and economic burden of AECB was identified. First, using various combinations of appropriate medical subjects headings and key words (eg, chronic bronchitis; treatment; lung diseases, obstructive; costs and cost analysis), a computerized search of the following databases was performed: MEDLINE@, Pre-MEDLINE@, Health-STAR, CINAHL, Current Contents/All Editions, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Several of these databases were also searched for articles written by selected authorities in the field of chronic bronchitis. Other potential sources were identified by examining the references cited in retrieved articles, review articles, and consensus statements. Both peer-reviewed publications and reports published as theses or in abstract form were considered.
