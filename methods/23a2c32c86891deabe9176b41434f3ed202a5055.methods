We calculated the percentage of volume with osteonecrosis in the femoral head and analyzed its variation at various time points. Consecutive coronal T1WI images were sent to a picture archiving and communication system to measure the volume of the femoral head with necrosis. On the basis of the unique feature of femoral head necrosis, we used the serpiginous low signal band as the margin, confirmed the inner side as the necrotic area, and calculated the percentage of volume with osteonecrosis as (necrotic volume/femoral head volume)Ã—100%. We used the ARCO stage classification standard to assess the clinical femoral head necrosis stage. 26 We also performed a general condition survey and assessed hip joint function with the Harris score in March 2018 via questionnaire. 27 To avoid potential judgment bias, we ensured that each person was imaged with the same CT and MRI system during follow-up. The standardized image judging, data extraction, data processing, and calculation process were performed by different research groups. Three senior radiologists, two senior orthopedic surgeons, and two senior respiratory physicians confirmed the pathological judgment standard based on imaging. Imaging data analysis was independently performed and averaged by three senior radiologists. Two professional statisticians independently performed the data processing and calculation processes. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03443102) and was authorized by the Ethics Committee of Peking University People's Hospital (2018PHB010-01). All recruited patients provided written informed consent to participate.
