Following the approached developed in [15] , the population is divided into two subgroups: a mask wearing group (subscript m) and a non-mask wearing group. People move back and forth between the mask and non-mask groups based on the number of individuals infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Individuals in each activity group are characterized by their epidemiological status: susceptible, denoted by S and S m , exposed, denoted by E and E m (i.e., people who are infected but not yet fully contagious), and infectious individuals, I and I m . Definitions of the eight epidemiological classes are summarized in Table 1 and the transfers are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1 . Because we are evaluating the effectiveness of masks in a single influenza period, we use a closed system with no migration in or out, and births and natural deaths are not included in the model. As seen in Figure 1 , the transfer rates of people from the exposed classes, E and E m , to the infectious classes, I and I m , are vE and vE m . Infectious individuals can move to group D, at rate mI and mI m , when they die from infection or to group R, at rate dI and dI m , upon recovery. The mean times in the infectious classes, I and I m , are 1=(dzm). Hence, the infectious fraction d=(mzd) recovers and the infectious fraction m=(mzd) dies as a consequence of this disease. We assume that there is homogeneous mixing between groups and that contact activity levels remain normal throughout the epidemic. We define t 0 as the beginning of the epidemic. Movement of individuals between mask and non-mask groups depends upon the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases in the population. A specified percentage of the population starts wearing masks as the number of infected people increases. We define Q Sm S, Q Em E, and Q Im I to be the transfer rates from the S, E, and I classes to the S m , E m , and I m classes, respectively, similarly Q S S m , Q E E m , and Q I I m are the transfer rates from the S m , E m , and I m classes to the S, E, and I classes, respectively. The rate coefficients are modeled by step-functions of the number of infectious individuals: for i = S, E, I, S m , E m , and I m . Here the parameters a and b are positive constants that determine the rate of movement and t is the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases that determines when masks are implemented. For i = S, E, and I, b i is set at 0.1 or 10% of the population. Using the transfer diagrams in Figure 1 we obtain the following system of differential equations: Here l (non-mask group) and l m (mask group) are the forces of infection and lS and l m S m are the transfer rates from the susceptible classes, S and S m , to the exposed classes, E and E m . The infection rates, l and l m , incorporate the probability of transmission per contact, b, the reduced infectiousness due to incubation, a, the reduced number of contacts because of symptomatic infection, h, and 1{g j , (j = s or i), which accounts for the effectiveness of the mask in reducing either susceptibility (g s ) or infectivity (g i ). The transmissibility, b, is defined as the Effective Reproduction Number < con for N95 respirators. Notice that < con decreases as a higher percentage of people wear masks as well as when masks are more effective. < con is greatly reduced when 50% of the population wears masks and masks are 50% effective. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009018.t005 susceptibility of the population multiplied by the infectivity of the disease multiplied by the average number of contacts an individual has per day. The definitions of the parameters are summarized in Table 2 . The forces of infection for the non-mask group and mask group are shown by: where r~N{(1{h)(IzI m ) and N is the total population
