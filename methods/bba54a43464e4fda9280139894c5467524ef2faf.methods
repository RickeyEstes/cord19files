Peptide synthesis. A panel of peptides (Fig. 1A) , including T20, CP, CP-SM, CP-SW, CP-IDL were synthesized with a standard solid-phase FMOC method, as described previously 5 . The peptides were found to be about 95% pure by HPLC and were identified by mass spectrometry (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). Concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar-extinction coefficient based on tryptophan and tyrosine residues.
