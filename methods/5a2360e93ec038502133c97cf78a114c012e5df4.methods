Our study was designed as a case-control study and is based on comparing methylation profiles among BEN patients and healthy controls. It was approved by Ethical Committees in Bulgaria and Serbia. We obtained peripheral blood samples from 3 series of patients after informed consent was received from every participant. Clinical assessment was performed according to unified criteria and these were applied to all sample cohorts [23] . From all 159 patients 5 ml blood samples were collected in EDTAcontaining vacuette containers. All samples were checked for DNA consistency by 1% gel electrophoresis. Samples of unsatisfactory quality were excluded from our study. Serbian-Ethics committee of University of Nis, School of Medicine, Nis, Serbia Bulgarian-Commission of Medical Ethics at the National Center of Hygiene, Medical ecology and Nutriotion, Sofia, Bulgaria. The first sample cohort was collected by preliminary clinical screening of 2500 people in the Vratza endemic regions in Bulgaria in 2003 that revealed 96 patients -21 males and 75 females [24] . All subjects were of Bulgarian ancestry, born and living in the endemic region. Genealogical analysis was performed to exclude kinship between any study subjects. Thus 44 female samples and 15 male samples were selected, based on clinical information and DNA quality. The second sample cohort was collected by a current survey in 2011 in Bulgarian endemic regions that revealed 51 cases of BEN -28 female and 23 male BEN patients. All subjects were of Bulgarian ancestry, born and living in the endemic region. DNA was extracted by standard phenolchloroform extraction procedure and stored at −80°C. Overall we included 72 female samples and 38 male samples of Bulgarian ancestry. The third sample cohort -49 cases, were collected from Serbian endemic regions. DNA was extracted by DNA extraction kit and stored at −80°C. 19 female samples and 30 male samples of Serbian ancestry were enrolled in our study. Control samples were collected from non-endemic regions in Bulgaria and Serbia after exclusion of any with a family history of kidney disease. Controls had no kidney disease, no anamnestic data for other chronic illnesses, hypertensive disease or diabetes and were clinically healthy at the time of blood sampling. They were matched according to age and sex to BEN samples. 75 female control samples and 31 male controls from Bulgaria and 33 female and 31male control samples from Serbia were included. DNA was extracted by standard phenol-chloroform extraction procedure and stored at −80°C. All samples were checked for DNA consistency by 1% gel electrophoresis.
