A paper-based survey was developed based on pilot work undertaken by the authors and commonly identified barriers to vaccination from the literature. 6, 23, 24 It elicited demographic data about the respondents, their influenza vaccination status from 2007 to 2009 and identified barriers to being immunised. It also posed questions intended to determine the respondent's attitude towards vaccination, based on seven statements about efficacy, safety, adverse events and recommended target groups for influenza vaccine and was part of a wider survey that incorporated questions on pandemic influenza. The survey was piloted with four GPs and PNs from outside the study area. Feedback from this process contributed to enhanced content, altered survey structure and modified wording. Our sample was drawn from Divisions of General Practice (DGP) in NSW. DGPs are government-funded organisations that provide support to a defined geographical catchment of general practices in Australia. They are classified by population and locality into five categories based on Rural, Remote Metropolitan Areas (RRMA). 25, 26 NSW has the highest number of DGPs, with 32. Purposive sampling by the authors was used to select four DGPs in NSW to represent a diverse sample from metropolitan, semiurban and rural areas. The final sample size for each participating Division was weighted according to how many GPs and PNs were practicing in the area. The study was undertaken from the 1st February to 1st April 2009, prior to the Pandemic (H1N1) Influenza 2009 which was identified in late April 2009. 27 Authors were blinded to participant selection, as they were randomly selected from de-identified DGP databases of GPs and PNs. Surveys were posted by DGPs and were accompanied by personalised explanatory letter and a reply-paid envelope. Non-responders were sent a second letter and survey by the DGPs within 4 weeks. Quantitative data was entered into Microsoft Access and was analysed using Microsoft Excel. Responses to the geographical location question were categorised into inner city, semi-urban and rural areas. Questions about influenza vaccine-related barriers, attitudes and beliefs were categorised into either agree, disagree or uncertain. The categories were compared with demographic characteristics and selfreported vaccination status of respondents using categorical data analysis. Ethical approval was granted by the University of New South Wales Ethics Committee.
