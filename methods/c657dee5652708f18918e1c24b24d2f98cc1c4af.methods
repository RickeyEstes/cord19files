A prospective, cluster randomized trial of medical mask and respirator use in frontline HCWs was conducted from December 2008 to January 2009 in Beijing, China. We initially aimed to determine the efficacy of two different kinds of respiratory protection (N95 respirators and medical masks) during the influenza season compared to each other and compared to a no-mask group. However, although we intended to have a randomized control group, this was not acceptable to the Chinese IRB, who felt it would be unethical to assign HCWs randomly to not wear a mask, given mask use was widespread in Chinese hospitals that were included in the randomization. As such, we studied a convenience-selected no-mask group of HCWs who did not wear a mask. These HCWs were selected from other hospitals where mask wearing was not routine during the study period. Absence of randomization in the no-mask group meant that we eventually had to restrict the primary analysis of the trial to the comparison of the efficacy of N95 respirators and medical masks with each other. Participants were hospital HCWs aged â€¡18 years from the emergency departments and respiratory wards of 15 hospitals. These wards were selected as high-risk settings in which repeated and multiple exposures to respiratory infections are expected. We also monitored all participating wards by active surveillance for clinically compatible illness, including in the no-mask group, for outbreaks of respiratory infection in patients during the study period, and none was detected. All hospitals were large, tertiary hospitals in urban Beijing, and there was no variation in the start of the influenza season within this geographic area. Recruitment commenced on the 1 December 2008 and final follow-up was completed on 15 January 2009. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Ministry for Health. Verbal informed consent was provided by participants, and they were provided written information about the study. The nine hospitals in the convenience no-arm group were not part of the randomization, but HCWs in those hospitals were selected from the same type of wards as the intervention arms (emergency departments and respiratory wards). They were followed up in the same way as the trial participants for development of infections.
