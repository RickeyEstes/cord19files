Hoima and Buliisa Districts are located in the Western region of Uganda on the shores of Lake Albert. According to the 2014 national census, Hoima has a population of 573,903 while Buliisa District has a population of 113,569 [7] . We conducted the investigation between 3 and 17 October 2015. We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or another neighbouring district from 1 June 2015 onward. We found cases by reviewing health facility records from June 2015 to September 2015. We also visited affected communities to search for cases using the case definition. We also interviewed village health team members, healthcare workers and case patients who sought care at the health facilities. We analyzed the case-patients' line-list data to elucidate the distribution of case-persons by person, place and time. Based on the results of the descriptive epidemiology, we formulated hypotheses about potential exposures. In the assessment of alcohol use as a potential exposure, we asked patients about the nature of alcohol they usually consumed and the average amount in one sitting. The alcohol consumed was quantified as number of standard drinks whereby one standard drink was equivalent to 285ml of beer or 30ml of distilled [8] . People who took more than 6 standard drinks were categorised as exposed. We conducted a case-control study to test alcohol intake as a possible risk factor for hematemesis among other hypotheses. In the case-control study, a case was defined as onset of hematemesis in a person during July to October 2015. A control-person was an individual without any history of hematemesis. Control-persons were matched to cases according to sex, age (Â± 10 years) and village of residence, with a case-tocontrol ratio of 1:4. Laboratory, also based at UVRI. These laboratories are national reference centres for viral and bacteriological diagnostics. The VHF diagnostic protocols used have been described before and were routinely used to confirm previous VHF outbreaks in Uganda [9] . Histopathology testing was done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA. Statistical analysis: Using population data from the national census [7] and the data provided by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2015 [10] on the age and sex distributions of the population, we calculated the attack rate by age and sex. In analysing the data from the case-control study, we used the Mantel-Haenszel method to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their confidence intervals (CI) to account for the matched study design.
