The project utilized a previously published methodology for assessing systems for prevention and control of priority zoonotic diseases in a country [10] , which was further adapted to align with GHSA measures and targets, as well as incorporate a holistic One Health approach. Notably, changes to the baseline methodology included developing a list of at least five priority zoonotic diseases, per the GHSA Prevent-2 Action Package on Zoonotic Diseases [11] , and ensuring the inclusion of the Ministry of Environment as a stakeholder. Overall, the methodology employs a completely collaborative approach, requiring the full participation and ownership of all relevant government line ministries. In Guinea, this meant ensuring input from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Livestock (MOL), and Ministry of Environment (MOE). Fig. 1 outlines the methodological process, including a summary timeline for each described step. The first step, which started in September 2015, wasto determine which stakeholders in Guinea would need to be engaged during the project. This was achieved through consultation with partners in Guinea, as well as a review of existing published reports on zoonotic diseases in Guinea. The second step was to determine the list of priority zoonotic diseases. This was achieved by conducting a literature search for the zoonotic diseases likely to be present or of high risk of emergence in Guinea, comparing the diseases identified via peer-reviewed and "grey" literature publications to available ministerial reportable disease lists, and holding a facilitated roundtable discussion among the ministries to add or remove diseases from consideration, and then prioritize. During the roundtable discussion, held in November 2015, we convened representatives from MOH, MOL, and MOE to categorize the different zoonotic diseases as emerging, epidemic-prone, or endemic in Guinea, as well as review the factors to be considered for prioritization in the Guinean context. Examples of factors included the economic and/or social impact of the disease, the case fatality rate in humans and/or animals, the overall health burden or morbidity caused by the disease, and implications for trade. Facilitators started the discussion by mentioning common zoonotic diseases and asking each Ministry (MOH, MOL, MOE) to present their perspectives related to the different factors. Participants were encouraged to provide supporting evidence on potential priority zoonotic diseases, including national statistics on prevalence, distribution, economic impact, and case fatality rate, where available. Disease information from international normative sources, such as WHO and OIE, was used alongside national data when considering the various factors. The list was then narrowed through group consensus discussion, with facilitators ensuring even contribution from all sectors, to six, to fulfill the GHSA requirement of targeting at least five priority zoonotic diseases. Once the consensus list of priority diseases was defined, each of the diseases was used as a "case study" to identify processes for prevention, detection, and response across the three primary implicated sectors: human health, domestic animal health (inclusive of pets, companion animals and livestock), and wildlife/ecosystem health. Between November 2015 and April 2016, the research team examined the processes for each disease from initial detection in a human or animal host to declaration of the end of an outbreak, including: routine and eventbased surveillance, sample collection and management; laboratory testing and confirmation; local, national, and international reporting; case management; and emergency response procedures. We focused primarily on areas of coordination and communication between the sectors, and included an administration assessment at all levels: local, intermediate, and national. We sought data from three main sources: (1) direct interviews with stakeholders, including approximately 15 ministry officials from MOH, MOL and MOE at national and sub-national levels; (2) site visits to key facilities at the national and sub-national level; and (3) two information-gathering workshops (conducted in November 2015 and January 2016) to convene partners and stakeholders from government together with non-governmental and international organizations working in global health security and health systems strengthening. (Site visit questionnaires and workshop participating institutions/organizations are available as Supplementary Materials.) The research team then used the information gathered to develop systems "maps" for each disease, highlighting where existing processes included formal and informal communication or collaboration by phone, email, or participation to joint investigation between sectors as well as existing gaps. The systems maps and identified gaps were validated with key partners and stakeholders. The third stakeholder/partner workshop, which included the three Ministries and their key partners, was held in April 2016 and focused on validating the systems maps and identified gaps, and also was used to develop a prioritized list of recommendations for capacity building based on the gaps identified in each of the disease maps. Consensus between participants on each recommendation was achieved through facilitated small-group discussion, with final review by the whole group. The recommendations included the estimated relative level of investment and time required to achieve and complete each gap. Criteria for the investment and time estimations included requirements for equipment and tools, technical expertise and resources as well as other required inputs. We defined "short-term" as 0-6 months; "medium-term" as 6-18 months; and "long-term" as greater than 18 months. Prioritization was defined based on the impact of filling the gap(s). "Low priority" was defined as an activity that would demonstrate Guinea's commitment to compliance with IHR (2005) and other capacity-building frameworks, would achieve a short-term goal, and/or result in a transient benefit. "Medium-priority" was defined as an activity that would strengthen baseline capacities, including equipment, processes, and/or materials with some sustained benefit. "High priority" was defined as an activity that would strengthen infrastructure, systems, and/or workforce for ongoing activities with farreaching benefits.
