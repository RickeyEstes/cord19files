Materials. N-terminally acetylated and C-terminally amidated SARS FP ( 770 MWKTPTLKYFGGFNFSQIL 788 ) and SARS IFP ( 873 GAALQIPFAMQMAYRF 888 ) peptides were either purchased from GenScript (Piscataway Township, NJ) or manually synthesized according to the standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis method on a Rink-Amide resin 98 . The details of peptide synthesis are described in Vicente et al. 99 . Purification was performed as described in Supplementary section SI1. The phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-snglycero-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DPPG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DPPS), 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DiPoPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), and the spin labels 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(n-doxyl)-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (n-PCSL, where n = 5 and 16), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(tempo)choline (DOPTC), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(tempo)choline (DPPTC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol (Chol) and linoleic acid (LA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All reagents were used without further purification. Sample preparation. Phospholipids (1.6 mg for DSC and 0.5 mg for ESR) and spin labels (0.5 mol% for CW ESR and 1 mol% for pulsed ESR) either in chloroform or chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) stock solutions were mixed in a glass tube. After dried under a N 2 flow, the lipid film was ultracentrifuged under vacuum overnight to remove traces of solvent. For CW ESR experiments, the sample was hydrated in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, sonicated in a bath type sonicator for a few seconds and maintained at a temperature above the main phase transition of the lipid for at least two hours for complete hydration. Samples were then subjected to at least six freeze-thaw cycles. A measured volume of SARS FP or SARS IFP stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the preformed multilamellar lipid dispersions. For DSC experiments, peptides dissolved in either acetonitrile/water 1:1 (v/v) or in DMSO solutions were diluted into buffer and added to the lipid film for hydration. Samples were vortexed for few seconds, maintained at a temperature above the phase transition for each lipid during at least 30 min, and subjected to six freeze-thaw cycles. The amount of phospholipid (final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml for ESR and 2 mg/ml for DSC) and peptides used provided a 20:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio for most of the experiments. It is worth mentioning that the same amount of DMSO or acetonitrile/water 1:1 added in the peptide-containing samples was also used in the peptide-free samples as controls for the ESR and DSC experiments. The control samples were prepared using the same protocol as those of the peptide-containing samples. For DiPoPE/peptide samples, peptides and lipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) stock solutions were mixed in a glass tube, dried to a lipid film under N 2 gas and lyophilized overnight. Samples were hydrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with or without 150 mM sodium chloride, and freeze-thaw cycled six times below the liquid crystalline-to-inverted hexagonal (Lα -H II ) phase transition temperature (T H ) of the lipid. DiPoPE concentration was 10 mg/ml and peptide concentration varied from 0.2 to 0.5 mol% (500:1 and 200:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio, respectively). For ESEEM experiments, POPC/POPG 7:3 mol/mol and peptides (20:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio) were prepared as above, but hydrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl D 2 O buffer, pD = 7.4 (actual pH measurement). Peptide concentration was confirmed spectrophotometrically by using the theoretical molar extinction coefficients of 6,990 M −1 cm −1 for SARS FP ESR Experiments. CW-ESR experiments were carried out on a Varian E-109 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz. Temperature was controlled by a homemade temperature control unit coupled to the spectrometer, whose accuracy is about 0.2 °C. Samples were transferred to glass capillaries (1.5 mm I.D.), which were set into a quartz tube containing a mineral oil bath to help stabilize the sample temperature. The following acquisition parameters were used: center field, 3,362 G; scan width, 80 to 160 G; modulation amplitude, 0.5 or 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 5 or 10 mW; time constant, 128 ms, and acquisition time, 240 s. Nonlinear least-squares simulations (NLLS) of the CW-ESR spectra were performed using the Multicomponent LabView (National Instruments) software developed by Dr. Christian Altenbach (University of California, Los Angeles, California) 24, 100 . The rotational diffusion rates (R ⊥ , R ∥ ) and order parameters (S 0 , S 2 ) were obtained as described in ref. 33 with further details in the section SI2 of supplementary information. Seed values for the magnetic parameters of both 5-PCSL and 16-PCSL were obtained from Earle et al. 44 and those of DPPTC were taken from Ge and Freed 101 . The strategy of the NLLS simulation was performed as described elsewhere 33 . Pulsed ESR experiments were performed on a Bruker Elexsys 580 X-band pulsed ESR spectrometer equipped with the Bruker Flexline ER 4118X-MS3 split-ring resonator and the ITC503 Oxford cryogenic system for temperature control. Samples were immersed into liquid nitrogen prior to the measurements at 50 K. Three pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments were carried out with the π /2 -τπ /2 -T -π /2 -τecho pulse sequence 54 and using a four-step phase cycling to suppress unwanted echoes 102 . The microwave power was adjusted to give 16 ns π /2 pulses and an interpulse delay τ of 236 ns, kept constant in all experiments, was chosen to maximize deuterium modulations at the magnetic field where the echo intensity is maximum. Starting at time delay T = 200 ns, 700 points were recorded with Δ T = 12 ns steps to obtain the three-pulse stimulated echo decays. The integration gate length was 48 ns and the shot repetition time was 1,500 μ s. The number of accumulations varied from 20 to 50 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio and on the modulation depth. Data analysis was performed as described in Bartucci et al. 62 . Briefly, the contribution of the spin relaxation to the ESEEM signal was eliminated by dividing the time-dependent echo amplitudes, V(τ , T), by a bi-exponential decay, 〈 V(τ , T)〉 , followed by subtraction of unity, as V norm (τ , T) = V(τ , T)/〈 V(τ , T)〉 − 1. The remained oscillations about zero were apodized with a Hamming window and zero-filled to increase the total number of points to about 4 K. Numerical Fourier transformation was performed and the resultant magnitude spectrum was multiplied by the dwell time Δ T = 12 ns to provide a spectral density in ns units.
