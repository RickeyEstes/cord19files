We performed a systematic review of the PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception to 1-March-2020 to find articles providing information on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and chloroquinerelated formulations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and articles describing related in-vitro studies. As much of the data on COVID-19 are coming from Asia, no language restrictions were imposed (see detailed search strategy in Supplement 1). The search was expanded using a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers. We also searched the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Clinicatrial. gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) to identify ongoing trials. Two authors (AC, MI) independently screened the databases and the trial registries and extracted relevant information (MI, GI). Discrepancies and doubts about relevance of the sources were solved by consensus with two more authors (AG, SE). We did not register the systematic review protocol because we anticipated the very limited available evidence on the topic and due to the urgency of the matter.
