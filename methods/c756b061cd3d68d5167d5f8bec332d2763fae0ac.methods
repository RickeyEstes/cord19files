Although a large number of databases are used for evaluation research at global level [45] [46] [47] , the current study uses the Scopus database which is widely accepted among researchers for the purposes of high quality bibliometric analyses [44, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Scopus is the world's largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed research literature, and is an established resource for identifying biomedical research including MEDLINE documents, and includes a higher level of detail than PubMed including the country of origin and citations per document [47, 54] . We used the key terms "microbiome-gut-brain axis" and its synonyms because we are concerned with microbiomegut-brain axis per se as a new concept in research rather than related topics. Data mining was conducted on July 12, 2019. The central theme in this study was research articles containing "microbiome or microbiota and braingut or gut-brain" to identify items based on their search in the fields title, abstract and keyword simultaneously and the time was 10 years between 2009 and 2018.
