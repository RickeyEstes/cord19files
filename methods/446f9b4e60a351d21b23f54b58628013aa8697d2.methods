Study site. The survey was carried out between December 2017 and May 2018 in Shanghai, a city in the southeast of China ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The central urban districts of Shanghai were selected as our study sites, representing typical urban areas with high income and high population density ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The 7 central urban districts are defined as areas within the outer ring road of Shanghai 36 , comprising a total population size of 7.3 million and an area of 289 square kilometers. Sampling. We sampled forty neighborhoods using multi-stage stratified sampling proportional to population size. A convenience sample of 25 households per neighborhood was selected so as to be broadly representative of the whole population of the neighborhood in terms of geographical distribution ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). One person per household was invited to participate in our study until we met our predefined target sizes equally balanced by age group and gender (Supplementary Text S1 for sampling details). Our target sample size was 1000. Individuals of all ages who had been living in the selected neighborhoods for longer than two weeks and did not intend to move from Shanghai in the following two weeks were considered eligible for inclusion in the study (Supplementary Text S1 for population details).
