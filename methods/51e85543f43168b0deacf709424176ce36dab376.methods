The viral proteomes analyzed in this study were downloaded from www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/virus.html and the human proteome obtained from UniProtKB (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ integr8). The human proteome originally contained 37,993 proteins at the time of download, but we filtered out (1) two viral contaminants (i.e. viral proteomes which were being expressed in human cells), and (2) duplicated sequences and fragments. After the filtering, we were left with a human proteome consisting of 36,103 unique proteins. Similarity analyses were conducted on 30 viral proteomes for a total of 717 viral proteins, equal to 302,667 amino acids. A similarly sized control set of 30 human protein samples (for a total of 686 human proteins, equal to 302,520 amino acids) was analyzed for inter-human overlapping. More precisely, for each viral proteome size, we constructed an artificial human sub-proteome drawn from the human protein set. The proteins were selected at random without replacement, and assigned to an artificial sub-proteome at random. We kept adding human proteins to each artificial human sub-proteome until adding the next protein would have caused the total number of amino acids in the artificial sub-proteome to exceed to the number of amino acids in the corresponding viral proteome. This way we eliminated possible bias in the comparison. The 30 artificial sub-proteomes are random samplings of human proteins and represent cross-sections of all human proteins. The list of the human proteins forming the 30 artificial human sub-proteomes is detailed as Swiss-Prot entries in Table 3 . Sequence similarity analyses of each of the 30 viral proteomes (or the 30 artificial human sub-proteomes) to the human proteome were carried out using viral (or human) 5mers sequentially overlapped by four residues. The scans were performed by custom programs written in C and utilizing suffix trees for efficiency [6] . The viral or human proteins were manipulated and analyzed as follows. The entire viral (or human) proteome was decomposed in silico to a set of 5-mers (including all duplicates). A library of unique 5-mers for each virus or human proteome was then created by removing duplicates. Next, for each 5-mer in the library, the entire human proteome was searched for instances of the same 5-mer. Any such occurrence was termed an overlap. Cursory analyses (e.g. identification of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of duplications) were performed using LINIX/UNIX shell scripts and standard LINUX/UNIX utilities. Data were plotted and linear least-squares regression was performed to determine whether any linear relationships exist between the level of overlap and the size of viral (or control) proteomes. The same procedure was applied when longer amino acid sequences (esa-, epta-, octapeptides, etc.) were used as probes in the similarity analyses. The similarity analysis for the artificial human subproteomes was performed as for the viral proteomes, with p e p t i d e s 2 9 ( 2 0 0 8 ) 1 7 5 5 -1 7 6 6 one modification. The modification is that all the proteins in the artificial proteome were removed from the comparison human proteome when the overlap determination was done. E.g., the artificial human sub-proteome 9 contains 12 human proteins selected from the original set of 36,103 proteins comprehensively forming the human proteome. These 12 proteins were removed from the comparison set prior to determining the overlap of artificial human sub-proteome 9 versus human; i.e. for artificial proteome 9, the overlap comparison was between 12 proteins in the artificial proteome and the remaining 36,091 human proteins. And similar for each of the other 29 artificial proteomes.
