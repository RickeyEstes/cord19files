This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All participants were informed about the study. However, the IRB waived the need for written informed consent from the participants because the identities of all respondents would be completely anonymous during data collection and analysis, and there would be minimal risk as perceived by the IRB for being involved in this study. The design of this study was described in details elsewhere [17] . In brief, this study was conducted in 21 adult ICUs in 17 provinces in China. All participating ICUs admitted patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza during the pandemic. A 36-item survey questionnaire was designed based on the study of Daugherty and coworkers [16] , to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of ICU HCWs related to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which was available as supporting information; see Questionnaire S1. On December 25, 2009 , the questionnaire with an instruction was sent by e-mail to the contact persons of individual participating ICUs, who encouraged as many HCWs as possible to participate the study. All questionnaires were collected and sent back by e-mail before January 15, 2010. Any HCWs not responding after the deadline were regarded as non-respondents. Data on the demographic characteristics of respondents, including age, sex, marital status, living status, status of influenza vaccination, and profession, were recorded. The professional status of the respondents was categorized as physicians, and nurses, and others (including respiratory therapists, student nurses, and nurse assistants). For the purpose of this study, we only included physicians and nurses in the final analysis. The respondents were asked to report their experience of caring for H1N1 patients, as well as relevant training. They were also required to report the level of knowledge and the level of confidence in their ability to protect themselves and their patients from exposure to influenza at work. A 5-point Likert scale (complete agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and complete disagree) was used to elicit preferred answers. We defined recommended PPE as use of hand hygiene, gloves, gown, mask (including surgical mask and N95 respirator), and goggles [13] . In the final analysis, answers with a higher level of protection than recommended (e.g. use of goggles when no aerosolgenerating procedures were anticipated) were deemed as correct because they represented adequate protection [16] . As a response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, all hospitals were required by local healthcare authorities to provide training programs to all hospital staffs during seminars. These training programs were mainly 2 to 3-hour lectures, developed based on the guidelines issued by Ministry of Health, often involving diagnosis, treatment, and infection control of 2009 H1N1 influenza. There was no posttest to evaluate the extent of information attainment by the attendees.
