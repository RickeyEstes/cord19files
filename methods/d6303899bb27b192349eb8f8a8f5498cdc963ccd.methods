In South Korea, physicians are legally required to complete death certificates, which are then sent to Statistics Korea and made publicly available through the Korean Statistics Information Service (KOSIS; http://kosis.kr/ eng). The death certificate includes information on disease directly leading to death, antecedent causes, and other major conditions contributing to death (12) . Once the death certificate is submitted, a professional staff in Statistics Korea identifies a single most relevant underlying cause for each death, in accordance with the World Health Organization definition (13) . The coding is reviewed by a committee to finalize the national public data provided to the users. Nationally, â‰ˆ90% of all deaths were certified in 1987, and almost 100% of deaths were certified by 2007 (14, 15) . The causes of death are coded according to the Korean Classification of Diseases, Sixth Revision, which is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th Revision (ICD-10). The Korean Classification of Diseases was first adopted in 1973 and was revised in accordance with the amendments in the ICD scheme. The death data collected before 1995, which were coded in the ICD's Ninth Revision codes, are converted to ICD-10 codes by Statistics Korea by using a mapping reference table (https://kssc.kostat.go.kr:8443). We retrieved infectious disease mortality rates for 1983-2015 from the KOSIS database and identified the infectious disease groups listed (Table 1) . We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for 1983-2015 by using the World Standard Population as reference (16, 17) . We analyzed trends by age group (<1, 1-4, 5-14, 15-64, and >65 years) and disease (respiratory tract infection, sepsis, TB, intestinal infection, vaccine-preventable disease, central nervous system [CNS] infection, viral hepatitis, HIVcaused disease, and rheumatic heart disease). We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify years associated with significant changes in mortality rates (18) . We calculated annual percentage changes (APCs) by using generalized linear models, assuming that a Poisson distribution was in play. To assess the trend over an interval, we computed an average of the APCs from the joinpoint model and used that result as a summary measure. The p value for a 2-sided test for which the true average of the APCs was zero was calculated based on a t distribution (https://surveillance. cancer.gov/help/joinpoint/setting-parameters/method-andparameters-tab/average-annual-percent-change-aapc). We obtained population denominators according to age and education level from the Korean Population and Housing Census data, which are obtained at 5-year intervals. The number of deaths according to age and education level (numerators) calculated from raw death certificate data were available from the KOSIS database. We selected information from the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 to use as population denominators for calculating mortality rates according to education levels. We analyzed changes in age-standardized mortality associated with selected infectious diseases, by education level, among those age >65 years. We categorized education levels as middle school or less, high school, and college or higher. We calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII) to assess the contributions made by socioeconomic disparity to infectious disease-caused mortality among persons of various education levels (19).
