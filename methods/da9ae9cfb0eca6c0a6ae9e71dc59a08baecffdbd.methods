Based on the state-of-the-art scientific literature guidelines, a search was conducted in Web of Science and PubMed for original and review English papers published after 2010 and a few papers published after 1986. The terms employed during the search were ("indoor air pollution in GCC" or "indoor air quality in GCC"), ("indoor air quality in < name of the GCC country > " or "indoor Radon in GCC" or "Building ventilation in GCC" or "sustainable buildings in GCC"), and also "indoor < name of the pollutants > ". For the respective countries, "ambient" or "outdoor" research studies were excluded. Since many published peer reviewed articles were not indexed in the above scientific electronic databases, gray search procedures in Google search engine were carried out based on the similar terminologies. In addition, published documents found on the national and international organization websites, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), were also considered. The order of the countries in this review study is based on the topto-bottom approach, which represents how detailed an IAQ study has been conducted by a particular country. Thus, countries with detailed studies came to the top list, followed by less detailed ones. This approach will help the readers to follow the trend of indoor air pollution in the GCC countries.
