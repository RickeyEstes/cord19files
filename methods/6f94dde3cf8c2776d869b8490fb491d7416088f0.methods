We attempted to study the spatiotemporal associations of emergency department visits that presented with fever and hospitalized, and identified clustering of cases to predict occurrence of outbreaks. Tai Po (147.84 km 2 ) is a district in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and it has a population of about 300,000 residents. Most of the residents in this district are living in apartment buildings with multiple (3 to over 30) storeys, a typical floor of which contains 4 to 8 flats that measure 40 to 90 m 2 in size. Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH) is the only public hospital that provides acute medical services to the residents of Tai Po. Following the outbreak of SARS in 2003, all emergency department visits are screened for the body temperature, and patients with fever are segregated in a separate waiting area. We prospectively captured consecutive emergency department visits of AHNH that led to hospital admissions during the period of 12 Sep 2005 to 14 Oct 2005, both days inclusive. For each patient-episode, we obtained data on demographics, temperature on presentation, provisional diagnoses, destined ward for admission and residential location. These data were available from the Clinical Management System, an electronic platform that is in place at all public hospitals in Hong Kong for retrieval of archived patient information (e.g. emergency department attendance record, hospital discharge summary, results of investigations etc.) and clinical management (e.g. request of laboratory tests, prescription of medications, etc.). The provisional diagnoses were recorded in a text field and we went through them manually to decide whether they represented infections or not. In AHNH, each clinical department owned its designated wards and patients were assigned their destined wards by their presenting illnesses. In addition, designated isolation wards for contagious infections (e.g. open pulmonary tuberculosis) were available under the medical and paediatric departments. The information on destined wards would facilitate outbreak investigation and infection control when clustering of febrile patients was found. As we focused on the detection of case clustering within Tai Po, we excluded patient-episodes with residential addresses without this district. Each textural residential address was transformed to x and y coordinates in Hong Kong Grid 1980. Using Geographical Information system (GIS) technology, data were created and geocoded in the form of point data. Each patient-episode was represented by a point and the rest of data were recorded in an attribute table. The creation of point data enabled spatial visualization and analysis of these patient-episodes. In studying the spatial associations among patient-episodes, we assumed that the most usual activity space of each patient was around 50 meters (m) from the respective residential location, and a 50 m buffer (i.e. a 50 m radius circle) was created for each point. If there was overlapping of two or more activity spaces, it might indicate associations among these patients in terms of their illnesses. Thus, spatially adjoining buffers were then merged to form a bigger buffer. Each three consecutive days was used as a temporal unit when analyzing the spatial associations. The data were left-censored by the emergency department attendance date. Numerical variables were summarized as either mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and range, whichever was appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as percentages. Unpaired Student's t-test and Chisquare test were used for univariate analyses. We defined fever as an oral temperature above 37Â°C or equivalent, and a case cluster as 3 or more spatially associated patient-episodes with fever during each 3-day period. The spatial growth of each cluster was monitored in GIS and the corresponding time span was recorded. The data points of the final map have been randomly distributed within a radius of 50 meters, which did not therefore show the actual residential locations of patients in the study. ESRI ArcGIS version 9.2 was used for the GIS related data processing and analyses, and SPSS version 13 was used for other statistical analyses. This study was approved by the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
