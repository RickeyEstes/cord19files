Virus. The 371 bat strain of MARV (Uganda 371Bat2007, GenBank accession #: FJ750958) used in this study was isolated from pooled liver/spleen collected from an ERB in 2007 in southwestern Uganda 2 . Prior to use in this study, the virus was passaged twice in Vero-E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA; sex: female, authenticated by ATCC) in maintenance media (DMEM containing 2% Thermo Scientific HyClone fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 2.50 µg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies)) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO 2 . The second passage stock virus (mycoplasma-free) was then titrated in the same cell line by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) assay. SCientifiC REPORTS | 7: 8763 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-07824-2 Bats. The captive-born bats used in this study originated from the ERB breeding colony at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). This MARV-free colony was established from wild-caught ERBs imported from Uganda 8 . All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the CDC and performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 2011). The CDC is an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) fully accredited research facility. Procedures conducted with MARV or MARV-infected bats were performed at the CDC under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory conditions in compliance with Select Agent Regulations (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Centers for Disease Control 2014). All bat cages were placed within bio-flow isolator units with HEPA-filtered inlet and exhaust air supplies (Duo-Flow Mobile Units, Lab Products Inc., Seaford, DE, USA). All bats were group-housed in a climate controlled BSL-4 animal area, with a 12 h day/12 h night cycle. Bats were provided daily with their body mass in fresh fruit supplemented with protein/vitamin powder (Lubee Bat Conservancy, Gainesville, FL, USA) and received water ad libitum. The number of bats used in this study was based on their previous MARV infection status (experimentally infected, "naturally infected or naïve negative control), as well as the amount of BSL-4 laboratory space required and the number of personnel needed to care for the bats over 24 months. The bat groups were sex-matched and no other methods of randomization were used throughout the study. Investigators were not blinded during the study. Experimental bat groups. A total of 12 healthy, adult ERBs (Rousettus aegyptiacus; 31 m of age; 6 males and 6 females; average weight of 164.0 g) were transferred from a previous 9-month long MARV transmission study that was initiated 24 months previously when the bats were 7 months of age (juveniles) 11 . The ERBs were divided into three groups (Table 1) based on their MARV infection history and sex. Group 1 was comprised of 5 bats (3 males, 2 females) that were subcutaneously inoculated at the beginning of the previous transmission study with 4 log 10 TCID 50 of the 371 bat strain of MARV. Shortly after inoculation, MARV RNA/infectious virus was detected in blood, oral, rectal and/or urine specimens collected from these bats. MARV IgG antibodies in this group peaked between 14 and 28 DPI and then rapidly declined, with all bats becoming seronegative by 3 MPI. Group 2 was comprised of 5 bats (2 males, 3 females) that were "naturally" infected through contact with the MARV-experimentally infected bats (group 1), as evidenced through the detection of MARV RNA in blood or oral swab specimens at 7 MPI and/or MARV IgG antibodies between 7 and 8 MPI. Group 3 was comprised of 2 negative control bats (1 male, 1 female) that tested uniformly negative for MARV RNA and MARV IgG antibodies throughout the previous transmission study. Specimen collection. Blood was taken daily from 0-14 DPC and at 21 DPC from the cephalic wing vein using a sterile lancet (C&A Scientific, Manassas, VA, USA). Blood was tested for the presence of MARV RNA by Q-RT-PCR through 14 DPC and MARV IgG antibody responses were monitored weekly through 21 DPC. The oral mucosa was sampled daily through 14 DPC using two polyester-tipped applicators (Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA). One oral swab was tested for the presence of MARV RNA by Q-RT-PCR and the second swab was frozen in sterile media for attempted virus isolation of any MARV RNA positive swabs. Euthanasia and necropsy. At 21 DPC, the bats were euthanized by cardiac exsanguination under anesthesia followed by an overdose of isoflurane. At necropsy, the following tissues were collected: axillary lymph node, gonad, liver, salivary gland and spleen. One set of tissues was tested for the presence of MARV RNA by Q-RT-PCR and a second set were frozen for virus isolation attempts in the case that any tissues were MARV RNA positive.
