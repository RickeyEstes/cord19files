We searched PubMed and EMBASE using the terms HIV vaccine, HIV immunization, human vaccine trials, SOSIP vaccine, mRNA vaccine, protein vaccine, peptide vaccine, trimer vaccine, AIDS, vaccination, immunization, viral vectors, and bNAbs to capture protein/peptide, mRNA, vector-based HIV vaccine experimental studies and passive immunization strategies. Studies that were published from January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2019, were included in this narrative review. After the initial electronic database search, we identified and removed duplicate publications. The remaining studies then underwent title and abstract review at which time publications were excluded if they were written in a language other than English and/or a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. Although quality assessments of the studies were not conducted, all studies included in the full-text review of this study met minimum standards of technical quality and observed protocols mandated by the Animal Welfare Act. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. The complete electronic database search results and citations are listed in the references.
