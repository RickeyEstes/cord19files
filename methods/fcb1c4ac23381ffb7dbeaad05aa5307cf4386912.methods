Quantitative Plaque Assay Analysis. To measure the activity of viruses, we employed a quantitative plaque assay. The MDCK cells used for plaque assay were grown in 6 wells plates by adding 3 mL of cells (2 × 10 5 /mL) to individual well. After confluent growth of MDCK cells in plates, the cells were successively washed with phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.2) and Eagles' MEM with 2 μ g/mL TPCK trypsin. After washed, 100 μ L of the ten-fold serial dilution of viruses were added into each well. For better virus adsorption, the inoculated cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator for one hour. After then, the virus inoculums were removed and the Eagles' minimal essential medium with 2 μ g/mL TPCK trypsin and 0.5% agarose was added. After the gel formation, the plates were put in a 5% CO 2 incubator for at least 42-48 hrs. After incubation, the plates were fixed with 10% formalin for 1 hour. After pour off agarose, the fixed cells were stained with crystal violet for 15 min and washed with tap water. Below certain virus concentration, the plaques wouldn't overlap each other seriously and can be counted unambiguously. Considering the corresponding dilution factor, the plaque forming unit per mL (pfu/mL) of the original virus can thus be quantified. The titer measurement will be performed three times on the same sample to reduce quantization error. Quantified by the plaque assay, the concentration of active viruses in our prepared viral solutions was around 10 7 /ml for H1N1 and H3N2. Real-time PCR Analysis. The sample RNA was extracted and amplified by the RT and quantitative real-time PCR (Primerdesign Precision OneStep ™ qRT-PCR Mastermix) with primer AMF (sequence: 5′ -GAGTCTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA-3′ ), primer flu-AR (sequence: 5′ -CAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAGTCC-3′ ) and flu A (5′ -FAM-tttgtgtttacgctcaccgt-TAMRA-3′ ) probe. For control group, RNase was added for 10 minutes digestion and stopped with RNase inhibitor. Then viruses were fractured artificially by freeze-thaw treatment. We thus were able to observe that the RNA signal of virus rose after 15 cycles of the amplification. For pre-treated groups, the RNase treatment were done and stopped before 8 GHz microwave illumination in order to make sure that RNA outside the viral envelope was eliminated in the first place. For the post-treat groups, RNase was added right after the illumination. If the virus particles were fractured, the released RNA would be degraded by RNase.
