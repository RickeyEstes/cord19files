We analysed a dataset of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections collected from three clinical trials of HCWs where active surveillance for respiratory viral illness was conducted in prospective follow up [21] [22] [23] . The same methods, data collection forms and outcome measures, were used across the three studies, allowing the data to be pooled [21] [22] [23] . Two studies were conducted in Beijing China: trial 1 (2008/2009) and trial 2 (2009/2010) and another study (trial 3) was conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2010/2011 [21] [22] [23] . In all clinical trials, participants were asked to complete diary cards on a daily basis to collect information on number of working hours, patients seen, mask use hours, high-risk procedures performed and appearance of respiratory symptoms. Thermometers were given the participants to measure their temperature daily and at symptom onset. Symptomatic cases were asked to complete sick patient follow-up forms and detailed information was collected on the following symptoms: chill or fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, sore throat, sneezes, lethargy, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, muscle or joint aches. Swabs of both tonsils and the posterior pharyngeal wall were collected on the day of reporting. In all RCTs, fever was defined as having body temperature 538°C. Clinical respiratory illness (CRI) and ILI were in the primary outcomes in three clinical trials. CRI was defined as two or more respiratory symptoms or one respiratory symptom and a systemic symptom and ILI was defined as fever 538°C plus one respiratory symptom [21] [22] [23] .
