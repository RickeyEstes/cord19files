Healthy children ages 48-96 months were recruited in a rolling fashion from 2 primary care pediatric practices in Madison, Wisconsin and followed for 1 year. Families of eligible children received information about the study by mail approximately 2 weeks before their next scheduled wellchild visit. Parental interest in the study was queried by the office nurse. If interest was expressed, the study coordinator provided additional information and invited the parent to participate in the study. Children were excluded from the study if they had an underlying condition reported by the parent or noted in the medical record, likely to alter the natural history of URI, including congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, craniofacial abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, allergic rhinitis, or a previous episode of chronic sinusitis. Written, informed consent was obtained and assent also was obtained from older children ($7 years of age). Subjects received a small stipend for participation. The study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. Demographic information was obtained by the study nurse. Responses to race/ethnicity questions were self-reported by the subject's parent. Nasal samples were obtained at entry and during 4 surveillance visits (February, April, September, and December) when children were asymptomatic as verified by the study nurses. Parents were instructed to call the study nurse at the first sign of a URI, which was defined as at least 48 hours of respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, nasal discharge, or cough. Nasal samples were obtained on day 3-4 of illness by the study nurse, and a recovery sample was obtained on day 15. A clinical assessment at the time of the visit assured that symptoms reflected illness confined to the upper respiratory tract. A symptom survey was filled out on day 3-4 and subsequently by telephone on days 7, 10, and 15. 21 The survey inquired about fever, nasal symptoms, cough, headache, irritability, facial pain, facial swelling, activity, sleep, and impaired appetite. If a symptom was present initially, a score of 2 was assigned. If it was absent the score was 0. If a symptom became more severe, less severe, or stayed the same, +1, Ã€1 or 0, respectively, was added to the previous score for each symptom. The URI was considered resolved if the score was #2. In addition, parents were asked to record any missed days of childcare, school, or work because of respiratory illness in their child on a calendar provided for that purpose. Each URI was classified as either an uncomplicated viral URI or sinusitis. The diagnosis of sinusitis was based on one of the following clinical criteria: (1) persistent symptoms-respiratory symptoms, including nasal discharge or cough or both, that lasted more than 10 days and were not improving (symptom score at 10 days $50% of highest score); (2) severe symptoms-a combination of purulent (thick, colored, and opaque) nasal discharge plus temperature >39 C for at least 72 hours; or (3) worsening symptoms-sudden onset of respiratory symptoms or fever after apparent improvement, usually beyond the sixth day of illness. 22 Samples of nasal mucus were obtained using an established nose blowing technique. 18, 23 Saline was sprayed into each nostril and then blown into a plastic "baggie." Two milliliters of a solution containing buffered saline (pH 7.4) along with 0.5% gelatin was added to the baggie; the contents were transferred to a sterile tube, processed, and frozen.
