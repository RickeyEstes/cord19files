A convenience sample of 288 Hong Kong secondary school students (aged 14-18 years) was surveyed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (May 12-22, 2009) with a response rate of 98%. The students reported their demographic information (sex and age) and knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive precautions regarding H1N1. All participations were voluntary, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the University Ethics Committee. The students were provided with a symptom checklist (yes/no answers) on which to indicate the presence of influenza symptoms, including headache, muscle pain, cough, difficulty breathing, dizziness, sore throat, chills, and fever, within the previous 14 days. They were also asked about experiencing influenza in the previous 14 days. Specific questions assessing knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission included the following: (1) "Do you think H1N1 could transmit via the airborne route?"; (2) "Do you think H1N1 could transmit via water?"; and (3) "Do you think H1N1 could transmit via body contact?" with responses of "agree/ disagree/not sure." An indication variable (1 item/2 items/all 3 items) was created to determine the number of correct answer (agreeing with the statements) regarding knowledge of routes of H1N1 transmission. Risk perception assessment included perceived risks of H1N1 infection, perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and perceived risks of H1N1 infection compared with the 2007 H5N1 pandemic. Adoption of the following preventive precautions during the H1N1 pandemic was investigated: (1) washing hands with soap or alcohol pad, (2) washing hands immediately after sneezing or coughing, (3) washing hands after contacting contaminated objects, (4) covering mouth when coughing or sneezing, and (5) wearing a mask. The number of preventive precautions reported by the student was then recorded (0-1 item/2-3 items/4-5 items). The regression models revealed that adoption of 4-5 preventive precautions was significantly related to female sex (adjusted OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.47-4.16) and correct answers to all questions about knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission (adjusted OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.39-4.17) ( Table 1) . A high absolute perceived risk of H1N1 infection (adjusted OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.10-2.98), but not a comparative perceived risk of H1N1 infection, was significantly associated with adoption of most preventive precautions.
