The basic reproduction number can be estimated through a variety of models. 5 In this section, we have compared three most popular estimates of ܴ /ܴ as shown below.  The reproduction number ܴ can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function. Note that if the empirical distribution of serial interval is used or ‫ݓ‬ ‫ݏ‬ are given, then .
