There was a large hospital-associated MERS outbreak in South Korea from May to July 2015, and environmental disinfection was emphasized after the end of the outbreak. 5 Patient rooms where confirmed patients with MERS stayed were cleaned with sodium hypochlorite (500 ppm) 6 times after discharge. Low-level disinfectants including sodium hypochlorite, alcohol, and quaternary ammonium compounds are effective for MERS coronavirus. 6 After the cleaning process, rooms were disinfected by hydrogen peroxide vapor as previously described. 3, 6, 7 As 45 patients with MERS changed rooms and used 2-or 6-bed rooms as private, 5,8 a total of 86 rooms with 214 beds were disinfected, which represented 11.0% of the total 1,941 beds. We retrospectively collected disinfection records, the number of inpatients in person-days (PD), the use of antibiotics as daily defined dose per 10 3 PD, 9 and microbiologic data from January to December 2015. Considering that the decrease of MDROs was observed for only 2 months after the MERS outbreak, this period (August to September 2015) was defined as the "post-outbreak period." The MERS outbreak period (June to July 2015) and the post-outbreak period were compared with the non-outbreak period (the rest of 2015). MRDOs included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), third-generation cephalosporinresistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas (CRP), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter. Clostridium difficile was not included because of limited cases in our center. The Student t test was used for statistical comparison using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). All P values were 2-tailed and P <.05 was considered statistically significant.
