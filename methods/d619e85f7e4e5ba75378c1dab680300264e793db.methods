Stool specimens were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to create 10% suspensions. Nasal swab specimens were collected in UTM-RT Mini tubes (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy), blended, centrifuged, and used for extraction. A QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was employed to extract viral nucleic acid from stool suspensions, nasal swabs and sera. The nucleic acid was amplified by a two-step RT-PCR method as described previously [23] . Primers covered a part of the conserved polymerase gene region and were designed to recognize all HCoVs in the first PCR step, and more specifically group 1B (229E and NL63, now classified as alphacoronaviruses), group 2A (OC43 and HKU1, now lineage A of betacoronaviruses) and SARS-CoV in the second step. PCR products were recognized in agarose gel electrophoresis and the HCoV types were finally determined by sequencing. For the other viruses studied, RT-PCR was used for rotaviruses and caliciviruses [26, 27] , PCR was used for human bocaviruses [28] and ProSpecT enzyme immunoassay kits (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) were used for adenoviruses and astroviruses. In addition, samples that tested positive for the adenovirus antigen were also tested using the PCR method based on Allard et al. [29] to distinguish enteric adenoviruses from non-enteric types. IBM SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA) was utilized for statistical analysis. Fisher's exact test or 2 test were used according to the criteria for the tests, and p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
