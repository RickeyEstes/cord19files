The P. pastoris secretion vector pPICZ (Invitrogen) was converted into a Gateway destination vector by cutting with XhoI, Wlling in the ends with Klenow polymerase, and ligating in the Gateway reading frame B cassette (Invitrogen). The new destination vector was named pDest-910. An internal XhoI site in the Hy3 gene was removed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Strategene). The product of this mutagenesis was used as the template for PCR ampliWcation. The Hy3 coding sequence was ampliWed with primers in two stages. For Wve cycles the reaction contained the amino primer GGCCTCG AGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTTGTGATCTGCC TCAGACCC (XhoI site underlined) and the carboxy primer GGGGACAACTTTGTACAAGAAAGTTGC GGCCGCTTATTCCTTCCTCCTTAATCTTTCTTG (NotI site underlined). After 5 cycles an adapter primer for the 5Ј side of the gene was added (GGGGAC AACTTTGTACAAAAAAGTTGGCCTCGAGAAAA GAGAGGCTG) and cycling was continued for 15 more cycles (Platinum Taq HiFidelity Supermix (Invitrogen), primers at 200 M). This PCR product contained modi-Wed attB sites, attB1.1, CAACTTT GTACAAAAAA GTTG, and attB2.1 CAACTTTGTACAAGAAAG TTG. These sites give about four times as many colonies in a Gateway BP reaction as the original attB1 and attB2 sites [8] . The PCR product was puriWed with QiaQuick PCR puriWcation columns (Qiagen). An aliquot of PCR product was digested with XhoI and NotI and ligated into pPICZ cut with the same enzymes (REaL expression clone). A second aliquot was cloned into pDonr223 (spectinomycin-resistant version of pDonr221, Invitrogen) by the Gateway BP reaction according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The inserts in both REaL and Gateway clones were fully sequenced. Then the insert in the Gateway entry clone was transferred by recombina- tion into pDest-910 to make the Gateway expression plasmid. The Gateway and REaL expression plasmids were electroporated into P. pastoris strain X33 and selected on Zeocin (100 g/ml) plates (http://www.teknova.com) at 30°C (Invitrogen "EasySelect" manual, http://www. invitrogen.com/content/sfs/manuals/easyselect_man.pdf). Colonies were picked into YPDS medium, grown at 30°C, and glycerol stocks were made according to the EasySelect manual. For P. pastoris fermentations, seed cultures of each strain (REaL or Gateway) were grown at 28°C in BMGY medium (EasySelect manual) in shake Xasks, and used to inoculate 1 L of basal salts medium containing 4% glycerol with trace mineral (PTM) salts (EasySelect manual) in New Brunswick BioFlow 110 minifermenters. Both fermentations were transitioned to methanol feeding, with a maximum of 12 ml methanol per L per hour. Aliquots were removed and centrifuged, and supernatants were applied to an SDS-PAGE gel, or diluted in PBS and spotted on nitrocellulose, next to aliquots of puriWed IFN-2c. The nitrocellulose membrane probed with rabbit anti-human IFN-2a (1:10,000 dilution in 2% dry milk), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was developed using SuperSignal West Femto reagent (Pierce). Putative interferon proteins were enriched by ion-exchange chromatography, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, and excised for N-terminal sequence determination by automated Edman degradation. Antiviral and antiproliferative assays of Hy3 activity were performed according to [9, 10] , respectively.
