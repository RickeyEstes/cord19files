Between June 2010 and January 2012, all 1,882 feline faecal samples submitted to a reference laboratory a by veterinary surgeons from first opinion small animal veterinary practices in the UK for a real-time PCR assay evaluating a panel of 8 enteropathogens b were considered. However, only samples collected from diarrhoeic cats were included in the current study (N = 1151). Additional data were recorded from the submission form when available, including age, gender and breed. Total nucleic acid was extracted from faeces by using the QIAamp DNA Blood BioRobot MDx Kit on an automated Qiagen platform (BioRobot MDx) according to the manufacturer instructions with slight modifications. Realtime PCR at IDEXX Vet Med Lab was performed using the LightCycler 480 system (Roche) with proprietary forward and reverse primers and hydrolysis probes. Target genes for enteropathogen detection using real-time PCR were as follows: feline coronavirus 7b gene (DQ010921.1), feline panleukopenia virus VP2 gene (EU252145), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene (AM888388), Salmonella enterica invasion A gene (EU348366), Giardia smallsubunit rRNA gene (DQ836339), Tritrichomonas foetus 5.8S rRNA gene (AF339736), Cryptosporidium smallsubunit rRNA gene (A093489), and Toxoplasma gondii internal transcribed spacer-1 gene (L49390). Real-time PCR was run with 6 quality controls, including PCR-positive controls, PCR negative controls, negative extraction controls, an internal positive control (IPC) spiked into the lysis solution to monitor the nucleic acid extraction efficiency and presence or absence of inhibitory substances, RNA quality control, and an environmental contamination monitoring control. Panels containing weak or borderline positive results (n = 16) and those from pooled faecal samples (n = 47) were excluded, resulting in 1088 samples being used in this study.
