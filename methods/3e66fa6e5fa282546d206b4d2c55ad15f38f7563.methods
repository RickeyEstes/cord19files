The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital. This was a retrospective observational cross-sectional study in which we analyzed the HRCT scans of 71 patients from several hospitals in different states in Brazil between July and September of 2009. The study population included patients presenting with flu-like symptoms and diagnosed with H1N1 infection, regardless of age or gender. The inclusion criterion was the diagnostic confirmation of H1N1 infection through laboratory testing (viral culture or real-time PCR) of aspiration material or of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. Another inclusion criterion was the required availability of complete chest HRCT scans of each study patient, performed during the acute phase of the disease. Patients with other pulmonary infections, confirmed through laboratory tests, were excluded, as were those with tomographic findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement resulting from chronic lung diseases. All HRCT scans were obtained 2-10 days after the onset of symptoms. As multiple institutions were involved, imaging examination was performed with different tomography scanners, using the high-resolution technique, in accordance with the following protocol: patient in the supine position; 1to 2-mm slice thickness in increments of up to 10 mm, from the lung apices through the hemidiaphragm, at the end of a deep inhalation; and a high spatial resolution reconstruction algorithm. Parenchymal and mediastinal window settings (width = 1,400-1,600 HU; level = −600 to −800 HU; and width = 350-450 HU; level =
