Cloning and Protein Purification. A human USP9X (amino acids 1,551-1,970) construct was cloned into the pET28-MHL vector (GenBank EF456735), which encodes a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavable N-terminal His 6 -tag. Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All USP9X proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain grown in Terrific Broth using a LEX bioreactor (Epiphyte3) or in LB media using a shaker incubator. Cells were grown at 37°C until the OD 600 reached 1.5 and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18°C overnight using the LEX bioreactor. Alternatively, shaker flask culture was grown at 37°C until the OD 600 reached 0.6 and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at 16°C overnight. For USP9X purification, all buffers were adjusted to pH 8.0 at room temperature. Harvested cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and benzamidine and lysed using sonication for 10 min with 5-/7-s on/off cycles (Sonicator 3000; Misonix). The crude extract was then centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The protein was batch-absorbed using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), washed with 25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, and eluted with an elution buffer (25 mM Tris, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP). The His 6 -tag was removed by overnight incubation with His 6 -tagged TEV protease during dialysis in 25 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Uncleaved protein and the TEV protease were removed by passing through Ni-NTA resin, and the target protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q; GE Healthcare). The protein was further purified using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. Pooled fractions were concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Ultra, molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa) to 20 mg/mL, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. USP2 CD was used as a control, and its expression and purification were described previously (42) . Ub-β-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium derivative (Ub 1-75 -MESNA) was generated as previously described (32) . Briefly, Ub 1-75 was expressed as an intein fusion using a Ub 1-75 -pTYB1 plasmid transformed into BL21(DE3) strain. Cells were cultured in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37°C and the overexpression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at an OD 600 of 0.6 for 16-18 h at 16°C. Cells were harvested via centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol. Cells were lysed on the ice, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with chitin resin (New England Biolabs) at 4°C for 2 h. Subsequently, the chitin resin was washed with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and equilibrated with 20 mM MES (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl. The resin was then incubated with 50-mL cleavage buffer containing 20 mM MES (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, 75 mM β-MESNA salt for 12 h at room temperature to yield activated Ub 1-75 -MESNA. Ub 1-76 and its Lys-to-Cys mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells using a Ub 1-76 -pET3a plasmid. Cells were lysed in 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.5), 50 mM NaCl and heat treated to precipitate E. coli proteins. Subsequently, the supernatant was saturated with ammonium sulfate (80%) and centrifuged to isolate precipitate, which was redissolved in a buffer containing 20 mM MES (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl, and further purified on a HiLoad Superdex 200-pg column (GE Healthcare). Protein purity was assessed by SDS/PAGE, and the protein identity was confirmed using a Xevo Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Crystallization. A surface entropy reduction (43) mutation (K 1637 E 1638 to two alanines) was introduced to crystalize USP9X CD. Crystal used for X-ray data collection was grown at room temperature using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 0.5-μL protein (20 mg/mL) with 0.5-μL reservoir solution containing 20% PEG3350 and 0.2 M diammonium tartrate. Crystal was cryoprotected by first immersion in the well solution supplemented with 10% ethylene glycol, then in Paratone-N (Hampton Research) before being flash frozen. Structure Determination and Refinement. X-ray diffraction data for USP9X were collected at temperature 100 K at beamline 19ID of Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. The datasets were processed using the HKL-3000 suite (44) and indexed in the P2 1 space group. Imposition of C2 symmetry incurred a significantly higher penalty than P2 and was not pursued. The USP9X structure was solved by molecular replacement using PDB ID code 1NBF as a search template with BALBES (45) . The graphics program COOT (46) was used for model building and visualization. Restrained refinement was performed using REFMAC v5.8 (47) incorporating NCS restraints. The final structure was validated by MOLPROBITY (48) and deposited in the PDB under ID code 5WCH (49) . Raw diffraction images were deposited in the Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (50) under doi:10.18430/m35wch. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1 . The two mutations K 1637 E 1638 AA are located on helix α3 and did not impact structure analysis. Di-and PolyUb DUB Cleavage Assays. DiUb cleavage assay was performed using 5 μM diUb and 0.5 μM USP9X CD in a 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT at 37°C. Reactions were quenched at specified time points using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher) and the products resolved using SDS/PAGE. TriUb and tetraUb assays were performed using 2.5 μM polyUb and 0.5 μM USP9X CD in 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. All di-, tri-, and tetraUb substrates were purchased from UBPBio. For Western blotting, Ub was probed using P4D1 monoclonal antibody (BioLegend). IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR) were used for indirect detection, and the results were visualized using an Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system. Generation of ABPs and Assays Using the ABPs. The monoUb-based probe was synthesized by reacting the Ub 1-75 -MESNA with PA or Gly-VME for 40 min followed by HiTrap SP HP cation exchange (GE Healthcare) column purification. To make diUb-NC1-PA2 probes, HA-tagged Ub 1-75 -MESNA was first reacted with an NC molecule followed by deprotection, as previously described to obtain HA-Ub 1-75 -NC (33) . In parallel, a mutant Ub 1-75 -MESNA with a Lys-to-Cys mutation at the selected lysine site was reacted with PA as described above to generate Cys-Ub-PA. After cation-exchange purification, equal molar amounts of HA-Ub-NC and Cys-Ub-PA were incubated at 0.5 mg/mL each in a 20 mM MES (pH 6.5) buffer containing 0.03 mM EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was purified using an SP column followed by buffer exchange to a 20 mM MES (pH 6.5) buffer to yield the diUb-NC1-PA2 probes. To make diUb-MA1 probes, HA-Ub 1-75 -MESNA was first reacted with a MA linker molecule followed by deprotection as previously reported for generating HA-Ub 1-75 -MA (32) . Concurrently, full-length Ub 1-76 with a Lys-to-Cys mutation for the desired linkage was purified as described above. HA-Ub 1-75 -MA was then incubated with Cys-Ub 1-76 on ice at 0.5 mg/mL concentration each in a 20 mM MES (pH 6.5) buffer containing 0.03 mM EDTA. The reaction mixture was then purified using an SP column followed by buffer exchange to a 20 mM MES (pH 6.5) solution to yield diUb-MA1 probes. Assays of WT USP9X CD and mutants using monoUb and diUb-NC1-PA2 ABPs were performed in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT at room temperature for 2 h with 2-μM probes. DiUb-MA1 labeling assays with USP9X CD and mutants were conducted in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) buffer with no additional DTT present for 1 h at room temperature with 4-μM probes. For comparison, labeling assays using K6-, K11-, K48-, and K63linked diUb-MA1 and diUb-NC1-PA2 probes (∼4 μM) were performed alongside HA-Ub-VME and HA-Ub-PA against USP9X CD and USP9X Δ (1924) (1925) (1926) (1927) (1928) (1929) (1930) (1931) (1932) (1933) (1934) (1935) (1936) (1937) (1938) (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7) buffer with no additional DTT present for 1 h at room temperature. For all labeling assays, the WT and mutant USP9X CD concentrations were 1.4 μM. Generation of DiUb-AMC Fluorescent Substrates and Fluorescence-Based DUB Assays. AMC-derived Ub, and Ub-like proteins (SUMO1, NEDD8, ISG15) (Boston Biochem) were used in fluorescence-based DUB assays to measure the activity of USP9X CD. Assays were carried out in 10-μL reaction volumes in 384-well black polypropylene PCR plates (PCR-384-BK; Axygen) and the fluorescence was measured on a Synergy plate reader (Biotek). For AMC assays, 10 nM USP9X was mixed with 0.5 μM AMC substrate in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 2 mM DTT, and the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 360 and 460 nm, respectively, with a 40-nm bandwidth filter. All kinetic parameters were determined using Michaelis-Menten regression analysis in Prism 6 software (GraphPad). Continuous diUb cleavage assays were performed using 50 nM USP9X CD and 500 nM K11-(Pos4, #UF-440; Boston Biochem) or 200 nM K63-(K63-2, #DU6302; LifeSensors) IQF-diUb substrates in an optimized USP9X buffer (20 mM Bicine, pH 8.0, 0.004% Triton X-100, 0.6 mM DTT), with excitation and emission wavelengths at 530 and 575 nm, respectively. Alternatively, for full kinetic analysis of K11 IQF-diUb and Ub-AMC substrate, 10-25 nM WT and mutant USP9X CD was used. Assays were performed in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 1 mM DTT at 25°C. Fluorescence was measured using a Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba). For Ub-AMC, excitation and emission wavelengths at 355 and 440 nm were used, respectively. For IQF-diUb, excitation and emission wavelengths at 544 nm and 572 nm were used, respectively. K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb-NC1-AMC2 fluorescent substrates were generated by first reacting Ub 1-75 -MESNA containing a respective cysteine mutation at K11, K48, or K63 with 32 mM glycine-AMC in the presence of 0.5 M MESNA, 0.17 M collidine and 5 mg/mL N-hydroxysuccinimide for 40 h. The resulting reaction mixture was treated with 10 mM DTT overnight, purified using an SP column with a salt gradient (50-500 mM NaCl) and buffer exchanged into a 20 mM MES (pH 6.5) buffer. Following purification, the cysteine-containing Ub-AMC was reacted with Ub-NC to generate diUb-NC1-AMC2 substrate ( Fig. 2A) and further purified using an SP column with a salt gradient from 100 mM to 1 M NaCl. Fluorogenic assay was performed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 1 mM DTT at 25°C. Fluorescence was measured using a Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba) with excitation and emission wavelength at 355 and 440 nm, respectively. Generation of Hybrid TriUb Probes. K11-, K48-, and K63-linked triUb probes were generated chemoenzymatically in two steps as shown in Fig. 2B . First, diUbs containing a native isopeptide and appropriate Lys-to-Cys mutation were generated enzymatically. Specifically, mouse E1 and E2-25K at 0.5 μM and 5 μM, respectively, were incubated with ∼7 mg/mL of Ub K48C and Ub D77 in the presence of 2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM DTT to generate K48-diUb. Similarly, mouse E1, E2 complex Ubc13/Mms2, Ub K63C and Ub D77 were used to generate K63C diUb. Mouse E1, Ube2s-UBD, and AMSH at 0.5 μM, 5 μM, and 0.5 μM were incubated with Ub K11C and Ub D77 to generate K11-diUb adapted from the previously reported method (51) . All reactions were performed overnight in a reaction volume of 500 μL with buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM creatine, 0.6 unit inorganic phosphatase, and 0.6 unit creatine phosphokinase at 37°C. The reaction mixture was buffer exchanged to a buffer containing 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) and 50 mM NaCl, and purified using an SP column. To generate hybrid triUb probes, the enzymatically synthesized diUb with a position-specific cysteine introduced in the distal Ub was incubated with an equal molar amount of HA-Ub 1-75 -NC or HA-Ub 1-75 -MA for 3 h at room temperature to generate triUb-NC1-CL2 and triUb-MA1-CL2 probes, respectively. The reaction mixture was then buffer exchanged into ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) and purified using an SP column. Alternatively, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min and directly injected into a Superdex 75 pg size-exclusion column in 20 mM MES (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA. The probes were characterized using SDS/PAGE and Xevo Q-TOF-MS. Protein concentration was determined using a combination of Bradford assay and SDS/PAGE based quantification. Hybrid triUb probe assays were conducted in a 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) buffer containing 1 mM DTT for triUb-NC1-CL2 cleavage assay while no additional DTT was present for triUb-MA1-CL2 assay. All diUb-MA1 labeling assays were performed at room temperature for 1 h unless otherwise noted, and all triUb-MA1-CL2 labeling assays were performed at room temperature for up to 2 h. Assays with triUb-MA1-CL2 were performed with ∼1.4 μM enzyme and 4-μM probe, while cleavage assays with triUb-NC1-CL2 were performed with 2.8-μM enzyme and 2-μM probe. In-Gel Digestion and High-Resolution MS/MS Analysis. To identify the cysteine residues responsible for labeling with the K11-diUb-MA1 probe, large-scale labeling of USP9X CD mutants was performed. Labeling bands were excised and cut into 1-mm 3 pieces and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Gel pieces were destained at 37°C in a 50% acetonitrile solution containing 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min and repeated until all stain was removed. The proteins in the gel pieces were reduced by incubation with 10 mM DTT at 60°C for 10 min and alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in a 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. After removal of the IAA solution, gel pieces were shrunk with acetonitrile, dried, and incubated in 50 μL of 0.01 mg/mL trypsin at 37°C overnight. Following digestion and extraction, samples were lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were redissolved in 0.1% TFA solution and introduced into Q-Exactive Orbitrap via UPLC column. Subsequent proteomics analysis was performed with Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (ThermoFisher).
