An anatomically accurate 3-dimensional upper respiratory tract model including all nasal cavities, the oropharynx, trachea and first three bifurcations of the bronchial tree was designed from CT scan images from a 4-year-old female child (99 cm in height, 16 kg in weight), and re-constructed using 3-D printing technology [20] . Experiments were conducted in a water tank (1.5 m Â 1.0 m Â 1.2 m), as shown in Fig. 1a ; a cylindrical acrylic vessel was used as the chest cavity to contain the lower respiratory tract.
