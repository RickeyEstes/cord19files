Animnls. Groups of six male Fischer-344 rats (CDF (F-344)/CrlBR; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Kingston, NY) were exposed to DMA at a concentration of 175 ppm, 6 hr per day for 1,2,4, or 9 days or 2 years. The 2 year animals were part of a CIIT sponsored bioassay (Buckley et al., 1984) . Six animals were examined at each concentration. Two groups of control animals were used in this study, 12 acute control animals (6 weeks old) and 6 chronic control animals (2 years old) derived from the DMA bioassay. The terminal body weights ofthe animals were 241.67 2 4.99,238.17 + 4.29, 225.33 f 1.84, 221.08 f 3.17, and 346.50 f 9.82 for animals exposed for 1, 2,4, or 9 days or 2 years, respectively, and 228.25 + 4.20 and 355.83 f 11.92 for the acute and chronic control groups (values are expressed as means in grams +-SE). Animals for the acute study were housed in polycarbonate cages on wire racks, over heat-treated hardwood bedding. They were transferred to stainless steel exposure cages which were placed on top of the stainless steel cage racks in the exposure chambers during the exposure periods. Chronic study animals were housed individually in hanging stainless steel wire-mesh cages in the exposure chambers. Pretesting of the chamber for concentration calibration indicated that the concentration of DMA was stable and was found to be within 10% of the nominal concentration at all points within the chamber (W. H. Steinhagen, personal communication) . During periods of nonexposure, the animals were provided with food (NIH-07 open formula diet, Ziegler Brothers, Gardners, PA) analyzed for selected contaminants (Lancaster Labs, Lancaster, PA) and tap water ad libitum. The chambers housing the animals were maintained on a 12hour light/dark cycle. All animals used in the acute phase of this study had negative viral titers in a standard murine virus antibody determination (Microbiological Associates Inc.). Sera from selected animals in the chronic study chambers (none were from animals used in this study) were negative with the exception of a few (3/ 12 controls, l/ 12 175 ppm DMA) positive results for rat corona virus. Exposures. The method for test atmosphere generation and analysis was described in detail by Buckley et al. (1985) and is outlined briefly here. Dimethylamine (99.97% pure) was obtained from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Fogelsville, PA). Rats were exposed and housed in 8-m' glass and stainless steel chambers with a total airllow of 2200 liters/min. The analytical concen-FIG. 1.

The numbering system is the same as that used in previous work . tration of DMA, expressed as a time-weighted average over the entire 24 months of exposure, was 175.1 + 1.9 (ppm + SD). Temperature and relative humidity were 7 1.5 f 0.9"F and 55.1 + 6.1%, respectively. The temperature and relative humidity in the control chamber were 71.7 f 0.8"F and 50.8 + 4.8%. Pure DMA was metered from the cylinder through flow meters into the supply airstream. Test atmosphere analysis was performed at 15-min intervals by infrared spectrometry. Mucociliaty studies and histopathology Rats were killed by decapitation within 1 hr of the end of the exposure period. Following the procedure described by Morgan et al. (1984) , the nasal cavity was opened by rapid dissection. The dissected tissues were placed in a 145-ml stainless steel and glass observation chamber which was maintained at 36-38Â°C. Humidified air was passed through the chamber at a rate of 1 liter/min during the entire observation period. The surface of the nasal mucosa was lighted with a fiber-optic light on a microscope fitted with long-working distance objectives. The mucosal surface was examined and mucus flow patterns, ciliary activity, features of nasal structure, and abnormalities of mucociliary function were recorded manually on maps of the nasal passages. Video recordings were made at 12 preselected locations (Figs. la and lb) for subsequent video analysis. Video recordings to be used for the determination of mucus flow rates were made within 20 min after death because previous work has shown that mucus flow remains fairly constant for at least 20 min after death in untreated F-344 rats . Maps of the rat nasal passages were used to record times of the various recordings as well as observations on the nature and extent of defects in mucociliary function. Ciliastasis was defined as absence of visible ciliary beat. Mucus flow rates were determined from video recordings by timing the travel of particles in the mucus epiphase over a calibrated distance on the monitor. The statistical significance of flow rate data was assessed by one-way analysis of variance. Dunnett's multiple range test with a pooled estimate of variance was used to compare each treatment group to the appropriate control group. A nominal statistical significance level of 0.05 was selected. Because there was a difference between flow rates of acute and chronic control animals, data from treated animals were compared with the data of the respective controls. A computer software package (RS/ 1, BBN Research System, Cambridge, MA) was used for the statistical analyses. Following mucus flow studies, tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered forrnalin and processed to paraffin, and 6-pm sections were cut, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy.
