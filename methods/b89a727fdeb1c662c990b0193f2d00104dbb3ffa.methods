We searched the English and Chinese literature in PubMed, CNKI and Google scholar databases with the keywords including "private hospitals in China", "hospital ownership", "public and private hospital", "private hospital development". The data was collected from China Health Statistics Yearbook [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] from 2005-2016 and the website of "the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) Statistics" (http://stats.oecd.org) [25] . The descriptive statistical analysis was used to access the development of the private hospital in China and OECD countries. Without employing any statistical inference method to explore the causes and consequences of the time trend, the statements in the discussion part are implication of the descriptive results. In future research, more comprehensive data and analysis can provide a stronger evidence to understand the topic. According to the China Health Statistics Yearbook, the hospitals in China could be divided into public hospitals and private hospitals by ownership. The public hospitals are defi ned in this study as the hospitals whose registered business type is state-owned or collectiveowned, while the others are private. The data of private/public hospital number and hospital beds in OECD countries was obtained from the website of "OECD Statistics" (http://stats.oecd.org), in the parts of "Health-Health Care Resources-Hospitals" and "Health-Health Care Resources-Hospital beds". The website of "OECD Statistics" is available for the public. Excluding the countries with no or not enough data of required indicators (for example, there are 33 countries in terms of the hospital number, however, only 24 countries are available.) during the research period, total 22 OECD countries are analyzed in this paper. Specifi cally, the data of Poland and Hungary after 2011 is not available from this website, therefore the data in 2011 was used in this paper [25] . We assess the development of private hospitals in China by examining both of the change in supply capacity and health care delivery. The number of hospitals, number of hospital beds and the average number of hospital beds per hospital were employed to measure the supply capacity. The visit number, inpatients number and bed occupancy rate (BOR) were used to measure the healthcare delivery. The number of outpatients in hospitals by ownership is not available in the dataset of China Health Statistics Yearbook, so we used the visit number and inpatient number instead of the outpatient number [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The share of private/public hospitals' number (in all hospitals) was calculated by dividing the number of private/public hospitals by overall number of all types of hospital in China. The share of private/ public hospital beds (in all hospitals) was calculated by dividing the number of private/public hospital beds by overall number of hospital beds in all types of hospitals. The average number of hospital beds per hospital was calculated by dividing the overall number of private or publicly owned hospital beds by overall number of private or publicly owned hospital numbers [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The visit number includes outpatients, emergency patients, patients for health checkup and health counseling. The bed occupancy rate was calculated by the following formula: Culmulative Inpatient days ×100 Number of beds×days The development of private hospitals in OECD countries were also studied in this paper in contrast with China. The OECD has included major developed countries in the world. Their experience developing private hospitals can provide reference for China. Table 1 showed the time trend in hospital size on average by private and public hospitals. Both of the private and public hospitals increased in size by year. The average number of hospital beds of the private and public hospitals increased from 45 and 149 beds per hospital in 2005 to 75 and 351 in 2016, respectively. However, the disparity in size between private and public hospitals was increasing. The average publicly owned hospital bed number was around 3.32 times of private in 2005, while 4.67 times in 2016. Combining the results in Figure 1 and Table 1 relatively smaller than the public ones during this period. It should be noticed that, from the aspect of inpatients, the growth of the delivery (represented by the share of inpatients) caught up with the growth of private hospital's supply capacity (represented by the share of private hospital beds). During 2005-2016, the share ratio of private hospital' inpatients and beds maintained around 70%. However, from the aspect of visits, the delivery (represented by the share of visits) lagged behind the growth of private hospital's supply capacity. The share ratio of private hospital's visits and beds decreased from around 80% (4.80%/5.89%) in 2005, to 60% (12.9%/21.69%) in 2016. Figure 4 further compared the BOR of hospital beds between private and public hospitals in China during 2005-2016. The BOR of both private and public hospitals increased from 49.80% and 71.50% in 2005, to 62.80% and 91.00% in 2016, respectively. From Figure 4 , we could fi nd that the BOR of private hospitals reached the highest in 2013 (63.40%), and then slightly decreased in the following years. And the publicly owned hospital had the similar trend and reached the highest in 2012 (94.20%), then went back down a bit. Although the bed occupancy rate of private hospitals was increasing in general, it was still much lower than public hospitals. In 2016, the bed
