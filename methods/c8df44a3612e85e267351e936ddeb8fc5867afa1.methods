In this section we introduce mathematical models for an "SIR" (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic in a single well-mixed population and in a metapopulation made up of several subpopulations. We assume that the intervention is initiated at a specific time t * (typically once the cumulative number of infections I + R reaches some threshold), and that the intervention lasts for a fixed duration D. In the metapopulation model, we compare outcomes when the intervention is implemented in all populations at the same time or in each individual population separately.
