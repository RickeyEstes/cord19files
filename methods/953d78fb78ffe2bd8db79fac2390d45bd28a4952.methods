Animals C57BL/6 (H-2 b ) mice (4-to 6-week-old female or male) were purchased from Samtako (O-San, Korea). CCR5 deficient (Ccr5 −/− ) mice and Foxp3 GFP knock-in mice (H-2 b ), which co-express EGFP and regulatory T cellspecific transcription factor Foxp3 under the control of an endogenous promoter, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Ccr5 −/− ·Foxp3 GFP mice were generated by crossing Ccr5 −/− mice with Foxp3 GFP knock-in mice. All mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of Chonbuk National University.
