Genes, expression vectors, protein expression and purification. Codon optimized H7 or N9 ectodomain encoding cDNAs (Genscript, USA) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (GISAID Isolate EPI439507, referred to as H7/human and N9/human) and of A/Anas crecca/Spain/1460/2008 (GenBank accession no. CAY39406, referred to as H7/teal and N9/teal) were cloned into expression plasmids similarly as described previously [20] [21] [22] . The HA ectodomain (a.a. 19-518; H3 numbering) encoding sequences were cloned in frame with sequences encoding a C-terminal artificial GCN4 trimerization motif 43 and a Strep-tag for affinity purification (IBA GmbH). The NA head domain (a.a. 71-465) encoding sequence was preceded by sequences successively coding for an N-terminal signal sequence, a double Strep-tag and an artificial GCN4 tetramerization domain 43 . The expression plasmids containing the H5 gene of A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (GenBank accession no. ACU65077.1) and the H1 gene of A/Kentucky/07 (GenBank accession no. CY028163) have been described earlier 21, 44 . The N1 head domain of A/Hubei/1/2010 (GenBank CY098760) was cloned similarly as described above. Site directed mutagenesis of the HA or NAencoding sequences was performed with the Quickchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). The HA and NA proteins were expressed in HEK293S GnT1 (2) or HEK293T cells and purified from the cell culture supernatants as described previously [20] [21] [22] . HA binding assays. Receptor-binding of HA was analyzed using a fetuin solid-phase binding and hemagglutination assays 20, 21 and by performing HA histochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissues similarly as described previously 24 . Glycan array analysis of the HA proteins was performed by the Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics as described previously 20, 21 . The fetuinbinding assays were performed at least twice in triplicate. The mean values of at least two independent experiments are shown. HA proteins were expressed in HEK293S GnT1(2) cells, except for the HA histochemistry, for which HA proteins expressed in HEK293T cells were used. NA activity assays. Activity of the NA proteins expressed in HEK293T cells was analyzed using a previously described fetuin-based assay 25 . In brief, fetuin-coated 96well plates, were incubated with limiting dilutions of recombinant soluble NA protein for 2 hour at 37uC. After washing, the plates were incubated with biotinylated peanut agglutinin (PNA, 2.5 mg/ml; Galab Technologies). Binding of PNA correlates with the amount of SIA released from galactose. The specificity of the NA proteins was determined by measuring the binding of biotinylated SNA or MAL I (both from Galab Technologies) after incubation of fetuin with NA. The binding of PNA, SNA and MAL-I was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. NA activity assays were performed at least twice in triplicate. The mean values of at least two independent experiments are shown. The amount of NA protein required for half maximum PNA binding (EC50) was determined using the GraphPad Prism software.
