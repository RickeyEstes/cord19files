This guidance on rapid advice guideline development is based upon an existing rapid review approach, which was modified to meet WHOs needs and to allow integration with the organization's existing approach to developing standard guidelines. The rapid review approach [6] and typology [7] were developed by the Knowledge Synthesis Group at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. This approach consists of an eight-step process based upon widely accepted systematic review methods, particularly those of the Cochrane Collaboration [6] . This approach has been used to develop rapid reviews for a variety of types of decision makers and has undergone modifications as needed to optimize the approach. In addition, this guidance on how to develop rapid advice guidelines was informed by discussions with WHO staff involved in emergency response (n 5 6), including staff from the Global Influenza Programme, Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses, Global TB programme, HIV Department, Emergency Risk Management Department, and the WHO Headquarters Library. The primary purpose of these informal dialogues was to become more familiar with the current WHO guideline process and to understand staff roles, experiences, and needs with regard to development of rapid advice guidelines. This was not considered research as there was no formal structure to the discussions and no data collection, analysis, or reporting. These discussions therefore did not require research ethics approval.
