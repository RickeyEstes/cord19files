Study site and population. The study was conducted in Kilifi County, a predominantly rural community on the Kenyan coast. The study population was recruited from local healthcare facilities including the Kilifi County Hospital and the Pingilikani dispensary. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and used for multiplex PCR diagnosis of 15 respiratory pathogens: RSV (A and B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3 and 4) adenovirus, influenza (A, B and C), coronavirus (OC43 and e229), human metapneumovirus and M. pneumoniae. Results from RSV-positive samples were confirmed using a direct fluorescent antibody test kit (Light Diagnostics, Merc) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A standardised set of clinical and anthropometric measures were collected for all study participants including: age, respiratory rate, axillary temperature, oxygen saturation, and history of upper respiratory tract symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose). To establish associations between RSV infection and the resident airway microbiota, children were stratified into two groups, RSV-positive and RSV-negative: in the RSV-positive group, only children who were positive for RSV (real-time cycle threshold values ≤ 27) and negative for all other targets on the multiplex panel were included. In the RSVnegative group, only children who were negative for all pathogens in the real-time PCR panel were included. Children with positive blood culture results were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was sought from the parents and legal guardians of all children who were sampled in this study. Ethical approval for the conduct of this study was granted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute's Scientific and ethical research unit (SERU). All study procedures were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practise (GCLP) standards. All measurements reported in this paper were obtained from individual children sampled once, with the exception of a subset of 10 children who were sampled during acute disease and at convalescence in order to examine the effect of RSV infection on Streptococcal colonisation. Sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The swabs that were collected from each study participant were initially stored at −80°C. For DNA extraction, samples were retrieved from storage, thawed on ice and cell pellets obtained by centrifuging samples for 10 min at 17,000×g, after which they were washed once using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 350 μl of a cell lysis buffer (RLT, qiagen) supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (1%) was added to the pellet and vortexed briefly to break up the pellet. Glass beads were then added to the sample and homogenisation was done by vortexing at maximum speed for 1 min. DNA extraction from the cell homogenate was done using the AllPrep RNA/DNA/ Protein kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA yields were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted for sequencing. Primers targeting this region were constructed with Illumina adaptor overhang sequences added to the gene-specific primer sequences. A region of ≈550 bp was targeted and amplified using the 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWG CAG-3′) and 785R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) primers appended with Illumina adaptor sequences. Amplifications were done in 25 µl reactions with 12.5 µl Q5 ® Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB), 1 µl of 1 µM forward and reverse 16S Amplicon PCR primer and 2.5 µl of template. The reactions were performed on ABI Veriti thermocyclers (Applied Biosytems) under the following conditions: 95°C for 3 min, 25 cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, followed by 72°C for 5 min and a final hold at 4°C. The amplified products were then verified on 1% agarose gel before purifying using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). A negative dH 2 O control was incorporated into the entire experimental workflow and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis in order to ensure that the workflow was free of extraneous bacterial contamination. This control was also included in subsequent library preparation and sequencing steps and confirmed to be free of extraneous bacterial contamination. Libraries were prepared by ligating Illumina dual indices and Illuminasequencing adaptors to the prepared amplicons using the NexteraXT index kit. Attachment of the indices was performed using 5 μl of the 16S amplicon DNA, 5 μl of Illumina Nextera XT Index Primer 1 (N7xx), 5 μl of Nextera XT Index Primer 2 (S5xx), 25 μl of Q5 ® Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB), and 10 μl of PCR-grade water (Ambion). The reactions were performed on ABI Veriti thermocyclers (Applied Biosytems) under the following conditions 95°C for 3 min, followed by eight cycles of: 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min and a final hold at 4°C. Each library was then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), and thereafter the size distribution and library quality control were carried out using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) to confirm the expected size distribution and the quality. The libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies). The barcoded libraries were normalised and pooled at equimolar concentration based on the Qubit results and 8 pM of the pooled library spiked with 5% Phix (v3) for sequencing. Sequencing was done on the Illumina MiSeq system using 2 × 300 bp PE sequencing with the MiSeq ® Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles). Analysis of the airway microbiome. A customised Python-based Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (https://qiime2.org/)-QIIME2 39,40 -workflow was adopted for analysis of raw Illumina reads and generation of the sequence table. Sequence quality control and feature table construction was done using DADA2 41 : low-quality sequencing reads were filtered out by trimming the reads at the nucleotide position at which a substantial drop in quality was observed. Error estimation, de-replication, construction of the sequence table and removal of chimeras was done using default DADA2 parameters. Taxonomies were assigned to the sequence table using a pre-trained Naïve Bayes classifier. The classifier was trained on the Greengenes 42 13_8 99% OTUs in which sequences were trimmed to represent the 16S region spanning 341F/785R V3/V4 primer pair. The sequence data have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive database (PRJEB28053). Analysis of the airway proteome. The host airway proteomes of children in this study were characterised in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 43 . A detailed description of this method can be found in Supplementary methods. The data arising from the mass-spectrometry analysis are deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium database 44 (Accession number: PXD009403). Analysis of the airway metaproteome was undertaken by searching the Raw mass spectrometer files (using MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.131) against a bacterial FASTA database, which was constructed by assembling Uniprot FASTA files of individual bacteria species that had been identified by genomic microbiota analysis into a single FASTA search file. Searches for bacterial proteins were done using the Andromeda search engine 45 . To test whether the mean expression levels of different host airway proteins were significantly different between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children, two-sided t-tests were conducted and adjustment for multiple testing done using the false discovery rate (fdr) method. Proteins were significantly differentially expressed if their mean expression level in one group was at least 1.5-fold greater than in the alternative group. GO biological pathway enrichment analysis was done on the enrichR bioinformatic pipeline 46, 47 . The output of this analysis was used to determine whether certain biological pathways were statistically overrepresented in the airway secretions of RSV-positive or RSV-negative children. The difference between the blood oxygen saturation levels of children with high (above median) neutrophil granule expression levels and those of children with low (below median) expression levels was analysed using Mann-Whitney test. Bacterial inhibition assay. Using a pure overnight culture of S. pneumoniae 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension was prepared in Mueller-Hinton broth with Tris ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium dodecyl sulfate (TES) buffer (Thermofisher) and standardised using a nephelometer. 100 µl of the suspension was transferred to a tube of Mueller-Hinton broth containing lysed horse blood. 50 µl of a 1:32 dilution of this mixture in minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma Aldrich) was then added to the wells of a U-bottomed 96-well plate. Nasal samples whose bacterial inhibition activity was to be measured were prepared as follows: 500 µl of raw nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs eluted in universal transport media (Copan diagnostics) were centrifuged at 17,000×g for 10 min and supernatants obtained. The supernatants were further spun at 17,000×g for 30 min on 3k Amicon centrifugal filter devices (Merck), to remove low molecular weight compounds (≤3 kDa). For each sample, the resulting concentrate was diluted over a 12-step doubling dilution series ranging from 1:20 to 1:40,960 in MEM. 50 µl of this preparation was then added to the plate containing the bacterial solution that had been prepared earlier and the plates were then incubated for 36 h in a 37°C incubator. After the incubation, the plates were visually inspected by two independent readers to determine the highest sample dilution at which bacterial growth was completely inhibited. The reciprocal of this dilution was referred to as the bacterial inhibition index (BII). Plates were also read on an optical microplate reader (BioTek) and optical densities at 630 nm determined. The correlation between airway protein expression level and bacterial inhibition activity was examined using Spearman's correlation analysis while the difference in bacterial inhibition activity between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children was tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Analysis of Pneumococcal antibodies in airway secretions. Two conserved pneumococcal antigens, pneumococcal histidine triad protein E 48 and cholinebinding protein D 48 were expressed as synthetic peptides and dissolved in a solution containing 70% dimethyl sulfoxide, 5% glycerol and 25% sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Each antigen was spotted on a functionalized Epoxy glass slide using a non-contact Inkjet microarray printer (Array jet). Slides were then dried at room temperature (RT) for 48 h and subsequently loaded onto hybridisation cassettes where they were initially washed twice with PBS containing Tween-20 and then twice with PBS only. Blocking was done for 1 h using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1× saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 4.5% sodium chloride (NaCl). Blocked slides were incubated at 41°C on a shaking platform. Nasal samples from study participants were first spun at 17,000×g for 5 min to obtain supernatants which were then filtered on 3K Amicon centrifugal filter devices (Merck). The resulting concentrates were supplemented at a 1:1 ratio with 5% BSA in PBS containing Tween-20. A total of 50 µl of this solution was added onto hybridisation cassette wells and the slides incubated for 4 h at 4°C on a shaking platform. After incubation, slides were washed as before. 1:500 dilutions of secondary antibodies-goat anti-human IgA conjugated to Alexa-fluor 555 (Southern biotech) and goat anti-human IgG conjugated to Alexa flour 647 (Invitrogen)-were mixed together and then added onto the slides, which were left to incubate for 1 h at 25°C. Following the incubation, slides were washed as above, disassembled from the cassettes, rinsed using Milli-Q water and spun dry for 5 min using a slide spinner. Slides were then read on a GenePix 4300A microarray scanner (Molecular devices). Pneumococcus-specific antibody levels against the two antigens were calculated automatically by the scanner software and expressed as background-corrected median fluorescence intensities (corrected median MFI). The difference in the levels of pneumococcus IgG between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children was tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Flow cytometry analysis of upper airway cells. One millilitre of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples obtained from children was centrifuged at 17,000×g for 7 min, after which 800 μl of the supernatant was removed and discarded. The remaining 200 μl were split into two aliquots of 100 μl each. The first aliquot was used for neutrophil phenotyping assays and the other was used for neutrophil phagocytosis assays. A volume of 20 μl of a pre-constituted cocktail of the following antibodies (from ThermoFisher) was used to label both aliquots-CD45, CD16, CD14, CD3, CD19, HLA-DR, CD66b, CD11b and a Live-dead marker. With the exception of the live/dead marker, all other antibodies were diluted 1:100 in FACS buffer. The live/dead marker was prepared at a 1:1000 dilution in FACS buffer. For the phagocytosis assay tube, 20 μl of opsonised E. coli was added to the tube (pHrodo Red E. coli BioParticles; ThermoFisher). The bacteria was initially prepared by mixing the E.coli strain with new-born calf sera followed by a 30-min incubation at 37°C. After this step, both tubes were incubated at 37°C for 35 min. After the incubation, 20 μl of a live-dead marker was added to each tube and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1X RBC lysis buffer followed by a 5 min incubation. Cells in each tube were then spun down at 2700×g for 1 min and the supernatant discarded. Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, after which 350 μl of FACS flow was added. Cells were then analysed immediately on a BD LSR Fortessa instrument. The following gating strategy was used to detect airway-resident neutrophils: Debris were excluded on the basis of their forward (FSC-A) and side (SSC-A) scatter characteristics (Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Doublets were excluded using FSC-A versus FSC-H ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ) and dead cells were excluded using the live-dead marker ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Cells that were double positive for CD66b and CD16 were gated as neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 5e ). Cells in this gate were further analysed for their ability to phagocytose a representative bacteria (E. coli) and the results expressed in a histogram plot (Supplementary Fig. 5d ). Data was analysed using FlowJo software. Reporting summary. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
