Descriptive content analysis was the methodology used for this study, as it has been considered as one of the most effective tools in analyzing the important features of Korean disaster management research resources and evaluating not only the tangible effects of research resources but also their intangible effects (FenRIAM, 2019; Vo, 2013) . The procedure of descriptive content analysis includes four steps: defining a research question, identifying information and data, reviewing collected information and data, and documenting a descriptive summary (Bengtsson, 2016) . In short, descriptive content analysis plays a role in assessing the significant characteristics of disaster management research resources by describing the outcomes of disaster management research resources. Meanwhile, relevant subjects and texts were identified, collected, and then interpreted for the research. For information and data identification, some terms (e.g., Johari window, principles of disaster management, science and technology policy, Korean disaster management, etc.) were searched in widely used search engines, such as ScienceDirect, EBSCO, Google.com, Oxford University Press, Korean search engines, etc. Moreover, the author performed subjective assessment to qualify the identified materials and resources. Primarily, as the Johari window was proposed about 65 years ago, not many researchers have discussed related issues in the 21 st century. Thus, the author identified or included as many articles or documents as possible on the Johari window into the references or resources for analyzed texts. In general, the majority of identified or collected references were labeled as favorites as shown in the results of the article. Using impact assessment, this article assesses (or evaluates) how the Korean field of disaster management research has been doing with its resources and what the field should do to improve the current situation and establish appropriate alternatives. In the process, the article analyzes all the resources of Korean disaster management research using the Johari perspective, with the goal of naming a current model and an alternative model on disaster management research resources. Similarly, this research has shown a comparative perspective between Korean-speaking researchers and English-speaking researchers regarding disaster management research resources. The comparative study leads to identifying many factors that are unique to national disaster management system when reflecting on traditional approaches, such as a single-case study, being too parochial, rigid, or even narrow in their theoretical process (Jreisat, 1975; Luft & Fakhouri, 1979) . Additionally, traditional approaches have not been based on cross-cultural situation. Therefore, this comparative study plays a role in fostering the development of effective planning and programs in the field, particularly by referring to the cross-language perspective. As can be seen in Table 1 , the two major stakeholders identified are Korean-speaking researchers and English-speaking researchers. These two groups have been directly or indirectly involved in all major resources of Korean disaster management research. Research resources written in other languages are excluded from the scope of this framework. By cross-checking the two stakeholders, four research resources, including open research resources, blind research resources, hidden research resources, and unknown research resources, are analyzed. Descriptive content analysis has been well known for its systematic review of the subject (Kim & Lennon, 2017) . Similarly, the Johari window has thoroughly pursued the systematic aspect of disaster management research resources by referring to open/free resources, blind resources, hidden resources, and unknown resources in that order (Newstrom & Rubenfeld, 1983) . The Johari window comprehensively includes not only the bright sides of research resources but also their dark sides. Considering these aspects, the Johari window technique is quite relevant for the methodology used in this article.
