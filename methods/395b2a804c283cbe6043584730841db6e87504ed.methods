In 2003, national public-health authorities in countries that have, or are planning, an HLIU were contacted by the EUNID coordination team, with the help of the European Commission, and asked to suggest (although not to formally endorse) clinicians with expertise in highly infectious disease/HLIU management as national representatives. The team also co-opted additional participants, selected for their experience in one or more aspects of highly infectious disease/HLIU management, including a representative of the group that developed similar guidance in the USA. 13 Thus, the skill mix and expertise of the group represented all key aspects of highly infectious disease/HLIU management (infectious diseases, intensive care, transport, engineering and maintenance, infection control, diagnostic services, occupational health, public health, and unit management). Group members presented details of arrangements in their countries for the management of patients with highly infectious diseases, heard (and questioned) expert presentations on HLIU management, and agreed a consensus defi nition of a highly infectious disease by discussion at the fi rst network meeting in 2005. 8 , 11 We then inventoried national and international guidelines, and used these, with relevant legislation and representatives' responses to a questionnaire, to identify key elements in the design and operational management of an HLIU, which were agreed by discussion at the network meeting in 2006. 9, 12 These elements formed the basis for a draft framework that incorporated evidence used to support current international and national guidance and legislation. This framework, with a draft defi nition of an HLIU, was shared throughout the network, and revised to incorporate comments and additional evidence. We used a questionnaire that off ered alternative solutions to particular design and management issues (eg, location and staffi ng of HLIUs, necessity for high effi ciency particulate air [HEPA] fi ltration) to structure group discussions, clarify preferred options, and agree consensus refi nements of the drafts at the third network meeting in 2007. 10 We then prepared this report, and shared it, and subsequent revisions, until the content was agreed by all.
