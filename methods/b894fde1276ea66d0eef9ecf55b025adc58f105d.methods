Chemicals. CM-II-sPLA 2 (P7778) and other sPLA 2 s obtained from A. mellifera honeybee venom (P9279), bovine pancreas (P8913) and S. violaceoruber (P8685) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. sPLA 2 from porcine pancreas was a kind gift from Sanyo Fine (Osaka, Japan). Manoalide was purchased from Abcam. 21 , SeV (Fushimi strain) 48 , VSNJV 46 , HSV-1 (CHR3 strain) 49 , EMCV (DK-27 strain) 46 , CV-B3 (Nancy strain) 50 , HIV-1 (NLCSFV3 strain) 51 and MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) 52 were described previously. HCV, DENV, JEV, SINV, VSNJV, HSV-1, EMCV and CV-B3 were prepared in Huh7it-1 cells 53 . FLUAV, HIV-1 and MERS-CoV were prepared in MDCK, HEK293T and Vero cells, respectively. SeV was prepared in embryonated eggs. The infectivity of all viruses except HIV-1 and MERS-CoV was determined on Huh7it-1 cells. Plaque assays were performed for SINV, VSNJV and EMCV by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 2 to 4 days under overlay medium containing 1% methylcellulose as described previously 46 and the viral titres were expressed as PFU/ml. For the remaining viruses except HIV-1, infectivity was determined by a FA method using specific antibodies against the respective viruses, and viral titres were expressed as CIU/ml as described previously, 21, [42] [43] [44] [45] 48 . Briefly, viral samples were serially diluted 10-fold in complete medium and inoculated onto Huh7it-1 cells seeded on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. After virus adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed with medium to remove residual virus and cultured for 24 h. The virus-infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with a virus-specific primary antibody for 1 h, followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated respective secondary antibodies for 1 h. Then, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. HIV-1 infectivity was determined by the TZM-bl assay using HIV-1 receptor-expressing HeLa cells, and the viral titres were expressed based on the β-galactosidase activity as reported previously 54 . MERS-CoV infectivity was determined by a FA method using a specific antibody 55 on Vero cells 24 h after infection and also by a TCID 50 assay on Vero cells by cultivating the virus-inoculated cells for 4 days, followed by fixing with phosphate-buffered formalin and staining with crystal violet 52 . The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (for cell growth) or 2% (for maintenance culture) foetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.
