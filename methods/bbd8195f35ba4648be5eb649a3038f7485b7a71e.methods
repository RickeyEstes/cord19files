The study was carried out between September 1 st and 30 th , 2009, at the University General Hospital of Ioannina, Greece, a tertiary teaching hospital with 850 beds providing secondary and tertiary care for a general population of 350,000. After the first moderate wave of the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in July and August, 2009, there was in the beginning of September an increasing public concern and fears about a new pandemic outbreak in autumn. Indeed, during the study, 8.8% of the referred patients were confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases, a proportion which increased rapidly, reaching a peak in the middle of November with 65.8% confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases, which decreased to 46.7% by the end of December, 2009. Overall, from September, 2009, to the end of December, 2009, 838 confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases were referred to our hospital, without any reported deaths. To assess HCWs' concerns and worries over the pandemic, their degree of perceived sufficiency of information concerning A/H1N1 influenza, their intended behavior during the pandemic and whether these factors were associated with psychological distress, the following self-reported questionnaires were administered, along with a request for demographic characteristics: (1) A questionnaire developed for this study comprising 20 items, which were chosen based on the available literature on the perceptions and opinions of experts regarding infectious disease outbreaks [Additional files 1 &2]. Eight items were dichotomous (Y/N) and 12 items were scored on a 9-point Likert scale from very little (1) to very much (9), very low (1) to very high (9) or strongly agree (9) to strongly disagree (1) ( Tables 1, 2 & 3) . Items were grouped in seven domains: (a) HCWs' concerns, worries and degree of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, (b) perceived sufficiency of information, (c) confidence in information received and measures taken by their department regarding A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, (d) perception of personal risk, (e) perception of being a risk to others (e.g. family and friends), (f) perception of stigmatization, isolation and sense of duty, and (g) work satisfaction. Cronbach's Î± score for factors consisting of items related to perceived information and information needs ranged from 0.68 to 0.89. Part-I of Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire [18] was also embedded in the questionnaire, which assesses the amount of desirable informational details about health issues required by the hospital worker, on a 5-point Likert scale. (2) To assess HCWs psychological distress, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) [19] was used. It comprises 28 items and, according to its standardization for the Greek population [20] , scores above 5 are indicative of mild to moderate psychological distress. Studies have also shown that scores above 11 are indicative of severe psychological distress [21] . As the total GHQ-28 score exceeds this recommended cut-off point, the probability of being assessed as having a psychiatric diagnosis at interview increases.
