The database used in this bibliometric study, the Web of Science (WoS) database: Core Collection [20] , is one of the largest and comprehensive bibliographic databases covering multidisciplinary areas. It encompasses over 12,000 of the highest impact journals worldwide (i.e. those considered to be highly influential in their fields) that contain somewhat higher data quality in the scientific, technical, medical, and social sciences [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . To retrieve the research related to social media in the field of psychology, we applied the following steps to conduct this bibliometric study: Step 1: The topic search query phrase "(Facebook OR Twitter OR LinkedIn OR Snapchat OR Instagram)" was applied to gather all the publications with those phrases in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. The documents published during the period from 2004 to 2015 were included in the study while the years 2016 and 2017 were excluded, as those years are still open for new issues. Step 2: We then limited our retrieved publications related to social media to all those indexed under research categories related to psychology in the WoS database, including "Psychology", "Psychology Clinical", "Psychology Developmental", "Psychology Multidisciplinary", "Psychology Experimental", "Psychology Social", and "Psychology Applied". Step 4: All the collected data were analysed and plotted based on the following characteristics: publication year, the main journal in the field, the institutions, the country/territory, the document type and language, the h-index, the impact factor (IF), the collaboration, and the citations. The IF was used according to the 2015 Journal Citation Reports Â® published by Thomson Reuters, 2016 [24] . Step 5: We then analysed the records to identify the relationship between the countries, the institutions, and the terms through visualisations the main clusters in each one by using VOSviewer v.1.6.5 software. The key terms were recognised in the titles and abstracts of the retrieved publications related to social media in psychology, and the co-occurrence frequencies of these terms were calculated. The term map was constructed based on the co-occurrence frequencies of these terms to cluster the main topics in this field.
