Two models of the SARS epidemic that incorporate the effects of quarantine and early detection of new cases but assume perfect isolation were recently introduced (8, 9) . A slightly different model was used to quantify the role that fast diagnosis and efficient isolation of patients played in Toronto's outbreak (10) . This model predicted control in Toronto and showed that lack of immediate action would have been catastrophic (11) . The model incorporates differences in the population's susceptibility (3) by dividing the population into classes S 1 (high risk) and S 2 (low risk). A low-risk group in the age range <19 years can be observed from the age-specific incidence in Hong Kong (3) . The low-risk class (S 2 ) has a reduced susceptibility to SARS, measured by the parameter p (0 < p < 1). While p = 0 denotes no susceptibility to SARS, p = 1 indicates that both susceptible classes are equally susceptible to SARS. Initially, S 1 = ρN and S 2 = (1-ρ)N, where N is the total population size and ρ is the initial proportion of fully susceptible (S 1 ) persons. Susceptible persons exposed to SARS enter the exposed class (assumed to be asymptomatic) with a rate proportional to β and remain there for a mean incubation period of 1/k. The possibility of reduced transmission from the exposed class is included through the parameter q (0 < q < 1), a relative measure of infec-
