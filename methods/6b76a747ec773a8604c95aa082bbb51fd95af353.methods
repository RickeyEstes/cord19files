The agent-based model (ABM) used in this study was built off a previous ABM called "Regional U.S. Hog Production Network Biosecurity Model" (RUSHPNBM) originally created by Wiltshire et al. (37) and Wiltshire (38) . The purpose of these ABMs has been the study of PEDv transmission in swine production systems. The ABMs are developed in AnyLogic 3 software with all functions written in Java 4 . The main developments of the model for the current study include the addition of: (1) seasonal disease cycles; (2) environmental infection events simulating persistence of PEDv in the environment which allowed for reoccurrence of the disease at previously infected sites; (3) on-farm infections from visitor vehicles other than hog or feed trucks; (4) agent adaptive functionalities (e.g., human behavioral processes such as willingness to adopt biosecurity and psychological distancing); (5) risk attitude categories derived from digital field experiments and; (6) webDb database for data input and output. The model's design and implementation relevant for the current study are provided here and further details can be found in the Supplementary Material and in Wiltshire (38) and Wiltshire et al. (37) . The main idea of the current ABM is to model both forward and feedback processes that describe the influence of (1) human risk attitude on biosecurity choices, (2) biosecurity on the probability of disease transmission, and (3)
