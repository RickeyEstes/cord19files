A total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from patients with a clinical pre-diagnosis of ARTI between September 1, 2014, and August 31, 2015. The specimens were transferred from healthcare institutions in Istanbul to Gelisim Medical laboratories, and analyzed directly or stored at -80Â°C until tested. The samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses and bacteria by using the RespiFinder Smart 22 assay (PathoFinder BV, the Netherlands). Each sample was simultaneously tested for the following 22 pathogens: IFV-A, IFV-A (H1N1)pdm09, IFV-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV-A, RSV-B, HMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), HBoV, AdV, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, Bordetella pertussis (BP), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), Legionella pneumophila (LP), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). First, viral and bacterial nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) were extracted according to the kit protocol. Next, amplification, detection, and data analysis were performed with the Rotor-Gene 6000 realtime PCR system (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (11, 12) . The statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for comparisons between groups in terms of categorical variables, wherever appropriate. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
