Specimens and clinical data. 11,956 respiratory samples, including nasal aspirates, supernatants from nasal and pharyngeal swabs, throat rinsing fluid, tracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, of 7681 patients were tested for respiratory virus infections. Testing was initiated at the discretion of the Lineage determination. NA sequences of a 123 bp-long amplicon of the HA gene [19] were assessed (BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit v1.1 and ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The sequenced region corresponds to nucleotide positions 966-1088 and 963-1085 of the complete HA gene of the Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008) and the Yamagata lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013), respectively. Sequences with nucleotides G16, G17, G28, G55, C64, G73, and A112 belonged to the Victoria-lineage. Viruses with nucleotides A16, A17, A28, A55, T64, T73, and G112 belonged to the Yamagata-lineage. Phylogenetic analysis. NA sequencing of the complete HA was performed according to WHO guidance [20] . In cases of low influenza B concentration an alternative protocol generating three instead of two overlapping fragments was used [21] . Phylogenetic trees of the 1710 nucleotides large HA coding region were constructed at nucleotide level with the MEGA software version 6 using the Maximum-Likelihood method. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates [22] . Complete HA sequences were submitted to Genbank (accession numbers MK459565 -MK459656). Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Continuous values were expressed as mean or median (range) and categorical data as frequencies (percentages). Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare means. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were performed for categorical variables. All tests were two-tailed. A p-level of < 0.05 was considered significant.
