For many spatial scales and problems, geography can naturally be partitioned into a finite number of discrete sites fS k g for k~1, . . . , K. Examples of these situations include individual cities, islands or countries. Starting from the observed data, at the tips of the phylogeny F we record discretized locations X~(X 1 , . . . , X N ), where X i [fS k g pin-points the sampling site of taxon i. Unobserved in the spatial process are the locations of the most common recent ancestor X root drawing from root distribution p root , the times at which the descendent taxa move and amongst which discrete sites these moves occur, a process which ultimately gives rise to X. Conditioning on X root and the unobserved locations realized at each internal node (X Nz1 , . . . , X 2N{2 ) [13, 16] , suggest modeling the instantaneous locations X (t) for taxa along each branch in F as independent continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). CTMCs are the same processes one commonly exploits to model sequence character evolution [15, 50] . Although many readers are familiar with CTMCs, we here highlight several chain properties to which we turn later when discussing CTMC modeling limitations. CTMCs are the simplest stochastic processes that emit discrete outcomes as a continuous function of time. The processes are memoryless, in that the probability of transitioning to a new location only depends on the current location and not the past history. A K|K infinitesimal rate matrix L~fl jk g completely characterizes the CTMC process. Rate matrix L contains non-negative off-diagonal entries and all rows sum to 0, yielding a stochastic matrix upon exponentiation. Solving the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation that specifies the behavior of the chain yields the finite-time transition probabilities p jk (t)~Pr X (t)~S k j X (0)~S j À Á . In matrix form, Determining the finite-time transition probabilities involves matrix exponentiation, generally accomplished through an eigen-decomposition of L. Here, we restrict ourselves to infinitesimal rate matrices that yield only real eigen-values and eigen-vectors. Any matrix similar to a symmetric matrix ensures a real eigen-decomposition; consequentially, we formulate where m is an overall rate scalar, S~fs jk g is a K|K symmetric matrix and P~diag(p 1 , . . . , p K ). Infinitesimal rate matrices of this form generate reversible Markov chains, such that p j l jk~pk l kj and p j p jk (t)~p k p kj (t), ð3Þ placing many restrictions on the underlying geographic process. We discuss these limitations and modeling extensions that allow for irreversible chains in the Discussion. In its most general timereversibile (GTR) form, L contains (Kz2)(K{1)=2 free parameters, with P donating K{1 together with mS's K(K{1)=2 off-diagonal entries. Following standard practice, we normalize entries in S such that m measures the expected (with respect to P) number of transitions per unit time t. One illuminating perspective from which to view a CTMC is that of a random walk on a graph G. From this perspective, the possible realizations of the chain fS k g correspond to the vertex set of G. Between the vertices lie edges that record the infinitesimal transition rates. For example, between S j and S k sits l jk . As a continuous-time random walk, a particle, starting at vertex S j at time 0, first waits an Exponential amount of time with rate {l jj and then randomly decides to which neighboring vertix S k to move with probability {l jk =l jj . Now on S k , the process repeats. Neighboring vertices are those for which a single edge connects them. For character evolution, ''complete'' graphs find almost exclusive use, such that edges exist between all pairs of vertices. At a minimum, however, the graph must remain ''connected'', such that it remains possible to walk between any two vertices on G. Bayesian stochastic search variable selection. When GTR models find use modeling nucleotide substitution, most of the K(K{1)~12 possible transitions have non-neglible probability of occurring and are observed over the evolutionary history. Such is unlikely to be the case for geographical locations; given that there may be many sites and each taxon only has one location (the equivalent of just one single alignment site), we expect most transitions to rarely, if ever, occur. Consequentially, we suspect a priori that many infinitesimal rates are zero. From a statistical perspective, so many degrees of freedom fit to the limited data lead to extremely high variance estimates. These poor estimates arise not only for L, but, more critically, for inference of the unobserved ancestral locations and X root . We circumvent this sparse data problem by invoking BSSVS to select a parsimonious parameterization of L. BSSVS enables us to simultaneously determine which infinitesimal rates are zero depending on the evidence in the data and efficiently infer the ancestral locations. As a beneficial by-product of BSSVS, directly quantifying the evidence about which rates are non-zero furnishes both the most likely migration patterns and the ability to test between competing migratory hypotheses. BSSVS is traditionally applied to model selection problems in a linear regression framework, in which statisticians start with a large number of potential predictors X 1 , . . . , X P and ask which among these associate linearly with an N-dimensional outcome variable Y. For example, the full model becomes Y~½X 1 , . . . , X P bze, where b is a P-dimensional vector of regression coefficients and e is an N-dimensional vector of normally distributed errors with mean 0. When b p for p~1, . . . , P differs significantly from 0, X p helps predict Y, otherwise X p contributes little additional information and warrants removal from the model via forcing b p~0 . Given potentially high correlation between the predictors, deterministic model search strategies tend not to find the optimal set of predictors unless one explores all possible subsets. This exploration is generally computationally impractical as there exist 2 P such subsets and completely fails for PwN. Recent work in BSSVS [51, 52] efficiently performs the exploration in two steps. In the first step, the approach augments the model state-space with a set of P binary indicator variables d~(d 1 , . . . , d P ) and imposes a prior p b ð Þ on the regression coefficients that has expectation 0 and variance proportional to a P|P diagonal matrix with its entries equal to d. If d p~0 , then the prior variance on b p shrinks to 0 and enforces b p~0 in the posterior. In the second step, MCMC explores the joint space of (d, b) simultaneously. To map BSSVS into the phylogeography setting, we consider selection among the 2 random graphs in which each of the K(K{1)=2 edges either exists or does not exist in G. Let d jk be the binary indicator that an edge exists connecting S j and S k . An equivalent parameterization specifies that l jk~0 when d jk~0 and l jk w0 otherwise. So, rate matrix L plays an analogous role to the regression coefficients in BSSVS. An important difference is that l jk [ (0, ?) while b k [ ({?, ?), mandating alternative prior formulations. Prior specification. To specify a prior distribution over d~fd jk g, we assume that each indicator acts a priori as an independent Bernoulli random variable (RV) with small success probability x. The sum of independent Bernoulli RVs yields a Binomial distribution over their sum W~X jvk d jk . In the limit that x%K(K{1)=2, this prior conveniently collapses to where g~x|K(K{1)=2 is the prior expected number of edges in graph G. We entertain two prior choices for P. Diagonal vector (p 1 , . . . , p K ) is the stationary distribution for the CTMC when all edges are included in the graph G. For this complete graph, as the length of the random walk t??, one expects that X (t)~S k with probability p k . One natural choice says that there exists no spatial preference over the long-run and fixes p k~1 =K for all k. However, sites may expound spatial preference over the long-run; for example, such preference can relate to known or unknown quantities such as population-size or geographic size of the site. In these situations, we estimate P simultaneously with the rest of the model by imposing the flat prior (p 1 , . . . , p K )*Dirichlet(1, . . . , 1). Also non-informatively for small values, we take m*Exponential (1) . To complete the CTMC specification, we assume that all unnormalized rates in S are a priori independent and Gammadistributed with prior expectation m jk and variance d jk |v jk , following in the vein of Bayesian SSVS. However, little previous work on prior formulation helps inform our choices of m jk and v jk . This represents a critically important area of research. A common, yet arbitrary choice in the Bayesian phylogenetic literature assumes that rates draw from Exponential distributions, forcing m jk~vjk . We follow this practice in light of there being no obvious way to elicit information on the variance of these rates. Finally, we explore two choices for setting the means. The first assumes no preference over rates, setting all m jk~C , where C is an arbitrary constant; as, after normalization, only ratios of infinitesimal rates participate in the data likelihood, the actual value of C has no influence on the likelihood. The second is informed by the geographical distance between sites.
