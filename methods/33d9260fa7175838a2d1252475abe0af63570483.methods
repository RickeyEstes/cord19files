Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sent to the CDC for histopathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation [4, 14] . Serum and plasma samples were tested for viremia and immunologic response. The consensus sequence of the virus isolate obtained from blood was compared with the lot used for vaccination, three 17D ref-erence strains, and an isolate from a young female who died in Spain following 17D vaccination (GenBank accession numbers: X15062, X03700, U17067 and DQ118157, respectively). Cytokine levels were assessed by the Beadlyte Human Multi-Cytokine Detection System (Cat #48-011, 46-127 and 46-129, respectively; Upstate USA Inc., VA) [15] and the patient's levels were compared with those in previously stored serum from four healthy unvaccinated people. The patient's DNA was isolated from her whole blood and used to analyze the sequences of selected genes that might influence vaccine response.
