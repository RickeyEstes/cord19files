Patients TEM analysis of cilia, NO n measurement and study of ciliary beat pattern using digital high-speed videomicroscopy were performed in 34 patients consecutively referred to our PCD diagnostic center. All patients were investigated because of chronic upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, i.e., bronchitis and/or bronchiectasis and sinusitis, possibly related to PCD. Other pathologic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Î±1-antitrypsin deficiency, or humoral immune defect had been previously excluded. Patient history was reviewed for respiratory diseases and tobacco addiction. The presence of bronchiectasis and situs inversus were assessed on high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) scan in all patients. Patients with unfeasible TEM and/or NO n measurement were excluded from the study. All investigations were performed in the absence of acute airway infection for at least 6 weeks. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and this study was approved by the Ile de France Ethics Committee.
