The spread of COVID-19 outside Hubei province is relatively controlled given the adequate medical resources. We use the reported number outside Hubei as it is a fairly accurate representation of the actual epidemic situation. In this modelling study, we first estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from January 11, 2020, to February 13, 2020, based on the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by January 23, 2020. Since some confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust the number of imported cases after taking these missing values into account. We then calculate the reporting rate in Wuhan from January 20, 2020, to February 13, 2020. Finally, we estimate the date when the first patient was infected. .
