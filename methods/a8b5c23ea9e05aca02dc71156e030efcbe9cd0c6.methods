This work uses the modified particle-size-resolved version of the Wells-Riley model in Equation (2) to estimate the risk reductions likely achievable by common HVAC filters for a case study of influenza transmission in a hypothetical office building. Estimates of operational costs are also made for both HVAC filtration and an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation in a range of climate zones across the U.S. in order to compare the likely costs of both control methods. The next sections describe our methodology for connecting the modified Wells-Riley model to HVAC filtration (i.e., MERV) and estimating operational costs.
