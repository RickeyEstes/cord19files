In approaching a new and emerging area of science and technology within the scientific literature a variety of search strategies may be used with Thomson Reuters or other publication databases. The choices made in the development of search strategies affect the number and nature of the results. Thus, searches of the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge capture a wide range of results across disciplines and publication sources but are very limited in terms of data fields for analysis. In contrast, Thomson Reuters Web of Science provides a narrower spectrum of results from three major scientific indexes and conference proceedings but includes all major data fields for analysis. We selected Web of Science because of the large range of fields available for text mining and analysis using software tools such as Vantage Point from Search Technology Inc. All databases suffer from lag times between the publication of articles and their appearance in databases. The second important methodological issue is the use of search terms. We engaged in experimentation with a range of search terms using corpus linguistics approaches and Natural Language Processing to identify individual words and phrases of relevance from samples of articles from Web of Science and reports on synthetic biology. This revealed that, in the absence of a controlled vocabulary, the terms used in synthetic biology such as biotechnology or protein engineering are rapidly swamped by uses of the same terms in other research areas. While it is tempting to use ever more refined terms we came to the conclusion that synthetic biology is a self-defining community of researchers from a variety of disciplines who are articulating themselves around the term synthetic biology and related terms such as synthetic genomics. For this reason a simple search strategy focusing on ''synthetic biology'', ''synthetic genomics'', ''synthetic genome'' and ''synthetic genomes'' was used to capture the core landscape. Other important contributions to the field are captured through analysis of cited literature and exploration of the landscape of researchers citing work in synthetic biology within their publications (below). Searches were conducted using the topic field in Web of Science which encompasses the title, abstract, author keywords and terms appearing in the title of cited literature (keywords plus). The results were then imported into Vantage Point software from Search Technology Inc. for text mining and processing of geographical, institutional and funding data fields. Publications citing this core landscape were also selected in Web of Science to exclude selfcitations, deduplicated and processed in Vantage Point. The processed data was then geocoded using Yahoo Place Finder and exported for visualisation and geographical mapping in Tableau Desktop and Gephi network mapping software. Data was prepared for display in Tableau Public by splitting relevant fields to extract values (i.e. country names). Gephi visualisations deployed the Fruchterman-Reingold and Force Atlas algorithms with nodes manually adjusted to ensure label clarity. The data presented in this article is limited to the literature available in Web of Science at the time searches were conducted in early January 2012. Data on literature citing the core landscape for synthetic biology is limited to the 5,995 deduplicated citing publications available in Web of Science at the time of search.
