Majority of the published epitope classifiers are based on Support Vector Machines [2] , Neural Networks trained through backpropogation [35, 36] , Naive Bayes Classifiers [18] , and Propensity Scales [37] . A very limited number of the more obscure methods have also been explored, such as Ant Colony Optimization [38] , for example. In the last decade a number of new and innovative classification and regression algorithms have been demonstrated and published, the most promising of which falls into the category of Deep Learning [39] . These types of systems are only now starting to be explored in the bioinformatics, and more concretely, the epitope prediction domain. In this paper we develop a new epitope classification pipeline called Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor (DRREP). DRREP is a deep neural network which uses a string mismatch activation function, and is trained using an analytical method based on ridge regression. Because DRREP learns using an analytical method in a single step (going through the data only once), the system learns faster than SVM and other traditional iterative learning methods (exp. those based on error back-propagation).
