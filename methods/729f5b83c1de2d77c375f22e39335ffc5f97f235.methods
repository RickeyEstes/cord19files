This study was conducted at the Family Medicine Training Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, and was approved by the Research Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The study began in mid-April 2011 and ended in mid-May 2011. Power analysis was conducted with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a 5% margin of error to estimate the required sample size. As no data on the prevalence of correct use of face masks could be found, the assumed prevalence was set at the recommended level of 50%. As a result, a total of 383 subjects were required. For inclusion in the survey, respondents had to be either an outpatient or a caregiver of an outpatient at the clinic. A systematic sampling approach was adopted to recruit outpatients and caregivers at the clinic by excluding every fourth outpatient/caregiver. As a result, 75% of the study subjects were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was initially written in English and was translated into Chinese. Informed consent was obtained for every completed survey. A pilot questionnaire was pre-tested for 3 days at the same clinic. Informal interviews were conducted with the 76 respondents. These steps were taken to ensure the validity of the questions and proper comprehension. As a result, two questions were omitted from the final survey due to ambiguity, and the procedural question was amended by including pictures to aid understanding. The final closed-ended questionnaire consisted of 33 items (Appendix 1, see online supplementary material). There were 5 items assessing knowledge, 19 items addressing attitudes and 6 items concerning practices. Another 3 items were used to collect data about demographics and medical history. The procedure for correct use of face masks was composed of a 3-part question addressing where the face mask covers, where the wire should be placed and which side should face the front. Knowledge items were adapted from guidelines recommended by the Centre for Health Protection 10 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 11 Attitudes were rated on a five-point Likert scale and based on the Health Belief Model. The Likert scale was later collapsed into 3 categories for analysis. Questions concerning practices were based on the use of face masks in public places, at the clinic and at home, and whether the face mask was used for selfprotection or to protect others. Data were described using frequency and mean scores. Regarding knowledge, a score of 1 was given for each correct answer and 0 was given for each incorrect answer. Therefore, the range was 0e5. Attitude scores were calculated by giving À1 for negative attitudes, 0 for undecided and 1 for attitudes favoring face masks. The scores ranged from À19 to 19. Finally, practice scores were calculated by giving a score of 0 for those who did not wear a face mask, a score of 1 for those who sometimes wore a face mask, and a score of 2 for those who answered that they always wore a face mask. The maximum score was 12 and the minimum score was 0. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between knowledge, attitudes and practices. A Pvalue <0.05 was considered to indicate significance. Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
