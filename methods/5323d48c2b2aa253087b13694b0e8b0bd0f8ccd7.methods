We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all consecutive patients with PCP who were admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure at Samsung Medical Center (a 1979-bed, university-affiliated, tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea) between October 2005 and July 2018. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center. Informed consent was waived because of the retrospective observational nature of the study. All patient records and data were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.
