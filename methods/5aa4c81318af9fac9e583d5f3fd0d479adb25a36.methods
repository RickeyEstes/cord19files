This was a prospective unblinded study of six healthy volunteers using combinations of one, two, three or five surgical masks (Surgikos, Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, TX, USA). The Surgikos mask is a pleated rectangular three-ply mask with a bacterial filtration efficiency of 95% at 3 mm. All volunteers gave written informed consent. Approval was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. All six volunteers underwent a set of tests with each of the combinations of masks. These involved standard testing procedures using a protocol described previously. 3 In brief, the tests consisted of comparisons of particle counts inside and outside the masks during a series of activities: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning the head from side to side, flexing and extending the head, talking loudly, and bending over followed by normal breathing again. The tube for sampling the mask particle count was connected to a test probe that was inserted through the fabric of the protective device. The probes were provided by TSI (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, MI, USA) for this purpose. The design of the probe is such that there is no leak around the insertion point, so the efficiency of the mask at filtering ambient particles should remain unchanged. The insertion site was centrally in the area directly in front of the mouth, as per the instructions for use provided by TSI. The tube for sampling the ambient particle count was fixed approximately 3 cm from the sampling probe. A PortaCount Plus (TSI Incorporated) connected to a computer running FitPlus for Windows software (TSI Incorporated) was used to count particles and calculate the ratio of ambient to device particle counts. This device counts all particles with a diameter between 0.02 and 1 mm. It calculates a fit factor, which is the average ratio of atmospheric to device particle concentrations. The equation used is: where N is the number of exercises performed and ff j is the fit factor for the individual exercise. One modification was made to the PortaCount Plus. The re-usable tubing supplied by the manufacturer was replaced with disposable PVC tubing of the same internal diameter and length to minimize any risk of cross-infection. To ensure an adequate ambient particle count throughout the testing, the 8026 Particle Generator (TSI Incorporated) was used to generate saline particles throughout the testing procedures. Each surgical mask was tied separately. The American National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health requirements for a half mask respirator are that it should have an assigned protection factor of 10. 4 Further to this, a safety factor of 10 is required when conducting performance or fit testing, so a half face respirator should achieve a minimum fit factor of 100. Data obtained while wearing one mask were compared with data obtained while wearing five masks using a paired t-test (Statview 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A P value !0.05 was considered to be significant.
