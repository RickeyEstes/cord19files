An extended panel of respiratory viruses has been available for a number of years from the microbiology laboratory at the study hospital. RV Figure 1 ). This was in accordance with the hospital policy at the time to support diagnosis while limiting unnecessary tests. Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with a positive NPA for RSV or RV were identified from a search of the microbiology department's electronic database. Data were collected over a period of three years and nine months (April 2012eDecember 2015). Infants who only had a single pathogen (either RSV or RV) were included in the study. NPA samples that identified more than one pathogen were excluded. Respiratory pathogens detected from babies in the neonatal unit (N Â¼ 10) were also excluded as bronchiolitis is more difficult to diagnose in this group, and they were more likely to have acquired infection nosocomially. NPA samples that were negative on PCR using an extended panel of respiratory viruses served as a control group. The study was a service evaluation project, and patient consent was not required. Data were collected on median age at presentation, sex, associated risk factors (chronic lung disease, prematurity, congenital heart disease, genetic conditions), therapeutic interventions (intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, chest X-ray), need for respiratory support (high flow oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, ventilation), management in high-dependency unit (HDU)/paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and outcome [length of stay (LOS) and any deaths]. LOS of seven days or less was defined as short, and LOS of eight to 21 days was defined as prolonged. Statistical analysis was performed using standard Chi-squared analysis, and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.
