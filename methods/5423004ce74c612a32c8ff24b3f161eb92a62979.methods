We adapted and used an existing investigation protocol for cross-sectional seroepidemiologic study of MERS-CoV infection in high-risk populations in contact with dromedary camels developed by WHO [16] . The WHO protocol was translated into French, questions were modified, deleted or added to make it more relevant to Morocco, and it was used to ascertain risks of exposure to dromedaries as well as dromedary products.
