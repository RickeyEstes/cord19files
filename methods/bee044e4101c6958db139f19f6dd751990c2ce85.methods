Ethical authorization. Ethical authorization for the use of human samples was obtained from the Cameroon National Ethics Committee, Yaoundé. All human experiments were performed in accordance with the Ministry's National Ethics Committee guidelines. Ethical authorization for the protocol and the use of animal samples was also obtained from the Cameroon National Ethics Committee, Yaoundé. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Ministry's National Ethics Committee guidelines. All experimental protocols used in this study were approved by Cameroon National Ethics Committee. Administrative authorization was obtained from the Delegation of Public Health for South West Region, Cameroon. Informed consent was obtained from human subjects or their parents or guardians. Bat sample collection. Bat samples were collected between December 2013 and May 2014 using a previously described method 32 . Briefly, bats were captured in 3 different regions (Lysoka, Muyuka and Limbe) of the South West Region of Cameroon (Fig. 1) using mist nets around fruit trees and around human dwellings. Captured bats were retrieved from the traps and held in paper sacks for 10-15 min, allowing enough time for the excretion of fresh fecal boluses. Sterile disposable spatulas were used to retrieve feces from the paper sacks, and placed into tubes containing 1 ml of universal transport medium (UTM, Copan Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy). Labeled samples were put on ice and then transferred to the Molecular and cell biology laboratory, Biotechnology Unit, University of Buea, Cameroon and stored at − 20 °C, until they were shipped to the Laboratory of Viral Metagenomics, Leuven, Belgium where they were stored at − 80 °C. Each captured bat was assessed to determine species, weight (g), forearm length (mm), sex, reproductive state, and age. All captured bats were then marked by hair clipping to facilitate identification of recaptures, and released afterwards. Trained zoologists used morphological characteristics to determine the species of the bats before they were released. No clinical signs of disease were noticed in any of these bats. Sample preparation for NGS. Eighty-seven fecal samples were grouped into 25 pools each containing three to five samples and treated to enrich viral particles as follows: fecal suspensions were homogenized for 1 min at 3000 rpm with a MINILYS homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) and filtered consecutively through 100 μ m, 10 μ m and 0.8 μ m membrane filters (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) for 30 s at 1250 g. The filtrate was then treated with a cocktail of Benzonase (Novagen, Madison, USA) and Micrococcal Nuclease (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA) at 37 °C for 2 h to digest free-floating nucleic acids. Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions but without addition of carrier RNA to the lysis buffer. First and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed and random PCR amplification for 17 cycles were performed using a Whole Transcriptome Amplification (WTA) Kit procedure (Sigma-Aldrich), with a denaturation temperature of 95 °C instead of 72 °C to allow the denaturation of dsDNA and dsRNA. WTA products were purified with MSB Spin PCRapace spin columns (Stratec, Berlin, Germany) and the libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing using the NexteraXT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). A cleanup after library synthesis was performed using a 1.8 ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Nyon, Switzerland) 33 . Sequencing of the samples was performed on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) for 300 cycles (2 × 150 bp paired ends). Partial sequences were completed using RT-PCRs with specific primers (Supplementary S4). For gene segments lacking the 5′ and/or 3′ ends of the ORF the single primer amplification method (Primers in Supplementary S4) was used as described previously 34 . Sanger sequencing was done on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA).
