The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Austin Health, RESULTS Atherosclerotic plaques were present in 170 (66%) coronary arteries. On a per-vessel basis, luminal stenosis severity was significantly associated with impaired FFR, iFR, Pd/Pa, and iFRa. Multivariable analysis revealed that FFR and iFR were independently related to $70% stenosis (À0.10, p < 0.001 and À0.09, p ¼ 0.003, respectively) and plaque volume (-0.02, p ¼ 0.020 and -0.02, p ¼ 0.030, respectively). Additionally, PR and SC were also independent predictors of an impaired FFR (À0.10, p < 0.001 and À0.07, p ¼ 0.021, respectively), but adverse plaque characteristics were not independently related to the vasodilator-free iFR. (6). From an anatomic point of view, there is a growing body of literature recognizing that a major share of acute coronary events originate from non-obstructive and so-called 'vulnerable plaques', which are prone to rupture (7) (8) (9) . Such atherosclerotic plaque morphology can now be assessed non-invasively using coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, and has been described as a strong predictor of adverse events (10, 11) . Recently, these high-risk plaques have been linked to hyperemic myocardial blood flow and FFR, independent of luminal stenosis severity (12) (13) (14) . Hypothetically, this might in part explain the relationship between a low FFR and the risk of cardiac events beyond angiographic stenosis significance (15) . Whereas FFR measurements require a hyperemic state, instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) has recently emerged as a novel invasive physiological measure obviating the need for hyperemia, notwithstanding a seemingly comparable relation with flow as well as short-term outcome (16) (17) (18) . Yet, studies describing an association between iFR and high-risk plaque morphology are lacking, which could provide insights regarding the currently debated differences and equalities of FFR and iFR (19) . Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate differences between FFR and the non-hyperemic iFR in relationship with CT-derived high-risk plaque features. PET. The PET scanning protocol has been described in detail previously (20) . In summary, a dynamic PET software. Among the various high-risk plaque features derived from CT, LAP (11%) and PR (9%) were most frequently found next to the less prevalent SC (5%) and NRS (2%). The quantitative association between plaque (18) Calcium-channel blocker 34 (28) Long-acting nitrate 9 (8) One-day rest-stress, stress-rest, stress-only, or 2-day stress-rest protocols were performed according to site-specific protocols. Patients underwent symptomlimited standard exercise treadmill testing or pharmacologic stress (16) . Rates of events were calculated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis for both stratification by visual assessment and TPD in the overall population and in Otaki et al. subgroups of suspected CAD. The log-rank test was used to assess any differences in event risks with worsening of visual perfusion or quantitative perfusion assessment among the classified groups. Integer values were considered for TPD analysis. Stress TPD category $5% has been previously established as the threshold for diagnostic abnormality (18, 19) . An SSS of $4 was considered equivalent to TPD $5% as it is used as an abnormal threshold during clinical reading (10) . The visual score SSS <1 (or SSS ¼ 0) was considered an approximate equivalent to TPD <1%. Table 1 . Overall population.
