In an EBOV-infected subject, the immune system components dynamically evolve in response to the virus replication dynamic [42] . As a result, a series of events is triggered determining the infection outcomes such as infectious status, symptoms, recovery, or death [42] [43] [44] . In this paper, the EBOV replication dynamic within a host was used to infer its transmission parameters.
