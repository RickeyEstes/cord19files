A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 8 large nonfederal acute care health care systems that experience 32% of all inpatient visits and 23% of all outpatient visits in North Carolina (7) . These health care systems ranged in size from 581 to 1,324 site-licensed beds, spanned the Eastern Coastal, Central Piedmont, and Western Mountain regions of the state, and were selected from a network of 11 health care systems staffed with hospital-based public health epidemiologists. The study cohort was defi ned as all inpatients and outpatients at the 8 health care systems who were assigned a discharge diagnostic code from the International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifi cation (ICD-9-CM), that corresponded with a reportable communicable diseases during a 10-year time period (1995) (1996) (1997) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . The years 1998-1999 were excluded from the study because this period marked the transition when the state law was changed to include a reporting requirement for laboratories. Diseases were excluded if they were chronic infectious diseases that resulted in a recurring assignment of ICD-9-CM code (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B carrier), if no spe-cifi c ICD-9-CM code was available (e.g., for viral hemorrhagic fever), or if the NC DHHS did not record patient identifi ers in their surveillance database during the entire study period (e.g., for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia). Approval for the study was granted by the institutional review boards of all health care systems as well as by the North Carolina Division of Public Health because identifi able patient data were required to match the hospital and health department databases. The cohort of patients assigned ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes by the health care systems for a reportable communicable disease were matched to the NC DHHS reported case-patients by using a unique identifi er created by either Social Security number, or a combination of the fi rst 2 letters of the last name, fi rst letter of the fi rst name, date of birth, and a 2-digit disease code. Repeat patient visits within a 31-day window for the same disease were enumerated and only the fi rst visit was retained, with the exception of tuberculosis, which had a 365-day window, and hepatitis A and paralytic polio, which were restricted to only the fi rst visit. Patients who had dates of reporting to the NC DHHS before the date of diagnosis at the health care system were excluded because they represented cases that had already been reported. Unadjusted disease-specifi c reporting completeness proportions were calculated by dividing the number of case-patients that were reported to NC DHHS by the total number of patients identifi ed in the health care systems who were assigned an ICD-9-CM diagnostic code for a reportable disease. In addition, completeness proportions were estimated by year (1995) (1996) (1997) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) for the 3 health care systems that had complete data available for all 10 years, and generalized linear regression models were used to examine the time trends. For the years 2000-2006, reporting completeness proportions and 95% confi dence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each health care system by using a binomial logistic regression model that included as covariates whether or not specifi c health care system personnel were designated for disease reporting. For disease-specifi c completeness proportions, empirical continuity corrections were used when no patients were reported for a disease (8) . In addition, adjusted completeness proportions and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated by using semi-Bayesian analysis (9) as recommended to reduce the mean squared error when an ensemble of measures are estimated (10) . This semi-Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis uses prior covariates that help explain the mean of the ensemble of estimates and a specifi ed prior variance (τ 2 ) of the distribution. Traditional maximumlikelihood estimates (i.e., unadjusted estimates as presented here) can be viewed as a special case of semi-Bayesian analysis in which the prior variance is infi nite. By specifying even a moderately informative prior variance such as a τ 2 indicating that 95% of all completeness proportions lie between 7.3% and 85%, an appreciable reduction in the overall mean squared error can be expected with a shift in the point estimate and a narrowing of the 95% UI for each completeness proportion, with the relative degree of narrowing being greater for diseases with less information. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the specifi ed prior variance, τ 2 , by using high, medium, and low τ 2 values that assumed 95% of the completeness proportions were within the following ranges: 2.2%-95%, 7.3%-85%, and 12.9%-75%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted on the inclusion or exclusion of prior covariates, which were the time frame for reporting the disease (i.e., 24 hours vs. 7 days), whether or not the disease had a reportable laboratory result, whether or not the disease had reportable serologic test results, whether or not the disease is classifi ed as a CDC category A bioterrorism agent, and the mode of transmission of the disease (person-to-person, arthropod-borne, food/water-borne, droplet/aerosol).
