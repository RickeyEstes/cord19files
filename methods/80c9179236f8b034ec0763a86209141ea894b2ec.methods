We contacted Ministries of Health, influenza reference laboratories and/or WHO NICs in 11 countries in West Africa: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. We asked for a description of their influenza surveillance systems and any variation from WHO guidelines, and for data on influenza-like-illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. Data collected included the number of sentinel surveillance sites (ILI and SARI), the number of specimens tested by week, sex, age group, and the number positive for influenza by type and subtype. At the time of study, ILI was defined by WHO as an acute respiratory illness with temperature of ≥38.0°C and either cough or sore throat, with onset in the last 7 days 1 .s WHO defined SARI among children aged 2 months to <5 years as cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and any sign of severe illness with onset in the last 7 days. For children aged ≥5 years and adults, SARI was defined as a temperature of ≥38.0°C and cough with shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with onset in the last 7 days 2 [19] . In each country, patients presenting to surveillance facilities and who met the case definitions were eligible; it is only after obtaining verbal consent of the patient (or parent/guardian consent for children) that nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal specimens were collected along with clinical and epidemiological data using a case report form. Specimens and corresponding case report forms were then transported from the sentinel sites to the national influenza reference laboratory where samples were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), using CDC protocols [20] . In-country data managers collected laboratory and epidemiologic data in central databases. Data provided for this study were analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) [21] . We defined predominance as >50% of influenza-positive specimens of the same type (and subtype for influenza A viruses) in a given year. We also examined the Spearman correlation between the peak month and the peak percent positive in order to test whether earlier peak corresponds to higher percent positive at the peak.
