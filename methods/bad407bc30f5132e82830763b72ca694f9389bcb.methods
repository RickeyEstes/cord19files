A narrative approach was adopted, using bibliographic abstracting services (PubMed, PsychInfo) to identify papers that might contain details about recruitment protocols, as well as methods of natural pain induction. Our approach was deliberately narrative rather than systematic because we were interested in reporting with equal emphasis both common and unusual methods. We were not concerned with the primary results of the studies reported, only in the operation of their methods. As our goal was to focus on common painful conditions, we selected headache, muscular pain, visceral (abdominal) pain, menstrual pain, and dental pain. We also included pain associated with upper respiratory tract infections, for example, ''sore throat'' [121, 122] . All methods reported were categorized into one of these 6 pain conditions. Reference sections from identified publications were searched for unidentified further publications. Citation searches using Web of Knowledge were also undertaken to attempt to identify further use of methods. For the recruitment methods part of the review, we categorised approaches based on how the sample was identified and participants recruited. These typically fell into 1 of 4 approaches: (1) identifying those with the relevant pain, for example, from locations where people seek analgesia; (2) identifying those about to experience the pain, for example, those scheduled to undertake painful nonclinical procedures; (3) identifying people at risk of pain, for example, recruiting those who report frequent complaints such as headache; or (4) by recruiting a normal sample of people and following them moment to moment, recording pain episodes as they arise [114] . These approaches were appraised in terms of ease and effectiveness within each condition. For the pain induction analogue part of the review, methods were considered where there was any systematic attempt to experimentally control or induce one of the 6 naturally occurring pain conditions. These can involve inducing the exact pain under investigation, as in pains that arise from exertion, or those studies that were designed to be close to the naturally occurring experience. For each of the main types of pain, we start by providing a brief description of the condition. Next, we consider the recruitment methods by which each pain condition has been examined. Where relevant, we then consider analogue versions of each pain type. All methods are appraised for their performance as a method of pain investigation, with particular regard to experimental controllability, relevance to naturally occurring pain, and novelty.
