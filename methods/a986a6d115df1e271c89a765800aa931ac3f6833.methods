This evaluation included an analysis of membership data and recent accomplishments from all FETPs that were part of the global network in 2012, descriptive data on abstracts submitted by FETP residents and graduates to the TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference in 2012 and a qualitative analysis of efforts to increase the quality of training. In order to obtain membership to TEPHINET, each FETP submits responses, either online or by Microsoft Excel, to a membership survey that focuses on general programme information, the residents and graduates of the programme, collaborating organizations and characteristics of the training. The TEPHINET board of directors developed the membership survey in 2006, and only a few minor modifications were made thereafter to increase its acceptance by the members and to ensure that longitudinal data were comparable. FETPs are requested to update this information every 2 to 3 years. Data on FETP course offerings, the training competencies (that is, outbreak investigation, surveillance system development and evaluation and management and leadership, et cetera), and criteria for residents to apply to the programme, the proportion of field versus didactic training, and collaborating agencies and organizations were abstracted from the membership surveys. Cumulative data that may increase or fluctuate each year, such as the number of graduates or activities completed by residents, had been updated between August and November of 2012 for all programmes. Key activities and accomplishments of programmes in 2012 were added to the repository of programme information. FETPs were contacted by e-mail about missing or unclear data. All final data were crosschecked for accuracy with previously collected data and directly verified by conference call with FETP directors. Descriptive data were obtained from a database of all abstracts submitted to the November 2012 TEPHINET global scientific conference, to identify current activities and accomplishments of the programmes and residents. TEPHINET conferences are a primary forum for residents and graduates to present their work to an international audience of experts and gain valuable feedback; they also serve as an opportunity for public health partners to learn about FETP activities. Information about quality improvement efforts were obtained from globally representative scientific committees that regularly convened between July 2010 and December 2012 and from the July 2009, 2010, and November 2012 programme directors' meetings. These efforts built on the Continuous Quality Improvement manual developed in 2005 to standardize field epidemiology training and increase quality, and launched a process for FETPs to voluntarily become accredited in field epidemiology training by an independent accrediting body [10, 11] . The purpose of accreditation is not only to improve the quality of the FETP, but to assure partners about the capacity of residents and graduates to tackle challenging public health issues.
