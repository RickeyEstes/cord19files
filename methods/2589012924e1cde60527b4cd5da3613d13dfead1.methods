Sample MERS-CoV pneumonia case, study setting, and study population A 70-year-old woman henceforth known as patient A was admitted to hospital A complaining of back pain. At the time of admission, the patient had pneumonia with fever lasting 10 days. Two days later, patient A was transferred to intensive care unit where she received endotracheal intubation. Since a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected during this period, HCWs did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). As no specific pathogen was identified, testing for MERS-CoV infection was conducted. Real-time reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (rRTePCR) was strongly positive for MERS-CoV [3] . Patient A had cycle threshold (C T ) values of 17.9 for envelope protein gene and 18.2 for open reading frame 1a gene. After patient A had been diagnosed with MERS-CoV, rapid contact tracing was performed and possible contact exposures were divided into two groups: high-risk and non-high-risk exposure groups. HCWs with highrisk exposure were isolated and immediately offered oral ribavirin (Viramid capsules; Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra; Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). The PEP protocol was initiated between days 1 and 3 after the last unprotected exposure to patient A. PEP therapy was administered until day 14 after the last exposure according to the incubation period of the disease [1] . Ribavirin was administered orally at a loading dose of 2000 mg followed by 1200 mg every 8 h for 4 days and then 600 mg every 8 h for 6e8 days. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg every 12 h for 11e13 days. Laboratory testing for HCWs in the PEP group was performed on days 3, 7, and 11 after treatment initiation. HCWs who received PEP therapy also underwent two-point sputum screening with MERS-CoV rRTePCR. To improve detection of unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the PEP group, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Euroimmun, LÃ¼beck, Germany) was also performed to detect MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) after completion of PEP therapy [4] . For control group selection, four hospitals with super-spread events were retrospectively selected. A retrospective comparative study was conducted for five hospitals of South Korea. Hospitals AeD are secondary referral hospitals whereas hospital E is a tertiary referral hospital. Each hospital had a corresponding MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patient (patients AeE). Pre-isolation pneumonia patients visited participating hospitals without knowing that they were infected with MERS-CoV. C T data were available for all five MERS-CoV preisolation pneumonia patients. C T values of the five patients were similar. HCWs with unprotected exposure to patients with MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia were enrolled from the above five hospitals between May and July 2015. We only included HCWs with high-risk exposure. HCWs from hospital A treated with PEP represented the PEP group. HCWs from other hospitals who did not receive PEP were classified as the non-PEP group. HCWs in the non-PEP group were isolated and monitored for the development of MERS-like symptoms for 14 days from the date of exposure to a patient with MERS. The incidence of MERS-CoV infection was compared between these groups.
