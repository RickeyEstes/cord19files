The single-cell RNA-Seq data of lung/alveolus (the Asian donor) sample is downloaded from GSE122960; the single-cell RNA-Seq data of samples from bronchial biopsy, nasal brushing, and turbinate are downloaded from GSE121600. We filter out the cells 1-expressing less than 200 genes; or 2-highly expressing mitochondrial genes, in which mitochondrial genes' reads account for more than 25% of the total reads. We filter out the genes expressing in less than 3 samples. Then, we conduct tSNE analysis on the cells with Seurat (3. .
