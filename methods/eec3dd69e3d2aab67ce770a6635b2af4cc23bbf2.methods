The Impact of SARS Study took place in Ontario, Canada between October 23, 2004 and September 30, 2005 in nine academic and community hospitals in Toronto and four in Hamilton. The Impact of SARS Study was designed to determine the psychological impact of an infectious outbreak on exposed hospital workers. Therefore, the population sampled included nurses in medical or surgical inpatient units and all staff of intensive care units, emergency departments and SARS isolation units. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of each hospital. All participants (n = 769) completed several self-administered instruments. Of these 769 participants, 179 (23.3%) were willing to complete a second survey, which included a self-administered survey of traumatic experiences. The second survey was completed a median of 9 weeks after the first survey (interquartile range 7-14 weeks). Because all 769 participants completed a survey that included demographic data and measures of distress, burnout, posttraumatic symptoms and behavioral impact of SARS, there is extensive evidence that demonstrates that the subsample (n = 179) does not differ from the full sample (n = 769) on psychological measures (Lancee et al., 2008) . Furthermore, we have previously reported on a comparison of the participants in the full sample to non-participant healthcare workers, which demonstrated that they do not differ with respect to in age, job type, years of healthcare experience, or overall subjective impact of SARS on their lives (Maunder et al., 2006) . Three subjects did not complete the trauma questionnaire and were excluded from the current analysis. Of 176 participants, 159 (90%) were women. Twenty-four (14%) were single, 132 (75%) married, and 20 (11%) separated or widowed. Most were nurses (n = 142, 81%) with the remaining divided between a number of clinical (n = 18, 10%) and non-clinical (n = 16, 9%) jobs. The mean age of participants was 45 years (SD 9.4) and the mean duration of work in healthcare was 20 years (SD 10.3). Lifetime experience with adverse events and trauma was surveyed with the TSI Life Event Questionnaire (Miller, Veltkamp, Heister, & Shirley, 1998) a 19-item questionnaire that surveys exposure to a broad range of potentially traumatic events and the earliest age at which each exposure occurred. Recent life events were counted as the sum of events reported over the previous 6-month period using the Responses to Life Events Scale (Marziali & Pilkonis, 1986 ) modified to provide a checklist of 120 common life events in the areas of job, school, finances, personal relationships, family, health, losses, injury, violence, children and pregnancy, and other experiences. In this sample, the number of life events in the previous 6 months was non-parametrically distributed and skewed toward zero. Current psychological distress was measured with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. The 10-item scale (K10) has been found to discriminate between cases and non-cases of SCID-diagnosed DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses and to show consistent psychometric properties across sociodemographic subgroups (Kessler et al., 2002) . In this sample, the K10 was non-parametrically distributed and skewed toward the minimum score of 10. The reliability of the K10 (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.92. Perceived social support was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, which was developed based on the responses of 2987 patients to the Medical Outcomes Study. Nineteen items measure the perceived availability of others to provide functional support if needed. The sum of these items correlates with measures of loneliness and family dysfunction and is distinct from measures of mental and physical health (Stewart et al., 1989) . The survey also asks for the number of close friends and close relatives "you feel at ease with and can talk to about what is on your mind." In the current study, perceived availability of support was non-parametrically distributed and skewed toward the maximum value. The reliability (Cronbach's alpha) of perceived availability of support was 0.97. Coping responses were measured with reference to coping with the SARS experience using the Ways of Coping Inventory (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980; Folkman & Lazarus, 1988 ) a widely used instrument which yields eight subscales of coping strategies. The eight factor model has been supported in clinical and non-clinical samples (Lundqvist & Ahlstrom, 2006) and the reliability of the subscales across many studies has been adequate (typically 0.60 to 0.75) (Rexrode, Petersen, & O'Toole, 2008) . Relative coping subscales (raw subscale score divided by total Ways of Coping score) were calculated for each of eight subscales. Relative scores remove the confounding influence of the intensity of distress experienced following SARS from the analysis of the types of coping which were used. In the current study, internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha) for coping subscales was problem-solving 0.73, seeking support 0.73, positive-reappraisal 0.77, distancing 0.68, confrontive coping 0.68, escape-avoidance 0.74, self-control 0.66, and taking responsibility 0.65. Coping through problem-solving, seeking support, positive reappraisal, confrontive coping, and self-control were normally distributed. Coping through escape-avoidance, accepting responsibility (self-blame), and distancing were non-parametrically distributed and skewed toward zero. The number of work shifts missed due to stress or illness over 4 months, according to the participant's self-report, was used as a proxy of functional occupational impairment.
