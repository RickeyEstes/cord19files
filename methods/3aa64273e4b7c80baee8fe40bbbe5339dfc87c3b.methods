We worked within the 4-county bovine TB-endemic area in Michigan's Lower Peninsula, where cattle herds continue to be infected and intensive sampling of hunterkilled deer is ongoing (Deer Management Unit [DMU] 452; Figure 1 ). DMU 452 is the historic core bovine TBendemic area and remains a focal site of intensive sampling of hunter-killed deer (18) . Prior carnivore surveillance conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had detected M. bovis in 18 of 249 sampled coyotes. Given the history of intensive surveillance and elevated M. bovis prevalence in the area, it was the logical choice to implement and evaluate a sentinel-based surveillance program. Habitat associations within DMU 452 were diverse; moraine uplands were dominated by forests of jack pine (Pinus banksiana), white pine (P. alba), oak (Quercus spp.), and maple (Acer spp.). Dominant lowland vegetation included tag alder (Alnus rugosa) and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), and wetland ephemera were common. Annual precipitation typically ranged from 71 cm to 91 cm; most occurred as snowfall (19) . Mean yearly summer and winter temperatures were 21°C and -10°C, respectively (19) . We trapped coyotes from December 2003 through September 2005 using padded foot-hold traps and scent lures in 15 townships within the 4-county area. We trapped coyotes in 6 townships in Alcona County, 5 in Oscoda County, 2 in Montmorency County, and 2 in Alpena County. Because a large proportion of land in the study area was privately owned (e.g., commercial hunting clubs, agricultural operations, residential development), landowner permission to access property dictated trap placement. Thus, we were unable to randomize trapping locations or distribute traps proportionally among counties. Within each township, traps were checked daily, and trapping was terminated when 10 coyotes were collected. Because multiple captures could occur on the fi nal day of trapping, we occasionally collected >10 coyotes/township. We killed trapped coyotes with a 0.22-caliber gunshot to the brain, determined their age on the basis of tooth wear and eruption (20) , and performed necropsy examinations on them within an hour of death to minimize autolysis. Tissues containing visible lesions as well as the parotid, mandibular, retropharyngeal, bronchial, mediastinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and submitted in formalin for histologic examination and fresh for mycobacterial culture. Coyote samples were processed by following protocols used for histologic examination and mycobacterial culture of white-tailed deer samples (6, 10) . Fresh tissues for bacterial culture were digested and decontaminated with a sodium-hypochlorite-sodium hydroxide method (21) . We then spun tissue suspensions in a refrigerated centrifuge at 6,000 × g for 20 minutes (21) . Half of the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and swabbed on the following solid media: Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing sodium pyruvate (National Veterinary Services Laboratory [NVSL], Ames, IA, USA), Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing sodium pyruvate (NVSL), BBL Mycobactosel L-J medium slant (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, NJ, USA) and Middlebrook 7H11 with aspartic acid and pyruvate (Becton Dickinson) (22) . We then injected the suspension (0.5 mL) into BACTEC 12 B liquid culture vials (Becton Dickinson) and BACTEC MGIT liquid culture tubes (Becton Dickinson) (21) . The solid media tubes were incubated at 37 ± 2°C in a 10% CO 2 incubator and examined weekly until colonies were observed or until an incubation period of 8 weeks was complete, at which time tubes with no growth were discarded (21) . We incubated the BACTEC 12 B vials at 37 ± 2°C and monitored them in the BACTEC 460 instrument for 6 weeks (21, 22) . We incubated MGIT 960 tubes at 37 ± 2°C and monitored them in the BACTEC MGIT 960 instrument for 6 weeks (21-23). Colonies from solid media and liquid culture bottles that showed positive signals were confi rmed as M. tuberculosis complex identifi cation by a combination of Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining and the AccuProbe M. tuberculosis complex nucleic acid probes (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) (21, 23) . We then used niacin and nitrate biochemical tests to distinguish M. bovis from M. tuberculosis isolates (21, 23) . Formalin-fi xed tissues were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Any granulomatous lesions were then stained with a modifi ed Ziehl-Neelson procedure and an auramine orange and acridine orange procedure (24, 25) . When tissues were identifi ed as having granulomatous le-sions and acid-fast bacilli, they were further evaluated by PCR. The PCR was performed on the formalin-fi xed, paraffi n-embedded tissue by using primers for IS6110 to identify M. tuberculosis complex species, which include M. bovis, and 16S rRNA to identify M. avium complex species. The PCR procedures were similar to those described previously (22) . Animals were considered positive if bacterial cultures isolated M. bovis from fresh tissues and/or fi xed tissues had granulomatous lesions with acid-fast bacilli that were PCR positive for IS6110. All histologic screenings and PCRs were conducted at NVSL. We used a log-linear model (26) to determine whether the count of M. bovis-positive coyotes was independent among age classes and sexes. We used adjusted residuals for describing and making inferences about the true association structure among the response variables. We used a Mann-Whitney test (27) to compare prevalence of M. bovis in coyotes to white-tailed deer sampled by MDNR during the same period.
