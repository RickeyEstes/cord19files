This study analyzed the data of Taipei Metropolitan from 2000 to 2009. Locating in the basin of northern Taiwan, Taipei Metropolitan (Taipei City and New Taipei City) is the economic and political center of Taiwan. Its population exceeds 6 million, which comprises near one-fourth of the total Taiwan population (Ministry of the Interior, 2006) . Although the Mass Rapid Transit system provides over one million daily transportations for over 20 years, traffic emissions remain the major air pollution source.
