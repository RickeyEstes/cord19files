In 2003 we developed a standard process for implementing FELTPs as part of the creation of the first FELTP in Kenya. We have used this standard process for all the subsequent FELTPs in sub-Saharan Africa. Before starting the FELTP in each country, CDC received an invitation from the MOH which led to a cascade of activities, including: a) a pre-assessment visit, b) a formal assessment and program planning visit, c) identifying a funding source for the program plan, d) developing an MOH-led steering committee, e) developing and obtaining approval of the FELTP curriculum, f) recruiting key staff for the FELTP, g) implementing short courses in field epidemiology for key frontline staff and for screening of the initial cohort of FELTP participants, h) recruiting the first cohort of the FELTP, and i) implementing the 2-year FELTP. Each of these activities is described in detail below. For regional programs (FELTPs which involving more than one country) we adapted this process with more focus on the host country at startup of the regional FELTP. The pre-assessment visits were conducted by a small team consisting of staff from CDC and existing FELTPs and PHSWOWs who visited the potential FELTP host country for about 1 week. The objectives of the visits were to gauge the interest of the MOH and its partners in starting an FELTP, to encourage the formation of an MOH-led Steering Committee, and to plan for the formal FELTP assessment and program planning visit. During the assessment and planning visits, conducted by a larger team usually 2-4 months after the pre-assessment, a representative sample of public health facilities at national and sub-national levels including public health laboratories were assessed using standard tools from the CDC FETP handbook to determine how they would participate in an FELTP [17] . Local universities were also assessed to determine their interest in the FELTP training model (which has a limited didactic period). If they were interested we determined the process to obtain a university-endorsed and approved FELTP curriculum that would be adapted from the standard core FETP curriculum developed by CDC [18] . Another team determined the cost of implementing an FELTP in the host country (and participating countries in a regional FELTP). At the end of each formal assessment we prepared an FELTP 5-year work plan including cost details and presented this to the first meeting of the FELTP Steering Committee. The Steering Committee, usually chaired by the highest ranking technical MOH official (e.g., the director of public health or chief medical officer), had representation from all the major stakeholders (e.g., CDC country office, World Health Organization representative, university senior leadership, public health laboratory service, veterinary service, and donors). Implementation of the FELTP work plan began with the identification of resources for the program and selection of the university or universities to host the FELTP. In general most FELTPs began with a short course component to train frontline public health workers to address immediate field epidemiology, surveillance, outbreak investigation, and laboratory needs. The short courses were generally 2-weeks long and trained up to 30 participants per course. They were also used as screening courses for the first FELTP cohort, and were taught by a mix of international and regional FELTP and EIS graduates. Participants in the short courses had to develop and implement an applied learning project for 3 months at their worksites after the 2-week training as requirement for passing the course. These projects provided immediate benefit for the host country. Many countries conducted at least two short courses before starting the 2-year FELTP and these short courses continued along with the implementation of the FELTP. The 2-year FELTP activities began with the recruitment of key staff, including at least one resident advisor who was usually a graduate of an FELTP or EIS or an experienced field epidemiologist, development of an FELTP office, finalization of the curriculum, and the advertisement and selection of the first cohort of the FELTP. The class size of the first cohort ranged from 10 to 15 with a mix of field epidemiology, public health laboratory, Page number not for citation purposes 4 and veterinary candidates. The training strategy and competencies and expected outputs have been described elsewhere and are similar for all FELTPs in sub-Saharan Africa [16] . In 2005 we collaborated with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the three PHSWOWs (i.e., Ghana, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and the Kenya FELTP to develop and then support the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) which is a networking and service alliance of African FELTPs [19] [20] [21] . AFENET, which is headquartered in Uganda, has become CDC's principal implementing partner for developing, staffing, and operating FELTPs in sub-Saharan Africa. CDC has worked with AFENET to plan and develop FELTPs, to participate in organizing short courses, and to implement regional initiatives for FELTPs (e.g., regional biennial scientific meetings and regional training fellowships). CDC provided technical assistance from Atlanta in the operation of the FELTPs through program specific teams that included field epidemiologists (generally graduates of the CDC EIS Program), instructional designers, public health advisors, and health education specialists. The Atlanta teams worked with the in-country resident advisors to provide assistance in program design, curriculum design, teaching, evaluation, quality assurance, direct funding, and fundraising. CDC staff worked collaboratively with FELTP program staff who were either host country MOH staff or host institution personnel and were led by a host country national that was the FELTP program director. In 2007, CDC began to maintain a tracking system for all field epidemiology training programs globally with information on participant numbers and outputs that was compiled annually into a report that is disseminated to key stakeholders [22] . In 2008 we defined a series of critical outcome measures for FELTPs to better align them with their public health surveillance and response system strengthening mission [15, 23] . The following critical outcomes should be increasingly evident in the host country's MOH if the FELTP is successfully contributing to its mission: a) Functional and robust public health surveillance systems, often beginning with notifiable disease surveillance and then non-communicable disease surveillance systems; b) Prompt and effective response to public health emergencies including disease outbreaks and other public health threats; c) A culture of evidence-based decision making in public health whereby programmatic decisions are based on scientifically sound data; d) A strengthened and motivated public health workforce composed of FELTP graduates of the 2-year program and the short courses conducted for frontline (i.e., sub-national, regional, provincial) public health workers; e)Evidence that the FELTP is contributing to a reduction in morbidity and mortality from priority disease conditions.
