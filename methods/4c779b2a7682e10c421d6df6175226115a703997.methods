Based on the analysis undertaken in the literature review, a conceptual overview of the research components is proposed in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 shows that the bureaucratic organization empowered to make policy on the golden week holiday system is the State Council of China, China's equivalent to a central government cabinet. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) is one of the stakeholder bureaucratic departments involved in the policy making process and represents tourism-related interests. The other departments involved in this process, which are not listed in Fig. 1 due to the research objectives of this study, include a variety of agencies such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Transportation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration of Work Safety. This paper is an explanatory study with a primary research objective of describing the respective policy making mechanisms the State Council used for the golden week holiday system in 1999 and 2007. The main research question for this study is as follows: how were the 1999 and 2007 golden week holiday system policies made? Corresponding to the afore-reviewed literature on the pivotal stages of policy agenda setting and policy demand prioritization in the policy making process, the primary research objective can be further divided into the following three specific objectives: (1) to investigate the respective policy inputs in terms of the major policy demands of the two policies; (2) to explore the extent of bureaucratic competition in terms of the weight of tourism-related policy demands when each of the two policies were formulated; and (3) to examine the respective policy agenda setting regimes in terms of the level of civil participation in formulating the two policies. These three specific dimensions of the policy making mechanism focus on the decision-making context of the policy making mechanism, and are selected for evaluation here in recognition of rationales conforming to both the general literature on public policy making mechanisms and the peculiarities of tourism policies, together with the unique Chinese political and bureaucratic contexts. The first research objective on the major respective major policy demands in the two years in question is a key dimension of the policy making process, which serves as the foundation upon which precise policy is formulated (Li, 2006) . The second research objective addresses the 'noisy' tourism policy arena in which, due to the complexity of the tourism industry, there are a number of diverse competing interests (Jeffries, 2001) . Finally, to assess the nature of policy agenda setting for what is a social phenomenon in contemporary China in a social context that is currently in the 'primary stage of socialism' and undergoing a fundamental transformation into a socialist market economy, the third research objective is intended to explore either consistency with or deviation from existing theoretical elaborations, most of which characterize Chinese public policy agenda setting in general as largely internally driven because of a distinct party-state dualism and a highly centralized bureaucracy (Wu, 2005) . Taking account of the peculiarities of public policy studies in both the tourism and Chinese contexts, this study undertakes a content analysis of documents related to policy making on the golden week holiday system for the period 1999-2007 with the assistance of computer analysis software including SPSS and QSR NUDIST (Qualitative Solutions and Research, Non-numerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing). Content analysis refers to the systematic analysis of textual data already coded for pattern and structure examination and confirmation, category development, and aggregation into perceptible constructs (Gray & Densten, 1998; Insch & Moore, 1997) . One of the unique benefits of content analysis is its compatibility with both qualitative and quantitative methods, in that it is capable of capturing a richer sense of the concepts expressed within the data due to its qualitative basis, and, at the same time, classifying words into content categories on a quantitative basis, which is why content analysis is also described as a form of contingency analysis in which content categories are extracted and the number of times a theme appears in the text counted (Roberts, 2000; Weber, 1985) . Content analysis has been intensively applied in public policy research, and its merits in the tourism realm have been gradually appreciated in recent years, which is partly attributed to the proliferation of internet-based contents as research data sources (Hall & Valentin, 2005) . By far, The tourism discipline has witnessed the successful and convincing utilizations of content analysis in such fields as the effects of tourism advertising materials and campaigns (Henderson, 2003) , image building of tourism destinations (Sirakaya & Soenmez, 2000; Zhang & Cameron, 2003) , variations in conceptual understandings in tourism (Cloke & Perkins, 2002; Garrod, 2003) , and the perceptions of tourism from the perspectives of the tourists (Chen et al., 2001; Yagi, 2001) . The research process undertaken for this study was as follows. First, documents and other materials in multi-media forms including written, audio and visual formats were collected in an effort to gather a critical volume of documentary evidence on golden week policies. A total of forty-five documents were gathered, including minutes of relevant official conferences and meetings, speeches made by leading officials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, and reports from various types of mass media such as television, newspapers, and magazines. Other than six documents that were entirely devoted to discussions on golden week holiday policy making in either 1999 or 2007, the remaining 39 all referred to both years. The contents of the documents were then analyzed utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods, with the assistance of SPSS and QSR NUDIST software. The analysis was conducted in two steps. First, from a qualitative perspective, two separate files were created in NUDIST to correspond to the respective time slots of 1999 and 2007, and the relevant data were input accordingly. The units of analysis for this study were text units that correspond to the respective research objectives. Such text units can be words, phrases, or short sentences of no longer than 30 words, and we were able to make minor grammatical changes if necessary without distorting the original meaning. During the analysis, each of the three specific research objectives was coded as a primary construct for each file created. Text units from the documents that the authors deemed relevant to a specific primary construct were coded and categorized under the primary construct. Similar text units were aggregated after coding. Meanwhile, text units which were overlapping in that they referred to two or more research objectives were accounted for separately under the related primary construct. With regard to all three of the research objectives, coding, re-categorization, and aggregation procedures were conducted to establish the hierarchical structures among related text units under the same primary construct. To ensure the rigidity and consistency of the coding process, the entire process followed the guidance and requirements set out in Neuendorf's (2002) code book. Specifically, to enhance the internal validity of the data analysis undertaken, we used the cross-coder assessment method during the coding phase of the content analysis. Cross-coder assessment refers to the utilization of more than one coder in coding the same content independently before establishing inter-coder reliability for the adoption of the coded units of analysis (Neuendorf, 2002) . Two of the authors of this study first coded the research materials on an independent basis before comparing and assessing the separate codings. Prior evidence (McBeth, Shanahan, Arnell, & Hathaway, 2007) has shown that inter-coder reliability can be established when more than 80% of the codings can be agreed upon. Altogether, the two coders initially agreed on 86%, 82%, and 91% of the codings for each of the three respective research objectives, thereby establishing an acceptable level of inter-coder reliability. For codings in which discrepancies arose, discussions were held until a consensus was reached and all codings were approved. The principles of constant comparative analysis were also observed to reify the inductive approaches adopted in this study to extract new concepts and relationships (Jennings, 2001) . In the second stage of quantitative analysis, corresponding text units from the two files were then input into SPSS to be compared through Chi-square tests and examine their relationships with policy making in the two respective years. In the Chi-square tests, the exact degree of such relationships were represented by calculating indices such as Cram√© r's V and odds ratios (Veal, 2006) . We discuss the findings in the following section.
