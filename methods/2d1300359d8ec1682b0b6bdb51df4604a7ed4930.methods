Aeromedical team and the process: This team consisted of an emergency physician with a licensed first-level and critical care paramedic who work at a university emergency center. When Korean travelers encounter medical emergency situations and hospitalize abroad, they contact to our aeromedical team through several routes (family, friends, domestic hospitals, government, etc) to be transported back to Korea. We discuss with them about transport method and consult with the foreign hospital. When transportation is approved by the patient's hospital physician abroad, we arrange transportation for the patient. Transportation of patients is via flight stretcher, flight-prestige, ship, or specified air ambulance. Flight stretcher is made with 6 economic class seats and flight-prestige is one business or first-class seat for the patient. Ship transportation is via regular international passenger ship and air ambulance is specified for 1 patient with all medical equipment. Once transportation is approved by both countries then we reserve the agreed method of transportation and emergency ambulances from both countries and transport the patient back to our country (Fig. 1 ).
