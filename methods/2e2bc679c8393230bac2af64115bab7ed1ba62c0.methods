The trial has covered 30 injured patients aged from 21 to 60 years with 25 to 78% skin burns and PO 2 /FiO 2 <300. Patients were randomized into two groups. The fi rst group was n = 13, PO 2 /FiO 2 <300, 24 to 72 h after burn. The second group was n = 17, PO 2 /FiO 2 <300, 4 to 11 days after burn. Injured persons were subjected to evaluation of cardiac index (CI), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBI), extravascular lung water index (ELWI0 and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) by single transpulmonary thermodilution (PiCCOplus; Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany), calculation of oxygen delivery (DO 2 ), and colloidal osmotic pressure of plasma. Grade of pulmonary damage was evaluated by Murrey, severity of dispragia by SOFA. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson and Spearman criteria (r; P). Diff erences were signifi cant at P <0.05. Results Hypoxaemia (PO 2 /FiO 2 = 259 ± 19) in the injured of the fi rst group was developing at the background of reduction of CI = 3.2 ± 0.5; ITBI = 751 ± 114; DO 2 = 596 ± 124 (r = -0.92; P = 0.02). ELWI level was normal (7.3 ± 0.8). In the second group, reduction of PO 2 /FiO 2 has been developing at the background of burn sepsis (average SOFA point = 7.0 ± 1.9, Murrey = 1.6 ± 0.4) and was caused by increasing of ELWI up to 9.0 ± 1.4 (r = -0.66; P = 0.002) and correlated with PVPI (r = 0.57; P = 0.01). There was no statistically signifi cant correlation ELWI with ITBI and colloidal osmotic pressure of plasma (r = 0.13, r = -0.42). Conclusions Gas exchange disorders in patients of the fi rst group were caused by lack of perfusion and misbalance between oxygen delivery and demand. Reduction of oxygenation index in patients from the second group was accompanied by ELWI at the background of alteration of intravascular penetration and sepsis. Introduction Prior non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is associated with an increased mortality in patients with haematological malignancies and acute respiratory failure treated by invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Methods We have assessed whether NIV failure is an independent prognostic factor for hospital discharge in a general cancer population treated by IMV. One hundred and six patients with solid tumours and 58 patients with haematological malignancies were eligible for this retrospective study; 41 were treated by NIV before IMV. The data for 102 patients who were treated for swelling of the larynx at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich from 2004 to 2008 were evaluated in a retrospective survey. Results Causes of laryngeal AE were in 26 patients an allergic reaction, in 33 cases were due to radiotherapy after cancer, 32 patients took an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), one patient had a hereditary angioedema (HAE) and in 10 patients are unknown. All patients independent from the underlying cause were treated with high-dose intravenous steroids, 69 patients with antihistamines, 33 with epinephrine (inhalation or i.m.), two patients with ACEI-induced AE were successfully treated with icatibant. Ten patients needed an intubation, 11 a tracheotomy, one patient an emergency coniotomy to preserve the airway. All 11 tracheotomy patients suff ered from cancer. Nine out of 10 intubated patients took an ACEI and were extubated on the ICU after 2 to 7 days. Conclusions According to our experience 80% of the patients with laryngeal swelling and upper airway obstruction react well to the standard therapy with steroids, epinephrine and antihistamines, indicating that the AE is histamine induced. In contrast these drugs have almost no eff ect on bradykinin-induced angioedema; that is, AE induced by ACEI. There is preliminary evidence that the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist icatibant that is approved for treatment of HAE type I and II may also be eff ective in ACEI-induced edema. Forty-six laryngoscopes were tested. All had traditional vacuum incandescent bulbs. Twelve (26%) fell below 1,000 Lux and six (13%) fell below the 500 Lux minimum. The failures were corrected by battery replacement in 25% and by bulb replacement in the remaining 75% (see Figure 1 ). Conclusions Simply checking laryngoscopes for the presence of illumination on a regular basis is insuffi cient to ensure best or even adequate function. Poor function is as frequently related to bulb dysfunction as battery fatigue. Institutions should consider quality control and maintenance programs or consider more advanced laryngoscopic lighting (for example, LED or halogen bulbs). References (Table 1) . We did not fi nd signifi cant diff erences of respiratory and hemodynamic data between groups; MR did not induce cardiovascular instability: the mean cardiac output was 5.2 ± 2.2 vs 4.9 ± 1.5 l/min (MRa vs no-MRa, respectively). Conclusions RM with CPAP performed before PDT could be performed safely to prevent alveolar derecruitment due to PDT. The participants (12 physicians, 38 nurses) were randomised to use the standard BVM or SB to ventilate a resuscitation training manikin over 1 minute. The mechanism of the SB was shortly described in the SB group but no hands-on training was provided. Participants were asked to ventilate the patients as they would do if patients have a pulse but do not breathe. Tidal volumes were registered to a computer connected to the manikin. The survey was carried out over a period of 13 weeks. Data collected from patients' case notes included site of central line insertion, length of line in situ, reason for line removal and positive blood culture reports. Results During the study period, 104 patients were treated on the unit. Fifty-two central venous lines were inserted in 36 patients (63.5% femoral (n = 33), 32.7% internal jugular (n = 17) and 3.9% subclavian lines (n = 2)). The lines were reviewed daily and removed if indicated clinically (pyrexia or raised white cell count) or if not required. A total 51.5% of femoral lines (n = 17) were removed due to clinical indications, as were 29% (n = 5) of internal jugular and 50% (n = 1) of subclavian lines. The average duration of a line remaining in situ was 4.5 days for femoral, 6 days for internal jugular and 5 days for subclavian lines. Blood cultures were taken at the time of line removal. These yielded positive results in eight femoral, seven internal jugular and one subclavian line. Our survey indicated that the incidence of ICR-BSI in our unit is 30.8% (of this 62.5% coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 12.5% E. coli and Pseudomonas each, and 6.25% MSSA and MRSA each). Conclusions The distribution of microorganisms causing bacteraemia is broadly similar in our unit to that in other teaching hospitals in the UK [2] , in that CNS was the commonest organism isolated. However, E. coli and Pseudomonas were the next common organisms, unlike other units where Staphylococcus aureus was the second most prevalent organism. The incidence of bacteraemia from femoral lines (53.7/1,000 catheter-days) was lower than that from internal jugular lines (68.6/1,000 catheter-days) possibly due to a higher index of suspicion in the case of femoral lines and earlier removal (Figure 1 ). Our study highlights the fact that femoral lines, which are often the safest option for unstable patients with head injury, can be eff ectively managed with strict adherence to guidelines to reduce ICR-BSI.
