Over a two-year period from 2007 to 2009, key informants were invited to take part in interviews. Interviewees were from organisations contacted by the first two authors in the course of collecting preliminary data for epidemiological research grants to prevent transmission of blood borne diseases amongst IDU. Each stakeholder was informed that they could refrain from commenting on sensitive issues and that no personal identifying information would be used in the final report. Interviews were conducted by the first author between March 2008 and June 2009 and recorded as shorthand notes, which were later transcribed into a word processing programme to facilitate key term searches. A broad topic guide allowed for greater flexibility to explore a range of issues but helped to maintain a focus on differences between NSEP and MMT, roles of different government industries in China's harm reduction programmes, and suggestions for future programmes. Prior to intervention-specific questions, definitions of key interview terms were explained to each participant. Eighteen key informants representing nine establishments participated in interviews. They included individuals from the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, n = 2), government operated MMT clinics (Kunming, Kaiyuan, Beijing; n = 6), independently operated NSEP (Beijing, Kunming, Kaiyuan; n = 3), municipal level departments of public security (Kunming, n = 2), and mandatory and voluntary detoxification centres (Kunming, Kaiyuan; n = 5). In addition a web-based search was conducted in both English and Chinese for publicly available government documents, including white papers, legal documents, and policy statements. Iterations of Boolean searches were used involving various combinations of the terms: "drugs," "narcotics," "drug control," "opiate addiction," "medical maintenance treatment," "methadone," "injection drug use," "China," "disease control," and "public health" and "HIV/AIDS." Relevant peer reviewed articles published in both languages were also included after searching Pubmed/Medline and China Academic Journals (CNKI) databases using the same search terms listed above.
