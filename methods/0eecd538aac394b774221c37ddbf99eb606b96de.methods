Each participant tested two PPE systems: a) system A: full-body suit including respirator -e.g. Tychem F protective suit including socks -e.g. 3M TM reusable light cap S-655 -e.g. 3M TM Jupiter TM cooling unit -e.g. Sempermed surgical gloves (optional) -e.g. boots b) System B: full-body suit with fully integrated ventilation system (positive pressure) -e.g. 3M TM JS-series Typ 3 Respiratory Protective Suit (CRPS) -e.g. Sempermed surgical gloves (optional) -e.g. boots at two different climate zones (module I: ~ 20°C / module II: ~ 28°C) on two different days. On each testing day between two and four subjects perform the series of testings listed below. Each subject is assigned through a system of randomisation called http://www.randomizer.at/, which decided with which PPE system the subject is supposed to start the testing series. The test series described below are run in succession where the test persons start in a time-delayed fashion. After 15 minutes, they change to the next test. Between the various tests, there is a five-minute recreation break. Tests 1-3 are repeated until the test person cannot tolerate the conditions any more or stops for another reason During the test phases the following parameters are measured and recorded regularly: heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen saturationand body temperature. Immediately before and after the separate modules urine and saliva specimens are taken in order to create a metabolite profile, and the weight of the body and the equipment are measured in order to be able to calculate the loss of fluids. In addition to the measurements mentioned above an extensive instruction, explanation and anamnesis will happen before the study starts. The test persons are encouraged to comment on their subjective feelings during the test series, furthermore there is an hourly survey by way of a structured questionnaire (including a continuous record on the communications system).
