The aim of this study is to assess the resilience of the Lebanese health system in the face of an acute and severe crisis and in the context of political instability. While many conceptual frameworks for resilience exist [23] there is no unified definition of health system resilience, or an established method to measure it [24] . One framework offers 5 dimensions to assess the potential of health system resilience to an emerging crisis, but a standardized set of internationally accepted indicators for these dimensions have yet to be developed and tested empirically [25] . For the purpose of this study, we have used the following working definition of a resilient system: "a resilient system has the capacity to absorb change due to external or internal shocks, maintain original functions and ensure long-term sustainability" [26] [27] [28] [29] . When studying the resilience of the Lebanese health system we drew on insights from studies of health systems that have faced refugee crises -studies which have considered the ability of a health system to maintain service delivery, prevent major outbreaks and sustain improvements in population level outcome indicators including utilization, service coverage, morbidity and mortality rates, as measures of success [30] [31] [32] [33] . The indicators used in these earlier studies are in line with the definition of resilience we have used. This definition stresses the ability of a system to reorganize and adapt to change while maintaining original functions and ensuring long-term sustainability [26] [27] [28] . The study employs a case study approach and draws on data from multiple sources. We use an input-process-output/outcome model of a health system [30] , where inputs, processes and outputs measure the capacity of the health system while outcomes measure its performance [30] . This approach allows for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the Lebanese health system and offers enough flexibility to capture both the contextual characteristics of the system and factors in place during the acute crisis that have affected the health system response and resilience. The study, which took place from January 2014 to July 2015, consisted of two main components: a literature review on resilience and how to measure it, and analysis of secondary data to document the impact of the refugee crisis and the health system response in Lebanon. For the literature review, we undertook a search using the following databases: OVID Medline, the Cochrane Library, Box 1. Lebanese health system -a brief overview The health system in Lebanon is a public-private partnership with multiple sources of funding and channels of delivery. Almost one half of the population is financially covered by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), an autonomous public establishment or by other governmental (civil servants cooperative and military schemes) or private insurance. All those schemes provide financial coverage with variable patient copays. The non-adherents are entitled to the coverage of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) for secondary and tertiary care at both public and private institutions. Palestinian refugees are covered through the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) for their health care services [9] . Although the MOPH does not cover ambulatory care services, it provides in kind support to a national network of primary health care (PHC) centers all over Lebanon [2] . The centers provide consultations with medical specialists at reduced cost, as well as medicines for chronic illness and vaccines funded by the ministry of health [2] . Around 68% of the primary health care centers in the national network are owned by NGOs while 80% of hospitals belong to the private sector [2] . The strong presence of the private sector in service delivery has led to an oversupply of hospital beds and technology [2] . While there is an oversupply of physicians, there is a shortage of nurses [10] . and Health Systems Evidence. In addition, we searched gray literature databases such as Reliefweb, MedNar, OAIS-TER, Open DOAR, PROSPERO and OpenGrey. Local data were obtained from multiple sources, namely the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health database which included data on service utilization, human resources, immunization coverage, and epidemiological surveillance. We also used national health accounts data (that uses the System of Health Accounts 1.0) and maternal mortality observatory data. The MOPH information systems and the maternal mortality observatory data sets are designed to incorporate ongoing assessment and reporting related to displaced Syrians, including for immunization coverage, disease surveillance and utilization of health services in addition to maternal and child mortality. Other sources included statistics from the Lebanese Ministry of Finance, Bank of Lebanon and the Central Administration for Statistics (CAS), UN agency publications, World Bank assessments, and international and local NGOs publications.
