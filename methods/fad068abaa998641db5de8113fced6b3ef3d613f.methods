Bacterial strains and cell cultures. P. gulae strains ATCC 51700 (fimA type A), D040 (fimA type B), and D049 (fimA type C) were selected from the stock culture collection in our laboratory 7, 8, 24 . Bacterial cells were grown anaerobically at 37 °C for 24 h in trypticase soy broth supplemented with yeast extract (1 mg/ml), haemin (5 μg/ml), and menadione (1 μg/ml), as previously described 48 ; they were then used in the following experiments. Ca9-22 cells (originally isolated from human gingival epithelia) were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan); these cells were used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells 28 because they have been widely used as an in vitro culture model of gingival epithelial cells 28, 49 . The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Bacterial growth. Bacterial growth was analysed in accordance with previously described methods, with some modifications [50] [51] [52] . Various concentrations of clindamycin were tested for their effects on P. gulae growth: 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 μg/ml. In addition, various concentrations of IFN-α formulation were tested: 0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μg/ml. Clindamycin and IFN-α formulation, separately or in combination, were added to the trypticase soy broth supplemented with yeast extract, haemin, and menadione used for bacterial suspension growth. In addition, overnight cultured P. gulae bacteria were added to the media at a density of 4 × 10 8 CFU/ml and then cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Bacterial growth after incubation was measured by determining the optical density at 600 nm using a microplate reader (SH-1000 Lab, Corona Electric, Katsuta, Japan), because the number of P. gulae bacteria in a given suspension has been previously estimated by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm and subsequent extrapolation from a standard curve 53 . The relative ratio of growth of each P. gulae strain was calculated by comparison with the optical density at 600 nm value of each bacterial broth without clindamycin. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9). Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for quantitative detection of mRnA expression. Ca9-22 cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum until confluent. After incubation, the monolayers of Ca9-22 cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM to remove unattached cells. Additionally, the number of viable cells in each monolayer was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting method. IFN-α (100 μg/ml) was preincubated with Ca9-22 cells prior to addition of bacteria. Overnight cultured P. gulae were harvested and washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The bacteria were then diluted to 1 × 10 8 CFU/ml in DMEM and used to infect Ca9-22 cells. For experiments involving bacterial infection of Ca-22 cells, we used the concept of multiplicity of infection (MOI), which is commonly defined as the ratio of infectious microorganisms to cells in a culture 54 . Ca9-22 cells were diluted to a density of 1 × 10 6 and infected with 1 × 10 8 CFU of respective P. gulae strains at MOI of 100 for 0-12 h. Then, total RNA was extracted from these P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells and cDNA was synthesized as described previously 55 . Briefly, total RNA from Ca9-22 cells was isolated using TRIsure (BIOLINE, Luckenwalde, Germany) and converted into cDNA using an iScript ™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were amplified using a QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The primers specific for genes encoding IL-1β, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-β1, which were used in this study, are listed in Table 2 . GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control and negative reverse transcription reactions were included in each assay. Expression values for mRNA were quantified by the ΔΔCt method, using GAPDH as the control. All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions (n = 9). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). P. gulae strains were used to infect Ca9-22 cells with or without administration of the IFN-α formulation, as described in the above section regarding RT-PCR. ELISAs were performed in accordance with previously described methods, with some modifications 56 . Ca9-22 cells were stimulated with P. gulae strains in the presence or absence of IFN-α for 24 h. For the quantification of IL-1β, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-β1 in cell lysate at each time point, sandwich ELISAs were performed using the Human IL-1β ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc., Rosemont, IL, USA), Human/mouse total COX-2 DuoSet IC ELISA (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), IL-8 ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc.) and TGF-β1 ELISA kit (Proteintech Group Inc.), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Absorbance was Schedule in clinical experiment. The clinical experiment was conducted in full adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki. All study protocols were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Azabu University. Prior to the clinical experiment, all owners were informed of the content of the study and gave written informed consent for approval of their pets' participation. The schedule for clinical treatment is summarized in Fig. 3 . In total, 52 dogs (28 males, 24 females; median age: 10 years [range: 1-15 years]) were enrolled (Table 1) ; all dogs received periodontal treatment under general anaesthesia. The subjects were divided into four groups with or without pharmaceutical treatments, as follows: no pharmaceutical treatment (control group; n = 12), clindamycin treatment (clindamycin group; n = 10), IFN-α formulation treatment (IFN-α group; n = 14), and combined clindamycin and IFN-α formulation treatment (combination group; n = 16). In the clindamycin group, clindamycin 5 mg/kg was administered via the oral cavity twice per day, beginning 4 days before treatment and ending 3 days after periodontal treatment (a total of 7 days), in accordance with the guidelines of the American Animal Hospital Association 57 . In the IFN-α group, 2.75 g of IFN-α formulation (InterBerryα ® ) was applied to the gingival margin of all teeth, 10 times total over 35 days after periodontal treatment. The combination group received both clindamycin and IFN-α formulation treatments, in accordance with the methods described above. Oral swab specimens were collected from the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth premolar using a micro brush (Microapplicator fine, FEED Corporation, Yokohama, Japan), as described previously 24 , several days before and 5 weeks after periodontal treatment. evaluation of periodontal conditions before and after clinical treatment. Periodontal scores were determined by assessment of the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth maxillary premolar, several days before and 5 weeks after periodontal treatment, using a modified version of a previously described method 13 . For each dog, gingival scores of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth premolar were evaluated visually as follows: (1) no significant findings; (2) mild periodontal disease-gingival swelling, gingival regression, and halitosis; (3) moderate periodontal disease-exposure of root, spontaneous bleeding, and tooth loss; and (4) severe periodontal disease-furcation involvement and fistula formation.
