Medical anthropologists are experimenting with a number of novel methodologies made possible by the availability of new technologies. One such method is participatory geographic information systems (GIS) mapping. When used in conjunction with ethnographic research methods, such mapping permits a better understanding of local perceptions of the distribution of health problems. Local populations are shown maps depicting higher and lower prevalence rates of a focal problem or syndemic, and then asked to participate in problem solving about what factors contribute to the patterns visually shown. The method then layers maps with existing information on who inhabits different places and what is known about the space and the people who inhabit these places. Mapping makes transparent what information health officials are collecting and seeing as risk factors, and allows local populations to interrogate these data and the way it is collected. They are also given the opportunity to identify relevant data they think is not being collected. This is an empowering methodology that does more than simply validate or cross-check epidemiological patterns and distributions of environmental problems. It facilitates community discussion of these patterns, their meaning, and possible solutions. Photo voice is another promising methodology that can be used alone or in conjunction with participatory mapping. It consists of giving community members the technology to create visual representations of their own locale, patterns of social interaction, and physical activity in different spaces at different times. They are also asked to record such things as what spaces are deemed safe or dangerous at different times as related to seasonality or the risk of disasters such as storm surges and flooding. Other things that may be captured by photo voice include seasonal challenges that impact on health and health care seeking, such as water availability and transportation. Like maps, these visual representations of local places foster community dialogue and a grounding of discussion in the lifeworld of participants.
