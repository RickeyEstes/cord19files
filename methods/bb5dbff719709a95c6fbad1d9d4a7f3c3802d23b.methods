Hygiene and potential pathogen transfer were assessed by observation of public visitor and trader behaviour, with special reference to contact involving animals, animal containers, related intermediary surfaces (such as table tops), as well as contacts involving hands, body and clothing. All items (including animals and inanimate items) directly associated with the sellers' stalls were presumed contaminated. Pathogen transfer from local contamination sources is well known, and it is reasonable to anticipate that at a stall at which animals are sold, all animals and animal-related material will probably have been exposed to microbial transfer and dissemination. Each investigator engaged in five minutes of observation at a location (e.g. a trader stall) and noted all visitor contact behaviours. Figures 1a and 1b outline the mode of contact observation systems. Individuals who handled or otherwise touched animals were noted as 'direct' contact events and those who touched proximal inanimate intermediary surfaces were noted as 'indirect' contact events with a presumed contaminated source. Both direct and indirect contact events were further observed to establish whether they subsequently touched their own head ('hand to head including mouth' = 'H1'), body ('hand to body or clothes' = 'H2 0 ) or other person (hand to another person = 'H3'). Results were marked on preprinted tables under categories of 'Direct', 'Indirect,' 'H1 0 , 'H2 0 and 'H3 0 , and tallied after each five-minute observation period. Hygiene efforts (referring to intentional efforts of a person to sanitize their hands or related action) were recorded (not tabulated) by observing whether or not individuals attempted to, for example, clean their hands immediately after contact with a presumed contaminated source.
