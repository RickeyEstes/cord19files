Chemicals and reagents. Yeast vectors, Y2H gold strain, Aureobasidin A (630466) and X-α gal (630463) were from Clontech (Mountain View, California, USA). Mav203 strain was from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, California, USA). Amino acid supplements, 3-Amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT, A8056), IPTG (I6758) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). Anti-His (SC-57598), anti-myc (SC-789) and anti-Flag (SC-807) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas, USA). Lysozyme (10153516103) was from Roche (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). Ni NTA agarose (25215) and Glutathione agarose (16100) were from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Peptide affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the macro domain (X) of HEV was generated at Genscript (Piscataway Township, New Jersey, USA) using KLH (Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin) conjugated peptide antigens. Peptide sequence is: CPDYRLEHNPKRLEA. Pre immune serum was collected from the animals prior to immunization. ELISA using peptides as antigen and pre immune serum as negative controls confirmed their titres to be > 1:512,000. In competition assays, corresponding peptides could block the binding of cognate antibodies. Functionality of the antibody in western was validated by testing its ability to detect the purified X-domain (from bacteria) and the X-domain expressed in Huh 7 cells. Cloning. Desired fragments were either PCR amplified using specific primers and template or isolated by restriction digestion and ligated into the target vector following standard protocols 44 . Details of the procedure for individual clones are listed in Supplementary Table S2 and primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S3 . All clones were verified by restriction mapping and confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Transformation and whole cell extract preparation. Y2H Gold and Mav203 strains were transformed using Lithium Acetate, following manufacturer's instruction. Transformation mixture was plated on LT − Synthetic Dropout media. Three days post-transfection, colonies were used for replica plating, whole cell extract preparation or quantitative liquid α -galactosidase assay. For whole cell extract preparation, spheroplasts were prepared by treatment with Zymolyase (5units/10 6 cells), followed by lysis in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50mM DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue). Yeast Two Hybrid assay. Lithium Acetate transformed Y2H Gold or Mav203 cells were grown on LT − plates, followed by replica plating into required selection medium. For Y2H Gold, LTH − , LTHA − , LTH − A r+ , LT − + X-α gal, LTH − + 5 mM 3-AT, LTH − + 10 mM 3-AT and LTH − + 20 mM 3-AT were used. Plates were grown for 3 days at 30 °C in a humidified incubator, followed by visual scoring of colony growth in a scale of "+ " to "+ + + " where + , + + and+ + + indicates poor, average and strong growth, respectively. Yeast Three Hybrid assay. pBRIDGE vector containing GAL4-BD fused ORF3 cloned under the control of constitutive ADH1 promoter (in MCS1) and methyltransferase in a second expression cassette (in MCS2), under the control of methionine deprivation induced MET25 promoter, was used to perform the Yeast Three Hybrid assay 30 . A second construct was also generated in which methyltransferase was inserted in the MCS1 and ORF3 in the MCS2. These vectors were cotransformed into Y2H gold along with the AD X, in the required combination and plated on LT − plates supplemented with 1 mM methionine (compared to 0.13 mM methionine in regular Y2H selection plates). Eight random colonies from each plate were replica plated into LTHA − , LTH − A r+ , LT − + X-α -gal, LTH − + 5 mM 3-AT and LTH − + 10 mM 3-AT plates, supplemented with 1 mM methionine. A second set of replica plating was done into LTM − plates to induce MET 25 promoter dependent protein expression from MCS2. Four days post incubation at 30 °C in a humidified chamber, colonies from LT − or LTM − plates were again replica plated into various selection media containing 1 mM methionine or no methionine. Colony growth was scored on day four-post incubation. Data are representative of three independent experiments. For monitoring competition between the methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins for binding to the X-domain, a pull down assay was conducted by using approximately same molar equivalents of each protein (~500 fmol) in the binding mixture. Based on the size of the fusion protein and quantitation obtained from comparison with BSA standard in coomassie stained gel, 1 pmol of GST-X, Met-His and ORF3-His corresponded to 50 ng, 40 ng and 16 ng proteins, respectively. For comparing the affinity of interaction, increasing quantity of the Met-His or ORF3-His (1 and 2 pmols) was added without altering rest of the parameters.
