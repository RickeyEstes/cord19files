Conventional methods, carried out on fresh specimens, included the viral isolation technique in MRC5, NCI-H292 and MDCK cells, and IFA on nasal smears using monoclonal antibodies (Imagen 速 , Dako, UK), to influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, RS virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus 229E (Argene, France). From nasal aspirates resuspended in 5 ml of viral transport medium, 2 ml were used for IFA and 0.25 ml for the viral isolation technique. Isolation of viruses in MRC5, NCI-H292 and MDCK cell lines, was performed using previously reported procedures (Freymuth et al., 1997) . IFA was used to identify influenza virus, RS virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and enterovirus (Dako, UK) in cell culture. Rhinovirus were identified by acid stability testing. RS virus sub-groups A and B were identified by monoclonal antibodies, as previously reported (Freymuth et al., 1991) . Typing of enterovirus was carried out by utilising neutralising antibodies (Eurobio, France). Molecular techniques were carried out from frozen samples. One positive and several negative controls were included for each infectious agent that was treated identically to the virus samples throughout. Nucleic acids were extracted by RNAzol B 速 (Bioprobe, France) for RNA viruses, and a chelex procedure for DNA agents, as previously described (Freymuth et al., 1997) . The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and retrotranscription PCR (RT-PCR), followed by internal probe hybridization, were used to detect sequences for RS virus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Primers, probes (Table 1 ) and molecular procedures previously defined and assessed in other studies, were used for the detection of RS virus (Freymuth et al., 1995) , adenovirus (Hierholzer et al., 1993) , Chlamydia pneumoniae (Petitjean et al., 1998) , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (de Barbeyrac et al., 1993) . For the detection of coronavirus OC43 and 229E, the primers and probes were selected in our laboratory from reported sequences of M genes obtained from the gene bank. PCR amplification products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and identified according to band location compared with the molecular scale: band at 278 bp for RS virus, 161 bp for adenovirus, 183 for Chlamydia pneumoniae, 466 bp for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 574 bp for coronavirus 229E, 334 bp for coronavirus OC43. That detection was then followed by a DNA Enzyme Immunoassay (GEN-ETI-K 速 DEIA, Sorin). That final test was based on the hybridization of amplified DNA with a single stranded DNA, 5%-biotinylated probe, specific for each agent, and coated on the wall of a microtiter plate with a streptavidin -biotin bond. The hybrid of probe and DNA was detected by using an anti-ds-DNA monoclonal antibody and by the addition of an enzyme tracer (anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). The assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer, and an index value was defined as OD sample value/OD cut-off value. RS virus sub-groups A and B were not classified by PCR. For rhinovirus and enterovirus, the amplification protocol was slightly different. Three primers were used simultaneously: OL26-OL27 (Gama et al., 1989) , and nHRV (Hyyp誰a et al., 1989) in the same RT-PCR assay (Mammes, 1994) . The amplified products were detected by electrophoresis only. There were identified by one band of 380 bp in cases of enterovirus, and two bands of 380 and 200 bp in cases of rhinovirus. Finally, no results were correlated to analysis of serological results of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, since, in that retrospective study, blood samplings were not available.
