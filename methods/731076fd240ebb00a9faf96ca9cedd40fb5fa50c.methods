Four or five Likert is not explicit; it does not tell which questions were measured using scales of four and which used five and how they way categorize for-example., 1 indicating low or high? Agree or somewhat agree? We agree with the reviewer that it would have been better to have used a Author's response: comparable (e.g. 5-point scale) for all the questions. If we had more time for piloting, we may have picked this up before sending out the survey. Now, the questions on safety and comfort had a 4-point scale and questions on communication, ability to provide care, and heat and dehydration had a 5-point scale. As can be seen in the questionnaire which is included in the supplementary material, we did not use coding in the answer categories. Understand the sample size was small and is actually mentioned as a limitation, however, any data on number of nurses and physicians that were deployed by WHO and MSF during the period of data collection for background purposes and to justify the limitation? As stated in the results section, we invited 192 health workers (166 from MSF Author's response: and 26 from WHO) to participate in the survey, but this included health workers outside the sampling frame (e.g. logisticians and water, sanitation and hygiene experts). Unfortunately we do not have more detailed information on numbers deployed. The sentence under data analysis is not clear to me, maybe rephrasing to better explain to the audience "For the purpose of statistical analysis, we considered each participant's experience with a PPE item unique and independent." We have now added the following clarification to the methods section: "i.e. we Author's response: did not account for the fact that the experience came from one and the same health worker". The survey assumes that all the participants speak and write English? Language characteristic not mentioned considering that these affected countries some are French countries. If all participants were not English speaking how was it translated? Especially as the authors mentioned that respondents could not comprehend some questions due to time constraint. Yes, this is correct. We assumed that all participants could speak and write Author's response: English and we did not translate the questionnaire. The miscomprehension was due to the fact that two questions were not phrased clearly, rather than the language skills of the survey participants. The literature highlights some gender differences for PPE amongst physicians and nurses especially in African context-assuming nurses are mostly women and physicians men--it would have been good to explore differences between nurses and physicians with regards to the specific PPE used. Were physicians exposed to more sophisticated PPE than nurses? PPE used. Were physicians exposed to more sophisticated PPE than nurses? This is a very interesting question. Although our study was not designed to Author's response: answer this question and the number of participants was too small to do any stratified analysis, I had a brief look at the data. We indeed found a higher proportion of physicians among males (91%) than among females (57%), but there were no obvious differences in robustness of PPE, when I compared gown or coverall use between males and females, or between physicians and nurses (varying between 32-36% using a gown). Other comments that may be of interest to the authors: I understand the limitation of the paper is focused on participants in Ebola treatment centers and only foreign deployed. However, guidelines should take into consideration local reality in terms of culture? Based on previous outbreaks, most families prefer to care for patient at home and given the limited resources in this context; Local materials were used at home in 2014 as PPE . http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/25/health/ebola-Fatu-family/index.html Given the reality of limited resources, and the fact that most families prefer to care for patient at home it would add more value also to consider experiences of those who cared for patient at home, the type of PPE used and opportunities in incorporating local reality into evidence-based guidelines for PPE. We acknowledge the importance of this issue brought up by the reviewer but it Author's response: fell outside the scope of the study and the WHO guideline that we were aiming to inform.
