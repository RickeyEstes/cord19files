This was a retrospective cohort study. Although the NHI of Taiwan was initiated in 1995, the database for that year was incomplete. We, therefore, searched the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to collect patients' medical records from 1997 to 2010. Files of inpatient expenditure by admission (DD1997eDD2010 files) and details of inpatient orders (DO1997eDO2010 files) were the main resources for data analysis. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, medical records of all inpatients whose first or second diagnosis was Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. On the other hand, for the ICD-9 þ IVIG set, in addition to the first or second diagnosis fulfilling the criteria for Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1), we further cross-linked the details of inpatient orders to see if patients were treated with IVIG. Patients were regarded as having received IVIG therapy if their inpatient orders included medication whose anatomical therapeutic classification code was J06BA02. Coronary aneurysm was identified by any discharge diagnosis, including ICD-9 414.11. Recurrence was defined as readmission of patients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in the ICD-9 set, and readmission of patients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease and receipt of immunoglobulin in the ICD-9 þ IVIG set. If two admissions were within 30 days, they were regarded as being in the same acute stage. If two admissions of the same patient were separated by more than 30 days, they were regarded as two episodes of Kawasaki disease in acute stages. Patients' sex, age, and date of admission were retrieved. The annual incidence, monthly distribution of patients, sex distribution, recurrence rate, and complication rate were calculated. The population statistics were obtained from the website of the Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan. According to the NHIRD, data that could be used to identify patients or care providers, including medical institutions and physicians, are scrambled before being sent to the National Health Research Institutes for database construction and are further scrambled before being released to individual researchers (http://w3.nhri.org.tw/nhird//en/Data_ Protection.html). A written agreement declaring there would be no attempt to obtain information that could potentially violate the privacy of patients or care providers was signed before the beginning of data retrieval. This analysis was conducted for research purposes only. There is no potential conflict of interest. The computer-processed personal data protection law and related regulations of the Bureau of NHI and the National Health Research Institutes of Taiwan were strictly followed. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the National Health Research Institutes prior to data release. The study protocol has also been approved by the institutional review board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital. SAS 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for data retrieval and data analysis. Chi-square tests were applied for categorical data comparisons. The Poisson regression model was used for comparing incidences. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
