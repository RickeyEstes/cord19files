This study is part of a larger study that aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational intervention on school emergency management plans using a pre-and postintervention methodology at the start and end of the 2013-2014 school year. The primary study examined only school nurses who completed both a pre-and postintervention survey (n ¼ 47). The present study uses data from all participating school nurses, regardless of whether they completed only a preintervention survey, postintervention survey, or both (N ¼ 133). If the nurse only completed 1 survey (pre-or postintervention), that survey was used for analysis (n ¼ 86); for nurses who completed both a pre-and postintervention survey (n ¼ 47), only their postintervention survey was included in analysis. This was done to create a cross-sectional dataset representing the 2013-2014 school year. The purpose of this study is to assess the current state of school readiness in follow-up to a 2011 survey that found that many areas of U.S. school disaster preparedness were lacking, especially in relation to pandemic planning. 6 An online survey was administered through Qualtrics (an online survey platform) to school nurses belonging to the Missouri Association of School Nurses (MASN) during the 2013-2014 school year. A recruitment e-mail was sent to MASN, who forwarded the link to members. Two follow-up recruitment e-mails were sent, 2 and 4 weeks after the initial e-mail, to maximize response rates. Nurses were asked to consult with the school disaster planner or administrator in charge of the school plan when completing the survey, if needed (ie, if they were not familiar with the plan). The Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board approved this study.
