A PUBMED/MEDLINE search was performed using a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, cruise ships and large-scale events up to June 2016. Only articles written in English were included. In addition, we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and public health organizations, associated with the International Society of Travel Medicine with online accessible travel medicine guidelines. Finally, we compared and evaluated these search results in the light of currently published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management. PUBMED/ MEDLINE search resulted in 828 articles of which after screening for relevance by the authors 73 were included.
