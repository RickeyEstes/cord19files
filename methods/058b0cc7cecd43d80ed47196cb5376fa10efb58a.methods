We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. Results 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory Introduction Molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have increased the sensitivity of detection for common and emerging respiratory viruses, and often reveal the presence of more than one pathogen in respiratory patients. [1] , [2] The importance of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis, severity or course of respiratory infections is not well established. The high sensitivity of molecular techniques raises questions about the clinical relevance of positive test results. The presence of a virus does not necessarily indicate causation of clinical symptoms or disease [3] . On the contrary, bacterial co-infection is usually associated with a more severe diseases course and worse prognosis, despite the precise interaction between bacteria and viruses is not always clear. Our study aims to analyze the relationship between viral or bacterial co-infection detected by molecular methods, and the clinical phenotype of children admitted to hospital with lower tract acute respiratory infections (LT-ARI).
