The isotopic internal standards of glucose (labeled with six 13 C or one 13 C) and mannitol (labeled with one 13 C) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (CIL, USA). Thiol-aptamers were obtained from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm, Milli-Q, Millipore, GmbH) throughout the experiments. Synthesis of materials. SiO 2 @Ag core-shell particles were prepared through controlled surface coating of silver on silica nanoparticles. Smooth and uniform silica nanoparticles were synthesized as the hard templates using the Stöber method 68 . To perform the surface coating, the silver mirror reaction was used. Overall, 1.80 g of the prepared silica nanoparticles was dispersed in 90 mL of ethanol solution. In a typical reaction cycle, freshly prepared [Ag(NH 3 ) 2 ] + ion solution (0.59 M, 10 mL) was quickly added to the above particles dispersion and sonicated at room temperature for 30 min. Then the particles were mixed with 300 mL of PVP ethanol solution (0.5 mM). During the experiment, PVP was employed as both the stabilizer and reductant 38 . The mixtures were stirred at 30/50/70°C for 2/4/5/7 h for the formation of silver nanoshells (SiO 2 @Ag). The structures of silver nanoshells can be adjusted by conducting the above reactions towards at the optimized condition (at 70°C for 7 h, further increased temperature or time may cause unwanted precipitation) for 1-4 rounds to obtain SiO 2 @Ag-1/2/3/4. The resulting products were washed with 50 mL of ethanol and deionized water and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min for three times. The final SiO 2 @Ag particles were dried at 60°C and stored as powders. The UV-Vis spectra of particles were checked and the qualified particles would show the absorption peak at~436 nm without red shift (suggesting no overloading of silver). Gold nanoparticles were synthesized using the in-solution seeding approach 16 . The seeding solution was firstly prepared by vigorous mixing of 10 mL of aqueous CTAC solution (0.1 M) and 515 mL of HAuCl 4 (4.86 mM) with 450 mL of NaBH 4 solution. Then the solution was aged for at least 1 h in a hot bath and then was diluted for ten times. Next, 10 mL of CTAC solution (0.1 M) was mixed with 515 mL of HAuCl 4 (4.86 mM) and 75 mL of ascorbic acid (0.04 M). Overall, 100 mL of diluted seed solution was added into the above mixed solution under sonication and kept in darkness for 2 days to obtain the final gold nanoparticles after centrifugation and washing with water. Surface functionalization. To modify silver nanoshells with aptamers, we used a post-grafting method 23, 46 . Briefly, 48 μL of PBS buffer was added into 1 OD of SHmodified kanamycin aptamers (5′-SH-(CH 2 ) 6 -TGGGGGTTGAGGCTAAGCCGA-3′) to a final concentration of 100 μM. 0.48 μL of DTT solution (10 μM) was mixed with aptamer solution and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Then 200 μL of SiO 2 @Ag-3 (0.5 mg mL −1 ) was added to the system and gently shaken at room temperature for 24 h with addition of NaCl (0.1 M) after 12 h. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000×g and re-dispersed in PBS. Material characterization methods. TEM images, HRTEM images, and elemental mapping images were collected using a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument. Normally, 8-10 μL of ethanol suspension of materials was deposited onto a copper grid before observation. During sample preparation for elemental mapping, 1 mg mL −1 of water dispersions of SiO 2 @Ag-3 were mixed with 10 μg μL −1 glucose (1/1, V/V) for 30 min and supernatant was discarded by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 10 min. The precipitates were washed and re-dispersed in water and put onto micro-grids for analysis. The inter planar space was measured by Digital Micrograph version 2.5 software (Gatan). SEM images and EDX spectra were recorded on Hitachi S-4800 by dropping the materials suspensions on the aluminum foil. Room temperature optical absorption spectra of the materials were obtained on an AuCy UV1900 spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on Nicolet iN10 MX (Thermo Scientific, USA). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M and the samples were degassed in vacuum before tests. Zeta potential and dynamic light scattering size measurements were performed on a Nano-ZS90 instrument in water at 25°C (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Mass spectrometry analysis. For LDI MS detection of metabolites, standard small molecules (glucose, mannitol, methionine, tryptophan, uric acid, lactic acid, arginine, and phenylalanine) were dissolved in deionized water by step-wise dilutions with the concentration ranging from 1 μg μL −1 to 1 ng μL −1 . Standard molecules were mixed with salts (NaCl, KCl, 0.5 M) and proteins (BSA, 5 mg mL −1 ) to explore the detection efficiency in complex samples. In a typical LDI MS experiment, SiO 2 @Ag particles and gold nanoparticles were dispersed in water at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL −1 for matrix use. CHCA was dissolved in 0.1% TFA buffer (water/ACN, 50/50, v/v) at a concentration of 4 mg mL −1 . Then 500 nL of matrix slurry was deposited with 500 nL of analytes solution on a stainless steel target plate and dried for LDI MS analysis. Mass spectra were collected in the reflection mode employing delayed extraction on 5800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) with the Nd:YAG laser (1 kHz 355 nm). The repetition rate and an acceleration voltage were set as 200 Hz and 20 kV, respectively. The delay time for this experiment was optimized to 200 ns. The number of laser shots was 200 per analysis for all LDI MS experiments. Only MS signals with signal-to-noise ratio over 10 were used for identification of molecules. Mass calibration was conducted by background substrate mass peaks of [Ag] n + (n = 1-3) in each spectrum for accurate mass measurement. MS/MS of selected molecular peaks of glucose and mannitol (from bio-samples and standards) were performed and compared for identification purpose in addition to the accurate mass measurement. The mass accuracy was within 50 ppm, which was comparable to previous reports 69 . No smoothing procedures were applied and all spectra were directly used for analysis. For enrichment and detection of kanamycin, 50 μL of aptamers modified silver nanoshells slurry was centrifuged and the precipitate was re-dispersed in tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mM). Overall, 1 mL of kanamycin with different concentrations (from 200 nM to 20 μM) was mixed with the dispersion above and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged to discard supernatant and re-dispersed in 0.5 μL of 0.1% TFA buffer (water/ACN, 20/80, v/v) for LDI MS analysis as established above. Isotopic quantification. The isotopes of selected metabolites were introduced as the internal standard for quantification use 17 . Standard solutions of small molecules with different concentrations were employed to plot the calibration curves. The isotopes were dissolved in water with concentrations of 250 ng μL −1 and 100 ng μL −1 for glucose and mannitol, respectively. Typically, the isotope solution was mixed with analyte solution with a volume ratio of 1:1. After dropping 500 nL of mixture solution on the plate, 500 nL of matrix solution was deposited onto it and dried for LDI MS analysis. The influence of naturally occurring 13 C ( 12 C/ 13 C, 98.89%/1.11%) was eliminated by subtracting corresponding signal intensity during the quantification process using isotopes with one 13 C. For quantification purpose, the relative intensity ratio of analytes/isotopes from five independent experiments was recorded with data shown as the mean ± s.d. (n = 5). Biochemical colorimetric method. Glucose level in 200 μL of native cerebrospinal fluid samples were detected using the traditional biochemical approach by the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Maidenhead, UK), where the glucose concentrations were obtained after enzymatic catalysis of glucose according to the colorimetric method. Statistical analysis. All statistical analysis in this work (including materials characterizations and bio-analytical results) was performed based on the SPSS software (version 19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago) to calculate the p-value for statistical demonstration, including independent sample t-test, paired t-test, one-sided t-test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Diagnosis of brain infection. CSF samples were donated by patients in Children's Hospital of Shanghai. The CSF samples for brain infection monitoring were collected in four consecutive days during operation. For diagnostic application, 17 CSF samples were obtained from infected patients and 21 samples were obtained from uninfected controls. All the investigation protocols in this study were approved by the institutional ethics committees of the Children's Hospital of Shanghai and School of Biomedical Engineering, SJTU. Informed consents from patients had been obtained since the project started. All samples were harvested in tubes by continued drainage without tedious lumbar punctures according to the standard clinical procedures and stored at −80°C until use 9, 17, 70 . The CSF samples were directly detected by the LDI MS using the silver nanoshells as matrix following the previous protocols in standard analysis and five independent experiments were performed with data shown as the mean ± s.d. (n = 5) for diagnostic use. Pharmacokinetic study. For pharmacokinetic study, both blood and CSF samples were donated by three patients with cerebral edema before and 30 min after rapid intravenous injection of mannitol (20% infusion solution, Shandong Qidu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China) during a surgical operation. All of the investigation protocols in this study were approved by the institutional ethics committees of the Children's Hospital of Shanghai and School of Biomedical Engineering, SJTU. Informed consents from patients had been obtained since the project started. The harvesting of serum samples was completed by vein blood draws based on the established method 9 , whereas the sampling of CSF was the same as brain infection diagnosis experiments. The serum and CSF samples were directly detected by LDI MS using the silver nanoshells as matrix following the previous protocols in standard analysis and five independent experiments were performed with data shown as the mean ± s.d. (n = 5) for pharmacokinetic study. Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
