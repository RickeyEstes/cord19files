For the virus infection, HAE cultures were washed thrice with 100 μl of 1 × PBS, following inoculation with HCoV-NL63 (isolate Amsterdam 1) or influenza A virus (IVA, strain H 3 N 2 ) or mock (cell lysate). After 2 h incubation at 32° (for HCoV-NL63) or 37 °C (for IVA) unbound virions were removed by washing with 100 μl of 1 × PBS and HAE cultures were cultured at an air -liquid interphase until the end of the experiment. Virus preparation and titration. The stock of HCoV-NL63 (isolate Amsterdam 1) was prepared using LLC-Mk2 cells. Six days post-infection (p.i.) infected cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and the resulting supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Mock sample was prepared in the same manner, from non-infected cells. Virus yield was determined according to the method described by Reed and Muench 44 . Briefly, cells infected with serially diluted virus were incubated at 32 °C for 6 days and the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored.
