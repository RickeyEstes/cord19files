We have implemented our method into an in-house script (GenomeFingerprinter.exe). It will be available upon request to the corresponding author. The programs of Zplotter (v1.0) and Mauve (v2.3.1) used in this study can be downloaded from links: Zplotter.exe at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/zcurve/and Mauve at http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/. To plot graphics from coordinates, any graphic tool can be used.
