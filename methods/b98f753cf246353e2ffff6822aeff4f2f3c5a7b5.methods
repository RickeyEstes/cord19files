Design of CPMO. CPMO1 and CPMO2 (GeneTools, USA) were designed to be complementary to a 25-mer sequence located in the AUG region (ORF1 and ORF2) of the CHIKV genomic RNA (SGEHICHD122508 virus isolate, GenBank; FJ445502) ( Fig. 1a; Table 1 ). Scrambled morpholinos, sCPMO1 (1 st BASE, Singapore) and sCPMO2 (GeneTools, USA) with random base sequence of their respective CPMO were synthesized as negative controls. To visualize cellular uptake and cytosolic distribution, all CPMOs and sCPMOs were covalently conjugated at 3' end with carboxyfluorescein. For mice studies, the Vivo-morpholino (GeneTools, USA) named as CPMO1v and scrambled CPMO1v (sCP-MO1v), were synthesized with an octa-guanidine dendrimer for facilitating in vivo tissue uptake of the oligomer. Using NCBI BLASTn tool, CPMOs were aligned to all published CHIKV genomic sequences (CHIKV taxid: 37124), with representative geographical isolates such as the S27-African prototype of the Central/East African (CEA) genotype (GenBank; AF369024), India RGCB355/KL08 (GenBank; GQ428214), Indonesia 0706aTw (GenBank; FJ807897), Singapore 0611aTw (GenBank; FJ807896), Sri Lanka LK(EH)CH20108 (GenBank; FJ513679) of the ECSA genotype, and Malaysia MY002IMR/06/ BP (GenBank; EU703759) of the Asian genotype shown in Fig. 1b . Comparative sequence alignment of CPMO1 to SINV (GenBank; NC_001547) and DENV (GenBank; M29095.1) were also performed (data not shown).
