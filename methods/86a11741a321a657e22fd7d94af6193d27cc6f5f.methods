National influenza surveillance network. The network consists of eight regional commissioned laboratories located in the northern (n = 3), central (n = 2), southern (n = 2), and eastern (n = 1) parts of Taiwan. These laboratories have steadily collected more than 8000 respiratory specimens for surveillance per year, including more than 1000 influenza virus specimens annually, all of which are sent to the Taiwan CDC for the monitoring of influenza viral activity. The Taiwan Influenza Express, a weekly online influenza surveillance report, has been published by the Taiwan CDC from July to May of each year since 2005 (http://www.cdc.gov.tw/english/ submenu.aspx?treeid = 00ED75D6C887BB27&nowtreeid = 8F1E239D0FD8877A) 10, 27 . This report includes the total number of respiratory specimens; isolate number of influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B; and case number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in intensive care units (ICUs), a class of events that is considered a category 4 nationally notifiable disease. However, data on weeks 19-37 are not available annually. A confirmed case involved a patient who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature ≥ 38 °C with either cough or sore throat) and nasopharyngeal/throat or bronchoalveolar lavage samples harboring influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using real-time (RT) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or via viral culture 11, 28 . For the purposes of the present study, each season was defined as extending from July of the same year to May of the following year. The annual population figures provided by the Department of Household Registration Affairs of the Interior Ministry were used for the calculation of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the ICU. , a 4000-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital that is located in northern Taiwan and provides both primary and tertiary care. In addition, CGMH is one of the 8 regional commissioned laboratories of the Taiwan CDC. Patients who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature ≥ 38 °C with either cough or sore throat) and had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using RT-PCR assay or via viral culture using respiratory specimens were included in the study. Patients whose data are not available were excluded. The institutional review board of CGMHT approved the study, and it was carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was waived due to the study's retrospective nature. All medical records of the enrolled patients were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, clinical course, antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or zanamivir), mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, and death were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity, was calculated for patients whose height and weight data were available. Obesity was defined as follows: 1) body weight ≥ 95th percentile in children < 2 years of age; 2) BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 in patients aged between 2 and 18 years; and 3) BMI > 28 kg/m 2 (Chinese criteria) in patients > 18 years 29 . Medical conditions associated with a high risk for influenza complications were defined based on those listed by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 30 . Patients with confirmed pneumonia on radiography, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute onset of cardiovascular, neurologic condition, respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; those who were admitted in the ICU; and those who died were considered to have influenza-related complications. Pneumonia on radiography was diagnosed based on the presence of a consolidation, infiltrate, or opacity 31 . ARDS was defined according to the standard criteria 32 . The primary study outcome was the occurrence of (any) influenza-related complications. The secondary study outcomes were pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality. Genetic characterization of the virus. A total of 82 isolated influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were randomly selected for the analysis of viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes across the five seasons. The RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qigen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR and primer pairs used for sequencing HA and NA genes were performed, as previously described 33 . Sanger sequencing of the viral HA and NA genes was performed to establish clade designation and to detect differences in amino acid 33 . The obtained amplicons were assembled into a full-length 1,701-bp span for HA and 1410-bp for NA using DNASTAR Lasergene (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Newly reported sequences in this study were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers shown in Fig. S1 for HA and NA genes. The evolution history was inferred by the maximum likelihood method based on the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model 34 . The percentages of replicate trees (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test. Phylogenetic analysis in this study was conducted using MEGA7 35 . Statistical analysis. Continuous variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs); categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software package version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, the USA). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was generated using Poisson regression with 95% confidence intervals to compare the rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the ICU per 100,000 populations across different seasons; 95% confidence intervals for which the upper and lower bounds did not include 1 were considered as statistically significant. Differences in categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or a Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used for outcome analysis. The variables included sex, season, age group, onset to presentation, underlying condition, obesity, smoking, alcoholism, and antiviral therapy. Variables with a P value < 0.1 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was performed to assess the overall fit of the model. All statistical operations were two-tailed. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
