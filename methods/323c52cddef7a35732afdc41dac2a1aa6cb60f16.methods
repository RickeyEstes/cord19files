The sequences of 16S rRNA, cyt-b and d-loop of the three Oryx species including Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx), Scimitar Horned Oryx (Oryx dammah) and Plains Oryx (Oryx gazella) were obtained from GenBank. The respective sequences of Addax (Addax nasomaculatus) were used as outgroup due to its close relationship to Oryx yet representing a separate sister taxa (Hassanin and Douzery, 1999; Iyengar et al. 2006) . The Gene-Bank accession numbers and the number of nucleotides for the partial sequences of 16S rRNA, cyt-b and d-loop of the four taxa are: Oryx leucoryx (U87021, 342; AF036286, 1143; AJ235326, 1253), Oryx dammah (U87020, 342; AJ222685, 1143; AJ235324, 1261), Oryx gazella (U87022, 342; AF249973, 1140; AJ235325, 1237) and Addax nasomaculatus (U87023, 342; AF034722, 1143; AJ235310, 1324) respectively. Tajima test statistics (Tajima, 1989 ) and the test of homogeneity of substitution patterns between sequences were performed after sequence alignments, using MEGA4 software (Tamura et al. 2007 ) while all the positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis that sequences have evolved with the same pattern of substitution was judged from the extent of differences in the base composition biases between sequences (disparity index test) whereas a Monte Carlo test (1000 replicates) was used to estimate the respective P-values (Kumar and Gadagkar, 2001) . The sequence data were subjected to three different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction: (i) Bayesian (BA), (ii) unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and (iii) maximum parsimony (MP). The gammacorrected Bayesian inference of phylogeny was conduced using MrBayes software (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and the Bayesian trees were visualized with TreeView software (Page, 1996) . For UPGMA method, the phylogenetic analyses were performed using the evolutionary distances computed by maximum composite likelihood method (Sneath and Sokal, 1973; Tamura et al. 2004) . For MP method, the maximum parsimonious trees were obtained using the close-neighborinterchange algorithm in which the initial trees were obtained with the random addition of sequences for 10 replicates (Eck and Davhoff, 1966; Nei and Kumar, 2000) . Both UPGMA and MP analyses were performed using MEGA4 software and the bootstrap consensus trees inferred from 1000 replicates were taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (Felsenstein, 1985; Tamura et al. 2007 ).
