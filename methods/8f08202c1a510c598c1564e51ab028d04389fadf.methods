In May 2010, a behavioral observation study was undertaken involving phase 3 medical students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Ethical approval was obtained from the UNSW Human Research Ethics Committee prior to the commencement of the study. The student cohort had completed a one 4-hour infection control course in the previous 12 months. The infection control course included education on hand hygiene, aseptic technique, standard precautions, and transmission-based precautions. The same student cohort attended two 2-hour lectures unrelated to infection control, on 2 separate occasions. One week before the 2-hour lecture commenced, students were informed that a behavioral observation study was being conducted during the lecture and required the students to be videotaped while they listened to the lecture. Students were not informed about which behaviors were under observation to blind them from the aims of the study; this was necessary to minimize the potential for a change in behavior as a result of being observed. 13 To participate in the study, students were instructed to move to a marked area on the left side of the lecture theatre and complete a participant consent form. To opt out of the study, students were instructed to move to the right side of the lecture theatre outside of the videotape recording range. Students were also informed that they could withdraw from the study once recording commenced by simply moving to the other side of the theatre. All participants consented prior to videotape recording. A digital videotape recording was made of the consenting participants and was viewed by investigators to record the facetouching behavior of every participant. For the purposes of precision, the digital recording was viewed multiple times after the lectures had taken place by 1 researcher (Y.L.A.K.). A standardized scoring sheet was used to tally the frequency of hand-to-face contacts, the area of the face that was touched, whether a mucosal area (eyes, nose, mouth) or nonmucosal area (ears, cheeks, chin, forehead, hair) was touched, and the time in seconds of each contact. Descriptive statistics were performed to determine the frequency and duration of touches per hour using SPSS version 21 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
