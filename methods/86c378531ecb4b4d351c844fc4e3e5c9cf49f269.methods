Groups of new RTA conscripts undergo an intensive 10-week basic training during which they are housed together in a single large barracks with one large sleeping quarters. After basic training, the recruits are permitted to go on leave for approximately 10 days. Upon return from leave, some recruits are retained in the camp but live in smaller barracks, while others are assigned elsewhere. In this study, newly enlisted RTA soldiers at least 18 years of age at an RTA training center in Bangkok were eligible to participate. Those with suspected tuberculosis or immunocompromising conditions such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, lymphoma or leukemia were ineligible. The current study included recruits from four consecutive classes (basic training initiated in May 2013, November 2013, May 2014 and November 2014, respectively) from the same training camp. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Royal Thai Army in Bangkok, Thailand, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Individuals giving informed consent were enrolled into the study and subsequently followed for respiratory illness. At enrollment, subjects were instructed to report to the RTA training center medical unit if they had respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, the camp's medical corpsman periodically reminded recruits to report any illnesses. At the time of illness, a history and physical exam was completed by RTA medical staff. Subjects with illnesses that qualified as an upper respiratory illness (URI) or ILI had a throat and nasal swab collected for PCR testing, and a rapid test was carried out to inform clinical care. A URI was defined as an illness with at least two of the following: (i) runny nose or sneezing; (ii) stuffy nose (i.e. congestion); (iii) sore throat, hoarseness or difficulty swallowing; (iv) cough; (v) swollen or tender glands in the neck (i.e. cervical lymphadenopathy); and (vi) fever or abnormal temperature. ILI was defined as an acute onset respiratory illness with a measured temperature (oral) >38°C (100Á5°F) with a cough or sore throat. In the first recruit class (designated as class 1), the location of beds belonging to each individual was mapped to evaluate spatio-temporal clustering of illnesses.
