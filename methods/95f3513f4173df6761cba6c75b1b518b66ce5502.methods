Searching for bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzymes. Sequence comparison was performed using BLAST and MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) tools available online. Similarity search and superposition of a 3D structure of proteins was performed by Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2016.08; Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada). Multiple sequence alignment between enzyme sequences was performed using the CLUSTALW tool available online. Phylogenetic tree drawing was performed using NJplot program (http://doua.prabi. fr/software/njplot). Fig. 7 Therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on established hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. a-e Therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on established hypertension. Experimental protocol (a); Ang II infusion (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated at 7 days before treatment. The mice were injected with B38-CAP (2 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle twice a day and blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff system at 2 h after injection. Systolic (b), diastolic (c), and mean (d) BP and heart rate (e) in the mice treated Ang II + vehicle (n = 7), Ang II + B38-CAP (n = 7), and vehicle + vehicle (n = 5). f-l Therapeutic effects of B38-CAP on established cardiac dysfunction. Experimental protocol (f); the C57BL/6J mice had TAC surgery at 5 weeks before treatment and B38-CAP (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was continuously infused with osmotic mini-pumps. Echocardiography parameters of %fractional shortening (%FS) (g) in the mice treated with sham + vehicle (n = 5), TAC + vehicle (n = 6), and TAC + B38-CAP (n = 6). Representative photographs of the hearts of mice under TAC (h). Bars indicate 2 mm. HW/BW (i), HW/TL (j), LW/BW (k), and LW/TL (l) are in the mice treated with sham + vehicle (n = 5), TAC + vehicle (n = 6), and TAC + B38-CAP (n = 6). m-q qRT-PCR analysis for the expression of heart failure genes and pro-fibrosis genes in the hearts (n = 5 mice per group). All values are means ± SEM. b-e Two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-comparisons test. g One-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-comparisons test for comparison of groups. Two-tailed paired t-test between before and after treatment of the same group. i-q One-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple-comparisons test. Numbers next to square brackets show significant P-values. multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 pfu/cell and then cultured in SF-900 II serumfree medium (Invitrogen) using 250 mL shaker flasks at 100 r.p.m. at 28°C for 72 h. rhACE2 was purified with Profinity IMAC Ni-charged resin (Bio-Rad), eluted with 250 mM imidazole, and further dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
