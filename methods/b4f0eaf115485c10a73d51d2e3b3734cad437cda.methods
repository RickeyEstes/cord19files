Measuring the amount of NAs in clinical specimens is a successful development of basic diagnostic molecular techniques. Both PCR and other NA amplification techniques have been proven to be reliable for this purpose, and a variety of semiquantitative and quantitative PCR methods are described (Clementi et al., 1996; Hodinka, 1998; Preiser et al., 2000) . Semi-quantitative techniques include methods based on limiting dilution of samples before amplification, or comparison of the extent of amplification between samples and 'external' standards at known NA concentration. The main disadvantage of these procedures is that they do not take into account the possible differences in amplification efficiency between the different samples and/or standards. Quantitative techniques allow a more accurate estimate of the NA levels, through co-amplification in the same tube of target NA and an 'internal' standard at a known concentration, which enables control of the amplification efficiency. New automated procedures based on real-time detection of NAs are becoming popular in diagnostic neurovirology. The real-time PCR is based on detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter. Fluorescence emission is recorded at each cycle making it possible to monitor the PCR reaction during its exponential phase, where the amount of PCR product correlates to the initial quantity of template. Compared to classical methods where the amounts of DNA are measured at the end of amplification, when the amplification efficiency is reduced, real-time PCR is more accurate and expands the dynamic range of quantification. It also eliminates post-PCR processing of amplification products, resulting in reduced risk of contamination and increased speed (Bustin, 2000) . There are two general methods for NA quantitation by real-time PCR: those based on the use of DNA-binding dyes, e.g. syber green, or of fluorescence-labelled probes. The latter are employed in the TaqMan (Fig. 3) (Holland et al., 1991; Higuchi et al., 1993; Heid et al., 1996) and LightCycler (Wittwer et al., 1997a,b) technology, that have both been described for quantitation of viral DNA in CSF (Kessler et al., 2000; Verstrepen et al., 2001; Gunther et al., 2001; Nagai et al., 2001; Read et al., 2001; Gautheret-Dejean et al., 2002; Aberle and Puchhammer-Stö ckl, 2002 ) (Table 4). Real-time PCR also allows simultaneous quantification, in the same tube, of different genomes (Read et al., 2001) , as well as virus genotyping and mutational analysis. Besides their use for direct diagnosis, NA amplification techniques constitute the base for genomic analysis. These techniques can yield high amounts of genomic material, which can be analysed for different purposes. These include virus characterisation for epidemiologic and phylogenetic studies, detection of viral mutations, e.g. those associated with antiviral drug resistance, neurotropism or neurovirulence. In addition, genotyping of viruses in CSF may be used to recognise unusual viral strains or to characterise new viral pathogens involved in CNS disease. There are a Fig. 3 . Example of a standard curve consisting of 5 Á/50 000 EBV DNA genomes/reaction generated by automated real-time PCR using the TaqMan technology. The fluorescence, proportional to the amount of amplified products, is acquired at each PCR cycle by an automated fluorometer. A threshold cycle (C T ) defines the cycle number at which the fluorescence passes a fixed threshold. Quantification of the amount of target in unknown samples is accomplished by measuring the C T and comparing this value to the C T values of the standard curve. number of post-amplification methods described, recently reviewed elsewhere (Arens, 1999) . Among these, DNA sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and hybridisationbased techniques have all been used in neurovirology. Nucleotide sequencing is the most accurate method to collect information on genome composition. Automated procedures have been developed during recent years, making sequencing relatively easy to perform (Fig. 4) . By RFLP, restriction enzymes are used to digest NAs into fragments of different size, which can be visualised by gel electrophoresis. This technique can be used after CSF PCR with consensus primers to distinguish individual viruses or viral strains (Fig. 2 ) (Rozenberg and Lebon, 1991; Arthur et al., 1989) . Hybridisation-based techniques include classical procedures, such as the Southern Blot, as well as modern high stringency hybridisation. The latter identifies minimal variations in the genome composition, such as single mutations. An example is the reverse hybridisation technique, incorporated into the commercial Line Probe Assay (LIPA), that has been used to detect HIV resistance mutations in CSF and plasma pairs (Cunningham et al., 2000) . DNA microarrays, or 'DNA chip' technology might become an additional tool for the identification and genomic analysis of virus sequences amplified in the CSF (Pease et al., 1994; Lockhart and Winzeler, 2000; McGlennen, 2001) . Despite high costs and current limited availability of technology and instrumentation, the DNA chip technology is in rapid development in virology, especially in the field of research, e.g. for measuring viral gene expression (Chambers et al., 1999; Jenner et al., 2001) . Sequences from plasma or other clinical samples have initially been tested for epidemiological or diagnostic purposes, such as screening for multiple HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (Wilson et al., 2000) . Table 5 summarises some of the most significant applications of genotypic analysis in neurovirology. The identification of enterovirus strains is an example of virus genotyping for both epidemiological and clinical purposes. Molecular typing of enteroviruses may be useful in epidemiological Fig. 4 . DNA sequencing from paired CSF and plasma specimens. An example of nucleotide sequencing from paired CSF and plasma samples using cycle-sequencing with dye-labeled oligonucleotides. Amplified products are obtained from paired CSF and plasma specimens following nucleic acid extraction, RNA retrotranscription and PCR amplification of a fragment from the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. The amplified DNA is purified from unincorporated primers and nucleotides and added to the sequencing reaction mixture. The products of the sequencing reaction are subected to automated electrophoresis and recognized by a laser scanner. A four-color electropherogram is produced, which is translated into a linear nucleotide sequence by a computer software. The final sequence is compared to reference sequences, e.g., HXB2 for HIV-1. Three nucleotide mutations, resulting in two aminoacid substitutions at codons 215 (treonin0/phenylalanin) and 219 (lysin0/glutamin) are found in plasma but not in SCF (arrows). Such mutations are associated with resistance to the RT inhibitor drug zidovudine. Rozenberg and Lebon (1996) Tymidine kinase DNA sequencing Possible determinants for neurovirulence not found surveillance programmes, but also has diagnostic and prognostic significance: to correctly identify polioviruses, new enterovirus types or variants, enteroviruses responsible of severe infections, or those causing infections in neonates or immunodeficient (Muir et al., 1998) . Molecular typing systems for enteroviruses might become a rapid alternative to traditional serotyping, which is timeconsuming, labour-intensive and requires virus isolation in cell culture (Muir et al., 1998; Oberste et al., 1999) . DNA sequencing in the CSF has enabled the diagnosis of CNS diseases caused by attenuate vaccine strains rather than wild-type viruses. Examples are the meningitis cases caused by the Urabe vaccine against mumps in the end of the 80s (Forsey et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991) , or the more recently reported vaccine-induced yellow fever cases (Martin et al., 2001) . Novel CNS pathogens have been identified following their isolation and/or amplification in the CSF. Recent examples are the two paramyxoviruses Hendra virus, transmitted by horses and causing meningitis and encephalitis in humans (O'Sullivan et al., 1997) , and Nipah virus, identified in patients with encephalitis during the 1998 and 1999 outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore (Chua et al., 2000) . Similarly, a newly described B adenovirus was unexpectedly identified by molecular techniques during the 1997 epidemic of enterovirus 71-associated encephalitis in Malaysia (Cardosa et al., 1999) .
