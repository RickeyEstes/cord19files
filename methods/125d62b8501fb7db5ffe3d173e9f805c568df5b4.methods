As a part of a survey of risk perception, knowledge, and sources of information for SARS and infl uenza, we conducted a study on precautionary actions for a hypothetical infl uenza pandemic in 5 European countries (Denmark, Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Poland), and 3 Asian regions (Guangdong [People's Republic of China], Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China], and Singapore) that had been affected by SARS. The overall survey, from which risk behavior was analyzed separately, is described in more detail elsewhere (14) . Brief details of the sample and questionnaire are given below.
