A systematic review of the literature on spatiotemporal examination of infectious diseases in healthcare settings between January 1961 and June 2013 was conducted using the following search terms: infection (e.g. HCAI, nosocomial, etc.); healthcare settings (e.g. hospital, intensive care, etc.); and time/space (e.g. spaceetime, spatial epidemiology, etc.). Potential synonyms for each search term (e.g. infection, healthcare settings and time/space) were identified and combined using Boolean operators. To ensure comprehensive capture of the literature, BIOSIS, Cochrane Review, CSA, DARE, Embase, HEED, JSTOR, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for all indexed publications. Additionally, Google Scholar was searched for indexed and grey literature using the above search terms. All papers, reports, abstracts and letters were included in the initial search.
