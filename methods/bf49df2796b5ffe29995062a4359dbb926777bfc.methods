This guideline has been developed by a panel from the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Haematology and Medical Oncology including 17 experts certified in internal medicine, haematology/oncology, infectious diseases, microbiology/virology or radiology and one medical student. First, predefined topics were delivered by the designated coordinator (MvLT) to all participants of the panel to form subgroups. Data were extracted and tabulated after a systematic literature search by subgroup members and revised in several steps by the members of the panel on the basis of an email-based discussion process and a face-to-face meeting. Finally, preliminary recommendations of the panel were discussed, revised and approved by the AGIHO assembly. In May 2014, the first literature search was performed for CRV and immunosuppression using the terms '-virus' and 'immunocompromised' (for example: 'adenovirus immunocompromised'). This search was performed for adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, hMPV, influenza, PIV, parechovirus, RSV and rhinovirus. The references were then screened by the subgroup members and relevant articles retrieved as full papers. Wherever applicable, additional papers were identified in the reference lists and treated as described.
