Cells and viruses. BEAS-2B cells (European Collection of cell cultures) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS). Rhinovirus serotype A1 was propagated in Ohio HeLa cells (European Collection of cell cultures) by standard methods and inactivated by exposure to UV light at 1200 mJ/ cm 2 for 30 min. For in vivo use in mouse models, virus was purified using precipitation in 7% polyethylene glycol 6000 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 M NaCl, followed by filtration using a 0.2 μm syringe filter and buffer exchange and concentration in an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (100 KDa nominal molecular weight limit) (Millipore, USA) 33, 59 . Virus infection and treatment with FP and receptor agonists. BEAS-2B cells were cultured to 80% confluence in 12-well plates. Cells were treated with 1 or 10 nM fluticasone propionate (Sigma-Aldrich) or diluent alone (mock) for 1 h. Cultures were subsequently stimulated with 0.2 ml of RV-A1 (MOI 2) or 5 μg/ml TLR3 agonist (poly(I:C); Invitrogen), 250 ng/ml MDA-5 agonist (transfected poly(I:C); high MW form which is specific for MDA-5, as previously described 35 Once confluent, rhEGF concentration was changed to 0.5 ng/ml during the ALI phase for differentiation in the basal compartment (beneath the transwell insert) without apical media until day 21 after initial seeding. At day 21 after initial seeding, basal media was replaced with media containing 1 or 10 nM fluticasone propionate, to appropriate wells. RV-A1 infection (MOI 0.1) was applied to the apical surface for 2 h in 250 μl BEBM minimal at 35°C, after which, infection media was replaced with 500 μl fresh BEBM minimal for the remainder of the time course. Samples were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post infection. At each time point, apical media was removed from the cultures and stored for protein expression analyses and half of the transwell membrane was carefully cut from the inserts and collected into RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for downstream molecular analyses by RT-qPCR while the remaining transwell membrane was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h for histological cross-sections to confirm differentiation and stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) to assess mucus production. Rhinovirus infection and treatment of mice. In vivo protocols: Female mice (8-10 weeks of age) on a C57BL/6 background were used for all animal studies. Mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and housed in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal work was performed under the authority of the UK Home Office outlined in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 after ethical review by Imperial College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (project licence PPL 70/7234) FP powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was resuspended at a concentration of 357 μg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and then diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Mice were treated intranasally under light isoflurane anaesthesia with 50 μl of FP solution (equating to 20 μg FP dose) or vehicle DMSO diluted 1:1000 in PBS as control. One hour after FP or vehicle administration, mice were infected intranasally with 50 μl RV-A1 (5 × 10 6 TCID 50 ) or UV-inactivated RV-A1 control (as detailed above) 33 . In separate experiments, 1 h following RV-A1 or UV-RV-A1 challenge, mice were additionally treated intranasally with 50 μl of PBS containing 10 4 units of recombinant IFN-β (R&D systems). Fluticasone administration in COPD exacerbation mouse model. Mice were treated intranasally under light isoflurane anaesthesia with 1.2 units of porcine pancreatic elastase (Merck) to induce emphysematous lung changes 25 , Ten days following elastase administration, mice were treated intranasally with 20 μg FP solution (prepared as detailed above), 1 h prior to intranasal infection with 50 μl RV-A1 (2.5 × 10 6 TCID 50 , a 50% dose reduction from the primary RV infection model) or UV-inactivated RV-A1 control, as detailed above. Naturally occurring human COPD exacerbation cohort. A cohort of 40 COPD subjects was recruited to a study investigating naturally occurring exacerbations between June 2011 and December 2013. Subjects of all grades of COPD severity, confirmed by spirometry, were recruited and all treatments were permitted. All subjects gave informed written consent and the study protocol was approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee (Protocol number 11/LO/0229). All subjects had an initial baseline visit during clinical stability for medical assessment, peak expiratory flow rate measurement, spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and clinical sample collection. Sputum induction and processing: Sputum was induced using pre-medication with 200 µg salbutamol via metered dose inhaler and large volume spacer. Four per cent saline was administered using a DeVilbiss UltraNeb99 ultrasonic nebuliser until an adequate sputum sample was obtained. Sputum was processed within 2 h of induction. Sputum plugs were selected from saliva by macroscopic inspection of the sample. An aliquot was selected and stored unprocessed at -80°C. The remaining sample was weighed and 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT) was added in the ratio 4 ml DTT to 1 g sputum. The mixture was then agitated and filtered. The same volume PBS was added, the filtrate centrifuged and the supernatant aliquotted and stored at −80°C. Virus detection: Viruses were detected in sputum using polymerase chain reaction. The following viruses were investigated: adenovirus, coronavirus, human bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza (AH1, AH3, B), parainfluenza 1-3, picornavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). For picornaviruses, 5 µl RNA was converted to cDNA by addition to a reaction mix containing 1.55 µl OL27 (Invitrogen), 1 µl 0.1 M DTT, 0.2 µl dNTPs (Invitrogen) and 0.25 µl (10,000U) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A single round of PCR of 32 cycles was then used to detect picornaviruses in this cDNA. Differentiation of RVs from enteroviruses was achieved by restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR product. For all other viruses, conversion to cDNA was achieved with 18 µl RNA added to a reaction mix containing 2.5 µl of random hexamer primers (0.5 µg/µl, Promega) and 6.5 µl of UHQ (nuclease-free water, Promega). This mixture was denatured at 70°C for 10 min. After quenching on ice, 10 µl of 5× first-strand buffer, 6 µl of UHQ, 5 µl 0.1 M DTT, 1.25 µl dNTPs and 2 µl (200U) of reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) were added following by incubation at 37°C for 1 h to yield cDNA. An aliquot of 4 µl of this cDNA was then used for each RT-PCR in the panel, performed using a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). Follow-up: Subjects had repeat visits at three monthly intervals when clinically stable and were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an acute exacerbation defined using the East London cohort criteria 60 and were seen within 48 h of symptom onset. Sputum samples were collected at the onset of exacerbation and at 2 weeks during exacerbation. Cell assays. In mouse models, BAL was performed by cannulation through the trachea and lavage with 1.5 ml sterile PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in ACK buffer to lyse red cells, washed in PBS and resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% FBS. Cells were stained with Quik Diff (Reagena) for differential counting. For flow cytometry analysis, lung leukocytes were obtained from BAL and red cells were lysed with ACK buffer. BAL cells were stained with Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (FC block; BD Biosciences) and subsequently with directly fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies specific for CD3ε (clone 500 A; 2 1 µg/ml, BD Biosciences), CD69 (clone H1.2F3 1 µg/ml, BD Biosciences), CD4 (clone RM4-5 0.25 µg/ml; BD Biosciences), CD8a (clone 53-6.7; 0.5 µg/ml BD Biosciences) and NK1.1 (clone PK136;1 µg/ml, BD Biosciences). Data were acquired on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo software (version 10.0.6; Tree Star, Ashland, USA). Representative gating strategies used for analysis of cell surface staining are shown in Supplementary  Fig. 8 . Protein assays. Cytokine protein levels in mouse BAL, human sputum supernatants or cell supernatants from in vitro experiments were assayed using commercial 'duoset' enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). MUC5AC and MUC5B proteins in BAL were measured after adhesion to a 96-well plate by allowing samples to evaporate at 37°C overnight. Plates were washed three times between steps. Plates were blocked for 2 h with 2% bovine serum, albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline. For measurement of MUC5AC, the detection antibody used was biotinylated anti-MUC5AC (Thermo Scientific) at 400 ng/ml. For the MUC5B assay, detection antibody was mouse anti-MUC5B clone EH-MUC5Ba. Bound anti-MUC5B antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Standard curves for mucin ELISAs were generated by serial 1:2 dilutions of supernatants taken from ionomycin-stimulated H292 cells (MUC5AC) and BAL supernatants previously taken from ovalbumin-induced hyper-allergic mice (MUC5B). Western blotting was used to evaluate proteins in BEAS-2B cell extracts. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein content was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (both Life Technologies). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-pSTAT1 Y701 (1:1000 diluted; New England BioLabs), anti-pSTAT2 Y690 (1:1000, New England BioLabs), anti-STAT1 (1:1000 diluted; New England BioLabs) and anti-STAT2 (1:1000 diluted; New England BioLabs). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C with shaking and secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 diluted; Jackson Immunoresearch) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Data were acquired using a Fusion FX7 image analyser (Vilber Lourmat). Uncropped western blot images are shown in Supplementary Fig 9. For measurement of serum antibodies in the mouse model, peripheral blood was collected from the carotid arteries and serum RV-specific IgGs were measured by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with purified RV1B, as used for in vivo infection, and incubated at 4°C overnight, Plates were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature. An aliquot of 50 µl per well of serum diluted 1:50 in 5% milk/PBS was then added with further 2 h incubation at room temperature. IgG detection antibodies were biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgG1 (0.5 µg/ml clone A85-1 BD Biosciences) and IgG2a (0.5 µg/ml clone R19-15. BD Biosciences). To prepare lung nuclear extracts for measurement of transcription factor activation, the left lung was excised, immediately placed into a 1.7 ml tube and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at −80°C. Lung tissue was manually homogenised while immersed in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and nuclear extracts prepared using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium). Activation of transcription factors GR, NFκB p65 subunit and IRF-3 were assessed in mouse lung tissue using commercially available DNA binding assays (Active Motif) using 20 μg per well of nuclear protein. Neutralisation assays. Neutralisation of RV was measured in Ohio HeLa cells (UK Health Protection Agency General Cell Collection) grown until~90% confluent on 96-well plates. Pooled sera for each given treatment group were incubated with purified RV-A1 or medium control at room temperature with shaking for 1 h and then added to HeLa cells with further incubation at 37°C for 48-72 h. Protection from cytopathic effect was measured by crystal violet cell viability assay. Cells were stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then washed with water, air-dried and crystal violet was solubilised with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution (w/v). Absorbance was measured by a Spectramax Plus plate reader at 560 nm. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from BEAS-2Bs, primary airway epithelial cells or sputum cells (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) and 2 µg was used for cDNA synthesis (Omniscript RT kit). For mouse models, total RNA was extracted from the right upper lobe of mouse lung and placed in RNA later, prior to RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis (as detailed above). Quantitative PCR was carried out using previously described specific primers and probes for each gene of interest 23, 33 , and normalised to 18S rRNA 33 . Reactions were analysed using ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). DNA extraction and bacterial 16S quantitative PCR. DNA extraction from human sputum and mouse lung tissue was performed using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, USA), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Bead-beating was performed for two cycles of 30 s at 6800 rpm (Precellys, Bertin Technologies). Total 16s bacterial loads were measured using quantitative PCR, performed in triplicate using the Viia7 Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies). In addition to template, each PCR reaction mix contained 0.2 μl of forward primer 520F (10 μm; 5′-AYTGGYDTAAAGNG-3′), 0.2 μl reverse primer 802R (10 μm; 5′-TACNVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′), 5 μl SYBR Fast Universal master mix (Kapa Biosystems) and 3.6 μl H 2 O. PCR cycling conditions were: 1 cycle of 90°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C (20 s), 50°C (30 s), 72°C (30 s) and melt conditions of 1 cycle of 95°C (15 s) and 1 cycle of 60°C (1 min) followed by dissociation at 95°C (15 s). For creation of the standard curve, a 1:10 dilution series (10 4 -10 9 copies) of partial 16S rRNA gene of Vibrio natriegens DSMZ 759 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany) from positions 27 to 1492 of the Escherichia coli reference cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit; (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used. Statistical analyses. For mouse experiments, animals were studied in group sizes of five-eight mice per experimental condition and data are presented as mean ± SEM, representative of at least two combined independent experiments. Data were analysed using one-or two-way ANOVA with significant differences between groups assessed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. In vitro BEAS-2B experiments were performed three-five times and data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were analysed by one-or two-way ANOVA test with differences between groups assessed Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. In vitro primary airway epithelial cell experiments were performed with a group size of n = 9 patients and individual data points are shown. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA with significant differences between groups assessed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Data from the human COPD cohort were analysed by using the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post test to compare protein levels or mRNA expression between ICS users and non-users. Correlations between data sets were examined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Data availability.
