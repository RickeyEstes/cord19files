The protocol for this study was approved by the University of Utah Medical Center Investigational Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. All patients who were seen at the CF clinic at the University of Utah Medical Center between September 1986 and April 1987 with an acute pulmonary exacerbation of CF were eligible for admission to the study. Pulmonary exacerbations were defined as an acute change in health associated with fever or hemoptysis or with an increase in dyspnea, cough, or sputum production. At the time of enrollment, each patient's history was obtained, and physical examination and an evaluation of severity of the underlying CF by Shwachman score were also done. Each patient also had specimens collected for viral and bacterial culture, viral serologic studies, complete blood cell count and differential cell count, and determination of serum C-reactive protein. Patients old enough to cooperate were asked to participate in pulmonary function studies. All exacerbations for which either a viral culture or both acute and convalescent serum specimens were collected were included in the data analysis. Of 84 exacerbations, four (5%) were excluded from the data analysis because these specimens were not available. Clinical evaluation. Specific historical information and physical findings recorded for patients in the study included the presence of upper respiratory tract symptoms, duration of illness before presentation, weight loss, household contacts with respiratory illness, and the presence of wheezing. The severity of the underlying disease was assessed by a modified Shwachman-Kulczycki scoring system 8 that employs the Brasfield score 9 for the chest roentgenogram findings. All chest roentgenograms were evaluated and scored by one investigator (P.G.B.). Pulmonary function tests. Pulmonary function tests were done with a computerized portable spirometer (model CM-V, Cybermedic Inc., Lewisville, Colo.). Patients were asked to perform three consecutive forced vital capacity maneuvers, and the highest value was recorded. The results of the PFTs done during the acute exacerbation were compared with those of a study done during the previous 6 months, when the patient was not acutely ill. The results were analyzed by calculating the percentage of change from the baseline for each test. Groups of patients were compared by determining the mean percentage of change from baseline for each of the PFTs. Viral cultures. All specimens for viral culture were obtained within 48 hours of patients' enrollment in the study. Each patient had a nasopharyngeal and a throat specimen obtained with calcium alginate swabs. The swabs were placed in viral collecting broth (Earle balanced salt solution with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with penicillin (500 U/ml) and streptomycin (250 ~g/ml) and kept at 4 ~ C until inoculated into celt culture. Within 24 hours of collection the specimens were inoculated into tube cultures of human foreskin fibroblast, HEp-2, and primary cynomolgus monkey kidney cells. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were also inoculated during the winter months, when influenza virus was prevalent. These tubes were incubated in stationary racks at 36 ~ C. Two tube cultures of human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were inoculated and incubated in a roller drum at 33 ~ C for isolation of rhinoviruses. All viral isolates were identified by standard immunologic or virologic methods. Serologic determinations, Serum specimens obtained within 4 days of enrollment in the study and serum specimens collected at convalescence 2 to 6 weeks after enrollment were tested for the presence of specific antiviral antibody. All specimens were stored at -20 ~ C from the time of collection until the antibody assays were performed. Antibodies to influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1 to 3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Mycoplasma pneurnoniae were detected by complement fixation. Antibody to coronavirus 229E was detected by a microtiter neutralization assay. 1~ A fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between the paired serum samples was considered evidence of a viral or mycoplasmal infection. Bacterial cultures. Sputum specimens were obtained from all patients able to produce adequate samples. In young children who were not able to provide a sample, specimens of respiratory secretions were obtained by sampling the hypopharynx with a cotton swab. All specimens were inoculated onto sheep blood agar plates and incubated at 37 ~ C. C-reactive protein determination. Concentrations of CRP were determined in the acute serum specimens obtained at the time of enrollment in the study. CRP assays were done by rate nephelometry (Beckman Immunochemistry Systems, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, Calif.). Values >0.59 mg/dl were considered positive. Statistical analysis. Proportions were compared by the Fisher Exact Test. Continuous variables in groups of patients were compared by a two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analyses were performed with commercial software (NWA Statpak, Northwest Analytical, Inc., Portland, Ore.).
