We use three different statistical methods (Table 1) to estimate the basic reproductive number R 0 and related quantities. These are i) Transmission tree method; ii) Renewal equation method; and iii) General growth method. For these statistical methods, asymptomatic infections are ignored. We also use transmission dynamics model to describe the asymptomatic and symptomatic infections and to cross-validate the above statistical methods.
