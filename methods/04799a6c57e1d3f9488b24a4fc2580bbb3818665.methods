Amplification of VP6 gene of PRV by PCR PRV Chinese isolate named DN30209 was recently isolated in a pig farm in Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China. The virus was propagated in MA104 cells in presence of trypsin at a final concentration of 3 μg/mL (w/v). The viral total RNA was extracted with a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (HaiGene, China). Sense primer (VP6-1): 5'-GGCTTTTAAACGAAGTCTTC and antisense primer (VP6-2): 5'-GGTCACATCCTCTCACTA were published primers [23] and used to amplify the VP6 gene for sequencing. The reverse transcription mixture included 5 μL of RNA (1 μg), 1 μL of primer VP6-2 (10 pmol), 4 μL of 5×RT-PCR buffer (TaKaRa, China),0.5 μL of RNase inhibitor, 1 μL of dNTP (10 mM/each), 1 μL sucrose and 0.04% bromophenol blue) followed by phenol-chloroform extraction at 12, 000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to RNA-PAGE to detect and analyze the genome of rotavirus. The RNA-PAGE was performed in 10% polyacrylamide slab gel using discontinuous buffer system without SDS as described by Laemmli [24] for 13 h at 10 mA. Viral RNA segments were visualized in silver staining.
