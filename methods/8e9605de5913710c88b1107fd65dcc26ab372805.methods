Study population and design. Since August 2009, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), in partnership with the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has carried out surveillance for ALRI (defined as cough or difficulty breathing with an onset within the last 14 days from hospital admission date) among patients aged ≥ 18 years, at Siaya County Referral Hospital, in Western Kenya. The study population is culturally homogeneous and the area is known for high malaria, tuberculosis and HIV prevalence [7] [8] [9] . A structured questionnaire was programmed using Microsoft Visual Studio.net (Microsoft, Redmond, USA) and installed into netbooks (Mercer classmate) for collection of demographic and clinical examination data from patients by surveillance officers i.e. trained clinical officers and nurses. The data were stored in password protected Microsoft SQL databases (Microsoft, Redmond, USA). All patients were managed and discharged according to the Kenya Ministry of Health standards and guidelines. Specimen collection and processing. NP and OP specimens were collected from consenting patients meeting the ALRI case definition using flexible mini-tip flocked swabs, combined into a single vial containing viral transport media, and transported to the laboratory for testing as previously described 7 . Sputum specimens were collected through expectoration (quality sputum defined as <10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field) in clean 3 ml tubes and transported at 2-8 °C to KEMRI/CDC laboratories in Kisumu where they were stored at −80 °C until testing. Nucleic acids were extracted from the sputum specimens, using a modified MagMax TM (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) viral RNA extraction procedure to include dithriothreital (DTT) treatment stage to break down sputum. Briefly, 100 μl of 500 mM DTT solution was added to 100 μl of sputum, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The MagMax TM viral RNA extraction procedure was performed on 200 μl material following the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted total nucleic acids from NP/OP and sputum were tested using TAC as described by Kodani et al. and Weinberg et al. 4, 10 . Each target of the 30 pathogens was considered positive if it passed the internal positive control and had exponential fluorescence curves crossing the assigned threshold at a threshold cycle (C T ) value of <35. For targets with two wells, the target was considered positive when either of the two wells was positive. Results with C T > 30 for Legionella spp. were disregarded due to probe degradation of the specific chemistry used in preparation of this TAC. Data analysis. We described demographic characteristics and laboratory outcomes of patients using proportions, means, and medians. The paired specimen results were compared between NP/OP and sputum specimens using the McNemar's test and further stratified by HIV status, malaria infection, clinical severity (≤ vs. >7 days hospitalized) and duration of illness (< vs. ≥5 days from onset to admission) which are provided as supplementary tables. Percent agreement between NP/OP and sputum specimens were calculated as the total number of times the NP/OP and sputum specimens agreed for each TAC target divided by the total number of patients tested. Tests with p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The C T values for each target were summarized using box-and-whiskers plots. Analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.2, Cary, NC).
