Agro-constructs and Agro-infiltration. The construction and characteristic features of an agro-construct of STMV (pSTMV; Fig. 1A ) have recently been described 9 . All CP variants constructed in this study were incorporated into the genetic background of pSTMV using a mega PCR approach 31 . Briefly, to construct the N-terminal CP variants (Fig. 1C ) 3R → A, 5K → A, 7K → A, 10R → A, 11K → A and 5R + 7K → 5A + 7A (refer red to as 57A; Fig. 1C ), STMV CPKO, STMV 13aa, STMV 13aa/A and STMV 13aa/B (Fig. 5A) , the CP gene harboring nucleotides (nt) 159 to 614 was first amplified with the following forward primers (For 3R → A 5′ GCTATGGGGGCAGGTAAGGTTAAACC3′ , 5′ GCTATG GGGAGAGGTGCAGTTAAACC3′ ,for 5K → A 5′ GGGGAGAGGTAAGGTTGCACCAAACC 3′; for7K → A 5′ GGTAAGGTTAAACCAAACGCAAAATCGACG 3′ ; FOR 10R → A 5′ GGTTAAACCAAAC CGTGCATCGACG 3′ ; 5′ for CPKO, 5′ CTGTTTCCAGCTTAGGGGAGAGGTTAGGTTAAACC3′ ;for 13aa, 5′ CGTAAATCGACGTAGGACAATTCGAATG 3′ ; for 13aa/A5′ GCTATGGGGGCAGGTAAGGTTAAACC 3′ ; 13aa/B 5′ CCAGCTATGGGGAGAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCATCGACGTAGGACAATTCG 3′ ) and a commonly shared reverse primer (5′ GGCGACTTGTCGACAGTTGC 3′ ; SalI site is underlined). The resulting PCR products were gel purified and used as mega primers in a PCR reaction. A region spanning the sequence of pSTMV from nt768-614 was amplified using a forward primer (5′ CGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGG3′ ; HindIII site is underlined) and each mega primer for the respective variant prepared above. The resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and SalI and sub-cloned into a similarly treated pSTMV. The nature of all recombinant clones was verified by DNA sequencing. Transformation of wild type and variant pSTMV agroconstructs to Agrobacterium strain GV3101 followed by infiltration into the abaxial side of the fully expanded N. benthamiana leaves was as described previously 32 . Mechanical inoculation, progeny analysis, packaging assays and EM analysis. Procedures used for mechanical inoculation of N. bethamiana with STMV variant virions in the presence of TMV U5, isolation of total RNA from agroinfiltrated leaves, purification of STMV virions, and Northern blot analyses are as described previously 9, 33, 34 . For electron microscopy analysis, partially purified wild type and variant STMV virions were further subjected to purification using 10-40% sucrose gradient centrifugation and spread on glow-discharged grids followed by negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate prior to examination with a JEM 1200-EX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 keV, and images were recorded digitally with a wide-angle (top mount) BioScan 600-W 1Kx 1K pixel digital camera.
