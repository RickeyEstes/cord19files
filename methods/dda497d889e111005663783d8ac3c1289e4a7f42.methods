We prospectively studied 481 hospital HCWs from wards including emergency and respiratory wards from nine hospitals in Beijing, China over a 5-week period from 1 December 2008 to 15 January 2009. These 481 subjects were a control group in a larger study [27] . The hospital wards were selected as high-risk settings in which repeated and multiple exposures to respiratory infections are expected. Participants were hospital HCWs aged 518 years and who were provided with written information about the study. Staff who agreed to participate provided informed consent and a copy of the information sheet with the participants' initials was retained as documentation [27] . The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Ministry for Health. Participants were asked to record on a daily basis whether they had performed one of the following: provision of nebulizer medications, suctioning, intubation, aerosol-generating procedures and chest physiotherapy. The following information was also collected: number of hours worked, estimated number of daily contacts with patients, number of daily contacts with influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and hand-washing adherence. The use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, eye shields, foot/hair covers was documented by study participants in a daily selfreport diary, and details of clinical and demographics were also recorded. All study participants were followed up for a period of 31 days and monitored daily for the onset of respiratory symptoms. If any symptom developed, combined nasal and throat swabs (double rayon-tipped, plastic-shafted swab) were taken and tested for respiratory viral or bacterial infection (Fig. 1) . The nose and throat swabs were tested at the Laboratories of the Beijing Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Viral DNA⁄RNA was extracted from 300μl of each respiratory specimen using the Viral Gene-spin ™ kit (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc., Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions [27] . We tested nose and throat swabs for the following: adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMP), coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, and rhinovirus A/B by nucleic acid testing using a commercial multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with the Seeplex® RV12 Detection kit (Seegen Inc., Korea). Details of laboratory methods have been described in a previous publication [27] . We also tested for bacterial colonization. A multiplex PCR (Seegen Inc.) was used to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, B. pertussis, Legionella spp, Chlamydophilia and Haemophilus influenza type B. After preheating at 95°C for 15 min, 40 amplification cycles were performed under the following conditions in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, Applied Biosystems, USA): 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1·5 min, and 72°C for 1·5 min. Amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. The multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel. The controls represent HCWs in their usual working conditions, without any interventions. This study is a post-hoc analysis of data collected during the primary trial on HRPs in the control arm. The prospective data collection and measurement of clinical endpoints in a group of HCWs working under usual conditions afforded the opportunity to measure the association of incident infection with HRPs. The primary outcomes of the study were: clinical respiratory infection (CRI)presence of two or more respiratory symptoms or one respiratory symptom (e.g. cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, sore throat) and one systemic symptom (e.g. fever, lethargy, chills); laboratory-confirmed viral infection (influenza A and B, parainfluenza, RSV, coronavirus, HMP virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus); laboratoryconfirmed viral or bacterial infection (and of the above viruses or a bacterial infectionpertussis, Hib, pneumococcus, Mycoplasma, Legionella); and influenza A or B (categorized as 'influenza' if either strain were present). The outcomes were tested against predictor variables such as age, education, category of HCW, influenza vaccination uptake, and performance of hand washing and HRPs. The total number of HRPs performed over the study period was calculated. A binary variable defining whether or not HCWs performed any HRPs during the study period was created and analysed with other predictor variables against incident infection during the study period. Poisson regression was used for the analysis of the outcomes, using Egret software (Cytel, USA). A P value of 40·05 was considered significant in the analysis.
