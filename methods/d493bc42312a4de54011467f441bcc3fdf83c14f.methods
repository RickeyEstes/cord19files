A literature review was conducted using the following key terms in Medline, PubMed, and CINAHL databases: negative pressure, ventilation, filtration, respiratory isolation, and airborne isolation. In addition, the snowballing technique (identifying relevant references from the reference list of other publications) and expert consultation were utilized. Only English language research articles in peer-reviewed journals, national organization publications, and book chapters that discuss methods of and provide empirical evidence related to airborne isolation and/or establishing negative air pressure for rooms/areas were utilized. Editorials, articles published in nonpeer reviewed journals or those that address negative pressure unrelated to room air balance, and non-English language articles were excluded. Abstracts and titles were screened, and only those that met the aforementioned criteria were considered. From a total of 86 titles and abstracts, only 13 met the criteria. Searching the reference lists of these and consulting environmental health experts resulted in an additional 11 relevant publications, for a total of 24 articles. Data from the 24 relevant articles were extracted; specifically, details of patients/samples, intervention, study type, study quality, and results were recorded in a spreadsheet. Studies were grouped by topic and quality of evidence, with randomized controlled trials assumed to provide the best evidence. Nonrandomized and other study designs were considered to provide less reliable evidence. Next, components were compiled into a visual step-by-step process. After the initial analysis was completed, the findings were discussed with content experts, and minor adjustments were made when applicable.
