As part of a larger study on infection control knowledge and reported practice, a mail survey was constructed in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) 4 Standards, State Health Department Infection Control Guidelines 27, and consultation with members of an Ambulance and Infection Control Expert Working Group (EWG). The survey consisted of questions grouped into three sections regarding demographic characteristics of participants (10 questions), knowledge of infection control (10 questions), and reported practices (10 questions) . Four questions within the survey related specifically to knowledge of infection control standards and principles. The survey tool, information sheet and consent form were piloted with a convenience sample of 20 paramedics, which resulted in minor editorial changes to enhance clarity. Pilot data were excluded from the main data set. Ethical approval was obtained from the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Commissioner of the participating ambulance service. All staff that held clinical position or a position that directly affected clinical outcomes were eligible to participate. The survey was distributed to 2274 paramedics across 240 locations within the State accompanied with stamped, self-addressed envelopes and information sheets. Participants were asked to omit any identifying comments such as their name, address or work station.
