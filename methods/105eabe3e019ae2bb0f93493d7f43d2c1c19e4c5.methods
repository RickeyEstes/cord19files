Ethics statement. Human monocytes were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors in accordance with guidelines and regulations of the Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Informed consent was given by all donors for the use of their blood samples. Adult worms were collected during the routine work of a local abattoir (Frigorífico Carrasco) in Montevideo (Uruguay). Protocols were approved by the Uruguayan Committee on Animal Research (Comisión Honoraria de Experimentación Animal, Uruguay) or by the Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Preparation of protein lysates from F. hepatica. Live adult worms of F. hepatica were obtained from the bile ducts of bovine livers, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, then mechanically disrupted and sonicated. After centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 60 min supernatants were collected and dialyzed against PBS. The obtained total lysate (FhTE) was quantified and stored at − 80 °C. Carbohydrate glycol groups present in FhTE were oxidized with sodium periodate (10 mM). The oxidation was performed at room temperature for 45 min in the dark, followed by the reduction with sodium borohydride (50 mM) of the reactive aldehyde groups. The Scientific RepoRts | 7:46748 | DOI: 10.1038/srep46748 resulting oxidized lysate is referred as FhmPox. In order to perform control experiments, the following control extracts were prepared: FhCB, consisted of FhTE subjected to the whole treatment excepting for the incubation with sodium periodate; and CmPox, consisting of PBS subjected to the entire treatment. Lysates were dialyzed against PBS and their protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The endotoxin levels were determined by using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate kit Pyrochrome (Associates of Cape Cod). Protein preparations showed very low levels of endotoxins and were not able to induce DC-maturation (as IL-12 read out) on their own. mo-DCs incubated with the control CmPox produced the same levels of cytokines in the culture supernatant as mo-DCs cultured in medium alone.
