We conducted 2 consecutive studies. In the first study, we assessed whether there was agreement between Spanish experts on the diagnostic criteria for AB using the Delphi method. 19 The second one was a cross-sectional survey of clinical paediatricians carried out by means of an online questionnaire that explored their opinions regarding the diagnosis of AB. Appendix B (available in the online version of this article) provides detailed information on the methodology used. Delphi procedure (expert consensus) 1) We searched the literature for consensus documents, clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews that proposed diagnostic criteria, case definitions or standardised descriptions of AB (Appendix B, Table S1 ). Based on the identified sources, we developed a questionnaire to begin the Delphi procedure. 2) Gathering the panel of experts. We established an explicit definition of expert (Appendix B, Table S2 ), and strove to obtain a group that was sufficiently representative of both the paediatric subspecialties associated with AB and the different Spanish regions. 3) Delphi process. We submitted the questionnaire to the experts (Appendix B, Table S3 ), which included items with dichotomous answers (yes/no), multiple-choice answers and answers on a 1---10 scale to rate the importance of specific clinical characteristics in the diagnosis. We held successive rounds in which the initial responses were processed, feedback provided to participants along with a summary of the opinions of all participating experts, and new items proposed by participants added to the questionnaire. To this end, we had established criteria to define consensus and to bring the process to an end, which can be found in Appendix B. 4) Analysis. We made a descriptive analysis of the responses, identifying items in which consensus was reached based on the pre-established criteria. Cross-sectional study. Opinion of clinical paediatricians 1) Development of questionnaire. We developed a questionnaire similar to the one used in the Delphi procedure, summarising it to include the key aspects of the latter (Appendix B, Table S4 ). 2) Administration of the questionnaire. With the help of the Asociación Española de Pediatría (Spanish Association of Pediatrics, AEP) and several other Spanish paediatrics societies (Appendix B, Table S5 ), we informed all their members of the project by electronic mail, inviting them to participate in an online survey and offering as an enticement entry in a draw for winning a free registration to an AEP congress. 3) Sample size. We calculated the sample size based on the estimation that the population of paediatricians in Spain is of approximately 10 000. We assumed the case of maximum uncertainty, and estimated a necessary sample size of 965 for a level of confidence of 95% and a precision of 3% (see Appendix B for details). 4) Analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of the questionnaire items and assessed the association between the answers and demographic variables such as age, sex, place of residence and main professional activity (subspecialty) by means of the 2 test, Mann---Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficient. Applying predefined criteria (Appendix B, Table S6 ), we identified the answers that were consistent with 2 of the most widely used definitions of AB (McConnochie, 20 NICE 10 ) and with the expert consensus reached in the preceding Delphi process. We analysed whether the variables under study could be reduced to a smaller number of criteria by means of factor analysis (Appendix B). Subsequently, for each identified factor, we analysed whether there were differences in the factor scores based on the aforementioned demographic variables using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Spearman correlation coefficient. We defined statistical significance as a P-value of less than .05. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the health district of the principal investigator.
