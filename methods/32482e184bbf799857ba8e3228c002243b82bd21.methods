To provide the broadest possible value, laboratory diagnosis of respiratory tract infections should generate information on viral epidemiology as well as provide clinical information. In many laboratories, diagnosis of respiratory virus infections relies heavily on direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) assays, other rapid antigen detection methods or modified culture procedures. The rapid turn-around of DFA means that this method is still useful for influenza virus (IFV) A, IFVB and RSV, providing a good nasopharyngeal (NP) sample is taken. Positive results are used for cohorting vulnerable individuals, for treatment of the individual and management of a potential outbreak. DFA, however, is not as sensitive as NATs for these targets and additional cases will be identified using this method on DFA-negative NP samples. The use of culture versus NATs as an adjunct diagnostic approach, especially for non-NP samples, depends on the laboratory capacity and set-up. Culture methods are, in theory, "catch all" with no need for a pre-conceived idea of the likely cause. In practice, culture is not very sensitive and often negative for many picornaviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) which are all recognized causes of respiratory symptomology and disease in the community and in hospitals. The choice of NATs, if appropriate facilities are available, is obvious where maximum sensitivity is required for testing one or a few targets (Lee et al., 2006) . Culture can then be reserved for samples which have already been screened and have given positive results by DFA or NAT if an isolate is needed for further analysis. As detailed elsewhere, however, the broad range of respiratory viruses (and other bacteria) which cause similar symptoms makes set up of NATs complex if the full diagnostic testing repertoire is to be attempted. Multiplex amplification methods with suspension microarray detection may be one diagnostic enhancement which will be useful for sensitive surveillance and outbreak investigation.
