Using probabilistic mathematical models, we explore the possible basis of the observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV. Our analysis was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, we test the hypothesis that the virus was sustained in the population between two successively reported cases solely through human-to-human transmission. In the second and third stages of our analysis, we evaluate various transmission patterns in a close contact setting, representative of a social contact network at the Hajj, to compare the observed and expected epidemiology. The methods are described in detail below. Results from the models are compared against the known status of the outbreak. Epidemiological data to inform the models were obtained from official news reports from the WHO, ProMED-Mail, and rapid journal publications.
