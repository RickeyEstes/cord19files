The following databases were searched from their respective receptions up to January 2016: PubMed; EMBASE; AMED; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; ScienceDirect; SCOPUS; Web of Science; China Network Knowledge Infrastructure; CQVIP; and Wanfang Data. The keywords used for the literature search included: Fang Feng and its English, botanical and pharmaceutical names. The papers identified from the search were screened according to the criteria laid out in the Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Complementary Medicines and Therapeutic Goods Orders for quantitative and qualitative analysis of herbal medicine by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). TGA adopts the British Pharmacopoeia and Therapeutic Goods Orders as the official guidelines for testing and acceptance criteria for herbal substances, herbal preparations, and herbal medicinal products, inclusive of traditional herbal medicinal products [2] . TGA also recognizes other international pharmacopoeias for guidelines on assessing and testing botanicals in complementary medicine. The selection criteria included process controls of the herbal substances, reporting reference standards such as authentication of reference materials and profile chromatograms, and analytical procedures and validation data. Papers in English or Chinese language are considered for this review. Scientific rigors were called upon to determine the chemical markers of herbs through the use of strict parameters in testing, quantitative and qualitative measures of the bioactive components, such as fingerprint spectrum, correlations differentiation, and stability evaluation, reference standards, and toxicological assessments. According to the TGA, reporting referencing standards includes naming the origin of the plant materials and its authentication [2] . A plant specimen voucher number (PSVN) is an upmost requirement for referencing standards in botanical testing [3] . It enables traceability of the plant material, allows access to the storage of crude plant for researchers who seek to cross verify data, further scientific investigations or commercial purposes, should there be discrepancies in the drug products produced from the plant source. Essentially, a lack of PSVN essentially thwarts scientific research from the onset and may cause legal repercussions if used for commercial purposes. Attempts to compare bioactive yield outcomes of these studies was unfeasible in this review, owing to differences in extraction weights and yield units used in the papers such as relative standard deviation, microliters or milligrams per liters. The scientific process of reporting chemical profiling by spectroscopic and/or chromatographic fingerprint should include calibration curves that depict the peak area ratio and the percentage of relative abundance of the bioactive compounds yielded from the plant material in study.
