Study design and data source. We investigated data from 594 COPD patients who were enrolled in the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS) cohort between December 2011 and March 2014. Patients were eligible if they had been diagnosed with COPD by a pulmonologist, were aged ≥40 years, had post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, and if respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum, or dyspnoea, were present. Detailed information regarding KOCOSS cohort is described in a previous publication 33 . We obtained four data items from KOCOSS cohort, i.e., smoking status, lung function, body mass index (BMI), and COPD assessment test (CAT) scores. We then merged these items with their HIRA data from between 2007 and 2012; the latter data included details on comorbidity, medication, and health care utilization. Moderate exacerbation was defined as when COPD patients visited outpatient clinics with an ICD-10 code of COPD (J43. x−44.x, except J430, as the primary or within the fifth secondary diagnosis) and systemic steroid medication with or without antibiotics were prescribed. Severe exacerbation was defined as when COPD patients visited the emergency room or were admitted to hospital with an ICD-10 code of COPD and were prescribed steroid medication with or without antibiotics. A high COPD grade was arbitrarily defined as patients who were (1) tertiary hospital care patients meeting the above definition of COPD, and (2) regularly used triple inhaler therapy (inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] + long acting beta-2 agonists [LABA] + long acting muscarinic antagonists [LAMA]) or used of systemic steroid therapy at least twice per year with COPD inhaler therapy (LAMA or ICS + LABA) 34 . The HIRA 2007-2012 data were used to analyse utilization of COPD medication, comorbidity, and hospital admission. The 2007 data were used to identify the history of COPD exacerbation over the past year, and the 2008-2012 data were used to analyse the relationship between COPD exacerbation and putative predictive factors. We also collected primary weather variables, including levels of particulate matter <10 microns in diameter (PM10, µg/m 3 ), daily minimum ambient temperature (°C), and daily precipitation for 2007-2012. Daily local meteorological weather data, measured at the local weather stations, were provided by the Korean Ministry of the Environment. All the information amassed was matched to the patients' addresses. Matching was performed at province level. The area of the respective provinces (n = 16) ranged from 501 to 19,031 km 2 (median: 6,628 km 2 , interquartile range: 827-10,362 km 2 ). The Korean National Institute of Health (KNIH) monitors the trends of virus activity on a nation level. KNIH has surveyed respiratory viral infection status since 2000 and provided information to the public on a weekly basis (detection rate, %). Data on the activities of influenza adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human bocavirus, and human enterovirus were collected from the KNIH database for the 2007-2012 period. Additionally, we tracked the tendencies of online web search queries (normalized search volume index, 0-100), containing the key terms "flu", "dyspnea", "asthma", "COPD", "acute exacerbation", "emphysema, " and "chronic bronchitis" on Naver (www.naver.com; the biggest search engine site in Korea), for the period 2007 to 2012. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population (mean and standard deviation [SD], and percent). Independent t-tests were used to compare continuous variables and chi-square tests were used for categorical variable comparisons. Because all longitudinal data related to these patients are measured repeatedly, it violates the independency assumption of general statistical techniques. Therefore, the occurrence of acute exacerbation was investigated using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) 35 . Univariate analysis was performed by GEE between COPD exacerbation and single factor one by one. Then, multivariable analysis was performed with all factors included. Factors included in multivariable analysis were time variables, sex, smoking history, CAT score, FEV1(%), prescription of COPD medication, ICD-10 code for comorbidities, number of hospital admissions during the previous year (2007), number of ER visits during the previous year (2007), the history of acute exacerbations during the previous year (2007), grade of COPD, activities of viruses, cumulative exposures to PM10, meteorological factors, and online web search query logs. Subsequently, backward elimination of significant variables was performed. Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to assess the relationships between lowest temperature and other variables. All analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
