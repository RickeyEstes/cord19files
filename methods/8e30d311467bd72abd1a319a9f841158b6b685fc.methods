To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 The PRISMA and Cochrane systematic review guidelines were adopted [29] . A panel of 12 investigators developed the systematic review protocol including the eligibility criteria and the data abstraction tool. No formal protocol was published for this systematic review.
