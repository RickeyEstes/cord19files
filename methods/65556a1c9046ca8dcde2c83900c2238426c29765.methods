A two-center, retrospective case-control study was conducted utilizing data from King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC-R) and King Fahad General Hospital in Jeddah (KFGH-JED), Saudi Arabia. The data were obtained between September 1, 2012 and June 1, 2016. KFGH-JED experienced a MERS outbreak between March and May 2014 (Oboho et al., 2015) , and KAMC-R experienced a large MERS outbreak between June and August 2015 (Al-Dorzi et al., 2016) . Both study centers applied the Saudi MOH case definitions (Anon, 2018b) to identify suspected individuals in the population studied, and rRT-PCR was used as the gold standard test to diagnose MERS-CoV in multiple and different clinical specimens when necessary. MERS-CoV-related symptoms were common at both centers. The project received ethical approval from two independent ethics committees: the Saudi MOH (IRB log number 16-230E) and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (study number RC17/061), Riyadh Saudi Arabia. During the study, the medical records of 829 subjects who were being assessed by rRT-PCR for suspected MERS-CoV were reviewed. The suspicion of MERS-CoV infection at both KAMC-R and KFGH-JED was determined based on the Saudi MOH guidelines (Anon, 2018b) . Two groups were compared: patients who were positive and patients who were negative for MERS-CoV infection. In an effort to reduce heterogeneity between the study groups, only subjects with a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest were included in the analysis. Thus, subjects who had no available results of a chest X-ray or CT scan of the chest were excluded. The initial screening for suspected MERS-CoV patients includes pneumonia (Anon, 2018b) . Most of the patients studied were evaluated for pneumonia immediately after presentation. The study excluded subjects who were less than 15 years of age (pediatrics/children), as defined in the Saudi MOH guidelines (Anon, 2018b) , and excluded subjects who had upper respiratory tract infections (respiratory symptoms, positive or negative MERS-CoV rRT-PCR, and normal chest X-ray and CT scan of the chest). The final sample comprised a cohort of 360 subjects who had a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray and/or a CT scan of the chest, who were classified according to the results of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR. The case group consisted of 135 pneumonia patients who were positive for MERS-CoV infection, and the control group consisted of 225 pneumonia patients who were negative for MERS-CoV infection. Cases were defined as patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia who had positive MERS-CoV rRT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirate and/ or bronchoalveolar lavage in addition to a lung infiltrate on chest Xray and/or CT scan of the chest. Controls were defined as patients with respiratory symptoms, a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray and/or CT scan of the chest, pneumonia, and negative MERS-CoV rRT-PCR result of nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or bronchoalveolar lavage. Nineteen predictive variables were included: age, sex, fever (temperature !38 C), one composite respiratory symptom (the presence of cough, bloody cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain), one composite gastrointestinal symptoms (the presence of diarrhea, vomiting, or nausea), seven MERS-CoV potential risk factors (contact with sick patients or camels, severe illness (defined according to the patient's clinical status, 'yes/no', which is based on clinical judgment), diabetes, lung disease, liver disease, renal disease, and heart disease), and seven laboratory measurements (white blood cell (WBC) count (Â10 9 /l), platelets (Â10 9 /l), creatinine (mmol/l), bilirubin (mmol/l), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; U/l), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; U/l), and albumin (g/ l)). The reference ranges for the laboratory measures were as follows: WBC count, 4-11 Â10 9 /l; platelets, 150-400 Â 10 9 /l; creatinine, 50-98 mmol/l; bilirubin, 3.4-20.5 mmol/l; ALT, 5-55 U/l; AST, 5-34 U/l; albumin, 35-55 g/l. No serological tests were available at the centers for these patients.
