Data reported here are derived from a survey by the Harvard School of Public Health Project on the Public and Biological Security. The survey was ≈20 minutes long and consisted of 85 questions. International Communications Research conducted the survey from September 28 through October 5, 2006. The survey was conducted in English and Spanish with a representative national sample of 1,697 adults >18 years of age, including an over-sample of adults who had children <18 years of age in their households. Altogether, 821 such adults with children were interviewed. In the overall results, this group was weighted to its actual proportion of the total US adult population (cooperation rate was 75%; response rate was 36% [11] ). Common methods for media and preelection surveys were used, and relied on weighting of the data to ensure representativeness. More information about the survey methods and complete question wordings is available in the online Technical Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/5/778-Techapp.pdf. Surveys like this one, and others that would be conducted as part of a series in the event of a pandemic infl uenza, can provide technical assistance to public health offi cials by monitoring the response of the public to the evolving health threat posed by such an outbreak. In a public health emergency, surveys would have to be conducted with short fi eld periods to enable rapid measurement of how the public reacts to a particular set of circumstances. These rapid cycle surveys would make it possible to provide timely information to public health offi cials and to ensure a quick response. Getting survey results to public health offi cials in real time creates a situation similar to that of preelection polling (i.e., specifi c events can change the behavior and beliefs of many persons in a relatively short timeframe). National polling organizations that engage in preelection surveys use shorter fi eld periods, which provide more up-to-date information but yield lower response rates than surveys conducted over longer time periods (12) . Forecasts of voters' choices in preelection polls have shown that outdated information may introduce more errors into predictions of results than low response rates do (13) . Independent studies have shown that the results of statistically weighted data from shorter duration surveys are similar to those based on the higher response rate in surveys of long duration and can be used without an unacceptable risk for bias (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Nonresponse in telephone surveys produces some known biases in survey-derived estimates because participation tends to vary for different subgroups of the population. To compensate for these known biases, sample data are weighted to the most recent Census data available from the Current Population Survey for sex, age, race, region, and education (19) . Other techniques, including random-digit dialing, replicate subsamples, callbacks staggered over times of day and days of the week, and systematic respondent selection within households, are used to ensure that the sample is representative. Possible sources of nonsampling errors for this survey include nonresponse bias, as well as specifi c wording of questions and the order in which questions are asked. The margin of error for the total sample was ±2.4%. To examine differences among subgroups, we compared responses by testing for differences in proportions, taking into account the effect of the study's design (20) . Because many of the respondents may not have been familiar with pandemic infl uenza, they were fi rst presented with a descriptive hypothetical scenario: "Now I want to ask you some questions about a possible outbreak in the United States of pandemic fl u, a new type of fl u that spreads rapidly among humans and causes severe illness. Currently there have not been any cases of pandemic fl u in the United States. However, imagine that there was a severe outbreak in the United States, possibly in your community. A lot of persons were getting sick from the fl u and the fl u was spreading rapidly from person to person." This scenario was intentionally designed to describe a severe situation without being overly alarming. Respondents were then asked how they would respond to and be affected by the circumstances that would arise from such an outbreak. The small proportion of the respondents who said they would be unable to cooperate with public health authorities could be translated into millions of persons who would have diffi culty.
