Direct observations using a previously created and routinely used checklist were undertaken to collect data on the PPE removal practices of HCWs. Observations were undertaken from October 13-31, 2014, at various times during the week. Health care workers entering and exiting patient rooms were observed and documented, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and nursing assistants. Observations were undertaken on 5 different units in our tertiary academic medical center: surgical transplant, internal medicine, general surgery, hematology/oncology, and cardiothoracic medicine. A single trained observer performed these observations outside of patient rooms for no longer than 3 hours at a time. All patient rooms observed were specified as following isolation precautions. HCWs caring for patients in these rooms were not made aware of the observer's presence, nor was the observer a part of the hospital's infection control team. No efforts were made to disguise the purpose of the observations if directly asked, but the presence of students at our teaching hospital is commonplace and usually does not provoke attention. Auditing of infection control and prevention practices is a component of typical infection control activities. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to guide our direct observations. These recommendations regarding correct removal of PPE state that removal of contaminated gloves should occur first followed by gentle removal of the gown from the back of the neck while in the isolation patient's room. 4 This was considered full compliance. If an individual failed to remove his or her PPE in the proper order, or wore a component of the PPE outside of the isolation patient's room, that individual was considered to be partially compliant. We observed PPE removal technique by assessing how the gowns were removed. An HCW's PPE removal was not considered gentle if the removal process involved forceful movements and flourish. The PPE removal was considered gentle if it lacked flourish and forceful movement.
