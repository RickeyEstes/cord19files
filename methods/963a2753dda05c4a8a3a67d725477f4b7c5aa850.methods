A study to characterize all known and suspected PCD patients in Israel (NCT 01070914) is currently being undertaken in Israeli pediatric pulmonology centers using multiple diagnostic PCD tests. The study is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and ethical approval was obtained from the local research committee at each centre that collected patients' data (Ziv Following recruitment each subject completed an in depth clinical history, before undergoing nasal brushing [for Electron Microscopy (EM), Immuno-fluorescence (IF) and video-microscopy], blood sampling (for genetic analysis) and measurement of nasal Nitric Oxide (NO). Thus, each subject underwent all of these 5 tests including an HVMA evaluation of his/her cilia. The nasal brushing material was first used for HVMA and the remaining was used for IF staining and EM. NO measurements were obtained according to established American Thoracic Society guidelines. A single manufacture unit (CLD 88 SP, Eco Physics Duernten, Switzerland) was used in all centers. Most of the NO tests were done by a single team of investigators (MP, DB) with the same unit. Some of the NO tests were done by the experienced technicians at local centers using identical standardized operating procedures (Single breath with breath hold). The average of three measurements was used for statistical analysis. In young children (usually less than 4 years) the tidal breath method was employed. The analyzers were calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications. The procedure for HVMA started by obtaining respiratory epithelial cells from the patient by nasal brushing using a conventional cervix cytology brush [Celletta™ brush cell collector with protective tip (product number 9100060; Engelbrecht Medizin-und Labortechnik GmbH, Tiefenbachweg 13; 34295 Edermünde, Germany)]. The first author has been trained in nasal brushing by experienced investigators (HO, CW, MS) before the present study. To minimize pain, the brush was rinsed with an isotonic saline solution before being inserted in the inferior nasal meatus, using rotatory and linear movements. The brush was immediately removed and transferred into a tube containing 2-3 mL of cell culture medium (RPMI Medium 1640, Endotoxin tested, Cell culture tested, without L-Glutamine, without Sodium Bicarbonate. Biological Industries LTD., Beit Haemek, Israel). The tube was then shaken vigorously so that cells became detached from the brush. The brush was withdrawn from the tube and used to smear slides (for later IF analysis) while the last portion of the material on the brush was stored in a glutaraldehyde filled tube for later EM analysis. A plastic Pasteur pipette was then used to draw approximately 50 microliter fluid sample from the RPMI tube and put it in one of the wells of a multi-well cassette under the microscope. Traditional HVMA uses single slides per sample and each fluid sample is put on a new slide for the HVMA. In this case we used a Linbro multiwell plate ( Figure 1 , Hampton Research Corp., CA, USA). This is a 24 well plate where the wells were identified by lettered rows A through D and numbered columns 1 through 6. It allowed multiple fluid samples to be placed in the wells with no need to remove the plate from the microscope holder between patients. The use of the multi-well plate instead of individual glass slides minimized microscope movements (during slides changes) and the need for focus adjustments. All sample images were visualized with a relatively small Eclipse TS-100 inverted phase contrast microscope (Nikon Corp. Tokyo, Japan) using a 40X objective lens (numerical apparatus = 0.55) providing a total magnification of 400 X. Eight to ten video images of each sample under the microscope were selected for recording based upon the visibility of vital ciliated cells, good resolution and preferably, the presence of cell strips. Images were recorded using a scA640-120 fm digital video camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) attached to the microscope. The camera was connected to a laptop computer (LG model #R58) with an IEEE cable. The computer was equipped with a high power video card and an Express card IEEE1394B interface ( Figure 2 ). The laptop computer was easily transportable and the whole system was packed on a heavy duty trolley (Pelican 1630, Pelican Products, Inc., CA, USA) for transport. All image recordings and processing were performed with the Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis (SAVA) system [7] , which was highly customized to perform ciliary analysis for both ciliary beating frequency (CBF) and patterns. Images were captured initially into RAM in real-time at 120 fps and immediately compressed and stored to disk. At a sampling rate of 120 fps, approximately 3 s of video were recorded for each image. Each digital image frame consisted of 640 columns X 480 rows of pixels. Images were recorded at room temperature within 10 minutes after brushing. Once recorded, the video clips for each subject (and sample) were played back in normal time and slow motion (up to 1/8th speed) for quality assessment and analysis of beat frequency and pattern. If the quality was deemed inadequate, we used the pipetor to draw a second sample from the tube into another well. If this was also insufficient, a second nasal brushing was performed on the subject and the process was repeated. Once this process was deemed satisfactory, the subject had completed his test and the system was immediately ready for the next subject. An initial preliminary assessment of the video clips was done on-site and a general subjective impression (general 3 categories of normal or likely normal; abnormal or possibly abnormal; and undetermined) was immediately shared with the treating physicians (and also with the patient and his/her family) who were usually present at the site but may not always attend similar tests done in centralized institutions. With a few simple clicks in the SAVA software, the next subject's details appeared on the screen and the system was ready for the next subject's sample. A much more thorough and comprehensive detailed analysis of the video clips was performed post hoc at the central laboratory where each video clip was played back and analyzed separately and a final result of findings was prepared. This analysis and interpretation was done by 3 experts in HVMA who were not involved in the data collection (2 from Germany, 1 from the UK) and were blind to the clinical data, NO EM, IF or genetic results of the subject. In cases of ambiguity the files were further reanalyzed and final report was reached by consensus. Analysis of each video clip included quality of image (images with no epithelia cells and/or clips with only single cells were excluded from further analysis), and beating pattern. Reviewing all 8-10 images for each subject and taking into account all of these criteria, the HVMA results of each subject were then categorized into the following specific categories [8] : Normal or Probably Normal beating (regular forward and recovery strokes); Immotile cilia; Residual movement (almost immotile cilia with minimal movements); Stiff beating (due to reduced bending capacity/ amplitude); Abnormal circular beating; Hyperkinetic cilia; No video available; Cannot be assessed. The last category (cannot be assessed) included subjects with poor quality clips for different causes such as those with single (not within an epithelial strip) immotile ciliated cells, poor resolution due to cells entrapped in mucus or subjective inability to distinguish between cilia of dying or damaged cells (secondary dyskinesia) to dyskinesia or a-kinetic cilia in a vital cell (primary dyskinesia). In these cases, nasal brushing and HVMA should be repeated three to six months later. The diagnosis of PCD was confirmed following the completion of the study and based on assessment of all available tests for each individual. In addition to predetermined classic clinical characteristic as an inclusion criteria, confirming the diagnosis of PCD in this study required at least 2 abnormal tests out of the 5 tests performed (EM, IF, Genetics, NO and HVMA). The distribution of various HVMA findings in the PCD diagnosed patients were then summarized post-hoc. The sensitivity of HVMA as an index test to accurately diagnose PCD was calculated as the proportion of abnormal HVMA in the total number of confirmed PCD. For the purpose of sensitivity calculation, PCD was confirmed by the presence of at least two abnormal references tests out of four (EM, IF, Genetics, NO; without the index test-HVMA)]. As there is no gold standard for PCD [9] it is very challenging to exclude PCD and to calculate specificity and/or negative predictive value of diagnostic tests. For example, even when PCD is defined by abnormal genetics, it is impossible to define "non PCD" (true negative, false positive) cases, as a subject who is negative for known PCD mutations can still harbor a new unrecognized PCD causing mutation. Therefore, we have focused on calculating the sensitivity of HVMA, namely the probability of an abnormal HVMA in subjects with PCD.
