As the primary goal of this course is to facilitate familiarity with the use and functionality of specific equipment and implementation of specific step-by-step processes, the most suitable instructional format is deliberate practice in a simulated environment. This program requires space to meet the needs of at least 12 participants rotating through multiple stations, some of which run concurrently. The participants will actively don and doff PPE, learn and practice the management of biosafety level 4 hazardous waste, and be provided an opportunity to manage, in interprofessional groups, a variety of routine medical processes and procedures while wearing PPE. Participants should be hospital clinicians who have the potential to be exposed to and care for patients with EVD in an isolated environment. These would include physicians, nurses, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, phlebotomists, and other relevant health care workers. The curriculum described hereafter is a 4-hour fundamental interprofessional training course designed for potential EVD caregivers. The course consists of a concise didactic session and observation of a demonstration of donning/doffing EVD-required PPE, active participation in the donning/doffing of PPE, Course Outline A concise schedule outlining the time and basic requirements for each section of the course is contained in Appendix A. Introduction of Donning and Doffing PPE Setup: Arrange Table and chairs conference-style to enhance introductions, observation, debriefing, and evaluation processes. Assign seating prior to class by placing nameplates with roles and designated groups around the table to ensure learning groups are interdisciplinary and to enhance conversations from the beginning of class. Have a computer with audiovisual capabilities on hand, as well as adequate space for the demonstration of donning and doffing of PPE using an observer and a separate narrator. Give each participant a precourse survey prior to the start of the class.
