A cluster-randomised trial of medical and cloth mask use for HCWs was conducted in 14 hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. The trial started on the 3 March 2011, with rolling recruitment undertaken between 3 March 2011 and 10 March 2011. Participants were followed during the same calendar time for 4 weeks of facemasks use and then one additional week for appearance of symptoms. An invitation letter was sent to 32 hospitals in Hanoi, of which 16 agreed to participate. One hospital did not meet the eligibility criteria; therefore, 74 wards in 15 hospitals were randomised. Following the randomisation process, one hospital withdrew from the study because of a nosocomial outbreak of rubella. Participants provided written informed consent prior to initiation of the trial.
