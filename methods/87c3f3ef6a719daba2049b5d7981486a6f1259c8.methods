How the database was handled. We consulted the Ebola data for the number of cases detected in the three countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 34 ). The data is available from 25th March 2014 to 13th April 2016 at the time interval of a few days. The data is noisy and contains obvious errors as sometimes the cumulative data is shown to decrease which is unphysical. The first available data is from March 2014 when Guinea was already struck with the disease for some time (first case in Guinea reported in December 2013) such that the data for the initial period is missing. For Liberia and Sierra Leone, the data for initial stage are available, however these are sparse and unreliable; often the data for number of death exceeds the number of cases. For this reason, the data has been analysed from the date when the number of cases detected is at least 50 for each country. Even then the errors cannot be fully avoided as for very late stages, the data being rare, also become somewhat unreliable. Hence, the entire data set has to be handled carefully. In Table 3 , a summary of the statistics of the Ebola data is presented and one can immediately note that all cases could not have been confirmed in the laboratory in the case of Liberia where number of deaths exceeds the laboratory confirmed cases. Obviously many cases were unreported. For Guinea, these two figures are closest and the data for Guinea is in fact the cleanest one. (Table 2) . Another point needs to be mentioned. The disease has been officially declared over on 1st June 2016 for Guinea, 9th June 2016 for Liberia and 17th March 2016 for Sierra Leone 35 . But one can see from Fig. 1 that the cumulative data shows a saturation over fairly long period of time. Apparently a few stray cases delayed the declaration of the disease being over. For Liberia, for example, the disease was originally declared to be over as early as in May 2015 but two small flare-ups were reported later. However the cumulative data is hardly affected by the later cases.

In the Euclidean model, the nodes of the network are assumed to occupy the sites of a chain of length N. We generated random long range bonds by connecting nodes located at a distance l along the chain with a probability ∝ δ − P l l ( ) ; the probability is normalised by making the total probability equal to unity. Once N/2 such bonds are constructed, the network is completed. The average degree of each node is three and it is expected that the inhomogeneity of the degree distribution is negligible. The disease spreading process is then simulated by assuming a single infected agent at any randomly chosen site in the beginning. All the neighbours are likely to be infected with a probability q in the next step. One generates a random number between 0 and 1, if it is less than q, the agent is taken to be infected. From the agents who are infected in the second step, the disease spreads to their neighbours and the process continues. Infected people are removed within one unit of time, with the assumption that they are either dead or cured, and they can infect the susceptible agents during this one time step only. The dynamical evolution stops when there is either no infected agent at a particular step or when all of them have died. Several configurations are considered and the dynamical variables averaged. In the present simulation, for the same network, the initial choice of infected site was repeated 400 times and the quantities averaged. A secondary averaging is made by considering 100 different network configurations. The number of nodes N and the total number of edges were kept fixed for any value of δ and q in the different realisations. Periodic boundary condition has been used in the simulation. Systems with size N = 2 11 has been considered.
