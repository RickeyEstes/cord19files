Public datasets (GEO: GSE122960) were used for bioinformatics analysis. Firstly, we used Seurat (version 2.3.4) to read a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples. We removed the low-quality cells with less than 200 or more than 6,000 detected genes, or if their mitochondrial gene content was > 10%. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than 3 cells. For normalization, the combined gene-barcode matrix was scaled by total UMI counts, multiplied by 10,000 and transformed to log space. The highly variable genes were identified using the function FindVariableGenes. Variants arising from number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out by specifying the vars.to.regress argument in Seurat function ScaleData. The expression level of highly variable genes in the cells was scaled and centered along each gene, and was conducted to principal component analysis. Then we assessed the number of PCs to be included in downstream analysis by (1) plotting the cumulative standard deviations accounted for each PC using the function PCElbowPlot in Seurat to identify the 'knee' point at a PC number after which successive PCs explain diminishing degrees of variance, and (2) by exploring primary sources of heterogeneity in the datasets using the PCHeatmap function in Seurat. Based on these two methods, we selected the first top significant PCs for two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), implemented by the Seurat software with the default parameters.

Following clustering and visualization with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), initial clusters were subjected to inspection and merging based on the similarity of marker genes and a function for measuring phylogenetic identity using BuildClusterTree in Seurat. Identification of cell clusters was performed on the final aligned object guided by marker genes. To identify the marker genes, differential expression analysis was performed by the function FindAllMarkers in Seurat with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differentially expressed genes that were expressed at least in 25% cells within the cluster and with a fold change more than 0.25 (log scale) were considered to be marker genes. tSNE plots and violin plots were generated using Seurat. b.
