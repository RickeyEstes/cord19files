The study was conducted at the quarantine station of Taoyuan International Airport (TPE), which is the largest airport in Taiwan. Before being allowed to enter the border, inbound passengers must self-report any illness to quarantine officers. In the arrival area they pass the quarantine station, which is equipped with non-contact infrared thermometer cameras (Ther-maCAM P20; FLIR, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The quarantine officers calibrate these infrared thermal cameras every day. When passengers walk by, a visual alarm alerts quarantine officers if a camera detects a surface temperature exceeding 36˚C. Suspected febrile passengers are then asked to have their tympanic temperature measured. Passengers with confirmed febrile illness (tympanic temperature �38˚C) complete a standard questionnaire that collects information on demographics, nationality, travel history before entering Taiwan, personal medical history, symptoms/signs, and a contact address and phone number in Taiwan. All information is entered in the database of the National Quarantine Surveillance System of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC). Because this study was for public health surveillance, it was exempt from human subject review and did not require informed consent. For febrile passengers coming from dengue-endemic countries, quarantine officers collect blood specimens to enable testing for dengue infection. All serum samples are sent to the central laboratory of TCDC for analysis by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen rapid test, envelope membrane-specific capture immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A diagnosis of dengue virus infection was confirmed by the finding of at least one of these criteria: NS1 antigen rapid test positivity; recent dengue infection, as indicated by ELISA results (a seroconversion in IgM antibody or a fourfold or greater change in IgG antibody titers in paired serum samples); and RT-PCR positivity for one of four serotypes of dengue viruses. For this study, we first abstracted from the system the numbers of symptomatic passengers and passengers who were tested for dengue infection, to calculate the proportion of denguepositive cases among tested passengers during 2007-2012. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic affected passengers during 2009-2010. After further considering the data completeness and quality, we included all inbound passengers at TPE who were tested for dengue infection in 2011 and excluded those having indeterminate test results. We also abstracted the number of passengers who tested positive and negative for dengue infection in 2011 and calculated the proportion of dengue-positive cases among tested passengers by month. To analyze the predictors of confirmed dengue virus infection among febrile passengers, we collected several key demographic and travel characteristics such as sex, age, purpose of travel, departure country, length of stay in dengue-endemic countries, and self-reported occurrence of mosquito bite within 2 weeks before entry. We asked each symptomatic passenger about having fever/chills, headache, myalgia/bone pain, fatigue, skin rashes, and any of the following upper respiratory symptoms: cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction. We categorized passengers' ages in four groups: 0-19 years, 20-39 years, 40-59 years, and �60 years. We classified the purposes of travel in five categories: group tourism, independent tourism, visiting friends and relatives, business, and other. We classified the lengths of stays in dengue-endemic countries in five categories: �7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-28 days, and �29 days. We categorized tympanic temperatures in two groups: �38.9˚C and �39.0˚C. We used a chi-square test to analyze the difference in variables between febrile passengers who tested positive and negative for dengue virus infection. We conducted univariate logistic regression analysis to generate crude odds ratios (ORs) of each variable with a p value <0. 10 . We further analyzed all these variables with statistical significance by stepwise logistic regression to predict a model of factors associated with dengue virus infection among febrile inbound passengers and generate adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Using stepwise selection, a significance level of 0.10 is required to allow a variable into the model, and a significance level of 0.05 is required for a variable to stay in the model. All tests were two-sided, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
