Virus . The Daniels (DA) strain of TMEV was used for all experiments ." This strain, originally obtained from J . R . Lehrich and associates of the University of Chicago, 35 was grown to 5x 108 plaque-forming units/ml in baby hamster kidney-21 cells . Antibodies . Cells of hybridomas GK1 .5 and 2 .43, both of which synthesize rat antibody of the lgG2b isotype, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection . mAb GK1 .5 and 2 .43 recognize monomorphic determinants on L3T4 (CD4) and Lyt-2 .2 (CD8) molecules, respectively. Hamster mAb 145-2C11 directed against mouse CD3 1 a 36.3' was obtained from J . A. Bluestone (University of Chicago) . mAbs obtained from ascites fluid were used for in vivo therapy and for staining cells in flow cytometry . To prepare ascites fluid, 1 x 10' hybridoma cells were injected into BALB/c mice that had been primed with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane and irradiated sublethally with 5 Gy or into T-cell-deficient BALB/c nude mice . Ascites fluid containing the mAb was purified by affinity chromatography on a mouse anti-rat IgG column (anti-CD4 or CD8 mAbs) or an anti-hamster IgG column (anti-CD3 mAb) . F/ow cytometry. Two hundred microliters of a suspension of washed cells from peripheral blood (5x10'/ml) was incubated on ice for 20 min with an equal volume of a 1/500 dilution of purified ascites fluid (1-2 mg/ml) containing anti-Lyt-2 (CD8) or anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb . After washing, the cells were stained with biotin-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) that did not cross-react with mouse Ig . After incubation on ice for another 30 min, cells were washed twice, stained 15 min with 0.1 ml of streptavidinfluorescein isothiocyanate, conjugated, diluted 1 :500, and analysed by flow cytometry (FACS V; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California) . To evaluate the degree of background staining, lymphocytes were stained by substituting the primary antibody with NrIgG . Animals and experimental protocol. C57BL/1 OSNJ (H-2b) female mice (4 to 6 weeks old) from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) were innoculated intracerebrally with 2 x 105 plaque-forming units of TMEV in 10-pl vehicle . Mice were treated i .p . with 0 .4 mg anti-CD3, 1 or 2 mg anti-CD4 or CD8, 1 mg NrlgG or NhamslgG, either at the time of virus inoculation or 15 days after infection . Animals were monitored daily for presence of paralysis or death until day 7, 10, 14, or 35 of scheduled termination of the experiment . Pathologic Analysis . Mice were perfused with Trump's fixative (phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde containing 1% glutaraldehyde, pH 7 .4) and the spinal cords were processed to provide 2 pm thick glycol methacrylate-embedded sections that were stained with a modified erichrome stain . A detailed morphologic analysis was performed on each of 10 to 15 coronal spinal cord sections from each animal . This resulted in the analysis of 150 to 300 spinal cord sections in each experimental group. A pathologic score based on gray matter inflammation, meningeal inflammation, and demyelination was obtained for each animal as described previously ." Each quadrant of every spinal cord section was graded for the presence or absence of pathologic features . The maximum pathologic score, 100, indicated the presence of inflammation or demyelination or both in every quadrant of all spinal cord sections of one mouse . All data are presented as mean±standard deviation . Brains from perfused animals were removed from the skull, cut into three coronal sections, and embedded in paraffin . The cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex, meninges, and corpus callosum were graded independently on a four-point scale for the presence of inflammation and necrosis (0, no pathologic abnormalities ; 1, minimal inflammation with <25 cells per 40x high-power field (HPF) ; 2, moderate inflammation with 25 to 50 inflammatory cells per HPF ; 3, intense inflammation with >50 inflammatory cells per HPF and early necrosis; and 4, intense inflammation and widespread necrosis of tissue) . The scores from the various areas were added to provide a total brain score (maximum = 28) . Sheep erythrocyte agglutination assay. Serum samples from treated mice were assayed for IgM hemagglutination of SRBCs to determine whether i .p . treatment with mAbs to T-cell subsets suppressed the humoral immune response to an irrelevant antigen . Animals were given 1 x109 SRBCs by i .p . injection 7 days before sacrifice or assay . Sera from these mice were stored at -70°C and assayed at one time for IgM hemagglutination . Multiple serial dilutions of the sera (1 :10 through 1 :10240) were made, and 100 yl of each dilution was placed on 96-well microtiter plates . A 1 :3000 dilution of packed SRBCs (in phosphate-buffered saline-0 .1% albumin) was made, and 50 ul was added to each well . This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then spun for 2 min at 2000 rpm . The agglutination was read to determine the IgM titer . Immunocytochemistry to detect virus antigen . For immunoperoxidase studies, spinal cord tissue blocks stored in 0 .1 M phosphate buffer were rinsed in 0 .1 M Tris buffer with 25 mm hydroxylamine (pH 7 .4), treated with 10% dimethyl sulphoxide in the same buffer for 1 h, and quick-frozen in isopentane chilled in liquid nitrogen . Ten-micrometer cryostat sections were cut and transferred to gelatin-coated glass slides . Frozen sections of spinal cords or deparaffinized brain sections from mice perfused with Trump's fixative were reduced with 1 % sodium borohydride in 0 .1 M Tris buffer with 25 mm hydroxylamine (pH 7 .4) at 4°C and refixed with 95% alcohol-5% glacial acetic acid . Sections were immunostained with a polyclonal antiserum to purified TMEV strain DA virions' by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) . Slides were developed with a solution of Hanker-Yates reagent (p-phenylenediamine-procatechol [Polysciences, Warrington, Pennsylvania]) and counterstained with hematoxylin .
