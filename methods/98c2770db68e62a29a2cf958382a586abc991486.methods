Among the plethora of compounds designed to inhibit infectious viruses, only a few (< 100) have been approved for clinical use (De Clercq, 2004; De Clercq and Li, 2016) . Nevertheless, some effective antiviral drugs have been on the market for several decades, such as the anti-influenza A virus drug amantadine, marketed under the trade name Symmetrel (by Dupont), which was approved in 1966. In 1982, Burroughs-Wellcome introduced acyclovir as an inhibitor of herpesviruses. Its remarkable specificity is connected with its activation by viral thymidine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation. However, due to development of drug resistance in a number of viruses, especially RNA viruses, there is a continuous need to design and test new inhibitors, preferably targeting different steps of viral life cycles. Here, we provide insights into the world of biochemical and cell-based assays that were developed to test antivirotics targeting various steps in the viral life cycle.
