Publicly accessible data on SARS morbidity and mortality were utilized in the study. [2] Case fatality was estimated by dividing the number of reported deaths by the number of probable cases. Air pollution was evaluated by air pollution index (API) provided by the Chinese National Environmental Protection Agency (CNEPA). [7] CNEPA calculated individual pollution indices for five major air pollutants including particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O 3 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The maximal individual pollution index was set as the comprehensive API for the monitoring area. In most of monitoring areas, PM10 was considered as a major pollutant. [7] API could be categorized into seven groups with 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 as the cut-off points. APIs less than 100 were thought healthy for general population. Since the majority of patients were diagnosed during April and May, the average of daily APIs collected within these months in each region was used for data analyses mainly. In addition, to evaluate potential influence of long-term exposure to air pollution on the case fatality rate, the average of APIs between June 2000 and October 2002 before SARS epidemic was also analyzed. Ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation and association between air pollution during April and May 2003 and SARS case fatality. A linear model was fitted to the data among five regions with 100 cases or more. Furthermore, we conducted data analysis by grouping SARS patients into three exposure levels and evaluating short-term exposure (April-May 2003) and long-term exposure (June 2000-October 2002), respectively. The cut-off points were 75 and 100 API. Case fatalities of patients from regions with high APIs (API>100) and patients from regions with moderate APIs (75-100) were compared to that of patients from regions with low APIs (API<75). Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Monotonic trend test with exposure scored as 1, 2, and 3 for each exposure group was also conducted to investigate whether case fatalities increased with the increase of APIs. All data analyses were performed in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS).
