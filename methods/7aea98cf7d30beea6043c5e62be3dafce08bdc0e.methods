Immunofluorescence assay. Mouse IgG binding on the tegumental surface of S. japonicum was detected using an immunofluorescence assay with both intact whole worms and frozen sections. For the whole worms, the assay was based on the standard protocol 51 with several minor modifications. Briefly, the whole worms were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then treatment with proteinase K (2 μ g/ml) for 10 min followed by permeabilized for 2 h with 1% SDS in PBS buffer at room temperature. After permeabilization, the parasites were re-fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde and rinsed in PBSTx buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer) and then incubated in blocking solution (5% horse serum, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBSTx buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. The blocked worms were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+ L) and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin at 4 °C overnight. After washing four times (30 minutes each) in the dark, the samples were mounted in permanent aqueous mounting medium (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK), and the fluorescence was visualized with a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Parasites treated with sodium citrate were assayed as controls. For the frozen sections, the samples were fixed for 5 minutes in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS buffer. We then proceeded to the blocking step using the method described above, and images were obtained with both a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and a laser confocal microscope. For the detection of mouse IgM on the parasite surface, whole worms were treated as described above and then stained with a combination of DAPI and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgM (μ chain). For detection of the binding capabilities of human Igs, freshly isolated whole worms were extensively washed in PBS containing 100 mM sodium citrate to strip off murine Igs from their surfaces. The worms were incubated separately with human IgG, IgM (Sigma, CA, USA) and IgE (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and then treated as described above. The worms were stained with a combination of DAPI and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-human IgG (H+ L), Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-human IgM (μ chain) or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgE (ε chain). All fluorescent antibodies and dyestuffs were purchased from Invitrogen (Oregon, USA). Affinity purification of native S. japonicum proteins with immobilized nonimmune human immunoglobulin G, M and E. Human IgG, IgM and IgE were covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and blocked with Tris-HCl according to the operation manual. Frozen parasite samples were homogenized by grinding in liquid nitrogen, followed by incubation with PBS buffer containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, CA, USA) for 15 min with gentle shaking at 4 °C. Ultrasonic disruption was used for 3 s and then repeated 80 times at 6 s intervals on ice. The mixtures were shaken at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 18,000 r/min for 30 min to remove tissue and cell debris. The protein concentration was quantified using the BCA kit (Thermo, Waltham, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 mg of protein was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in TST buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20, pH7.6) and incubated with 100 μ l IgG-, IgM-or IgE-Sepharose for 4 h with gentle agitation. The beads were washed ten times in large volumes of TST buffer followed by two more washing steps using 1 ml of 5 mM NH 4 Ac (pH5.0). The bound proteins were eluted with 200 μ l elution buffer (0.5 M HAc, adjusted to pH3.4 with NH 4 Ac). The Sepharose resin was used as a control for nonspecific adsorption to the resin. All affinity purification steps were performed at 4 °C.
