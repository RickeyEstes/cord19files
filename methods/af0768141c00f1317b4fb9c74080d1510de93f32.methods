We conducted a series of diverse educational processes across distinct learning environments within our medical center. These were layered over time as an outgrowth of observed patterns of antibiotic prescribing and infection prevention behaviors across the spectrum of our learners. The majority used a quasi-experimental, before-and-after study design with preand postintervention knowledge assessment questions, surveys of learners, or chart review with post-antibiotic prescription audit as methods of evaluation. The Ï‡ 2 analysis was used to measure pre-and postintervention differences (Microsoft Excel). Statistical significance was set at a P value of <.05 where applicable. Montefiore Medical Center Institutional Review Board approval was obtained where appropriate, and remaining studies were registered as quality improvement (QI) initiatives through the Montefiore Network Performance Group. The targeted learner, educational strategy, and method of assessment are detailed below.
