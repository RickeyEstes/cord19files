Let  be the set of 4 bases, i.e., = A C G T { , , , }  and Q = (s 1 , s 2 , ..., s n ) be a DNA sequence of length n, that is, The four bases are categorized into two groups according to three kinds of chemical and physical properties. The A and G bases are purine denoted by the letter R. The C and T bases are pyrimidine represented by Y. In another way of grouping, the A and C nucleotides are amino denoted by M and the G and T are keto denoted by K. According to the H bound, the G and C have strong H bond and they are represented by the letter S. The A and T bases contain weak H bond and they are represented by W. We define three numerical values for each of the letters R, Y, M, K, S and W. To characterize the distribution of R and Y in the sequence Q, we first replace the letters A and G by R and replace the C and T by Y in the sequence Q. Then the sequence only contains two kinds of letters: R and Y. Similarly, for Y we define w Y (⋅):{R, Y} → {0, 1} such that w Y (s i ) = 1 if s i = Y, and 0 otherwise. Then we get three characteristics for Y: n Y , μ Y and D Y 2 . For this kind of classification for nucleotides, six values are used to present the distribution of the four bases with respect to this chemical property. In the same way, we define other triplet for M, K, S, and W. Thus an 18 dimensional vector of the DNA sequence Q is defined by µ µ .   n  D  n  D  ( , ,  , We call this multiple encoding vector because it utilizes three groups of letters to encode the DNA sequence. The construction of this vector is shown in Fig. 7 . Pairwise distance among vectors derived from the new method are computed using Euclidean distance. Then the distance matrix of all biological sequences is constructed. Based on the UPGMA algorithm, the phylogenetic tree of organisms is built using MEGA 6.0 software 37,38 . Data Availability.
