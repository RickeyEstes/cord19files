As described before [21] , an initial prospective, clusterrandomized trial of the effect of mask use on respiratory virus transmission in households was conducted during two successive winter seasons between 2006 and 2007 in Sydney, Australia. The current study was conducted prospectively as an extension of the aforementioned over three consecutive winters between 2006 and 2008 in Sydney, Australia. The setting in which suitable families were identified was a pediatric health service comprising an emergency department of a pediatric hospital. The hospital acts as a specialized tertiary referral hospital for the western metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia, which has a population of 1.5 million people, and 15 local government areas. Over 70,000 sick children and their families are cared for each year in this area [22] . The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital at Westmead.
