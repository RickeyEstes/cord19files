A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to September of 2015. Five main commercial malls in Riyadh were randomly selected. People in the main cities in the KSA visit malls for different purposes, including shopping and entertainment, all year long. Therefore, malls can be considered representative of the Saudi population for purposes such as scientific research. Approval for the project was obtained from the Research Committee, College of Public Health and Health Informatics, King Saud Bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences, and from the Institutional Research Board Committee (IRBC) at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC) (#IRBC/383/15), Riyadh, National Guard Health Affairs at the Ministry of the National Guard. The study included Saudi adults living in Riyadh aged 18 years and older. The study excluded non-Saudi adults or visitors from outside of Riyadh. Proportional quota sampling was used to ensure that the respondents were demographically representative of the general population, with quotas based on age, gender, region and social class. A sample size of 768 was calculated based on an expected 50% proportion of poor knowledge in this population toward MERS-CoV transmission and prevention measures at 80% power with a 95% confidence level and a design effect of two [10] . A two-stage sampling method was employed. The first stage consisted of selecting 5 top malls located in different zones of Riyadh city (north, south, middle, east, and west). Then, a simple random sample of adults shopping in these malls who were willing to participate in the study was interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire. To measure the level of knowledge in both males and females, a 1:1 ratio was purposefully chosen. The enrollment strategy was undertaken to cover all three different work shifts of the malls (morning, afternoon, and night). Of 768 possible participants, 676 individuals of both genders were successfully interviewed (response rate = 88.02%).
