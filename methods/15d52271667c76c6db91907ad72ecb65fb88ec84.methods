We used the WHO-OIE-FAO working group's neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of 2,947 H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) strains to identify those classified in clade 2.2.1.1 [34] . In total, 91 sequences were included in this category. One was not available in GenBank and thus the remaining 90 were downloaded from GenBank in FASTA format. We provided metadata for each sequence and included the year of collection, the type of host, and the location of the host. We identified the metadata by analyzing the strain name of the sequence such as A/chicken/Egypt/1/2008. Since location metadata is essential for phylogeography our inclusion criterion was for each sequence to have a location metadata value at the governorate level. Most of the strain names in our data set only had Egypt, thus we analyzed the country metadata field in each GenBank record for more specific information. In total, 74 (82%) HA sequences had a governorate name in the country metadata field and were included in the final data set. For each governorate name, we identified the latitude and longitude of its centroid location. We used the centroid for each governorate due to the absence of more granular locations such as cities. For governorates with vast surface areas, this creates large uncertainty in regards to the true location. However, our focus was on the diffusion of influenza between governorates and the use of centroid locations enables for a consistent approach. Finally, the most recent date in clade 2.2.1.1 [34] was only 2010, thus we used the Influenza Research Database (IRD) Figure 5 Bayes factor test for non zero rates for the HA gene. The software Spread [45] was used to calculate the Bayes Factor for the migration routes between Egyptian cities. A Bayes Factor cutoff of 6 was used. A darker color indicates a higher Bayes Factor. The route with the highest value was Ash Sharqiyah â†’ Al Gharbiyah with a Bayes Factor of 92.86. The map is a zoom-in of the Delta Region. [35] to downloaded additional HA sequences from 2010-2012 in Egypt. For the HA gene, IRD considers a complete segment to contain at minimum 1,659 sequences. Thus, we specified this minimum segment length and also excluded sequences without a governorate name. This added 152 sequences to the final set for a total of 226. We could not identify a separate tree for the NA strains, thus we included any strains in the HA tree that also had a NA sequence available in GenBank. In total, 37 sequences were downloaded from GenBank. 35 NA sequences (95%) had a governorate name in the metadata field and were included in the final dataset. We again used the IRD to identify additional NA sequences from Egypt from 2010-2012. This added 57 sequences to the final set for a total of 92. However, due to the low total, we did not specify a minimum segment length. Additional files 1 and 2 show maps of the Egyptian governorates with the number of HA and NA sequences (respectively) included in this study.
