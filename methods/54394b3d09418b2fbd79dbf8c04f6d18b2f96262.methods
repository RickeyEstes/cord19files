We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the time-dependent reproduction number from data informing the serial interval and from data on the incidence of cases over time (Fig. 1 ). The first step uses data on known pairs of index and secondary cases to estimate the serial interval distribution; the second step estimates the time-varying reproduction number jointly from incidence data and from the posterior distribution of the serial interval obtained in the first step.
