We used a qualitative study design to examine HCW's perceptions and reported RPE use. We focused on registered nurses (RNs) and nursing assistants (NAs) because they provide frontline care, spend significant time with patients, are frequently exposed to infectious agents, and thus are more likely to require RPE. 1, 16 This design facilitates identifying previously unknown issues from the participants' perspectives. Importantly, whereas some responses may not be "true," the perception of their veracity may still inform behaviors and highlights the use of our qualitative approach. For example, transmission routes described by an HCW may not be biologically plausible, yet this understanding may inform RPE use.
