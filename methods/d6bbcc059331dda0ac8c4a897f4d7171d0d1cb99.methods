After the Ministry of Environment set out to monitor physical and psychological health among HD disaster victims and their family members mainly in cooperation with Asan Medical Center (Seoul), the National Center for Mental Health, affiliated to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, was requested to conduct psychological assessment and counseling support. In May 2016, it was decided that mental health support would be provided to 138 victims and 205 family members, as well as 288 bereaved family members who were confirmed to be suffering from respiratory diseases resulting from HDs. Subjects were assigned to 5 regional National Mental Health Centers corresponding to their areas of residence. The National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) provided psychological support to subjects in Seoul and Gyeonggi province. The aim of the psychological support from NCMH was to screen the high risk group regarding mental health via telephone, and in case of need, refer them to the local mental health centers in communities for psychological treatment. Psychological support was carried out in accordance with the psychological support guidelines which had been shared with Asan Medical Center (Seoul) and 5 regional National Mental Health Centers. Also, trained mental health specialists and psychiatrists in charge of intervention via telephone had been educated about the procedure and the interview process in advance, and all results of the telephone counseling were shared with the psychological support team in the NCMH every day. Based on the same psychological support guidelines, mental health specialists or psychiatrists conducted primary telephone counseling and visited each subject in case of necessity from June to December 2016. A mental health specialist conducted psychological evaluation through open-ended conversations using semi-structured questions (e.g., "Have you experienced insomnia since the event?"). The evaluation interview included previous physical or mental illness, respiratory symptoms, emotional responses (e.g., sadness, depression, anger, anxiety, fear, and guilt), and behavioral responses (e.g., insomnia, avoidance, and isolation). Subjects were informed of the purpose of the counseling as well as the fact that continued counseling would be available if they provided consent. General impressions about psychological distress were rated using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) 15 scale, which has a range of responses from 1 (normal) to 7 (among the most severely ill patients). To determine the need to monitor subjects and make referrals to psychiatric hospitals or local mental health centers, the severity of psychological distress was classified into 4 levels corresponding to CGI-S scores: level 1, "normal" (CGI-S score = 1, not at all ill); level 2, "slightly normal" (CGI-S score between 2 and 3, borderline to mildly ill); level 3, "slightly bad" (CGI-S score between 4 and 5, moderately-markedly ill and possibly in need of medical treatment); and level 4, "very bad" (CGI-S score from 6-7, severely to most extremely ill, in need of support from others and possible hospitalization). Counseling records of 118 people (26 victims, 47 family members of victims, 45 bereaved family members of victims) who cooperatively engaged in the call or counseling services provided by the NCMH were retrospectively analyzed. Family members were divided into 2 groups-bereaved because of HDs and others-to compare psychological responses. HD disaster-related symptoms were compared between 3 groups (victims, the bereaved, other family members) using Ï‡ 2 tests.
