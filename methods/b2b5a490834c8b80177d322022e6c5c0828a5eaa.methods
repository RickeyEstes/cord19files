The human herpesvirus 2 genome (NC 001798) as well as those of the rhinovirus (NC 001490), rubella (NC 001545.1) and Varicella zoster (NC 001348.1) and HERV-W (NP 055405.3: env polyprotein) viruses, Borrelia Burgdorferri (NC 011728) and T. Gondii (NC 001799: Partial genome) were screened against the human proteome using the NCBI BLAST server and the Entrez query filter "schizophrenia". The HERV-W, influenza, HSV-2 and rubella viruses were also screened unfiltered (Translated pathogen genome versus human proteins: BlastX) [31] . The BLAST algorithm detects overall homology between entire gene or protein sequences, and it is necessary to set parameters to low significance levels in order to detect short intraprotein consensus homology. The parameters used were: Expect 20,000, E value = 100,000; matrix PAM30. The original BLAST results are stocked at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/blasts.htm. Information for all abbreviations is available at this site, provided by the NextBio highlighting service. BLAST files were scanned by an online tag cloud generator producing tags sized according to gene word occurrences http://www.tagcloud-generator.com/ generator.php#anker. Word occurrences were counted using a "Highlightall add-in" for Firefox https://addons .mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4240/. Antigenicity (B-cell epitope prediction) was estimated using the BepiPred server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ BepiPred/ [32] (Table 4) . Kegg pathway analysis [33] of 632 schizophrenia susceptibility gene candidates was performed using Kegg mapper http://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/color pathway.html. The results of this analysis are available at http://www .polygenicpathways.co.uk/keggszgenes.htm. Venn diagrams were constructed online at http://www.bioinformatics.org/ gvenn/index.htm [34] . Genes and risk factors with at least one positive association are included in this study. Although certain genes and risk factors are clearly more important than others, and problems of replication in both gene and risk factor studies abound, gene, gene, and gene/environment interactions may explain some of the heterogeneity. For example many schizophrenia-related genes are involved in the life cycle of T. Gondii, but may be irrelevant if this pathogen is not encountered. Similarly T. Gondii infection may have little effect is such gene variants are not present. Pathway analyses of genome wide association data, and previous studies, are showing that the risk-promoting effects of many genes in similar pathways are better predictors of risk, than when treating each gene in isolation (see Section 1). Although some of these factors may be false positives, many genes and risk factors may have a role to play in certain conditions, but the greater import of genes such as DISC1 or neuregulin is recognised.
