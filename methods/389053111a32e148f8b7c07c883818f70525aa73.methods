Sample preparation. Two types of standard uniform particles and three types of bacteria were used in this study. Fluorescence polystyrene latex (FLPSL) particles (F8820; Fluorescent microsphere; 1.0-μ m diameter; orange fluorescent (540/560); Invitrogen) and polystyrene latex (PSL) particles (4010A; Monosized microsphere; 1.0-μ m diameter; refractive index of 1.59; density of 1.06 g/cm 3 ; Duke Scientific Corporation) were used as standard particles for the performance evaluation of particle detection and quantification. As test airborne microorganisms, Gram-negative Escherichia coli (Korean Collection of Type Cultures (KCTC) 1039, Biological Resource Center, Republic of Korea), Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (KCTC 1022), and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), were used 45 . The bacteria were incubated in nutrient broth (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA) at 37 °C, and harvested using a centrifuge (Mini, Gyrozen, South Korea) at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes. Bacterial pellets were washed three times using SDW with a centrifuge to remove the residual medium. To create the bacteria suspensions, 30-mL aliquots were placed in a six-jet collision nebulizer (BGI Corp., USA) to aerosolize the bacteria. Microchannel design and fabrication. The microchannel was a single-layer PDMS channel fabricated using conventional soft lithography. SU-8 (2025; Microchem Corp.), which is a negative photoresist, was spin-coated onto a 4.2-inch Si wafer. The photoresist was soft baked on a hotplate at 65 °C for 5 min, followed by 95 °C for 10 min. A chrome photomask pattern was installed using a UV aligner, and the photoresist was exposed to UV irradiation. Following this exposure, the resist was baked at 65 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 10 min. The SU-8 photoresist pattern was developed using 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate (Microchem Corp.) for 7 min. After completion of the developing process, the pattern was rinsed using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized (DI) water to yield a master mold. PDMS was poured over the developed wafer with the pattern, and cured in an oven at 65°C. The patterned PDMS channel was then removed from the wafer, and bonded onto glass using O 2 plasma to seal the microchannel. Fluorescence microscopy cell counting. To enumerate FLPSL particles and bacterial cells using the fluorescence microscopy method, 10-20 μ L of sample (following enrichment via centrifugation in the case of low particle concentrations) was loaded into the sample injection area of a disposable hemocytometer (DHC-N01; INCYTO, Republic of Korea), and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (B X 51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a U-MWG2 filter set; the excitation wavelength was in the range 510-550 nm, and the emission wavelength was > 590 nm. For each sample, images of at least 16 microscopic fields were captured using a CCD array camera. Microscopy cell counting was carried out using the ImageJ software package (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Colony counting. Bacterial suspensions were serially diluted and spread onto the surface of nutrient agar (Becton Dickinson) in a petri dish, followed by incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. The resulting colonies were counted manually. Scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of airborne bacterial particles was investigated using SEM (Nova Nano SEM 200; FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA). The modified Karnovsky's fixation protocol was used 46, 47 , and bacterial samples were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde (15713; Electron Scientific RepoRts | 5:15983 | DOi: 10.1038/srep15983 Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA, USA) and 2% glutaraldehyde (16020; EMS) in a 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (SCB; pH 7.2) (11652; EMS) at 4°C for 2 hours, followed by washing with 0.05 M SCB at 4°C for 2 hours. Post-fixation, the samples were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide (19152; EMS) in 0.05 M SCB at 4°C for 2 hours, and then washed with distilled water at room temperature. The samples were dehydrated at room temperature in a 30-100% ethanol series with 10-minute exposure to each concentration. The ethanol was then replaced with hexamethyldisilazane (16700; EMS). Following dehydration, each sample was spread onto polycarbonate membrane filters with a pore size of 0.4 μ m (Isopore Membrane Filters HTTP01300; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and coated with osmium by chemical vapor deposition (HPC-1SW; Vacuum Device Inc., Ibaraki, Japan).
