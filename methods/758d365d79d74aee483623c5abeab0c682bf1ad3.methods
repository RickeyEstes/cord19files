Mice. All mice used in this study, including Ceacam1 À / À , Jh À / À , Tcrab À / À , Aid À / À , sIgM À / À , Myd88/Trif À / À , Baffr À / À and Fcgr2b À / À mice, were maintained on the C57BL/6 genetic background (back-crossed at least 8 times and as many as 16 times) and were bred as homozygotes. Vi10/CD45.1 mice expressing VSV-specific BCR as a transgene were used for cell transfer studies, and mice expressing the CD45.1 transgene were used for reconstitution of bone marrow. Sixto eight-week-old, age-and sex-matched mice were used for all the studies. All animals were housed in single ventilated cages. During survival experiments, the health status of the mice was checked twice daily. Animal experiments were authorized by the Nordrhein Westfalen Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (Recklinghausen, Germany), and in accordance with the German law for animal protection or according to institutional guidelines at the Ontario Cancer Institute of the University Health Network and at McGill University. Animals exhibiting severe symptoms of sickness or paralysis or showing substantial weight loss during VSV infection were put to death and were considered dead for statistical analysis. Bone marrow chimeras. For generation of bone marrow chimeras, C57BL/6 mice were irradiated twice for 7 min each with a total of 1,050 rad. After 24 h, mice were reconstituted intravenously with 5 Â 10 6 bone marrow cells from each donor for mixed bone marrow chimeras. Mice were analysed 40-45 days after reconstitution. Virus and plaque assays. VSV, Indiana strain (VSV-IND, Mudd-Summers isolate), was originally obtained from Professor D. Kolakofsky (University of Geneva, Switzerland). Virus was propagated on BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. VSV concentration was determined as described below, and was then plaquepurified on Vero cells 57 Serum was titrated 1:2 over 12 steps and was incubated with 1 Â 10 3 PFU of VSV. After a 90-min incubation at 37°C, the virus-serum mixture was plaqued onto Vero cells. Overlay was added after 1 h, and the mixture was incubated again for 24 h at 37°C. Plaques were counted by crystal violet staining. Antibody titres are presented as two-or threefold dilution steps ( À log 2 and À log 3 ) times the predilution (that is, Â 40). B-cell culture. Spleens retrieved from WT and Ceacam1 À / À mice were homogenized in magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) buffer (1% FCS and 0.8% 0.5 M EDTA). B220 þ B cells were isolated by positive selection with CD45R-conjugated magnetic beads (MACS Miltenyi Biotech). Flow cytometry confirmed that the purity of B220 þ cells was higher than 95%. For proliferation assays, cells were labelled with 5 mM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, and 2 Â 10 5 cells per well were cultured in 96-well flat bottom plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% LPS-free FCS, 1% antibiotics and 0.1% 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. They were then challenged with anti-CEACAM1 (20 mg ml À 1 , clone CC1; a kind gift from Dr Kathryn V. Holmes, University of Colorado, Denver, CO) antibody or recombinant mouse CD40 ligand (1 mg ml À 1 ) in combination with mouse IL-4 (10 ng ml À 1 ; R&D Systems) or LPS (100 ng ml À 1 ; Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h. Similarly, for inhibition experiments, purified B cells (as described above) were cultured in the medium described above with recombinant mouse CD40 ligand (1 mg ml À 1 ) in combination with mouse IL-4 (10 ng ml À 1 ; R&D Systems) and were treated with 10 mM Ibrutinib (Selleck). Control wells were supplemented with equal amounts of DMSO used to dissolve Ibrutinib. Cell death was measured by DAPI (Life Technologies) staining. For survival experiments, B cells were cultured as mentioned above, and cells were stained with Annexin-V (BD Biosciences) followed by DAPI. Proliferation and survival were determined by FACS at indicated time points. For cell signalling experiments, splenocytes were dissociated in VLE-DMEM supplemented with 10% LPS-free FCS and 1% antibiotics and were challenged with anti-CEACAM1 (clone CC1, 20 mg ml À 1 ; K. Holmes) and anti-IgM (10 mg ml À 1 ) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for various time periods at 37°C. Histology. Histologic analyses of snap-frozen tissue were performed with a monoclonal antibody to VSV glycoprotein (Vi10; made in-house). Anti-CD45R (B220; RA3-6B2), anti-CD90.2 (53-2.1), anti-CD19 (1D3), anti-CD1d (1B1) and anti-CEACAM1 (CC1) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from eBioscience. Biotin-anti-CD169/SIGLEC1 (MOMA-1) was purchased from Acris. Sections were washed and stained with streptavidin (eBioscience). In short, sections were fixed with acetone, and nonspecific antigens were blocked in PBS containing 2% FCS for 15 min, followed by various stainings of antibodies, diluted 1:100 in blocking solution for 45 min. Images of stained sections were acquired with a fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE BZ II analyzer). Immunobloting. Spleens were dissociated, and splenocytes were subjected to erythrocyte lysis buffer (MORPHISTO). Next, 10 Â 10 6 cells were challenged with or without anti-CEACAM1 (clone CC1, 20 mg ml À 1 ) antibodies, anti-IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., 10 mg ml À 1 ) antibodies, and LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, 100 ng ml À 1 ) treatment for indicated time points. Cells were lysed with boiling SDS buffer (1.1% SDS, 11% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris; pH 6.8) with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. Total cell extracts were examined by 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto Whatman nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) by standard techniques. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA (PAA Laboratories) in TBS supplemented with 1% Tween-20 and incubated with the following antibodies: antiphospho-Iga (Y182); anti-phospho-Syk/ZAP (Y352/Y319); anti-phospho-p44/42 (p-Erk1/2); anti-phopshpo-p38; anti-phospho-NF-kB p65; anti-Syk; anti-p44/42 (Erk1/ 2), anti-p38; anti-IkBa (all from Cell Signalling Technologies); anti-Iga (Thermo Scientific); and anti-NF-kB p65 (Santa Cruz). The secondary antibodies anti-actin (Cell Signalling Technologies) and anti-GAPDH (Meridian Life Science) were detected by horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-rabit IgG (GE Healthcare) antibodies, or both. Signals were detected with the BIO RAD ChemiDoc imaging system and analysed with the manufacturer's software. Blots were quantified with KODAK MI software. Images have been cropped for presentation purpose. Full-size images are presented in Supplementary Fig. 3 . Immunoprecipitation. Mouse B-lymphocyte H16-L10-4R5 cells were cultured in RPMI 1660 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% antibiotics. 25 Â 10 6 cells were lysed in dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with 1% Triton-X and protease inhibitor cocktail (both from Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated with anti-CEACAM1 antibody (CC1, Novus Biologicals, 5 mg ml À 1 ) overnight at 4°. CEACAM1 was immunoprecipitated with protein G dynabeads (Life technologies). RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from MACS-sorted pure B cells with TRIZOL reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was transcribed with a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative realtime PCR amplification of single genes was performed with SYBR Green quantitative PCR master mix in a Light Cycler 480 (Roche). QuantiTect Primer assays for Bcl-6, Pax-5, Bcl2a1, Xiap, NF-kB, Rel-B, Nfatc1, Nfatc2, c-Jun, c-Fos, Ap1S1 and Blimp-1 (Qiagen) were used for quantification of mRNA expression of the respective genes. The following oligonucleotide primers that detect murine CEA-CAM1 isoforms were used for detection: mouse CEACAM1, a common sense primer that detects both long and short isoform FP-5 0 -GCCATGCAGCCTCTA ACCCACC-3 0 ; and two antisense primers that detect specific isoforms, mouse CEACAM1-L BP-5 0 -CTGGAGGTTGAGGGTTTGTGCTC-3 0 and mouse CEA-CAM1-S BP-5 0 -TCAGAAGGAGCCAGACCCGCC-3 0 . The product was analysed on 3% agarose gels in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For analysis, expression levels of target genes were normalized to NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms7217 ARTICLE glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S r-RNA (Qiagen), or both as an internal control gene (DCt). Gene expression values were then calculated with the DDCt method; the mean of four untreated WT B cells (0 h after sorting) was used as a calibrator to which all other samples were compared. Relative quantities (RQs) were determined with the equation RQ ¼ 2 À DDCt . LCMV-glycoprotein GP1-specific IgG measurements. The detection of LCMVglycoprotein GP-1-specific IgG by ELISA has been previously described 59 . In short, 96-well flat-bottom Nunc Immuno Plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in coating buffer (0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 þ 0.1 M NaHCO 3 ; pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C. On the next day, plates were washed with washing buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and unspecific binding was blocked with 2% FCS in PBS for 2 h. Plates were incubated with LCMV Gp-Fc supernatant (made in-house) for 3 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and titrated with pre-diluted (1: 20) serum over 12 wells with 1: 3 dilutions in successive wells. After a 90-min incubation, plates were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG antibody (Sigma). After a 1-h incubation, plates were developed as described below. ELISA measurements. For detection of VSV-specific anti-IgG and anti-IgM antibodies, 96-well flat-bottom Nunc Immuno Plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with baculovirus VSV-GP 42 in coating buffer 0.1 M NaCO 3 (0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 þ 0.1 M NaHCO 3 ; pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C. On the next day, plates were washed with washing buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and unspecific binding was blocked with 2% FCS in PBS for 1-2 h. Plates were washed once and titrated with prediluted (1:15) serum over 12 wells with 1:3 dilutions in successive wells. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed with washing buffer and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse-IgG (Sigma) or anti-mouse-IgM (Sigma) antibody for 30-60 min. Plates were washed and incubated with 1 Â TMB Substrate solution (eBioscience) in the dark, after which 10% H 2 SO 4 solution was added to stop the colour reaction. Optical density was measured at 450 nm (FLUOstar Omega, BMG LABTECH). Various immunoglobulin isotypes and subtypes were measured in naïve serum of WT and Ceacam1 À / À mice as described 55 . Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Student's t-test was used to detect statistically significant differences between groups. Significant differences between several groups were detected by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni or Dunnett post hoc tests. Survival was compared with log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests. The level of statistical significance was set at Po0.05.
