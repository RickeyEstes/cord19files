A total of 1032 subjects were recruited from Wan Fang Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan. The Institutional Review Board of Human Ethics, Taipei Medical University, approved the study protocols. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. Instrumentation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Digital infrared thermal imaging (DITI) (Spectrum 9000MB Medical Thermal Imaging System; Telesis Technologies Inc., Kaohsiung, Taiwan), thermoguard (Figure 1 ), and ear drum IRT were used to conduct mass screening of subjects who entered the hospital and identify those with fever. The DITI system has two components: a sensor head and a PC imaging workstation. The DITI system can measure between 10°C and 40°C at 60 frames per second. The minimum change in temperature that can be detected is 0.07°C. The DITI system can measure the skin temperature of the face, especially the frontal and the temporal area, to screen febrile patients. 21, 22 In Spectrum 9000MB fever test mode, the alarm sounds when thermographic temperature is > 37.5°C, as expected in a febrile patient. When a subject was found to have thermographic temperature > 37.5°C, the ear drum temperature was measured to confirm whether the patient had a fever (38°C). When the ear drum temperature was ≥ 38°C, the patient was immediately isolated for further examination. The ear drum IRT, thermoguard and DITI screening station was set up away from the entrance of the hospital at distances of 0 m, 5 m, and 10 m. Temperature data at different distances and ambient temperatures were collected on 3 different days.
