Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a freestanding academic medical center that houses dedicated neonatal, pediatric, and cardiac ICUs totaling 119 beds. The remaining 408 beds are distributed amongst the non-ICU floors, including the general medicine and surgical wards, a bone marrow transplant ward, and an inpatient psychiatric unit. During fall 2015, a universal hospitalwide visitor policy allowing families to identify a fixed list of up to 6 nonparent, nonlegal guardian persons as visitors was adopted with the approval of a family advisory group in an effort to standardize practice across the hospital and reduce the potential risk of acquiring community pathogens during hospitalization. Nonsibling child and ill visitor restrictions continued during the winter respiratory viral season. To determine the influence of this policy change on hospital respiratory viral transmission, health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were identified during the preintervention season (December 1, 2014-March 31, 2015) and the postintervention season (December 1, 2015-March 31, 2016). Health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were defined as a positive nasopharyngeal respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction panel (detects respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus), respiratory syncytial virus antigen, or influenza A or B antigen obtained on or after hospital day 5 in a child without a previous positive test either during or in the 30 days preceding his or her hospitalization. Positive tests obtained before hospital day 3 were defined as infections present on admission. Testing obtained between hospital day 3 and 5 were excluded to account for incubating viruses present on admission. Of note, no viral surveillance screening programs exist at CCHMC; all testing performed is at clinicians' discretion guided by clinical symptoms. No additional infection control interventions directed against respiratory pathogen transmission were implemented between the pre-and postintervention seasons. Incidence rates of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections were calculated based on total at-risk patient-days, defined as hospital days on or after hospital day 5. Rates were calculated separately for the ICUs, where existing restrictions were liberalized, and for the non-ICU floors, where new restrictions were placed. Rates were compared using the 2-sample Poisson exact test. Proportions were compared using a 2-tailed Ï‡ 2 or Fisher exact test. All analyses were performed using R version 3.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (http://www.r-project.org).
