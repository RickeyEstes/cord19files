Gene Synthesis and Protein Constructs. CedV (GenBank accession no. NC_025351.1), HeV (GenBank accession no. NC_001906.3), and NiV (GenBank accession no. NC_002728.1) fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoprotein open reading frames (ORFs) were codon-optimized and synthesized (Genscript). DNA plasmids of human ephrin-B1, -B2, and -B3; ephrin-A1, -A2, -A3, -A4, and -A5; and mouse ephrin-A1 full-length ORFs were purchased (Origene). A tetrameric soluble CedV G (sG) was constructed with an immunoglobulin (Ig) κ-leader sequence, S-tag, and tetrameric GCN4 motif at the N terminus of the coding region, replacing the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain elements. CedV sG was produced from a stable-expressing cell line and purified by S-protein agarose affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (8, 35) . All ORFs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1+hygro+CMV (67) ; the expression plasmid encoding human ephrin-B3 has been previously described (68) . Cell Lines and Virus. CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] CCL-61) cells and pgsA-745 (ATCC CRL-2242) cells, a derivative deficient in xylosyltransferase (UDP-D-xylose/serine-1,3-D-xylosyltransferase), referred to as CHO745 in this study, were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in Gibco F-12 Nutrient K (Kaighn's Modification of Ham's F-12) Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% HyClone Cosmic Calf Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. The reverse genetics technique for the production of replication-competent, recombinant CedV was described previously (30) . The rCedV antigenome plasmid was designed based on the sequence available in the GenBank (accession no. NC_025351.1). Coprecipitation Assay. S-tagged CedV sG purified protein was incubated in a 1:2 (microgram) ratio with a panel of soluble Fc-conjugated A-class and B-class ephrins, including human ephrin-A1 Fc (transiently expressed in 293 cells and purified) and mouse ephrin-A1, mouse ephrin-A2, human ephrin-A3, human ephrin-A4, human ephrin-A5, mouse ephrin-B1, mouse ephrin-B2, and human ephrin-B3 (R&D Systems) in the presence of 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer at 4°C overnight. This commercially available panel of soluble ephrins contains those derived from both mouse and human sequences. The key residues in the ephrin G-H loop that insert into the receptor-binding pocket of henipavirus G proteins are conserved between human and mouse orthologs of ephrin-A2, -B2, and -B3. The CedV sG-ephrin ligand complexes were precipitated using 50 μL of a 20% protein G agarose slurry, washed 3 times with RIPA buffer, boiled in 2× NuPage LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and run on a 4 to 12% NuPage Bis-Tris gel. Coprecipitated CedV sG proteins were detected by Western blot using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-S-tag polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). Receptor Interaction Analysis by SPR. The interaction of CedV sG with different ephrins was monitored by SPR using a BIAcore T200 instrument and CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare) using adopted methods (69) . Detailed experimental procedures can be found in SI Appendix, Supplementary Experimental Procedures. Cell-Cell Fusion Assays. The β-galactosidase reporter gene cell-cell fusion assay is well described (70) (71) (72) (73) and was carried out as previously reported for henipavirus glycoproteins (8, 74) . The split-luciferase-based kinetic fusion assay was adapted from a dual-split reporter assay previously described (30, 75) . Detailed experimental procedures can be found in SI Appendix, Supplementary Experimental Procedures. Protein Expression and Purification. All proteins used for structure determination, including ephrin-B1 (UniProt Knowledgebase [UniProtKB] P52795, residues 29 to 170) eprhin-B2 (UniProtKB P52799, residues 27 to 170), and the globular domain of CedV G (GenBank accession no. YP_009094086, residues 193 to 622), were prepared as previously described (18) . Essentially, proteins were expressed in Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen) using the Baculovirus Expression System (Pharmagen). Recombinant protein purification was facilitated by fusion of all expression constructs to a thrombin cleavable Fc region of human IgG. Gel filtration in an SD-200 column (GE Healthcare) was used as the final purification step after Fc-tag removal by thrombin protease. Crystallization and Structure Determination. For complex formation, purified ephrins and CedV G were mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio in 5 mM 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) at pH 7.2 and 150 mM NaCl buffer. Both ephrin-B1 and -B2 form stable complexes with CedV G in the gel-filtration column, and the purified complexes were collected as single peaks after size exclusion chromatography. Crystallization trials were conducted with a "Mosquito" robot (TTL Technology) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 100 nL of protein solution with 100 nL of well solution. Crystals of CedV G only and CedV G in complex with ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2 were grown in wells containing 100 mM 2-(Nmorpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.0) with 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 100 mM Tris 8.5 with 20% PEG 6000, and 100 mM Tris 8.0 with 18% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether (MME), respectively. Well solution supplemented by 25% glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant for flashfreezing the crystals in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction datasets were collected remotely at beamline ID-24 of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). The datasets were processed with HKL2000 (76). Phases were calculated by molecular replacement in Phaser (77), using NiV G or its complex with ephrin-B3 (3D11 and 3D12) as a search model. Model building and refinement were performed by using Coot (78) and Phenix refine (79) . Crystallographic statistics are presented in SI Appendix, Table S1 . The structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under ID codes 6P72, 6P7S, and 6P7Y. Structural Modeling of Ephrin-A1 in Complex with CedV G. Structural modeling was performed by homology modeling in the SWISS-MODEL server with the structure of the CedV G-ephrin-B1 complex. Mutagenesis. Point mutations in the human and mouse ephrin-A1 expression plasmids (T115I and I115T, respectively) were introduced by QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) and verified by sequencing in the vicinity of the mutation. At least 2 independent clones were tested for each mutation. Illustrations. All molecular representations were generated with PyMOL (Delano Scientific LLC). Figures were prepared using GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop. Sequence Alignments. Human and mouse ephrin ligand sequences were analyzed with Clone Manager Suite9 software (Scientific & Educational Software). The henipavirus G proteins were aligned using Clustal Omega (80) .
