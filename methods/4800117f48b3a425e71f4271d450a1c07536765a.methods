Cells. 293T (human kidney epithelial), CV-1 and Vero E6 cells were obtain from ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . All cells were tested negative for mycoplasma in MycoAlert ™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Peptide synthesis. All peptides were produced by standard Fmoc-solid phase methods. The cholesterol moiety was attached to the peptide via chemoselective reaction between the thiol group of an extra cysteine residue, added C-terminally to the sequence, and a bromoacetyl derivative of cholesterol, as previously described 8,24 . Viruses. HPIV3 clinical isolate virus (CI) was obtained from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at New York Presbyterian Hospital and grown in human airway epithelium (HAE) at an air-liquid interface for only one Pseudotyped viruses were generated using VSV-Δ G-RFP, a recombinant VSV derived from the cDNA of VSV Indiana in which the G gene is replaced with the Ds-Red gene (RFP). Pseudotypes with NiV F and G were generated as described previously 8 ß-Gal complementation-based fusion assay. We previously adapted a fusion assay based on alpha complementation of ß-galactosidase (ß-Gal) 27, 28 . In this assay, receptor-bearing cells expressing the omega peptide of ß-Gal are mixed with cells co-expressing envelope glycoproteins and the alpha peptide of ß-Gal, and cell fusion leads to alpha-omega complementation. Fusion is stopped by lysing the cells and, after addition of the substrate ( ® The Tropix Galacto-Star ™ chemiluminescent reporter assay system, Applied Biosystem), fusion is quantified on a Spectramax M5 microplate reader. In the overnight fusion assay, cells expressing both alpha and omega peptides of ß-Gal were co-cultured for up to 20 h. Pseudotyped entry assay mimicking multicycle replication. As described previously 29, 30 , NiVF/G glycoproteins were pseudotyped onto VSV-Δ G-RFP and the resulting pseudotyped viruses were used to infect NiV F/G-expressing cells, at an MOI of 0.125, for simulation of multicycle replication. RFP production at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h was analyzed on a microplate fluorescence reader (Spectramax M5). For detecting RFP expression levels, the wells were read by excitation at 535-nm and emission at 579-nm. For the detection of YFP expression, the wells were read by excitation at 510-nm and emission at 535-nm. For the modified multicycle replication assay, VSV G glycoprotein was pseudotyped onto VSV-Δ G-RFP and the resulting pseudotyped viruses were used to infect viral glycoprotein(s)-expressing cells for a simulation of multicycle replication. For single-cycle infection assays, the VSV-G pseudotype was used at an MOI of 0.125 to infect 293T cells transfected with control plasmid. Assay for triggering of F-mediated fusion using uncleaved HPIV3 F K108G: receptor retention, receptor release, and F retention by peptides. Monolayers of 293T cells were transfected to transiently express the cleavage site mutant HPIV3 F (K108G) and WT HN in the presence of neuraminidase 40 mU/ml, overnight. The next day, cells were washed and incubated with neuraminidase 40 mU/ml and cyclohexamide 1:1000 (100 μ g/μ L), for 1 h, at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed and incubated with 1% RBC suspensions in CO 2 independent medium (Life Technology) at pH 7, for 30 min, at 4 °C. After rinsing to remove unbound RBCs with CO 2 independent medium, 1 μ M of peptide was added, and the plates were placed at 37 °C for 1 h. Zanamivir was added at a final concentration of 2 mM, and the plates were left at 37 °C until the complete release of RBCs in the non-treated samples. Plates were rocked, and the liquid phase was collected in V-bottomed tubes for measurement of released RBCs. The monolayers were incubated at 4 °C with 200 ml of RBC lysis solution (lysis of unfused RBCs with NH 4 Cl removes the RBCs whose membranes have not fused with HN/F-coexpressing cells). The liquid phase was collected in V-bottomed 96-well plates for the measurement of reversibly bound RBCs. The cells then were lysed in 200 μ l 0.2% Triton X-100-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were transferred to flat-bottomed 96-well plates for quantification of the pool of fused RBCs. The amount of RBCs in each of the three compartments described above was determined by the measurement of absorption at 405 nm. Lipids. POPC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), while cholesterol (Chol) was from Sigma. Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. VG peptides contain one tryptophan residue, intrinsically fluorescent, which makes fluorescence spectroscopy methodologies suitable tools to follow these molecules. Membrane dipole potential studies were carried out in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Mulgrave, Australia). Peptide aggregation studies were evaluated in a FLS920 series fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, Livingston, UK). L-Tryptophan, HEPES and NaCl were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The working buffer used throughout the studies was HEPES 10 mM pH 7.4 in NaCl 150 mM 16, 31, 32 . Intrinsic fluorescence measurements of VG peptides and tryptophan (for the sake of comparison) were performed with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a starting emission wavelength of 300 to 450 nm. The excitation spectra of the same species was obtained from 220 to 300 nm, with a fixed emission wavelength of 350 nm. ANS fluorescence emission spectra were obtained from 400 to 600 nm, with an excitation wavelength of 369 nm. Typical spectral bandwidths were 5 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission. Excitation and emission spectra were corrected for wavelength-dependent instrumental factors 33 . Emission was also corrected for successive dilutions, scatter and simultaneous light absorptions of quencher and fluorophore 34 . All fluorescence measurements were performed at approximately 25 °C. Aggregation followed by ANS fluorescence. The effect of peptide concentration on VG, VG-Chol, VG-PEG4-Chol or VG-PEG24-Chol aggregation was followed by ANS fluorescence 35, 36 , with excitation at 369 nm. The intensity of fluorescence emission was collect from 400 to 600 mn. A final ANS concentration of 12.8 μM was used throughout the experiments and titrated with peptides stock solution to yield a final peptide concentration in the range of 0-8 μM. 2 way-ANOVA statistical analysis was applied to distinguish the influence of PEG linkers in peptide aggregation. Scientific RepoRts | 7:43610 | DOI: 10.1038/srep43610 Surface pressure. Changes on the surface pressure of lipid monolayers induced by VG, VG-Chol, VG-PEG4-Chol or VG-PEG24-Chol were measured in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough NIMA ST900 (Coventry, UK), at constant temperature (25 ± 0.5 °C). Briefly, a solution of lipids in chloroform was spread on a Teflon trough of fixed area until it reaches a surface pressure of 23 ± 1 mN/m. The lipid used in this study forms monolayers upon spreading on the air-water interface. Peptide solutions were injected in the subphase and the changes on the surface pressure were followed during the time necessary to reach a constant value. The surface pressure of an air-water interface upon injecting the largest concentration of each peptide used throughout the studies was always below 15 mN/m (data not shown). For this reason, the lowest initial surface pressure of the lipid monolayers before the addition of the peptides to the subphase was above that value. In this condition, the changes in surface pressure observed upon the injection of the peptide can be attributed to an effect of the peptide on the monolayer interfacial tension. The dissociation constant (K d ) was calculated from the adsorption Langmuir isotherm: RBCs were labeled with the membrane dipole potential sensitive probe di-8-ANEPPS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, blood samples were centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min, plasma and buffy-coat were removed, and remaining RBCs were washed twice with HEPES buffer. RBCs at 1% hematocrit were incubated in buffer supplemented with 0.05% (m/v) Pluronic F-127 (Sigma) and di-8-ANEPPS 10 μ M during 1 h 17, 38 . The unbound probe in the labeled cells was washed with Pluronic-free buffer on two centrifugation cycles. VG, VG-cholesterol, VG-PEG4-Chol and VG-PEG24-Chol were incubated with erythrocytes at 0.02% hematocrit, during 1 h, with gentle agitation, before fluorescence measurements. Excitation spectra and the ratio of intensities at the excitation wavelengths 455 and 525 nm (R = I 455 /I 525 ) were obtained with emission set at 670 nm, in order to avoid membrane fluidity-related artifacts 39 . Excitation and emission slits for these measurements were set to 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The variation of R with the peptide concentration was analyzed by a single binding site model 40 with R values normalized for R 0 , the value in the absence of peptide. R min defines the asymptotic minimum value of R and K d is the apparent dissociation constant. Antiviral activity against live HPIV3. Peptide activity against HPIV3 was determined by plaque reduction assays in infected cell monolayers 18 . IC50 of inhibition was calculated using Graph Pad Prism 5 software. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) (n = 3 separated experiments).
