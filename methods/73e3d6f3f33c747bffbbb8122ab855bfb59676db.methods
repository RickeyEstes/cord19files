Experiments were performed by measuring the exhaled air distances and directions during coughing in a high-fidelity HPS (Medical Education Technologies Inc, Sarasota, FL) in a hospital isolation room setting so as to reflect actual hospital environment. The dimension of the isolation room was 4.165.162.6 m and the room ventilation system was set at a pressure of 27.4 Pa and 16 air changes per hour.
