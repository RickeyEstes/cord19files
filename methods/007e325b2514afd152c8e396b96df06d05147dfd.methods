This was a retrospective analysis of data collected during an occupational safety programme for SARS and tuberculosis prevention for nurses working in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. All nurses were fit tested using a PortaCount Plus (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) according to the protocol described in the US regulation, 29 CFR 1910.134. 3 The PortaCount measures the number of ambient dust particles inside and outside the respirator, and calculates a fit factor that is a ratio of the two measurements. The machine runs in two modes; the N99/N100 mode and the N95 mode. In the N99/N100 mode, the device counts all particles sized between 0.02 and 1 mm diameter. In the N95 mode, only particles with a diameter of 0.04 mm are counted. One N100 mask (8233) and two N95 masks (1860s and 9210) (3M, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) were tested. Prior to carrying out each fit test, the nurse was asked to perform a user seal check, and to state whether or not she could detect a leak. The mask was considered to have passed the user seal check if no leak was detected. Following the manufacturer's recommendation, the two N95 masks were tested using the N95 mode, and the N100 mask was tested using the N99/N100 mode. All staff were already familiar with the 1860s and 8233 masks, as they had used them during the epidemic. Most staff had not used the 9210 mask previously. Prior to testing all of the masks, the staff were instructed in their use. One modification was made to the PortaCount. The re-usable tubing supplied by the manufacturer was replaced with 150 cm of disposable PVC tubing of the same internal diameter to minimize any risk of cross-infection. As this tubing was longer than the tubing usually used in the N95 mode, the ambient purge time in this mode was increased to 15 s to compensate for the additional length. This time was found in separate testing to be 5 standard deviations greater than the average time required to purge this length of tubing. To ensure an adequate ambient particle count throughout the testing, the 8026 Particle Generator (TSI Incorporated, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) was used to generate saline particles throughout the testing procedures. The accuracy of the user seal check was scored against the quantitative fit test. Following the NIOSH guidelines, a fit factor of 100 on this test was used as the pass mark for each of the respirators. The number of staff fitting each mask and the difference between the number of males and females were compared using the Chi-squared test (EPI-INFO v6, CDC). A P value !0.05 was considered to be significant.
