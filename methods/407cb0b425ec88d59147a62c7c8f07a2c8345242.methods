This evaluation study used a quasi-experimental design. Participants were recruited through referrals from healthcare and social-work professionals working in hospitals, specialist clinics, and social services. Participants were matched and screened according to selection criteria before being randomized to the CDSMP group (experimental) or the Tai-Chi group (comparison). A comparison group was used for two reasons. First, it was not ethical to delay intervention for those assigned to the control group. Second, we experienced substantial difficulty in recruiting research participants when we explained to them that they may be allocated to a control group without active intervention. We used the Tai-Chi interest class as a comparison group as Tai-Chi is widely accepted in Chinese culture; as a result, the recruitment of participants was improved. However, as we mainly aimed to examine CDSMP in this clinical trial, we tended to use several strategies to limit the potential benefits of Tai-Chi so that it could be used as a comparative intervention. Tai-Chi was taught using an interest group and mass activity format, and the participants were not involved in group discussion or the learning of self-management skills, nor were they encouraged to practice Tai-Chi outside of class. All participants in the comparison group were offered the opportunity to enroll in the CDSMP after completing the clinical trial. Ethics approval of the study was obtained from both The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation.
