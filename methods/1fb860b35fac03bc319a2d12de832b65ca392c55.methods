Protein expression and purification. The coding sequence of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein ectodomain (EMC strain, spike residues 1-1290) was ligated into the pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen) with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain and a hexa-His-strep tap tag to facilitate further purification processes. Briefly, the protein was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, purified by sequentially applying Strep-Tactin and Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) with HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). Fractions containing MERS-CoV S glycoprotein were pooled and concentrated for subsequent biochemical analyses. The sequence encoding MERS-CoV S1 NTD (residues 18-353) with a C-terminal hexa-His tag was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX. FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected with the plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma). After 72 h, the supernatant was collected and the NTD was purified using NTA sepharose (GE Heathcare) and Superdex 200 High Performance column (GE Healthcare) with HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). The sequence encoding the 7D10 V L and V H were separately cloned into the backbone of antibody expression vectors containing the constant regions of human IgG1. The chimeric antibody 7D10-H was expressed in FreeStyle 293-F cells by transient transfection and purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A Sepharose and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified 7D10-H was exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and was digested with papain protease (Sigma) over night at 37°C. The digested antibody was then passed back over Protein A Sepharose to remove the Fc fragment, and the unbound Fab in the flow through was additionally purified using a Superdex 200 High Performance column (GE Healthcare). The gene encoding the 7D10 V L followed by V H with a connecting triple GGGS linker and a C-terminal hexa-His tag was synthesized and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pVRC8400. FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected the plasmid in the presence of PEI (Sigma). The cell-culture supernatant was collected 72 h after the transfection, and the 7D10 scFv was collected and captured on NTA Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The bound 7D10 scFv was eluted with HBS buffer containing 500 mM imidazole and was then further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 High Performance column (GE Healthcare). Complex preparation and crystallization. The MERS-CoV NTD and the scFv fragment of 7D10 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1.2, incubated for 2 h at 4°C and further purified by gel-filtration chromatography. The purified complex concentrated to approximately 10 mg mL −1 in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, Data collection and structure determination. To collect the diffraction data, all crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after being incubated in reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The diffraction images were collected on the BL17U beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility (SSRF) 46 with the wavelength of 0.9796 Å. All images were processed with HKL2000 47 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER from the CCP4 suite 48 . The search models were the MERS-CoV NTD structure (PDB ID: 5vyh) and the structures of the variable domain of the heavy and light chains available in the PDB with the highest sequence identities. Subsequent model building and refinement were performed using COOT and PHENIX, respectively 49, 50 . There are 94% of most favored, 5.3% of allowed and 0.3% of disallowed Ramachandran plot in the final refinement model. All structural figures were generated using PyMOL 51 . Neutralizing assay of pseudotyped MERS-CoV. 293T cells cultured in 100 mm dish were co-transfected with 6 μg of pcDNA3.1-MERS-Spike or its mutants and 24 μg of pNL4-3.luc.RE. The supernatants containing sufficient pseudotyped MERS-CoV were harvested 48-72 h post-transfection. Subsequently, the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) was determined by infection of Huh7 cells. For the neutralization assay, 100 TCID 50 per well of pseudoytped virus were incubated with 16 or 8 serial 1:3 dilutions of purified antibodies, Fabs or scFvs for 1 h at 37°C, after which Huh7 cells (about 1.5 × 10 4 per well) were added. After incubation for 72 h at 37°C, the neutralizing activities of antibodies were determined by the luciferase activity and presented as IC 50 , calculated using the dose-response inhibition function in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.) Cell entry of pseudotyped virus. The concentration of the harvested pseudotyped virions was normalized by p24 ELISA kit (Beijing Quantobio Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) before infecting the target Huh7 cells. The infected Huh7 cells were lysed at 48 h after infection and viral entry efficiency was quantified by comparing the luciferase activity between pseudotyped viruses bearing the mutant-and wildtype MERS-CoV spike glycoproteins. Postattachment neutralization assay. For the postattachment pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, Huh7 cells, upon reaching a density of 1.5 × 10 4 per well in a 96-well plate, were incubated with 100 TCID 50 per well of pseudotyped virus at 4°C for 1 h. After removing the supernatant, 200 μL of PBS was added twice to each well to wash the un-bond pseudotyped viruses. A total of 16 serial 1:3 dilutions of purified antibodies in DMEM (10% FBS) were then added to the Huh 7 cells with attached pseudotyped viruses, as well as DMEM (10% FBS) alone as control. Neutralization activities were determined based on the luciferase activity after incubation for 72 h at 37°C and also presented as IC 50 , calculated using the dose-response inhibition function in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.) Cooperativity of mAbs for neutralization. Synergistic, additive, and antagonistic interaction between 7D10 and MERS-GD27, 7D10, and MERS-27, as well as 7D10 and MERS-4 for virus neutralization were evaluated by the median effect analysis method using CompuSyn software as previously reported 52, 53 . The measured neutralization values were input to the program as fractional effects (FA) ranging between 0.01 and 0.99 for each of the two antibodies and for both in combination. CI values were calculated in relation to FA values. A logarithmic CI value of 0 indicates an additive effect, <0 indicates synergism, and >0 indicates antagonism. Live MERS-CoV neutralization assay. The neutralizing activity of the mAbs against live MERS-CoV was also determined in DPP4-expressing Vero E6 cells. Upon reaching a density of 5 × 10 4 per well in a 12-well plate, cell monolayers were infected with 30-35 plaque-forming units (PFU) of live virus in the presence or absence of the mAb. After three days of incubation at 37°C, the inhibitory capacity of the mAbs was assessed by determining the numbers of plaques compared with the potent MERS-CoV anti-RBD and anti-N9 mAbs. Murine model of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. The MERS-CoV susceptible animal model hDPP4-knockin mouse, which was established by inserting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) into the Rosa26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in global expression of the transgene in a genetically stable mouse line 28 , was used in this experiment. Mice (N = 5) were challenged by intraperitoneal injection (I.P.) with doses of 1.27 × 10 7.5 TCID 50 of pseudotyped MERS-CoV. 7D10-H and MERS-4 were administered I.P. to R26-hDPP4 mice at a dose of 200 μg per mouse prior to challenge with pseudovirus. Mice (N = 4 for the PBS group and N = 3 for the 3C11 group) were also administered PBS or control mAb 3C11 (mAb of anti-NA of H5N1, at a dose of 400 μg per mouse) and challenged using the same I.P. dose of pseudovirus. The IVIS-Lumina II imaging system (Xenogen, Baltimore, MD, USA) was used to detect bioluminescence. Prior to measuring luminescence, the mice were anesthetized using an I.P. injection of sodium pentobarbital (240 mg kg −1 ). The exposure time was 60 s, and fluorescence intensity in regions of interest was analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, Baltimore, MD, USA). Different wavelengths were used for detecting pseudovirus and tdTomato fluorescence. The substrate, D-luciferin (50 mg kg −1 , Xenogen-Caliper Corp., Alameda, CA, USA), was injected I.P. and imaging was conducted 10 min later. The relative intensities of emitted light were represented as colors ranging from red (intense) to blue (weak) and quantitatively presented as photon flux in photons s −1 cm −2 sr −1 . Binding studies using BLI. Binding kinetics of MERS-CoV NTD and its mutants with 7D10 were studied using a FortéBio Octet HTX instrument. Assays with agitation set to 1000 rpm in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 were performed at 25°C in solid black tilted-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). 7D10 (20 μg mL −1 ) was used to load anti-human IgG Fc capture probes for 300 s to capture levels of 0.5-1 nm. Biosensor tips were then equilibrated for 300 s in HBS buffer supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 prior to binding assessment with different concentrations of wild-type or mutant MERS-CoV NTD for 120 s, followed by dissociation for 240 s. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using Octet software, version 9.0. Binding competition assays by SPR. Real-time binding and analysis by SPR were conducted on a BIAcore T200 instrument with CM5 chips (GE Healthcare) at room temperature. For all the analyses, HBS buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 was used, and all proteins were exchanged to the same buffer. The blank channel of the chip was used as the negative control. DPP4 (20 μg mL −1 ) was immobilized on the chip at about 100 response units. Soluble MERS-CoV spike trimer (S) at the same gradient in the present or absence of the concentration gradient of IgGs, Fabs, or scFvs was flowed over the chip surface. After each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated with 7.5 mM NaOH. Data were analyzed using the BIAcore T200 evaluation software by fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. FACS analysis of cell-surface staining. The binding between recombinant soluble MERS-CoV spike trimer (S) and human DPP4 expressed on the surface of Huh7 cells was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). All cellsurface staining experiments were performed at room temperature. Soluble MERS-CoV spike trimer (S) with strep-tag (1 μg) was incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in advance at molar ratios of 1:1, 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27 for 1 h. Huh7 cells were trypsinized and then incubated with S or S and mAbs mixtures for 1 h. After washing the un-bound S with PBS 3 times, the Huh7 cells were then stained with streptavidin APC (BD eBioscience) for another 45 min. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS 5 times and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS Aria III machine (BD eBiosciences). Western blots. Totally, 10 μL pseudotyped MERS-CoV was thawed and mixed with 2 μg of antibodies (IgG, Fab or scFv) for 1 h. The virus alone or the mixture was incubated with 20 μL of Huh7 cell suspension for another 1 h at 37°C. An equal volume of buffer and proteinase-K (final concentration of 10 μg mL −1 ; Thermo_Fisher) was then added and incubated 1 h at 4°C. For the soluble S, 1 μg of the S trimer was incubated with 3 μg of the DPP4 ectodomain or 3 μg of 7D10 Fab for 1 h on ice. Trypsin (final concentration of 5 μg mL −1 ; Thermo_-Fisher) was then added to these samples and incubated 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently, the samples were supplemented with 10 μg mL −1 proteinase-K and incubated 30 min at 4°C. 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was then added to all samples prior to boiling at 100°C. Samples were run on a 4-12% gradient Tris-MOPS-Gel (GenScript) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. An anti-S2 MERS-CoV S polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; Thermo_Fisher; Cat#PA5-81788) and an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; HuaxingBio; Cat#HX2027) were used for Western blotting. AI600 was used to develop images. Reporting summary. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
