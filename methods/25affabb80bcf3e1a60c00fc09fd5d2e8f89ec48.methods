In the Netherlands, patients that consult the GPs with symptoms of ILI are reported on a weekly basis to the Continuous Morbidity Registration Sentinel General Practice Network (further referred to as sentinel GP registry), covering 0.8% of the Dutch population being nationally representative by age, gender, regional distribution, and population density [4] . The sentinel GP data consists of the weekly number of patients presenting with ILI at the GP. In 2009, the registry had 42 participating GP practices with 59 GPs covering a population of approximately 130,000 patients [4] . ILI was defined according to the criteria of Pel [5] , by (1) acute onset, with prodromal stadium of three to four days, (2) a temperature increase to at least 38 degrees Celsius, and (3) at least one of the following symptoms: cough, nasal congestion, raw throat, frontal headache, retrosternal pain, and body aches. Incidence of ILI is calculated on a weekly basis, using number of patients registered at the reporting GP practices as the denominator. This is acceptable as almost every person in the Netherlands is registered with a GP. In the Netherlands, an influenza epidemic is defined as more than 5.1 patients with ILI per 10,000 inhabitants per week consulting the GP for at least two consecutive weeks [6] , combined with influenza A virus isolation from laboratory samples. Data quality is assured by training of GPs for data entry, and a pop-up appearing in the system when an ILI diagnosis is entered reminding the GP to register the ILI case in the sentinel GP registry. The NICE registry was founded in 1996, with initially six participating ICUs. In 2003 this number had grown to 33 and in 2011 85 ICUs participated covering approximately 90% of the Dutch adult ICUs. For each admission, among other items, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) [7] reason for ICU admission diagnosis is registered and sent to the NICE registry on a monthly basis. Upon receipt, the data is usually entered into the NICE registry database and available for participants within one day. There is currently no distinct variable describing whether an ICU patient has influenza like illness or was diagnosed with an influenza virus infection, or receives antiviral drugs. Therefore, we defined an ICU admission with a possible SARI (further referred to as ICU admission with respiratory infection) when the following four criteria were met: (1) the patient was admitted to the hospital less than two days before ICU admission, (2) there was a medical (non-surgical) reason for admittance, (3) the ICU admission was not a readmission to the ICU within the hospitalized period, and (4) the APACHE II reason for admission was 'Respiratory Infection. We used the percentage of ICU admissions with a respiratory infection (relative to the total number of medical ICU admissions), instead of the absolute number of ICU admissions to adjust for the growing number of NICE registry participants throughout the study period. Thus our study dataset included study year, week number, number of patients with ILI, population size of reporting GPs, number of ICU admissions with respiratory infection, and number of medical ICU admissions. Data quality is assured by regular on site visits of the ICUs [8] . In this study, we used weekly time series of patients presenting with ILI from the sentinel GP registry and ICU admissions of respiratory nature from the NICE registry. In the NICE registry, few ICUs were participating in the years 2000 until 2002, leading to large variations in the percentage of ICU admissions with respiratory infections. Therefore, from both registries, we used data from 2003 through 2011. As influenza generally occurs between week 40 and week 20 of the subsequent year [9] , we defined an influenza year (i.e. season) from July 1st until June 30th the next year, thereby having ten influenza years in our dataset.
