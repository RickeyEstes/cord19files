More than 80,000 patients per year present to the emergency department of the National University Hospital; these patients are triaged to three treatment areas: critical care and intermediate care, which are located in a common area with curtains separating the gurneys; and ambulatory care, which has examination rooms and an open waiting area. At the hospital entrance, there are prominent signs highlighting the features of SARS, including fever and respiratory symptoms. Since March 17, all patients have to answer a screening questionnaire, and those meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SARS (7) are transferred immediately to the national SARS hospital by a dedicated ambulance. Screening involves use of thermal scanners, and a national online database is used to check for contact with previous and current SARS patients. Since March 27, all staff have routinely used personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators and water-impermeable gowns and gloves. Caps, shoe covers, and eye protection gear were introduced during the peak of the epidemic (the second week of April), but are now optional, except for eye protection during high-risk procedures. The records of 13 patients with a final diagnosis of SARS who were managed in our emergency department from March 18 until April 22, 2003, were reviewed retrospectively. The study was approved by the hospital's Institutional Review Board.
