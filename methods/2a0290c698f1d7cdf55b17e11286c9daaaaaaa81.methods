General characteristics, outbreak sites, and source of exposure of patients diagnosed with MERS The timeline from the first confirmed MERS case in South Korea, and the first death to the latest death is outlined in Figure 1 . Data were analysed based on the South Korean Government's MERS information portal, and policy briefings officially managed by MOHW and KCDC. 11, 12 The official daily briefing reports included patient serial number, day of diagnosis, infection route, sex, age and hospital. The sex and age of all 186 South Korean cases were determined. Outbreaks were defined as occurring in hospital, within the family or in the community. Sources of exposure were divided into three groups: healthcare professionals [doctors, nurses, medical technicians (e.g. radiologists) and medical transport staff]; infections contracted in hospitals by inpatients or outpatients; and infections acquired through visiting hospitalized patients or familial care-giving.
