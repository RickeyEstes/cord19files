For this study, a qualitative research design involving individual, in-depth semistructured interviews was adopted. A total of 40 participants were recruited from and interviewed at one private-practice primary health care clinic during the peak season of influenza A (H3N2) in January 2015 in Hong Kong through purposive sampling. A phenomenological approach was adopted for data analysis.
