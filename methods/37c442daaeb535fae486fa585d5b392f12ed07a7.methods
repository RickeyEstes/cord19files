A wide range of both target and signal amplification nucleic acid amplification methods could be applied to respiratory virus detection. Any target amplification method has the advantage of sensitivity above signal amplification but the latter may be simpler and less laborious for high specimen throughput. This review focuses on methods where detailed publications using either "in house" or commerciallyavailable assays for respiratory virus nucleic acid detection are available.
