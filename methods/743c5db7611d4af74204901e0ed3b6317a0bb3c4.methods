We performed a cross-sectional survey in the Singapore military from mid-August 2009 to early-October 2009, after the peak of the local epidemic which occurred during the first week of August in Singapore [15] . The Singapore military comprises of conscript males who serve compulsory military service after high school, and nonconscript regular servicemen. Most servicemen stay in camp during weekdays and return to the community/ home during weekends, resulting in interactions within the military and general communities. As part of the military's pandemic response plan, every serviceman was given an information pamphlet on pandemic influenza, with information about the virus and preventive measures that could be taken to reduce risk of transmission and infection. The servicemen were also briefed on the above with emphasis on personal hygiene measures and socially responsible behavior (for example covering the nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing). Other measures implemented include daily temperature monitoring, prompt reporting of all illnesses to healthcare staff, and laboratory testing of influenza-like illness clusters. Laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1-2009 were isolated at home for 7 days, while close contacts of these confirmed cases were allowed to continue working but were given post-exposure chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir and were segregated from the rest of the military units to prevent spread. In addition, all healthcare workers were required to don personal protective equipment including N-95 masks during their working hours. Our study population consisted of 4 distinct exposure groups of military personnel -laboratory confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, close contacts of H1N1-2009 cases (defined as those who had worked or lived with a laboratory confirmed H1N1-2009 case during the infectious period), healthcare workers, and other general servicemen. The military maintained a comprehensive list of all laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1-2009 and their close contacts, which were identified via contact tracing. An anonymous self-administered paper questionnaire was mailed to the respective servicemen with a self addressed envelope included for return of the survey forms. Questionnaires were sent to all laboratory confirmed cases and their contacts, all healthcare workers in the military and general servicemen from various representative units in the military. Approval for the study was obtained from the military's research committee.
