We conducted a semi-systematic review of the biomedical literature between 2012 and 2014 in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines [3] . Our review is based on the work conducted by the AMIA PHI and GHI working groups to present a 'Year in Review.' Given that our review focuses on a synthesis of multiple mini-reviews performed by the working groups and the heterogeneity of the selected articles, we neither assessed the quality of studies nor aggregated study results, thereby classifying our study as a semi-systematic review instead of a comprehensive systematic review or meta-analysis.
