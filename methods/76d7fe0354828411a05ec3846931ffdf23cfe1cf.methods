Protein expression and crystallization. Briefly, 1A-S310-677aa and other HKU1 S proteins containing an N-terminal hemo signal peptide and a C-terminal 6His tag were expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen). The proteins were purified from the cell supernatantusing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200High Performance column (GE Healthcare). The purified HKU1-S1protein was concentrated to 6 mg ml À 1 and stored in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH8.0) and 100 mM NaCl. Crystallization of 1A-S310-677aa was achieved at 22°C using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method with 0.8 ml of protein and 0.8 ml reservoir buffer containing 0.2 M MgCl 2 , 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and 0.1 M Tris (pH8.5). The crystals were harvested in reservoir buffer with 8.8% (W/V) pentaerythritol ethoxylate (3/4 EO/OH) and 20% sucrose and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure determination and refinement. To determine the crystal structure of HKU1 1A-S310-677aa, different techniques, including molecular replacement, selenomethionine derivative and heavy atom soaking techniques, were used to solve the phase problem of 1A-S310-677aa, but attempts were unsuccessful. However, 1A-S310-677aa was cysteine-rich and contained 24 cysteines. Its Bijvoet ratio is approximately 1.77% at 5.96 keV, making the 1A-S310-677aa crystal a suitable candidate for native SAD phasing. The diffraction data collection and structure determination using the native SAD method have been described elsewhere 34 . Briefly, all diffraction data were collected at the macromolecular crystallography super-bending magnet beamline X06DA (PXIII) at the Swiss Light Source at an X-ray energy of 6 keV (2.0663 Å wavelength) using the Pilatus 2M-F detector. Sixteen datasets were collected from two isomorphous crystals at a size of 90 Â 50 Â 20 mm 3 . Each dataset consisted of 1,800 images collected with 60% transmission (flux of B0.9 Â 10 10 photons per second), and all diffraction data were indexed and integrated using XDS software 36 . Scaling was performed with XSCALE. The data quality was assessed using PHENIX.XTRIAGE 37 . The substructures were determined using SHELXD in 1,000 trials with a cutoff of 3.2 Å. Phasing was performed using SHELXE with combined chain tracing and density modification. From experimentally phased maps, initial models were built with BUCCANEER and PHENIX.AUTOBUILD 37 , and refined by manual model building with COOT 38 . The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to B3.1 Å and the overall resolution was better than 2.3 Å (CC1/2 of highest resolution shell: 89.4%). Final models were obtained using datasets collected at higher energy (1.00 Å) with a resolution at 1.9 Å and by molecular replacement using the initial model generated from the native SAD datasets. ELISA. To coat the plate, 0.5 mg of purified proteins were added into each well of Immulon 2HB plates (Thermo, Rochester, NY, USA) and incubated for overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with washing buffer (PBST, PBS þ 0.05% Tween 20), the wells were blocked with blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). After washing three times with PBST, fourfold serially diluted antibodies in blocking buffer were added into each well and incubated at RT for 1 h. The mAb bound to the truncated S proteins was detected using an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Cat# 115-035-166, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) at a dilution of 1:5,000. After 1 h incubation and washing three times with PBST, 100 ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, Beijing, China) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min. The reaction was then stopped by addition of 2 M sulfuric acid, and the optical density at 492 nm was measured using a MultiSkan MK3 plate reader (Thermo, Rochester, NY, USA). Blockade of HKU1 virus entry by soluble HKU1 S proteins. Prior to virus infection, apical surface of differentiated HTBE cells were washed twice with DMEM þ 1% BSA and incubated with various amounts of soluble, truncated HKU1 S proteins for 1 h at 37°C. After removal of the soluble S protein, cells were then inoculated with 150 ml of passage three of the amplified HKU1 (#21) virus diluted with an equal volume of each HKU1 S protein onto the apical surface for 4 h. After washing three times with DMEM þ 1%BSA to remove unbound viruses, cells were incubated at 34°C. HKU1 viruses were harvested by washing once with 150 ml of DMEM þ 1%BSA at 24 and 48 h post inoculation, and cells were fixed at 48 h post-inoculation and assayed for infection by immunofluorescence using a rabbit 1814 polyclonal antibody to HKU1 S protein and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cat# 111-095-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Real time PCR. Viral RNAs were extracted from 140 ml of virus-containing apical wash using a QIAamp viral mini kit from Qiagen, according to manufacturer's protocol, and real-time PCR was performed using RNA Ultrasense One-Step qRT-PCR from Invitrogen targeting the N gene of HKU1. About 10 ml of viral RNA extract was mixed with 10 ml of master mix containing 2.3 ml of H 2 O, 1 ml of enzyme, 4 ml of 5 Â buffer, 0.2 ml of 10mM probe (5 0 -TTGAAGGCTCAGGAAGGTCTGC TTCTAA-3 0 ), 1 ml of 10 mM primer HKU1qPCR-F (5 0 -CTGGTACGATTTTGC CTCAA-3 0 ), 1 ml of 10 mM primer HKU1qPCR-R (5 0 -ATTATTGGGTCCACG TGATTG-3 0 ), and 0.5 ml of MgSO 4 . Following an incubation at 42°C for 5 min and a denaturation step of 5 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of amplification were performed for 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C on a Roche Light Cycler 480 machine. A serially diluted synthetic DNA fragment containing the sequence from 28,849 to 28,949 of the HKU1 genome was used as the quantitative standard to calculate the viral genome copy number in the samples for real-time PCR.
