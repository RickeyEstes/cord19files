This is a retrospective study which focuses on fall injury-related AED attendances among children and adolescents aged 0-19. All injury-related AED attendance data of children and adolescents covering the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2012 were retrieved from the database of Hospital Authority (HA). HA is the official governing body of all public hospitals in Hong Kong, which covers the majority of 24-hour AED service in the territory. The HA database adopts the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) system for diagnosis, 19 which reflects the types of the injuries of the patients. E-codes were required to identify any external causes of attendance admissions. Records that met the following criteria were included in this study: (1) aged 0-19, (2) had a diagnosis of fallrelated injury (ICD-9 fall-related external cause code E880-E888) and (3) with a principal diagnostic code, except complications of medical care (ICD-9 codes 996-999). If the AED patient was subsequently hospitalised due to the same episode of injury, their corresponding inpatient records were also retrieved and matched. Inpatient diagnosis, if available, was used preferentially over AED diagnosis. The trauma types were stratified into fracture (ICD-9 codes 800-829) and non-fracture injury (ICD-9 codes beyond 829, excluding 996-999). In general, X-ray is used for all fracture diagnosis in the AED treatment in Hong Kong. The confirmed fracture locations of the patients were then recorded in terms of ICD-9 codes into the HA database. To understand the mechanisms of the injury types, fracture and non-fracture injuries were further divided into subcategories representing different body regions. For instance, based on ICD-9 codes, the fall-related fractures have been grouped into the fracture of hip (820), fracture of femur (821), upper extremity fractures (fractures of shoulder/upper arm (810-812), forearm/elbow (813), wrist/hand (814-817)), lower extremity fractures (fracture of lower leg/knee (822-823), ankle/foot (824-826)) and central fractures (fractures of skull/face (800-804), neck/trunk (805-809)). Similar but a more complicated coding (see online supplementary appendix I) in non-fracture group also allowed us to break it down into hip/thigh, upper extremity (shoulder/upper arm, forearm/elbow and wrist/hand), lower extremity (lower leg/knee and ankle/foot), head, neck/trunk, abdomen/lower back and others. In addition to the detailed descriptions of the injury episode, the HA databases also provide basic demographic information including age, gender, as well as the LOS during the subsequent hospitalisation. This information can act as a proxy for the injury severity. Stratified by the nature of the injury, the average LOS of an individual from fracture group can be compared with that from non-fracture group. Midyear sex-specific population data of each of the 12 years were obtained through Demographic Statistics Section of Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to compute the attendance rate of fall-related injury.
