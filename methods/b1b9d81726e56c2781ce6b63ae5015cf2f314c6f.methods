The outbreaks of COVID-19 occured around the Chinese Spring Festival, when a huge number of populatin flows in and out the origin outbreak area, Wuhan, which resulted in that the epidemic was severe in mainland of China and worldwide. The policy of traffic blockage was executed since Janurary 23 rd , 2020, after then the chance of cross-infection decreased sharply. Here we make the following assumptions regrading to the status quo of the epidemic and the SARS empirical parameters. A1: The outbreak of COVID-19 started on the beginning of Dec., 2019. A2: The flows in domestic provinces are concluded, the abroad flow-in is not considered. A3: Only the susceptible with no clinical symptoms can flow in and out, the exposed and infections will be quarantined. A4: There is no super spreaders, in other words, the chance of infected was equal to those who are contact with the infections. A5: The COVID-19 has weak seasonality in its transmission, unlike influenza. A6: The recovery rate is time-dependent and will linearly increase. .

A8: Most people will follow the official instructions and stay at home after the traffic blockage. We denote S, E, I, R,F in the flow-SEIR model [10] and the parameters as shown in Table 1 . In addition, we introduce the traffic blockage factor τ , and the quarantine factor ε , which stands for the quantifications of traffic blockage and quarantine, respectively. Since the people was urged to stay at home, this self-protection is also regarded as quarantine.
