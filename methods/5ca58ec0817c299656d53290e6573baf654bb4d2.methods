Vesicle swabs were taken from the skin of the patient and the nurse during the time of their chickenpox rash. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from vesicle swabs was extracted using QIAmp w DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Ltd, Crowley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viruses were genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and R1 published methods. 1 Initially, a total of 13 SNPs were used to determine the genotype (A-C). Then a DNA fragment, comprising VZV R1 variable region, was amplified and directly sequenced in a GeneAmp 2700 polymerase chain reaction machine. Viral DNA sequences were analysed using BioEdit v 7.0.1 and Chromas2 software. To test the hypothesis of airborne transmission experimentally, a water tank was built with food dye to simulate infectious aerosols in an isolation room. This tank was constructed to simulate the flow of air across a full-size doorway, with an inward-opening door, by using water to simulate air in a scaled-down model using the principle of Reynolds number equivalence, where water can be used to simulate air (the Reynolds number is a dimensionless number equal to the ratio of inertial to viscous forces where fluids, i.e. gases or liquids, are in motion). 2 The motions of the door and food shows how the dye has moved (long arrow) when the door (short arrow) has stopped opening (tZ0.7 s). Transport of the dye into the adjacent room is shown in (c) (tZ2.5 s). dye were captured on video camera with a time scale (Figure 1 ).
