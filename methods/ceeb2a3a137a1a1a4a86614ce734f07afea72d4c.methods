The clinic data from the EPAC database and patients' records from Powerchart between January 2006 and December 2015 (years 1-10) were reviewed. The number of women assessed, the sources of referral, the reasons for referral, the final diagnoses, and the treatments provided at the clinic were analyzed. The total number of ER visits per year, the number of initial consultations, and repeat assessments within 30 days for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy were obtained from the health records department. The ER data were obtained between January 2004 (year âˆ’1) to December 2005 (year 0) before and just after the opening of EPAC (pre-EPAC) and between January 2006 and December 2015 (years 1-10) after the opening of EPAC (post-EPAC). The classification of these selected pregnancy-related complications determined on the basis of ICD 10 classification: abortion/miscarriage (codes 002 and 003), early pregnancy hemorrhage (code 020), and ectopic pregnancy (code 000). The code 020 for early pregnancy hemorrhage includes threatened abortion and other hemorrhage in early pregnancy.
