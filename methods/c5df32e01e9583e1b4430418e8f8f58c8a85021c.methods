Peripheral blood and genomic DNA extraction. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 100 unrelated Chinese volunteers using EDTA-coated tubes at the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital (Xi'an, China) with informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the National Engineering Research Center for Miniaturized Detection Systems, Xi'an, China. All methods were performed in accordance with these approved guidelines. The genomic DNA from the volunteer was isolated from 200 μ L of blood using a Whole Blood Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Xi'an GoldMag Nanobiotech Co., Ltd., Xi'an, Shaanxi, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final DNA quality and concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop 2000c/2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer design and synthesis. For each SNP, six primers for RT-LAMP were designed, including two outer primers (common primers, F3 and B3) and four inner primers (specific primers, FIP-G, FIP-A, BIP-G and BIP-A) that recognize distinct regions of the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles (rs4244285 and rs4986893). Conventional PCR primers were designed based on the principle of AS-PCR using the Primer 5.0 software program (Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK). All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Biotechnology Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Plasmids for CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3. Plasmids 19-2GG, 19-2AA, 19-3GG and 19-3AA, which contain the CYP2C19*2 G681G, CYP2C19*2 A681A, CYP2C19*3 G636G, and CYP2C19*3 A636A genes, respectively, were constructed using the pMD TM Optimization of RT-LAMP reaction. The initial condition of the RT-LAMP reaction was adopted from Zhang et al. 39 . The LAMP reaction mixtures were incubated for 45 min at 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, or 65 °C to determine RT-LAMP Conventional PCR (n = 100) Total Sequencing (n = 100) Total Agreement (%) Frequency (%) *1/*1 *2/*2 *3/*3 *1/*2 *1/*3 *2/*3 *1/*1 *2/*2 *3/*3 *1/*2 *1/*3 *2/*3 Table 2 .
