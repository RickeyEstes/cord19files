We (2) they were characterized by intensity of communication activities and media attention that accompanied the emergence of cases and/or the ensued public health response; (3) each phase roughly resembled the curve of an epidemic lifecycle (pre epidemic, epidemic, and post epidemic); and (4) each phase contained new breakthroughs or significant events that caused a remarkable turn in the course of the epidemic. Our description is based on (1) data obtained from government documents and the reporting of other MERS-CoV outbreak major events by regional and international agencies and (2) stories related to MERS-CoV published in the local print media, namely in Al-Raya Newspaper. Al-Raya was chosen because it was leading among the prime media outlets used by the SCH to publish updates on the epidemic and it was the source of media that massively covered the development of the epidemic (a total of 134 news stories were identified as follows: 108 news articles, 19 press releases, three press conferences reports, and two interviews). In Qatar, narratives across the local newspapers are largely the same, particularly in publishing official press releases. Al-Raya newspaper was leading daily in terms of readership compared to the other four Arabic dailies in Qatar based on circulation statistics. As such, we believe that in Qatar, Al-Raya newspaper can be fairly reflective of the mainstream media. However, we acknowledge that there is a limitation in assessing only one source of print media and remark that this study does not intend to report a comprehensive media content analysis that exhausts all types of media. An electronic search was run for the word "corona" in the online archive of Al-Raya Newspaper to retrieve all of the relevant news stories. The extraction of news articles was performed by four research team members who independently reviewed each article and performed a content analysis of the selected news stories, comparing results, and discussing disagreements. These stories were then compiled and matched with the SCH's press releases, records of activities performed by the national response authorities, and public reactions, in addition to the "rumors" detected by the Governmental Health Communication Centre within the Supreme Council of Health (SCH), in Qatar through monitoring of MERS related news.
