Ethics statement. Fish were maintained in Aquainnovo facilities in recirculating water at 15 °C under a photoperiod of 12:12 (light:dark) and fed a maintenance diet of commercial pellets once a day. Water quality indicators, such as dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrite, and ammonia, were analyzed periodically, and the measured values were acceptable considering the particular requirements of this species. All animal procedures were carried out under the guidelines of "International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals" of European Union Council (2010/63/EU) and fulfilling the statements of the Animal Welfare Protocol (AWP) from Aquainnovo. All experimental protocols were approved by the ethical committee of the University of Concepción. Biological samples and high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. From a recent study by our group, Illumina sequencing data for S. salar challenged with ISAV were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (Acc. No. SRX658605; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) 26, 37 . Briefly, transcriptome sequencing was conducted in Atlantic salmon (S. salar) challenged by cohabitation with the ISA virus. The gills, head-kidney, and liver were sampled from S. salar prior to the challenge (day 0) and after the first evidences of ISA outbreak at 19, 23, and 30 days post-challenge (DPC) (Fig. 1) . From 30 mg of each tissue, total RNA was isolated using the RiboPure ™ Kit (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and purity were estimated using the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA), while the RNA integrity number was evaluated with a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, USA) using R6K screen tape. Samples with RNA integrity number values above eight and with a 260/280 ratio equal to 1.8 were used for library construction. The Scientific RepoRts | 6:22698 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22698 cDNA libraries were constructed with RNA isolated from each tissue at the different sample times and sequenced in the MiSeq Sequencing Platform (Illumina, USA) in six different runs. De novo assembly. Sequencing data analysis was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench software (CLC bio, Denmark). Raw reads were filtered by quality and adapter/index trimmed. CLC bio's de novo assembly algorithm was used to create a contig list from previously filtered reads using a mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3, deletion cost = 3, length fraction = 0.8, similarity fraction = 0.8, and a minimum contig length = 250. Finally, contigs were adjusted by mapped reads, and end gaps were treated as mismatches. Identifying putative long non-coding transcripts relies on removing those sequences that could encode for a protein. For this, different filters were systematically applied for the identification of lncRNAs (Fig. 1) . Expression values were estimated as reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) and then normalized to the total number of assembled contigs, using state numbers in reads per 1000000. Contig annotation and coverage filter. Contig annotations were performed based on protein similarity. For this, nucleotide sequences were translated to protein sequences and blasted against the non-redundant BLASTx protein database using a word size = 3, gap cost existence = 11, extension = 1, and a BLOSUM62 matrix. A strict E value of 1 × 10 −5 was used as threshold for the identification of unannotated sequences. Therefore, sequences with higher E-values were treated as unannotated transcripts and used for further analysis. Later, contigs with an average read coverage below 50 were also removed. Coding potential and genome mapping filter. Coding potential is a support vector machines-based classifying system that comprehensively scores transcript characteristics, including the presence and integrity of predicted ORFs, similarity to known protein sequences, and conservation of a single frame. The following three approaches were used to identify and discard transcripts that could encode for proteins: (i) The Coding Potential Assessment Tool was used to discriminate coding and noncoding transcripts from a large pool of candidates 28, 30 ; (ii) The transcripts with an ORF length of less than 30 amino acids (defined for lncRNA as < 200 base pairs) were chosen; and (iii) An NCBI conserved domain search was used to identify transcripts that could encode for protein-conserved domains. The remaining transcripts were mapped against the latest version of the S. salar genome (Acc. No. AGKD00000000.4), considering a mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3, deletion cost = 3, length fraction = 0.8, and a similarity fraction = 0.8. The predicted lncRNAs were aligned against previously obtained datasets for Salmo salar. Likewise, the predicted lncRNAs were checked for matches to any protein coding isoforms (BLASTx). Those transcripts that had any match with protein coding isoforms were removed from further analyses. In silico lncRNAs expression. Different RNA-Seq analyses were performed for each sample and tissue by mapping filtered reads against putative lncRNAs. The considered parameters included a minimum read length fraction = 0.9, minimum read similarity fraction = 0.9, and unspecific read match limit = 10 in relation to the reference dataset. Expression values were estimated as RPKM and normalized against the total set, using state numbers in reads per 1000000. To identify lncRNAs highly regulated during ISAV infection in each tissue, the Z-test was used for statistical analysis 51 . This test counts data and compares single samples against one another. The Z-test is based on an approximation of binominal distribution by using normal distribution and taking proportions rather than raw counts into consideration. Additionally, p-values were false discovery rate-corrected. A Volcano plot was used to select and extract the most differentially expressed transcripts, with highly regulated transcripts being those with |fold changes| > 2 and p-values < 0.01, as compared to the control group (day 0).
