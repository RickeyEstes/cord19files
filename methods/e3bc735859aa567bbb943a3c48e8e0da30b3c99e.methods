To examine the elements and process of biosurveillance in current legislation of the ROK pertaining to infectious disease control, the most recent version (finalized on December 31, 2018) of the IDCPA 10 was reviewed. The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) of the WHO and US biosurveillance-related legislation were examined to enable understanding of how biosurveillance is arrayed in the jurisdictional landscape. The IHR was analyzed because of its influence on national legislation. 11 Notably, the regulations in the IHR were included in the IDCPA of the ROK. 3 Legislation relating to biosurveillance in the United States was included in the analysis, as the United States leads the development of biosurveillance systems. 12 US legislation relating to biosurveillance was identified by searching the congressional website. 13 Legislation that included the term ''biosurveillance'' was selected, including the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (IRCA), 14 the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), 15 and the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA). 16 The independent analysis of legislation was based on the elements and processes of biosurveillance of the IRCA. The IDCPA and IHR were also independently analyzed as to how they encompass the components of the surveillance system.
