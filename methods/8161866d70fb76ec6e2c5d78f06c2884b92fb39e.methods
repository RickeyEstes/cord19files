Patients and Samples. Samples were sourced from two previous acute respiratory infection (ARI) cohorts among in-and outpatients, that were conducted at Children's Hospital 1 and 2 in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam during years 2009 and 2010. Detailed information on patient enrolment, sample collection and clinical parameters for the inpatient study are provided in Do et al. 17 . Briefly, children under 2 years of age were eligible if admitted for a lower respiratory tract infection with an onset of symptoms less than 5 days prior to recruitment. Patients with uncomplicated non-respiratory or non-infectious respiratory causes for hospitalisation were excluded. In the outpatient study children under 16 years of age, living in Ho Chi Minh City, and with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection (defined as presenting with cough, sore throat, runny nose or nasal congestion for less than 5 days as the chief complaint) with no underlying illness except asthma were enrolled at the outpatient clinic of Children's Hospital 1. Three types of respiratory specimens (nasal swabs, throat swabs, and nasopharyngeal aspirates) were collected on admission by trained personnel using standard operating procedures, and were placed in viral transport medium 17 . Specimens were kept at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h and then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until further processing. RNA was extracted and viral nucleic acid was detected as described previously [17] [18] [19] . The studies were approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Institutional Review Boards of Children's Hospital 1 and 2 and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethical Committee under the approval numbers 44.08 for the inpatient and 31.08 for the outpatient study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all children enrolled in the study. PCR Amplification and Sequencing. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from HPIV-positive samples as previously described 20 and shipped to Duke-NUS for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. For sequencing, HPIV-positive samples were further amplified in a hemi-nested PCR approach with newly designed species-specific primers targeting overlapping regions of the viral genome (Table S2) . Briefly, the first-round PCR was conducted in 5 or 6 separate reactions and amplified an 'outer' PCR product of about ~3 kb collectively covering the entire genome of HPIV (~15 kb for HPIV1-3, ~17 kb for HPIV4). These initial PCR products were further amplified in a second-round PCR yielding 2 separate overlapping 'inner' products of 1.5-1.8 kb. Amplicons were gel-purified and sequenced with PCR primers. If required, PCRs and sequencing reactions using additional primers were performed to achieve full genome coverage. Low quality reads were manually curated, primer sequences were removed and contigs were assembled in Geneious version 7.0 21 . Nucleotide alignments of the HN gene of all HPIV species and whole genome sequences of HPIV3 were created using MAFFT 22 . Phylogenetic Analysis. All available HN gene sequences of the 4 HPIV species were downloaded from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) 23 and annotated with sample collection date and country. Temporal phylogenies of individual HPIV species were inferred in BEAST v1.8.3 24 using a strict clock, the HKY85 substitution model, and a constant coalescent tree prior. MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10,000 generations. Run convergence was confirmed in Tracer v1.6 after 10% burn-in removal 25 . Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were generated using Tree Annotator v1.7 26 . The phylogeny of HPIV3 was further inferred from available whole-genome sequences. All phylogenetic trees were visualized using of migration in and out of Viet Nam were inferred using an asymmetric substitution model with the Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) option. Two independent runs of 100 million generations were combined using LogCombiner v1.8.3 after removal of appropriate burn-in and the mean migration rates were extracted from the combined log file. Epidemiological Analysis. We analysed the clinical characteristics of HPIV species from the two studies from which our samples were sourced. Demographics (age, sex) and clinical metadata (duration of illness at presentation, clinical symptoms pulse, respiratory rate, total episode duration, ICU admission, clinical diagnosis and disease outcome) recorded during the original studies were used. For each of the studies, we assessed the variability of parameters (age, duration of illness, pulse, and respiratory rate) across HPIV species with a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn post-test. Proportions of demographic and clinical variables were compared between HPIV species with a Chi-squared test with Yates' correction. The clinical diagnosis at presentation and follow-up were classified as upper respiratory infection (rhinitis, rhinopharyngitis or laryngitis) or bronchiolitis/ pneumonia or any lower respiratory infection (either bronchitis, croup, bronchiolitis or pneumonia). A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 5.0d for Mac software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California USA). Data availability.
