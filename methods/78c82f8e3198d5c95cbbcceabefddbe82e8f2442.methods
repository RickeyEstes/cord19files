A group of 36 medical, veterinary, and wildlife experts in zoonoses from government, research institutions and universities in Kenya prioritized 36 diseases using a semi-quantitative One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with slight adaptations. The tool comprises five steps: listing of zoonotic diseases to be prioritized, development of ranking criteria, weighting criteria by pairwise comparison through analytical hierarchical process, scoring each zoonotic disease based on the criteria, and aggregation of scores. The prioritization of zoonotic diseases was carried out through a facilitated consultative process involving 36 experts in zoonoses from the public health (n = 19), animal health (n = 15) and wildlife health (n = 2), during a three day workshop in September 2015. To select participants, institutions (government, research and academia) and departments that work on zoonoses in areas of surveillance, research and diagnostics on both human and animal health were identified and invitations sent out requesting for experts on zoonoses. Those who were nominated voluntarily agreed to participate. About 20% of the zoonoses experts selected by their institutions had not previously participated in ZDU activities. To minimize systematic bias arising from participants from same institutions 'thinking the same way', participants from same institutions and expertise were purposively placed in different groups.
