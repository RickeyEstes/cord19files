We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and laboratory and radiological findings of all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV-infected patients who were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Korea), which was one of the main designated isolation hospitals for the treatment of patients with severe MERS during the Korean MERS outbreak in May and June 2015. Specifically, the medical records of the four patients who experienced neurological complications were evaluated in detail by two experienced neurologists. The presence of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed by applying real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to specimens from the lower respiratory tract (collected sputum and endotracheal aspirates) according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization. 9 Clinical stages of sepsis were defined according to the third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3). 10 We calculated the Pneumonia Severity Index and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II to identify the severity of pneumonia and the condition of each patient upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 11, 12 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul Medical Center (approval no. 2015-069).
