Two methods are used for replacing CVAD; placing a new catheter over a guide wire at the existing site, or percutaneously inserting a new catheter at another site. Guide wire insertion has been the accepted technique for replacing a malfunctioning catheter (or exchanging a pulmonary artery catheter for a CVAD when invasive monitoring was no longer needed) as they are associated with less discomfort and a significantly lower rate of mechanical complications than those percutaneously inserted at a new site. Studies of the risks for infection associated with guide wire insertions examined by HICPAC yielded conflicting results. One prospective study showed a significantly higher rate of CR-BSI associated with catheters replaced over a guide wire compared with catheters inserted percutaneously. 301 However, three prospective studies (two randomised) showed no significant difference in infection rates between catheters inserted percutaneously and those inserted over a guide wire. 302, 304, 305 Since these studies suggest that the insertion of the new catheter at a new site does not alter the rate of infectious complications per day but does increase the incidence of mechanical complications, guide wire exchange is recommended. Most studies examined by HICPAC concluded that, in cases where the catheter being removed is known to be infected, guidewire exchange is contraindicated. 302, [304] [305] [306] [307] A systematic review concluded that, compared with new site replacement, guidewire exchange was associated with a trend toward a higher rate of subsequent catheter colonisation, regardless of whether patients had a suspected infection at the time of replacement. Guidewire exchange was also associated with trends toward a higher rate of catheter exit-site infection and CR-BSI. However, guidewire exchange was associated with fewer mechanical complications relative to new-site replacement. 303 Methods are available and techniques have been described which allow a diagnosis of CR-BSI to be made without the need for catheter removal. 308 Such approaches could be used prior to the replacement of a new catheter over a guide wire in order to reduce the subsequent risk of CRinfection. 308
