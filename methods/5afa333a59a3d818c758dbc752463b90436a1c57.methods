Cells, viruses and IFN. Vero, Huh7, A549 and Hep2 cells and their respective derivatives were grown as monolayers in 25 or 75 cm 2 tissue-culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum at 37 uC. When needed, cells were treated with human recombinant IFN (Roferon-A; Roche) at 1000 U ml 21 . The CPI2 isolate was grown and titrated in Vero cells. Preparation of radiolabelled antigen extracts, immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. The methodology used has been described elsewhere (Carlos et al., 2005) . Briefly, cells were mock infected or infected with CPI2 and at 8 h p.i. were treated with IFN or left untreated for 12 h and then metabolically labelled for 1 h with L-[ 35 S]methionine (500 Ci mmol 21 ; MP Biomedical). After labelling, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer, sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 12 000 g to remove solid material. Immunocomplexes were formed by incubating soluble antigens with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), pre-coupled with a mix of mAbs to the viral proteins NP, P, HN and M. The proteins in immunocomplexes were dissociated by heating for 5 min at 100 uC and analysed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed, stained and dried, and the resolved bands visualized by phosphorimage analysis. Plasmids and generation of cells expressing shRNA to ISG56/ IFIT1. The mammalian expression vector containing the full-length haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged IFIT1/ISG56 gene was a kind gift from Dr F. Weber (Institute for Virology, Philipps University Marburg, Germany). Lentivirus vector used for the expression of ISG56/IFIT1 shRNA sequence was based on pLKO.1puro, as described by Everett et al. (2007) . A derivative of the vector expressing the blasticidin resistance gene (pLKO.BLAST) was obtained from Dr R. D. Everett (CVR, University of Glasgow, UK). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into pLKO.BLAST. The target sequences for human ISG56 were for region 1 (59-GGATAAAGCTCTTGAGTTA-39) and region 2 (59-CTACAAAT-TGGAAGGAAAT-39) (Li et al., 2009) . The method used to isolate lentivirus stock has been described previously (Hilton et al., 2006) . Lentivirus-infected cells were selected with blasticidin (10 mg ml 21 ) and maintained for 4 weeks in medium containing blasticidin. Immunofluorescence. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown on 10 mm diameter coverslips (General Scientific Co.) in individual wells of six-well plates. Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ISG56/IFIT1. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with the different viruses. At 24 h p.i., monolayers of cells on coverslips were incubated in fixing solution (5 % formaldehyde in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized (0.5 % NP-40, 10 % sucrose in PBS) for 10 min and washed three times in PBS containing 1 % FCS. To detect the proteins of interest, cell monolayers were incubated with 20 ml of appropriately diluted primary antibody for 1 h. For CPI2 infection, mAbs to NP and P proteins were used, named SV5-NP-a and SV5-Pe, respectively (Randall et al., 1987) . To detect overexpressed ISG56/ IFIT1, anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used. After subsequent incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed several times with 1 % FCS in PBS and incubated for 1 h with secondary Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (for viral proteins) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for ISG56/IFIT1 detection (Sera Lab). qPCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from infected cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of RNA was subsequently used for RT-PCR. Fragments of~200 bp were amplified with primers for NP, P, M, HN and L. b-Actin was used as a reference gene. Primer sequences were: NP: 59-AGGGTAGAGATCGATGGCT-39 (forward) and 59-GTCTGACCACCATTCCCTT-39 (reverse); P: 59-AATACCA-CCAGGGGTCACAG-39 (forward) and 59-CGAGCACCCAAACTG-TGCTT-39 (reverse); M: 59-TCATGAGCCACTGGTGACAT-39 (forward) and 59-TGGAATTCCCTCAGTTGTCC-39 (reverse); HN: 59-AACTCTGCAGTCGCTCTACC-39 (forward) and 59-GCAATCTG-ACACTTGGCCCA-39 (reverse); L: 59-TCCAAGTGATGACTTTG-AATT-39 (forward) and 59-CCATACTCATTACTCGTGTGCC-39 (reverse); and b-actin: 59-ACCAACTGGGACGACATGGAG-39 (forward) and 59-TAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAAC-39 (reverse). The plotted values of mRNA were expressed as the quantity of the gene of interest relative to the quantity of the reference gene, to obtain normalized and relative expression values. Each sample was performed in duplicate on the same qPCR plate in two separate experiments. A non-template sample and a non-reverse transcriptase sample were analysed routinely as negative controls. Data were collected using a 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). In vitro methylation assay. Poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from 1.5610 7 mock-or CPI2-infected A549 cells with an Oligotex Direct mRNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). In vitro-transcribed N7-methyl-capped model RNA (m7-Cap-RNA) encoding the NP of mouse hepatitis coronavirus was generated using a T7 RiboMax Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega). The N7-methylated cap was added using the ScriptCap m7G Capping System according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Cellscript). 29-O-Methylation reactions were carried out as described previously (ZÃ¼st et al., 2011) . Briefly, 100 ng of in vitro-transcribed m7-Cap-RNA or 300-1500 ng poly(A)-containing RNA derived from virus-infected cells or the corresponding amount of poly(A)-containing RNA from uninfected cells was incubated for 1 h at 37 uC with ScriptCap 29-Omethyltransferase (Cellscript) in the presence of 0.5 mM S-adenosylmethionine and 1.4 mM 3 H-labelled S-adenosylmethionine (78 Ci mmol 21 ; Perkin Elmer). Reactions were purified with SigmaSpin Post-Reaction Clean-Up columns (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluates were mixed with 2 ml Ultima Gold scintillation fluid for measurement of 3 H incorporation with a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer).
