After research ethics board approval and informed consent, two researchers used a structured questionnaire to interview quarantined healthcare workers. The questionnaire elicited demographic information, details about health, and information about exposure to the index patient. Time of exposure was categorized as follows: <1 min, 1-10 min, 11-30 min, 31-60 min, 1-4 h, or >4 h. Exposure proximity, procedures performed, and infectioncontrol precautions were documented. Each healthcare worker was asked about symptoms suggestive of SARS that developed during or after the quarantine period. For healthcare workers in whom suspected or probable SARS developed, additional data were collected about the nature and course of their illness. Suspected and probable SARS were defined according to the definitions issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) (7) . Symptoms of suspected SARS were a fever >38Â°C, respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiologic link with a SARS patient; all quarantined healthcare workers were considered to have an epidemiologic link on the basis of contact with the index patient. Probable SARS was defined as suspected SARS with radiographic lung infiltrates.
