This is a cross-sectional study. We obtained a 1% random sample of Twitter data via Twitter streaming application programming interface (API) [11] . APIs are a set of protocols that enable third-party software applications to retrieve structured data from online platforms. Twitter streaming API provides streams of live feeds, and it is the most commonly used data source for Twitter research [12] . For this study, we ran Python scripts to access a 1% random sample through the sample function of Twitter streaming API [13] . From this sample, we retrieved MERS-related tweets using keywords, such as 'MERS' in Chinese, English, Indonesian/Malaysian (Bahasa Indonesia/Bahasa Malaysia), Japanese, Korean, and Thai. For details, see Online Supplementary Materials. The time frame was June 1 (the 13th day of the outbreak) to June 30, 2015 (4 days before the last case was confirmed), Seoul Time, i.e., Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) Ã¾ 9. (The first of the 186 MERS cases was confirmed in Korea on May 20, 2015; by May 31, 23 cases were confirmed; the last four cases were confirmed in the first four days of July [10] . Our time frame captured the majority of the time span of the outbreak. ) We first performed a preliminary data analysis, using one week of data to fine-tune our data analysis plan, before we analyzed the full dataset. After preliminary analyses, we focused our analysis on the corpora of 5 languages that returned the highest number of tweets: English (N Z 4024), Indonesian (N Z 1256), Japanese (N Z 1334), Korean (N Z 21,823) and Thai (N Z 2084). We used Google Translate API to prepare preliminary English translations of the Indonesian, Japanese, Korean and Thai corpora. We then selected the posts with the highest frequency that contributed to 50% of the dataset and asked a native speaker or professional editor of each of the four languages to manually proofread the English translation. Once we finalized the English translation, we performed the following analyses with the translated text.
