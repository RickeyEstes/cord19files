The study protocol was largely based on the University of YorkÕs Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance for undertaking reviews in healthcare [9] . Work commenced in mid-July 2010 and the main part of it was completed in mid-October 2010. Further work was carried out in June 2011 to bring the literature coverage up to date. The following specific questions were developed to capture the objectives of the review: • Is there an association between mass gatherings and influenza outbreaks or spread? • Are there any particular characteristics (such as size or duration) of mass gatherings that influence transmission of influenza? • Does the restriction of mass gatherings reduce the spread of influenza within the community (compared with no restriction or with other interventions)?
