The Orenstein's screening method was used to calculate vaccine effectiveness with the following formula: where PCV is the proportion of vaccinated among influenza cases and PPV is the proportion of vaccinated among the population [5, 6] . PPV was obtained from administrative sources. Two influenza datasets were used: one of clinically defined ILI cases, and one of laboratoryconfirmed pandemic A(H1N1) influenza cases. One injection was considered sufficient to confer a vaccinated status [7, 8] . Because influenza vaccines were not given to children under six month-old, they were excluded from the study. Individuals with missing age or vaccination status were also excluded.
