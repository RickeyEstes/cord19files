Mice. The complement C3 deficient (C3 −/− ) mice (#003641) and the C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The Vsig4 −/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. M. van Lookeren Campagne (Department of Immunology, Genentech, CA, USA). The Pdk2 −/− mice were provided by Dr. C.R. Harris (Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, USA). All mice were backcrossed ten times onto the B6 background to avoid unpredictable confounders. Specific pathogen-free male and age-matched mice (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Virus and infection. MHV-3 viruses were expanded in 17CL1 cells to a concentration of 1 × 10 7 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml. Mice were received MHV-3 (100 PFU/mouse) via intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection. In some experiments, C57BL/6 WT mice were infected with lentivirus (1 × 10 7 PFU/mouse) via intravenous injection to transiently force the expression of Vsig4 in vivo, and these mice were further infected with MHV-3 after 6 days. The virus-infected mice were euthanized on the indicated days. Liver damage was compared by H&E staining and cell apoptosis was measured using the Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining method according to the manufacturer's instructions (#12156792910, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The virus titers in liver tissues were determined by plaque assay method. Briefly, the supernatant of liver tissue homogenate was ten times step diluted. Mouse 17CL1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates, when reaches 80% fusion, cells were added with the diluted liver extraction and incubated for 30 min under 37°C, 5% CO 2 condition. Cells were then added with 1 ml 2% MethyCellulose DMEM medium (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) per well, and then further incubated for 4 days. Cells added with the supernatant from uninfected liver tissue homogenate were used as negative controls, whereas cells treated with the purified MHV-3 virus were used as positive controls. Finally, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and the viral titers were determined by crystal violet staining assay. Diet intervention. C57BL/6 WT mice and congenic Vsig4 −/− littermates were received NCD or HFD (#MD12031, Medicience Ltd., Nanjing, China) starting at the age of 8 weeks. The body mass was evaluated every week for a total of 10 weeks. The distribution of fat tissues in obese mice was made using an in vivo microcomputed tomography scanner (μCT, Quantum FX, Perkin Elmer, Hopkinton, MA, USA). At the end of the feeding experiment, the mice were sacrificed, and blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged to collect plasma. The liver and epididymal WAT were dissected, weighed, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The morphometry of individual fat cells was assessed using digital image analysis as described previously 26 . Briefly, microscopic images were digitized in 24-bit RGB (specimen level pixel size 1.28 × 1.28 μm 2 ). Recognition of fat cells was initially performed by applying a region growing algorithm on manually indicated seed points, and the minimum Feret diameter was calculated. GTT and ITT experiments. For GTT, the animals were i.p. injected with 2 g/kg glucose (#G6125, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) after 12 h of fasting, and blood was drawn to measure blood glucose 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. For ITT, 0.5 U/kg of insulin (Novolin R, Novo Nordisk) was i.p. injected after 6 h of fasting, and blood was drawn at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min thereafter. Seahorse XFp metabolic flux analysis. The OCR was measured using an XFp extracellular analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Macrophages were seeded at 2.0 × 10 4 cells/well density in 8-well plates for 5 h to allow adherence to the plate. After 2 h of LPS (800 ng/ml) administration, the cells were changed to unbuffered assay media (base medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, pH 7.4) and incubated in a non-CO 2 incubator for 1 h. Four baseline measurements were taken before sequential injection of mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin, FCCP, and antimycin (AA) plus rotenone (AR) provided by the manufacturer (#101706-100, Agilent Technologies). OCR was automatically calculated using the Seahorse XFp software. Every point represents an average of three different wells. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence double staining. Paraffinembedded tissue blocks were cut into 2.5 μm slices and were mounted on polylysine-charged glass slides. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by exposure to 3.0% H 2 O 2 for 30 min. Antigen retrieval was performed in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 120°C for 10 min.

After washing, the sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The Vecta-stain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to perform the avidin-biotin complex method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections incubated with isotype and concentration matched immunoglobulins without primary antibodies were used as isotype controls. Peroxidase activity was visualized with the DAB Elite kit (K3465, DAKO), and brown coloration of tissues represented positive staining. To detect p-PDH-E1α S300 and mitochondria co-localization, both BMDMs and PEMs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Saponin in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were then stained with rabbit anti-p-PDH-E1α S300 antibodies (#AP1046, 1:100, Merk, Temecula, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C, and then stained with Alexa Fluor488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (#A-21206, Thermo Scientific, Billerica, MA, USA) for 1 h. Finally, the sections were incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI and MitoTracker Red (#M-7512, Thermo Scientific) at 500 nM for 30 min at 37°C. The results were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan 2). ELISA and western blotting.

To measure the mROS superoxide, macrophages were incubated with MitoSOX red (5 μM, Life technologies, Eugene, Oregon, USA) at 1.0 μM for 1 h in phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen). The death cells were excluded firstly by staining with LIVE/DEATHFixable Near-IR Ded Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies). To measure the expression of activation markers on cell surface, suspended cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in dark using fluorescent antibodies (anti-B7-H1, anti-B7-DC, anti-B7-H3, and anti-CD40). To detect intracellular proinflammatory cytokines (pro-IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6) expression, macrophages or T cells were isolated and treated with brefeldin A for 4 h. mAbs were then added, and further incubated for an additional 1 h. all of these fluorescent antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 10,000 live cells were analyzed by FACsAria cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All the flow cytometry data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software. Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or the indicated tissues with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The expression of mRNA encoding for the indicated genes was quantified by quantitative (q)RT-PCR with the SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (Takara) and was normalized to the expression of β-actin. qRT-PCR was performed with specific primers (Supplementary Table 2 ). The results were compared by the 2 −ΔΔCt method. Lentiviral constructs and transduction. The mouseVsig4 (NM_177789) cDNA ORF clone (#MR203780) and Pdk2 (NM_133667) cDNA ORF clone (#MG206400) were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). The whole gene expression cDNA for Vsig4, Pdk2, the truncation mutants of Vsig4, and Vsig4 site-directed mutagenesis were further amplified with specific primers (Supplementary Table 3 ). cDNA was cloned into the pCDH-MCS-T2A-copGFP-MSCV (CD523A-1) vector. This vector was mutated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit II (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The lentiviral packaging vectors-psPAX2 and pVSVG were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). The psPAX2 plasmids (2 μg), the expression vectors (2 μg) and the pVSVG plasmids (2 μg) were cotransfected into 293T cells, and the virus supernatants were collected after 48 h (2,000 rpm/min, 3 min). RAW264.7 cells were transduced with unconcentrated virus supernatant overnight in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene and selected in puromycin (0.5 mg/ml). The expression of VSIG4 and PDK2 was measured by western blot. Pdk2 and Stat3 shRNA silencing. Lentiviral constructs with shRNAs directed against mouse Pdk2 and Stat3 in the pGV112 vectors, which were prepared by GeneChem (Shanghai, China). Primers are presented in Supplementary Table 4 . Lentivirus was prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells with transfer vectors along with third-generation packaging constructs (pHelper 1.0 and pHelper 2.0). The viral titers were determined with serial dilution of virus-containing media on NIH3T3 cells. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with unconcentrated virus supernatant overnight in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene and selected in puromycin (0.5 mg/ml). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR. BMDMs underwent cross-linking for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde in medium. Chromatin fragments were prepared, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Dnmt3a (#ab2850, Abcam, 1:1000, Rabbit), anti-STAT3 (#ab119352, Abcam, 1:1000, mouse) or rabbit/mosue IgG isotype mAbs and coupled to Dynabeads Protein G. DNA was phenol/ chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated in the presence of glycogen. DNA was purified with a PCR purification kit (#28104, Qiagen). qPCR was performed with special primers (Supplementary Table 5 ) flanking the putative Dnmt3a-and STAT3-binding sites. The input DNA was an aliquot of sheared chromatin before immunoprecipitation and was used for normalization of the samples to the amount of chromatin added to each ChIP. Vsig4 gene promoter methylation analyses. The Sequenom MassARRAY platform (CapitalBio, Beijing, China) was used to perform the quantitative methylation analysis of Vsig4. This system uses matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in combination with RNA basespecific cleavage (MassCLEAVE). A detectable pattern is then analyzed for its methylation status. PCR primers were designed with Methprimer (http:// epidesigner.com) and were showed in (Supplementary Table 6 ). The spectra methylation ratios were generated by Epityper software version 1.0 (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). Vsig4 gene promoter luciferase reporter assay. A840bp (-840/+1) fragment of Vsig4 gene promoter was cloned into the pGL3-basic expression vector using primers described in Supplementary Table 7 . The pGL3-basic and the -840/+1 Vsig4 promoter constructs were fully methylated in vitro by M.SssI following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs (NEB), Beijing, China). The completeness of methylation was checked by measuring the extent of protection from digestion by the restriction enzymes BstUI (NEB). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in 12-well plates and were transfected with these plasmids by using amaxanucleofector (4D-Nucleofector, Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA). At 48 h after transfection, cells were further treated with proinflammatory mediators for an additional 12 h. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Invitrogen). Luciferase reporter activities were measured in triplicate using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and quantified using the GloMax 96-well plate luminometer (Promega). The firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase ratios were determined and were defined as the relative luciferase activity. Results are shown as the mean ± s.e.m. of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. To examine the transfection efficiency, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a pmaxGFP control vector and transfection efficiency was assessed by in situ GFP expression according to manufacturer's protocol (Lonza). Statistical analysis. Survival data from in vivo experiments were analyzed by a log-rank test performed on curves generated by GraphPad Prism 4.03 Software (MacKiev). For all other analysis, two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-tests with a 95% confidence interval performed on graphs generated in GraphPad Prism were used. p < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.
