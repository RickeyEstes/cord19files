Study design. We analyzed epidemiological datasets of laboratory-confirmed MERS patients and focused our study on eleven healthcare-associated outbreaks that were reported in KSA and ROK since 2015, when policies and procedures for case identification and comprehensive contact identification and follow up became systematic and were implemented by affected countries. The data used documented MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO under the International Health Regulations (2005). We only included clusters of cases/outbreaks that were linked to healthcare facilities. Supplemental ROK case-based data were provided as a detailed line list of the Korean MERS cases included in a published study 17 . We defined laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection as following WHO guidelines 4, 37 . We defined a HCA-outbreak as the occurrence of 5 or more laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections with reported epidemiologic links between cases and during which the human-to-human transmission events were documented within a single healthcare facility, with no more than 14 days apart between cases symptom onset. The MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015 is treated as a single outbreak. Individual-level variables included information on age, sex, nationality, occupation (healthcare personnel (HCP) yes/no), dates of symptom onset, date of notification to WHO, presence of any pre-existing co-morbid conditions, and clinical outcome. In case of missing or conflicting information and when information from the country was not available, we considered the data as missing. statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis was performed by HCA-outbreak (outbreak-level analysis) using aggregated data, and for all cases (individual-level analysis). All analyses were conducted using Stata, version 14 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP), Microsoft Excel (Version 15.35 2017, Jones, Chicago USA) and R. Outbreak-level analysis. We calculated the duration, size and case fatality ratio for each outbreak. The duration of an outbreak was calculated as the number of days between the date of symptom onset of the first reported case to the date of symptom onset of the last reported case. We obtained weekly smoothed estimates of the case reproduction number based on the approach developed by Wallinga and Teunis 38,39 using the R 0 package. We assumed that the serial interval of MERS-CoV had a Gamma distribution with a mean of 6.8 days and a standard deviation of 4.1 days, as described elsewhere 40 . Individual-level analysis. We summarized case characteristics as frequencies and proportions for categorical variables, as median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables. Chi-square tests were used to compare subgroups of cases when appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Univariate analysis identified variables significantly associated with fatal outcome, which were included in a multivariable model. Model selection was performed using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression with backwards selection taking into account clustering of individuals by outbreak. For the variable "age", the cut-off was fixed at 65, based on the results of the univariate analysis. Variables with p-values < 0.05 were retained in the final model.
