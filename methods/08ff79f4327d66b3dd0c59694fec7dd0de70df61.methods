Animals. Male, 60-day-old F-344 rats (CDF [F-344] Crl BR, VAF + animals, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Kingston, NY) were weighed, ear tapged, and randomly assigned to either the air-or O,-exposure groups. They then were transferred to individual wire cages within a barriermaintained exposure facility with food (Purina Rodent Lab Chow, St. Louis, MO) and water available ad libitum for IO days prior to initiation of exposure. Separate groups of rats were purchased for the I-. 3-. 13-, and 78-week studies. Ozone-exposed rats and matched air-exposed controls were studied at six time points after the onset of exposure. These time points were I week, 3 weeks, 13 weeks, 13 weeks plus 6 weeks recovery in clean air (19 weeks). 78 weeks, and 78 weeks plus 17 weeks recovery in clean air (95 weeks). Twelve animals from each exposure group were used. Serum was obtained on arrival from 5% of rats in each shipment and from sentinel rats exposed along with test rats. Sera were tested for and found to be free of antibodies to the following viruses: reovirus Type 3, pneumonia virus of mice, encephalomyelitis, Sendai, mouse adenovirus. sialodacryo adenitis, Toolan H-l, Kilham rat virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis. and rat coronavirus. In addition, lung washes were tested for and found to be free of Mycoplusma pulmonis, and nothing unusual appeared in bacterial cultures from the nasopharynx, trachea, and gut. Rats were also monitored and found to be free of ectoparasites and endoparasites. Air-and O,-exposed animals were handled identically at all times. Exposure regimen and fiility. The exposure was carried out in facilities operated by the Inhalation Toxicology Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Health Effects Research Laboratory (Research Triangle Park. NC) and by ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc. (RTP. NC). A complete description of the automated exposure facility has been reported by Davies et al. (1987) . Briefly, animals were exposed in identical walk-in 14.2 m3 environmental rooms. Computer-interfaced mechanical systems monitored and controlled exposure concentration. temperature (74 + 3"F), humidity (60 f 10%). chamber air flow, and lighting. Ozone was generated by passing cylinder-supplied oxygen (National Specialty Gas Co.) through a silent arc O3 generator (Ozone Research and Equipment Corporation. Model OSV-0). and was monitored using continuous chemiluminescent analyzers (Bendix Model 8002) (RFOA-0 176). These analyzers were calibrated every 2 weeks using a uv standard. The Ox exposure consisted of a continuous background level of0.06 ppm. During the 5-day work week, a 9-hr "ramped spike" (maximum concentration, 0.25 ppm; integrated concentration, 0. I9 ppm) was added to the background exposure (Fig. I) . Animals and equipment were serviced daily during a 2-hr shutdown. On weekends the rats were exposed for 22 hr per day at the background level (0.06 ppm). The standard deviation for the peak part of the exposure was less than 4% of its mean at all times and that for the background portion did not exceed 2% of its mean concentration. During the I8-month exposure, a total of 40 hr of O3 exposure was missed due to mechanical problems. Histology. Rats were removed from the chambers and euthanized within 4 hr after their exposure was terminated. Lungs were fixed by infusing the fixative (2% glutaraldehyde in 0.085 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) through a trachea1 cannula at a pressure of 20 cm HzO. The lungs were removed from the chest after 10 min of fixation inside the chest wall. They were immersed in the 2% glutaraldehyde fixative for 2 weeks before being trimmed free of other tissue. Measurement of lung volumes by fluid displacement was then performed. Three 2-mm thick slices were cut from the left lobe in a manner that divided the rest of the lobe into four pieces approximately equal in width (cranial to caudal direction). Each slice was cut into large blocks with approximately 4 X 4-mm faces. The blocks were mixed and then six to nine blocks from each slice were arbitrarily selected. They were embedded in Epox 8 12 with large molds with a random orientation. The random orientation of terminal bronchioles allowed them to be cut in a random direction with respect to the central axis of each terminal bronchiole. Microdissection. Three blocks of epox-embedded lung tissue were selected arbitrarily, softened with mild heat, and cut into slices 0.3-0.5 mm thick. These slices were sequentially inspected under a dissecting microscope. Small airways were followed until they led into terminal bronchioles and proximal alveolar ducts. All the terminal bronchioles in one tissue block that were perpendicularly cut in cross section were isolated. One terminal bronchiole from each block was randomly selected for study. We defined the proximal alveolar region (PAR) as the alveolar tissue surrounding the alveolar ducts beginning at the bronchiolar-alveolar duct junction and ending FIG. I. Exposure regimen for the simulated ambient pattern of ozone. Rats were exposed to this regimen for 5 days each week. On weekends, the exposure consisted only of a 22 hr/day 0.06 ppm background. at the second alveolar duct bifurcation. Samples were taken at the approximate center of this region by taking them just distal to the proximal edge of the first alveolar duct bifurcation. We required that cross sections of the two first alveolar ducts be present in the section. All proximal alveolar regions contained in the series of embedded tissue slices that satisfied the definitions given above were isolated. Three terminal bronchioles and three proximal alveolar regions were used from each animal. Methods for microdissection have been described in detail by Chang and Crap0 (1990) . Electron microscopy. Blocks of PARS were trimmed to include only the alveolar septa surrounding the alveolar ducts. Ultrathin sections (-60 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined with a Zeiss CM 10 electron microscope (EM) at 2000X. Photographs were taken at the upper left and lower right corner of each grid square, and the entire section was photographed. A montage of the entire bronchiolar epithelium was made for each terminal bronchiole. Micrographs were printed on 11 X 14 inch paper at a magnification of 8500x using a calibration grid . EM morphometry. The parameters measured in proximal alveolar regions in this study included the volumes of type I epithelium, type II epithelium, interstitial cells, interstitial matrix, and endothelium as well as alveolar cell characteristics (cell number, mean cell size, and mean cell-surface area). Because the absolute volume of proximal alveolar tissue cannot be easily measured, tissue volumes were expressed as the ratio of tissue volume density to surface density of the alveolar epithelial basement membrane . We have found that although the thickness of the basement membrane may change, its surface density was not altered significantly during these chronic Or exposures (Table 4) . It can be used as a Chang and Crapo, 1990) . Morphometric studies ofthe terminal bronchioles included measurement of the thickness of the bronchiolar epithelium and mean cell characteristics of the bronchiolar epithelial cells. The major terminal bronchiolar cells studied were ciliated cells, Clara cells, preciliated cells, and brush cells. All unidentified cell profiles were classified as "other" cells. Methods for the morphometry of terminal bronchiolar cells and morphological criteria used to identify them have been reported by and Chang et al. (1986) . Statistical unalyses. A large number of morphometric analyses were conducted on the terminal bronchiolar and proximal alveolar regions. In order to perform the statistical analyses on the most meaningful biological endpoints and to minimize the need for correcting results for multiple comparisons, primary variable groupings were defined a priori. The critical variables identified for changes in volumes, surface densities, surface areas, tissue thickness, and the characteristics of the major cell types are given in Tables 1 and 2. These sets of primary variables were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The remaining variables which had not been identified in multivariate groupings as being primary, were analyzed only in univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). The factors of interest in the statistical analyses were pollutant exposure (air, 0,) and length of exposure including recovery, if done, (1. 3, 13, 19, 78, and 95 weeks). A two-factor ANOVA examined the effects of pollutant and length of exposure in a 2 X 6 design. For the primary variables, ANOVA tests were only examined if a significant MANOVA effect due to pollutant or to an interaction with pollutant was found. Significant ANOVA effects were further examined by using the ANOVA mean square error to test the least squares means via t tests with application of a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, as appropriate.
