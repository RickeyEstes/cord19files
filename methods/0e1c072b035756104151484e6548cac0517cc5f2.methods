We decided the best solution would be to first generate a large number of patterns using the training set. For each possible term pair we generate a feature vector which represents the frequency of matching that term pair using each of the patterns generated. This feature vector is then classified, and the posterior probability used in our synset formation algorithm described below. It should be noted that we used the number of term pairs to calculate these scores, which gives a lower value than might be expected. For example if 4 terms were correctly identified out of a synset of 8 terms, then only 6 out of 28 synonym pairs have been identified, so the score is only 21.4% even though 50% of the terminology was recognised.
