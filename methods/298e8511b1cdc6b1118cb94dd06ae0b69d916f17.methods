The study was conducted in our institution between February and April 2007. Southern Health is the largest metropolitan health service in Victoria, Australia, providing services to a population of over 750 000 and employing over 10 000 staff. A self-administered, anonymous survey was placed on the hospital intranet. Staff were advised of its presence by personal email (medical staff), by advertisement on the intranet and in the Chief Executive Officer's newsletter. Additionally, as the survey was conducted during the annual influenza vaccination campaign, an opportunity to complete the questionnaire was also available when staff attended for their influenza vaccination. Surveys were either completed directly onto an electronic database (via intranet access) or returned to the investigator for entering. The survey included questions on personal characteristics such as sex, age, presence of dependent children and job classification. The job classification variable was collapsed into five categories: medical (consultants, registrars, residents, medical students), nursing, clinical support (dietician, social work, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, interpreter, pharmacy, security, patient services attendant), administration (including clerical staff) and hotel services. Respondents were also asked to respond to 16 statements using a 5-point Likert scale: 'strongly disagree', 'disagree', 'undecided', 'agree' and 'strongly agree'. Pearson's c 2 test was used to detect significant differences between positive responses (strongly agree or agree) from medical and nursing staff. This study was an anonymous, infection control quality improvement study and, in line with our hospital's policy, was exempted from application to the Research Ethics Committee.
