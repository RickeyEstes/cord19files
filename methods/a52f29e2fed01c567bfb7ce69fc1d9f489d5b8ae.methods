This study was conducted in Queen Mary Hospital, a university-affiliated acute regional public hospital of 1,700 beds in a health care network in Hong Kong West, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. Proactive infection control measures with an emphasis on timely education of health care workers and hospitalized patients about directly observed hand hygiene along with active surveillance, opportunistic "added test" screening, rapid laboratory diagnostics, appropriate patient isolation and decolonization, and extensive contact tracing for potential secondary cases were performed to minimize the risk of outbreaks in our hospital between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. The infection control team, composed of 1 infection control officer and 7 infection control nurses, conducted syndromic surveillance and monitored the detection of hospitalacquired microorganisms, defined as a positive microbiology test on specimens collected after 48 hours of admission, via a computerized surveillance system that is connected to the microbiology laboratory database. A clustering report is generated by the computerized surveillance system when 3 or more microorganisms are isolated in the same ward within 7 days. The retrospective surveillance period could be extended further if the microorganism has a longer incubation period. A hospital outbreak was defined as 3 or more patients acquiring epidemiologically important agents after 48 hours of hospitalization in the same ward. Epidemiologically important agents were classified into 4 categories: respiratory viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus), gastrointestinal pathogens (norovirus, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile), MDROs (VRE, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, multiple-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and MRSA in pediatric and neonatal units), and miscellaneous pathogens of known epidemiologic significance (eg, scabies). MRSA in adult units and extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were not included because these 2 groups of bacteria have been highly endemic locally for many years. However, we still included MRSA for surveillance in pediatric and neonatal units. In Hong Kong, the computerized surveillance system for outbreak detection was established for public hospitals under the governance of the Hospital Authority, which is a statutory governance structure managing all public hospitals. These 42 public hospitals are geographically organized in 7 hospital networks, namely Hong Kong West and Network A, B, C, D, E, and F, serving more than 90% of Hong Kong's population of 7 million. Each hospital network is led by the biggest acute regional hospital, such as Queen Mary Hospital leading the Hong Kong West network, and hospitals A1 (another tertiary referral hospital), B1, C1, D1, E1, and F1 of comparable bed numbers leading networks A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. The characteristics and services provided by the 7 acute regional hospitals are listed in Table 1 . When an outbreak occurs, the hospital infection control officer is required to notify the Hospital Authority and the Centre for Health Protection, Department of Health. Upon receiving an outbreak notification, a press statement is released and simultaneously uploaded to the public domain of the Hospital Authority website. The infection control performance of Queen Mary Hospital and Hong Kong West hospital network was analyzed with respect to the overall performance of the 7 regional hospitals and hospital networks. All acute regional hospitals and hospital networks had similar staff ratios in infection control: 1 infection control nurse per 250 beds. They do not implement similar proactive infection control measures but follow the Hospital Authority guidelines with regard to standard and transmission-based precautions for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of infectious diseases. Using the hospital outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and per 1 million patient-days as benchmarks, the performance of all public hospitals in regard to outbreak prevention can be measured.
