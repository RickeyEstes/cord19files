Fluorogenic substrates. Fluorogenic peptide substrates-NVS1 (Hylite Fluor488-EPDFHLQGPEDLAKE-K (QXL520)-NH2) and TVS2 (Hylite Fluor488-VWKMQSDEY-K(QXL520)-NH2)were designed based on the cleavage site between the N-terminal protein and helicase of the NoV polyprotein (Belliot 6 . Predicted secondary structures and active site residues in TV protease, and the reciprocal substrate cleavages of the TV and NoV proteases. (A) Predicted secondary structures and active site residues in TV protease. The predicted beta strands are represented by green arrows, whereas predicted loops and helical turns are shown in blue and red, respectively. Residues conserved or conservatively substituted (while conserving physico-chemical properties) between NoV and TV proteases are highlighted using yellow background. Active site residues are highlighted in red, and residues in contact with a peptide inhibitor in 2IPH (and thus defining the overall substrate binding cleft) are shown in blue. Notice that the active site and substrate binding cleft are within regions conserved between NoV and TV proteases (yellow patches). (B) The relative enzymatic activities of NoV protease on TV protease substrate TVS2, in comparison to on its native substrate NVS1. (C) The relative enzymatic activities of TV protease on NoV protease substrate NVS1, in comparison to on its native substrate TVS2.

Both substrates were synthesized and labeled by Anaspec (CA). The two fluorophores on each substrate form a quenching pair and exhibit FRET within the intact peptide. Upon the cleavage between Q and G residues on NVS1 by NoV protease, or between Q and S residues on TVS2 by TV protease (Fig. 4A) , the donor fluorophore (Hylite Fluor488) separates from the quenching fluorophore (QXL520), allowing activities of protease to be measured. Stock solution of the fluorogenic substrate was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and subsequent dilution was prepared with the assay buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 20% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT). Generation of protease expression constructs. To express the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-protease fusion proteins in E.coli, protease coding sequences were amplified from NoV cDNA (Genbank#: NC_001959) with primers p1405B and p1406 (Table 1) , and TV cDNA (Genbank#: EU391643) with primers p1069c and p1071b (Table 1) , respectively, and were cloned into vector pGEX4T1 (GE Health-care, PA) at BamHI/SalI sites. To express N-terminal histidine (his)-tagged proteases, the same inserts were cloned into vector pQE30 (Qiagen, CA) at the identical cloning sites. Generation of recombinant TV polyprotein fragment expression constructs. To express TV polyprotein fragments containing predicted protease cleavage sites in the forms of maltose binding protein (MBP) or GST-fusion proteins, the corresponding TV cDNAs (Genbank#: EU391643) were amplified with specific primers (Table 1) , and cloned into vector pMAL-c2X (New England Biolab, MA) or vector pGEX4T1 (GE Health-care, PA) ( Fig. 2A) . Protein expression and purification. GST-protease fusion proteins, GST-polyprotein fragment fusion proteins, and MBPpolyprotein fragment fusion proteins were expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) plysS (EMD Millipore, MA) under the induction of 0.4 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at room temperature. The his-tagged proteases were expressed in E. coli M15 (Qiagen, CA) under the identical induction and culture condition. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 Â g for 15 min. For GST-fusion protein purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1X PBS with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). For MBP-fusion protein purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in column buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) with 1 mM PMSF. For his-tagged protease purification, the cell pellets were resuspended in cell resuspension buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) with 1 mM PMSF. The cell resuspensions were subjected to sonication, then cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 Â g for 60 min. MBP-, GST-fusion and his-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resins (New England Biolabs, MA), Glutathione Sepharose 4B resins (GE Healthcare, PA), or Talon cell trus affinity resins (Clontech, CA). Purified GST-fusion proteases were further digested with thrombin and subsequently purified with gel permeation chromatography using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, PA). The elution profile was monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 280 nm and the elution fractions were collected and dialyzed with protease buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) (Blakeney et al., 2003) , while his-tagged proteases were dialyzed with buffer containing 50 mM NaH 2 SO 4 , pH4.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM mercaptoethanol (Zeitler et al., 2006) . Proteases were then stored at À80 1C in small aliquots. The purity of the proteins was verified with SDS PAGE and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein concentration assay (BioRad, CA). Protease activity analysis using fluorogenic peptide substrates. For protease activity assays, 2 mM of each protease was mixed with 10 nM of fluorogenic peptide substrate NVS1 or TVS2 in protease buffer, and were transferred to black 96-well non-treated microtiter plates (Corning, NY), with final reaction volume of 50 ml/well. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 1C. The fluorescence was detected using Multimode detector 880 (Beckman Coulter, CA) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm, respectively. The protease activities were determined from averages of duplicate or triplicate tests. Optimization of reaction conditions. To determine the effects of pH, ionic strength, glycerol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the enzymatic activities of the NoV protease, the concentrations of individual buffer components in the standard protease activity assay conditions described above were adjusted. The pH profile was determined at constant ionic strength with a pH range from 5.0 to 9.0, using a variety of buffers suitable for various pHs: 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT for pH 5-6.5; or 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT for pH 7-9 (Nall et al., 2004) . The percentage of enzymatic activities was determined by comparing mean relative fluorescent units (RFU) at various points to the highest RFU in the same set of assays. Polyprotein cleavage and peptide N-terminal sequencing. Purified TV polyprotein fragments and purified TV protease were incubated at room temperature overnight. The cleaved products were run on SDS gels and blotted to PVDF membranes. After staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, the desired bands were excised for the peptide N-terminal sequencing. The peptide N-terminal sequencing services were performed by the protein facility at Iowa State University, Ames, IA. Prediction of the secondary structures and active site residues in TV protease. BLASTp was used to align TV protease sequence to the closest structurally resolved NoV protease (PDB code 2IPH), which allowed us to map secondary structures from the NoV template into TV protease between residues 18 and 162. For the remaining N-and C-termini residues, secondary structures predicted by SABLE (http://sable.cchmc.org) are used to provide the overall predicted structure of TV protease. Inhibition assays. To allow formation of enzyme/inhibitor complexes, 2 mM of each protease was pre-incubated with inhibitors at desirable concentrations in protease buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The proteolytic reaction was then initiated by the addition of the fluorogenic peptide substrates (2.5 mM). The final reaction mixtures were transferred to black, 96-well non-treated microtiter plates and were incubated for 60 min at 37 1C. The fluorescence emissions were measured in triplicate for each data point, as described above. Percent inhibition was determined by comparing the mean RFU of each reaction with inhibitors to the corresponding mean RFU of the reaction without inhibitors. The IC 50 values were determined from reaction mixtures containing various concentrations of inhibitors ranging from 0 to 1000 mM. Generation of mouse anti-TV-3Al antibodies. The coding region of TV 3Al (aa574-712) was amplified with primers p1282b and p1283b (Table 1) , and was cloned into pQE30 vector (Qiagen). The his-TV3Al protein was then expressed in E.coli M15 (Qiagen) under the induction of 0.4 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for overnight at room temperature. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 Â g for 15 min. To purify the his-3Al protein, the cell pellets were resuspended 1x lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The cell resuspensions were then subjected to sonication, and the cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 Â g for 60 min. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using TALON His-Tag Purification Resin (Clonetech). Mouse anti-TV3Al polycolonal antibodies were generated follow a conventional antibody generation procedure. (2000), Wirblich et al. (1995)
