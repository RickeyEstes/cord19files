In January 2016, 14 survivors from the 1976 Yambuku EVD outbreak were identified using DRC Ministry of Health reports. Six of the identified participants were considered confirmed cases and enrolled in the plasmapheresis study conducted after 1976, with symptoms and molecular analyses that were considered positive at the time [12] . The remaining 8 participants were suspected cases based on Ministry of Health reports along with in-person interviews, and confirmation from health-care workers present during the outbreak. Participants were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics, health history, current health status, and exposure to wildlife and potentially infected humans. Upon review of the questionnaire responses, all 14 survivors reported symptoms of EVD (fever or unexplained bleeding or any three of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccups, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [13] ) during the outbreak between August and November 1976. Study participants were also asked to complete a physical assessment, which included weight, height, and blood pressure. Blood specimens were obtained from participants by venipuncture in vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences). After processing, aliquots of serum, plasma and buffy coat were frozen and stored in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa and shipped to collaborating institutions.
