Animals. Disease-free male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 232-268 g were purchased from Bantin and Kingman (Fremont, CA), and maintained on Purina rodent laboratory chow No. 5001 and water ad libitum. They were serologically determined to be free of antibodies to pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus 3, Theiler's virus, Sendai virus, Kilham rat virus, H-I virus, mouse adenovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rat corona virus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, and M. pulrnonis (Microbiological Associates, Bethesda, MD). Serological monitoring of both ozone-exposed and control animals was done before and after the inhalation exposures. Inhalation exposures. Ten rats were exposed to chemically and biologically filtered air (FA) for 60 days (FA preexposure group) while 10 rats were exposed to FA plus 0.96 ppm ozone (0,) 8 hr/night for 60 days (0s preexposure group). The animal housing, exposures, ozone generation, and monitoring were conducted according to standard procedures at the California Primate Research Center inhalation exposure facility (Last et al., 1983) . The rats were maintained with a lo-hr light and 14-hr dark cycle. Explant exposures. After 60 days of either FA preexposure or O3 preexposure, the rats were deeply anesthetized and their tracheae were removed and placed in exposure vessels mounted on a rocking platform in a tracheal culture system where they were intermittently exposed to an atmosphere of 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and either 0 or 3 ppm O3 (Nikula and Wilson, 1986) . Three ppm OX was chosen as the test concentration in this experiment because this concentration had been shown to cause readily detectable morphologic damage (ciliated cell injury, necrosis, and sloughing of cells) to tracheal epithelium which resembled lesions induced by ozone exposure in vivo (Nikula and Wilson, 1986) . The explant exposures were conducted with 10 tracheal explants in each of two 24-hr trials (Table 1) . After the 24-hr explant exposures, the tracheae were placed in 2% glutaraldehyde fixative and 0.1 M cacodylic acid buffer (pH 7.4, 385 mOsm). Microscopic analysis. Transverse sections of trachea that included cartilage ring 10 (counting rings from the carina proximally) were washed in Zetterquist's wash (Pease, 1964) and postfixed in 1% 0~0~ Zetterquist's solution for 2 hr at 25Â°C. The tissues were washed and block stained with 2% uranyl acetate overnight. The specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols followed by propylene oxide and embedded in Epon-Araldite. The membranous portion was reembedded in Beem capsules for ultrathin sectioning. Thin sections (approximately 90 nm) were made with a Sorvall MT2B ultramicrotome and a diamond knife and were mounted on Formvarcoated slotted copper grids. Specimens were coded and viewed randomly with a Zeiss Model EM-10 transmission electron microscope, and montages were prepared by photographic enlargement to 2720X on 5 X 7-in. prints. Cell counts were estimated by classifying the cell type of the central 100 nuclear profiles in the specimen. The numerical density (nuclei/mm) was determined by measuring the length of the corresponding basement membrane using a planimeter (MOP-3, Zeiss, Inc.). Statisticalanalysis ofdata. The numerical density data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's least significant difference multiple comparison test at a levels of 0.05 and 0.0 1 (Kossack and Henschke, 1975 ; Numbercruncher statistical systems, version 3.1, Keysville, UT).
