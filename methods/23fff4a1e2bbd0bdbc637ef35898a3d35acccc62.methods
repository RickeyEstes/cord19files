The children in the study were those under the age of five years referred to a large infectious diseases unit over a twelve-month period from May I978 to April 1979 inclusive, because of acute diarrhoea regardless of any other factors. They were studied prospectively. A detailed history, which included data on feeding, contact and past history, was taken and examination was performed with special reference to the temperature, ears, nose, and throat, chest, weight and state of hydration. Haemoglobin, white-cell count, sedimentation rate, urea, electrolytes and bicarbonate values in the blood were estimated. Notes were made of treatment, feeding requirements and progress. Three bacterial cultures of the patients' faeces were prepared, each using McConkey's agar, desoxycholate agar, selenite selective broth, mannitol salt agar and latterly, Skirrow's medium. Potentially pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli were identified for the following serotypes: oI Sac, o26, o44, o55, o86, OIII, OII2ac, OII4, OII9, 0124, 0125, 0126, 0127, OI28 and oi42. Viral cultures of the faeces using rhesus monkey or baboon kidney, green monkey kidney and HEP 2 tissue cultures were instituted. Stool specimens for EM were prepared by suspension with phosphatebuffered saline, differential centrifugation, deposition on to standard copper grids pre-coated with formvar and carbon and stained with phosphotungstic acid. EM scanning was performed for 3o minutes on each specimen, mostly at a magnification of 4oooo. All stool specimens were, if not immediately transported to the laboratories, stored at 4 Â°C. As an adjunct study, stool specimens were collected from Io8 controls with other illnesses but without diarrhoea. EM and viral cultures as described above were performed on these.
