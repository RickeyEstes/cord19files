The main factor under surveillance was live births. A live birth was defined as a fetus born after 28 weeks of gestation (or with a birth weight >1000 g) with at least one of the following vital signs: heartbeat, breathing, pulsation of the umbilical cord or contraction of voluntary muscle. Only live births or the parents of those births on the census register in Beijing were included. From 1992 to 2015 a total of 1 881 952 live births and 12 541 deaths were recorded. Categorization of the causes of death was in accordance with the International Categorization of Diseases (ICD-10). Because the data on the deaths of under-5 children in Beijing were derived from the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Surveillance Network, no further ethical approval was required for the present study.
