The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the School of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University under nÂ°10-005. This study was conducted on February 1st and February 4th, 2010 (first snapshot) and on February 1st and February 3rd, 2011 (second snapshot) in 2 homeless shelters (designated A and B) in Marseille, France, as previously described [4] . After written informed consent for participation, homeless persons were interviewed and examined by a medical doctor. Thereafter, nasal specimens were collected with a 2-ml MW950S virocult swab (Sigma, Wiltshire, U.K.). Ten respiratory viruses were tested using real-time RT-PCR [6] : influenza virus A, B and A/2009/H1N1, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV-A, RSV-B) human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43 and E229, human rhinovirus (HRV), enteroviruses (EV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data were analysed with SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Two-tailed tests were used for comparisons. Differences in proportions were tested using Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
