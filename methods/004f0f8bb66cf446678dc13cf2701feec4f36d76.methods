This study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China. Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.
