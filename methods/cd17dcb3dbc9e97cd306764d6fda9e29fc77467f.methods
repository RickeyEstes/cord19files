This is a secondary analysis of the 30th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration prospective observational study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. The study design, setting, participants, and methods of data collection have been described previously. 2 Briefly, site teams at 16 hospitals across 12 US states enrolled children age <2 years with an attending physician diagnosis of bronchiolitis for up to 3 consecutive years during the 2007-2010 winter seasons using a standardized protocol. All medical decisions, including testing for viruses, were at the discretion of the treating clinicians. During the study period, no sites were routinely testing for rhinovirus. The institutional review board at each participating hospital approved the study. Investigators conducted structured interviews assessing patients' demographic characteristics, medical history, and details of the acute illness. Pre-admission and daily hospital clinical data were obtained by chart review. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected using a standardized protocol. 2 Polymerase chain reaction assays used single-plex or duplex 2step real-time polymerase chain reaction for RSV types A and B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza virus types A and B, 2009 novel H1N1, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses NL-63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E, enterovirus, adenovirus. This testing was conducted from 2008-2010, as described previously. 2
