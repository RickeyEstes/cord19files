We included all patients who tested positive and who underwent more than 1 MERS-CoV test of respiratory tract samples. PMAH policy calls for a minimum of 2 samples obtained 48 hours apart for suspected MERS-CoV cases; more samples can be obtained in the event of very high suspicion, at the treating physician's discretion. However, the attending physician can override this policy if he or she deems that more testing is needed. Clearing a negative MERS-CoV case requires a minimum of 2 negative samples obtained 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization. Some patients underwent repeat testing at the discretion of the treating clinicians, and the testing was nonsystematic. MERS-CoV tests were done on either Cobon-flocked nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples. The respiratory samples were tested using RT-PCR amplification targeting the upstream E protein gene (upE) and ORF1a for confirmation, as described previously. 8, 15 A probable case was defined as a patient testing positive for 1 of the genes who underwent no further testing but had a history of potential exposure and consistent clinical signs and symptoms. A confirmed case was defined as a patient testing positive for the 2 genes. Early in the course of MERS-CoV, all samples were analyzed at the Riyadh regional laboratory, but starting in 2015, after a period of validation, samples were tested at the PMAH laboratory to expedite the reporting process. Obtaining the results takes 6-8 hours; usually all samples are run first thing in the morning, but samples can be run any time during the day or night depending on urgency. We included patients who had intermittently positive MERS-CoV test results after an initial negative test. We considered a case negative if 2 or more consecutive samples were negative by RT-PCR.
