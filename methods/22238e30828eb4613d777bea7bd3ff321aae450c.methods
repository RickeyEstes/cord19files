Data source. Surveillance data were collected using the GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network platform. This network comprises 57 specialized travel and tropical medicine clinics on 6 continents, which contribute anonymous, delinked clinician-and questionnairebased travel surveillance data on all ill travellers examined to a centralized Structured Query Language database 10, 11 (for additional details, see www.geosentinel. org). The GeoSentinel data-collection protocol is reviewed cyclically by the institutional review board officer at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is classified as public health surveillance, not human-subjects research requiring submission to and approval from institutional review boards. Canada currently has 6 sites in 4 provinces belonging to the global GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network, which have grouped together as the core sites of CanTravNet, the Canadian Travel Medicine Network. The 6 Canadian sites are large referral-based outpatient clinics that primarily serve the Greater Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal areas, which together account for 47% of the Canadian population (or a catchment of about 15.5 million people). They are staffed by specialists in travel and tropical medicine and are typically secondary or tertiary points of care for patients, although immediate referral from the emergency departments attached to the respective parent hospitals is common. All of the centres provide post-travel services, which are billed under the provincial health plans. Collected data include each patient's demographic characteristics, detailed recent travel itinerary, all countries visited within the past 5 years, reason for travel, affected organ system, and whether the patient had a pretravel encounter with a health care provider. Final diagnoses are made by the attending physicians at each CanTravNet site, and each diagnosis is assigned a diagnostic code selected from a standardized list of more than 500 diagnostic entities, some of which are etiologic (e.g., Campylobacter) and others of which are syndromic (e.g., acute diarrhea). Syndromic codes are entered when an etiologic code cannot be assigned because of use of empiric therapy, self-limited disease, or inability to justify complete or sophisticated work-up as part of routine clinical practice. All CanTravNet sites contribute microbiologically confirmed data, where available, based on the best reference diagnostic tests (including serologic assays and polymerase chain reaction) available in Canada at the time. "Probable" diagnoses are restricted to patients with pathognomonic physical findings (e.g., tick eschar), clinical response to highly specific therapy, or classical presentation and exposure history with laboratory exclusion of other possible etiologies. Definitions. Six possible reasons for most recent travel are available in GeoSentinel: immigration, including immigration by refugees; tourism; business; missionary, volunteer, research, or aid work; visiting friends and relatives; and "other," which includes travel for education, military service, and "medical tourism." Those whose reason for travel is listed as "immigration" include patients whose post-travel diagnosis is related to their emigration travel or long-term residence in the home country, rather than a particular isolated international trip. 11 Examples of diagnoses attributable to immigration-related travel are leprosy, tuberculosis, and certain chronic helminthic infections, such as hydatid disease or neurocysticercosis, as well as diseases imported by new immigrants to Canada. Travel to visit friends and relatives is defined as travel by an immigrant who is ethnically and/or racially distinct from the majority population in his or her current country of residence and who is returning to his or her homeland to visit friends and relatives. This type of travel also refers to travel by children of foreign-born parents (i.e., second-generation immigrants) who return to their parents' homeland to visit friends and relatives. The term "visiting friends and relatives" is typically applied to individuals travelling from a high-income country of current residence to a low-income country of origin. 12 "Medical tourists" are defined as those whose primary purpose of travel is to seek emergency or elective care and who, as a consequence of the travel, acquire an infectious complication secondary to the medical care received or become ill with an infectious or noninfectious disease while abroad. Countries of exposure and travel were assigned to 1 of 14 regional classifications: 11 North America, Central America, the Caribbean, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia, South East Asia, North East Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and Oceania. Inclusion criteria. We extracted and analyzed demographic, clinical, and travel-related data on Canadian citizens and new immigrants to Canada encountered after completion of their international travel or residence abroad and seen from September 2009 to September 2011 at any of 5 CanTravNet sites that were in operation at that time. We included only patients with probable or confirmed final diagnoses (specific etiologic or syndromic diagnoses, as described above). The term "cohort of travellers" refers to the entire cohort of travellers encountered at CanTravNet sites, including immigrants. "Ill returned travellers" refers to travellers or immigrants within the larger cohort who were deemed to have a definitive "travel-related" diagnosis, as opposed to diagnoses unrelated to travel or not ascertainable. Statistical analysis. Extracted data were managed in a Microsoft Access database and were analyzed with standard parametric and nonparametric techniques. Data for categorical variables were compared with Yates' corrected Ï‡ 2 analysis, and data for continuous variables were analyzed for significant differences with the Student t test or, in the case of non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Differences between groups of continuous variables were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Statistical computations were performed with SigmaStat 2.03 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
