Bioaerosol sampling. From January 2017 through January 2018, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) BC 251 2-stage aerosol samplers were used to collect aerosol samples from the following Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) heavy rail lines: East West Line (EWL; green), and North East Line (NEL; purple). MRT lines were selected for their high capacity (~1,600 passengers per 6-car train), frequent use, and connection to high-traffic public areas. The EWL was specifically chosen for its connection to Changi Airport, and the NEL for its connection to downtown Singapore. Aerosol samples were collected weekly, with occasional interruptions, during peak ridership (~267 passengers/car or 5 pax/m 2 ) from 7:30-9:00 and 17:30-19:00 on Wednesdays. Sampling days varied occasionally due to public holidays and the researchers' availability. Using a 2-foot (61 cm) long piece of ¼" (0.635 cm) Tygon tubing, NIOSH samplers were connected to AirChek ® TOUCH Sample Pumps (SKC, Eighty Four, Pennsylvania) carried inside personal backpacks worn by the researchers. Both straps were tightened around the shoulders to secure the backpack against the researcher's back. NIOSH samplers were securely fastened to the front of the backpacks (on or above the researcher's heart) using Velcro (Fig. 1) . For each separate MRT line (i.e., green and purple), the same assembled NIOSH sampler was used for both AM and PM sampling sessions. To ensure all researchers followed the same sampling protocol, each researcher sampled one of the middle train-cars and remained standing with intermittent walking throughout each sampling session. Between AM and PM sampling sessions, sampler inlets were covered with electrical tape and the assembled samplers were refrigerated. All of the material collected by one NIOSH sampler during 3 hours of sampling was counted as one aerosol sample. Before aerosol sampling, air pumps were calibrated to sample at 3.5 L min −1 collecting a total of 630 L of air per MRT line each week. Calibration was performed by inserting the sampler into a calibration adaptor (designed for NIOSH samplers) attached to an SKC check-mate calibrator. NIOSH samplers were engineered to separate collected particles into three size fractions: >4 μm, 1-4 μm, and <1 μm in diameter 33 . Prior to molecular analysis, the particles collected in the 1-4 μm and <1 μm size fractions were combined (see sample processing below). Therefore, our study reports molecular results for two particle size fractions (droplets >4 μm and droplet nuclei ≤4 μm). If processed directly, the minimum time duration between the start of sample collection and reporting of assay results (for one, 3 hr aerosol sample) was 14 hours. However, most of the DNA/RNA extracted from the aerosol samples was stored at −80 °C and analyzed in monthly batches. NIOSH samplers were rinsed with deionized water and soaked in 70% ethanol between each sampling day and a swab sample of the sterilized NIOSH sampler interior was used as a negative control sample for each sampling day. Negative control swabs were transferred to tubes containing 1 mL of 0.5% BSA solution, vortexed for 15 seconds, and discarded. Negative control sample solutions were stored at −80 °C prior to further analyses. Environmental data collection. Ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH) and light intensity were logged during each sampling session using portable HOBO data loggers (Onset; Bourne, MA, USA) tied to the sampling backpacks worn by the researchers. Using Bluetooth Low Energy Technology, each HOBO data logger wirelessly transmitted data to the researcher's mobile device using the HOBOmobile application. Once sampling was complete, researchers used the application to stop the data logger and convert the data file to an excel file before sending the data to a designated research assistant's email address. Data were then recorded onto a master excel file. Sample processing. A UV-sterilized Biological Safety Cabinet Class II and sterile consumables and equipment were used to process samples. Using a filter-handling kit (225-8372; SKC), each polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter was removed from the NIOSH sampler cassettes and transferred to a 50 mL Falcon tube and vortexed while dry for 5 seconds. To minimize cross-contamination, forceps were sterilized with 70% ethanol in between each filter transfer. One milliliter of 0.5% BSA solution was then added to each 50 mL Falcon tube containing a filter and vortexed again for 15 seconds. One milliliter of 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution was added to each 1.5 mL conical tube from the NIOSH samplers and vortexed for 10 seconds. Using cryotube vials, the BSA solutions from the 50 mL Falcon tubes containing filters were pooled together with their respective 1.5 mL conical tube sample. Two milliliters of BSA solution were added to each 15 mL Falcon tube from the NIOSH samplers, vortexed for 15 seconds, and transferred to cryotube vials. Nucleic acid extraction and real-time RT-PCR/PCR. DNA/RNA was extracted from 0.5 mL of each aerosol sample and negative control sample solution using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit and QIAamp DNA Blood kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Using previously validated probe-based molecular assays [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] adapted to the Duke-NUS Laboratory of One Health Research, extracted RNA was tested for the presence/absence of influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, and RSV subtypes A and B using superscript III One-step real-time RT-PCR with Platinum Taq Polymerase. RSV-A and RSV-B assays were not adapted to our laboratory during the time of sampling and therefore were performed 3 months after the last aerosol sample was collected. Extracted DNA was tested for the presence/absence of adenoviruses by real-time PCR 43 using a QuantiNova Probe PCR kit (Qiagen). Three negative control reactions (no template) were included in each real-time RT-PCR/PCR assay. A positive aerosol sample was one in which virus was detected in one or more of the NIOSH sampler stages, with a Ct value < 40. Stage 2 (1.5 mL tube) and stage 3 (filter) were combined to represent respirable particles (i.e., droplet nuclei ≤4 μm in diameter) compared with particles that are only inhalable (i.e., droplets >4 μm in diameter) collected in stage 1 (15 mL tube). Cell culture and DNA sequencing. Virus-positive samples were tested for viability using cell culture. First, 500 μL of each adenovirus-positive aerosol sample was inoculated into A549 cells (ATCC) with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) 2% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 °C. MDCK cells were used to culture the influenza A virus-positive and suspect-positive aerosol samples. Inoculated shell vials were then observed for cytopathic effect 72 hours after inoculation, and daily for ten days afterwards. Observation of cytopathic effect was used to score positive or negative cultures. RSV-positive samples were not tested for viability as RSV assays were not performed until after all of the original aerosol sample material had been used for DNA/RNA extraction, leaving us with no original sample material to perform cell culture on RSV-positive
