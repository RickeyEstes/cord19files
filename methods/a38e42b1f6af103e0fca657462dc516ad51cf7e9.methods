We searched EMBASE and Medline for reports on livestock associated (LA) zoonoses combined with human-livestock interactions. Our search terms and selection steps are given in Appendix A. We also scrutinised references of the included publications. Publications until the 22nd of September 2014 were included. We included publications reporting on zoonoses from livestock animals, human-livestock contacts, human-livestock contacts and infectious disease transmission, and in case of multiple human LA-zoonosis case reports, exact DNA matches between livestock and human isolates. Peer-reviewed, original research in English, Dutch or German language was included. We excluded articles describing; vector borne diseases, experimental laboratory studies, xenotransplantation-related diseases, reports on diseases with livestock as a dead-end host (e.g. Rabies, Schistosomiasis, Malaria, and Trypanosoma), papers evaluating diseases linked to wildlife hosts (e.g. bat-related and primate (bushmeat)-related diseases), as well as papers discussing food related zoonosis outbreaks. These articles were excluded because these zoonotic pathogens, are not transmitted through direct contact between livestock and humans. Selected papers were either articles or articles in press, other publication types were removed from the selection. Titles and abstracts of retrieved publications were evaluated regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria by GK together with RAC.
