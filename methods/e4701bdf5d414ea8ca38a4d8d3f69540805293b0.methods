On admission, 107 and 21 patients were divided into non-severe and severe groups, respectively. A confirmed case with COVID-19 was defined as a positive result to real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 7 . Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included the analysis. Suspected patients and clinical diagnosised patients were not part of our study. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Xiangyang No. 1Hospital with written informed consent from the patients. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data between groups with variables were compared by Ï‡ 2 test or Fisher's exact test, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. All means were reported with the corresponding standard deviation in tables. The P values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
