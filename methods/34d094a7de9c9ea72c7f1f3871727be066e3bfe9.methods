The objectives of our analysis were to describe the cohort of individuals placed under travel restrictions since inception and demonstrate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing commercial air travel of individuals with communicable disease who are identified by health agencies and meet criteria for placement. For all individuals for whom travel restrictions are requested, CDC maintains case records in its Quarantine Activity Reporting System (QARS), a secure, restricted-access database [9] . Demographic and clinical information is obtained from the requesting agency, typically local and state health departments, as well as evidence that the addition and removal criteria are met, dates and times of significant events leading to addition or removal of federal travel restrictions, and outcomes following removal. We reviewed de-identified case data for all individuals considered for or placed on travel restrictions because of a suspected or confirmed communicable disease from May 22, 2007, to December 31, 2015; individuals considered for or placed on travel restriction related to an exposure to a communicable disease were not included in this analysis. CDC determined that this analysis did not meet the definition of research and was not subject to review by the CDC Institutional Review Board. We summarized the number of requests for consideration of travel restrictions, the states, countries or agencies that made the request, and whether the request resulted in addition to the DNB and PHLO. Poisson regression was used to determine if the number of consultations for travel restrictions has significantly increased over time. Individuals could have multiple requests for consideration of travel restrictions and multiple DNB/PHLO actions. For all individuals placed on travel restrictions, we examined demographics including country of citizenship, sex, age, and location at time of DNB and PHLO placement (i.e., within or outside the U.S.). We dichotomized status of individuals as either 1) U.S. citizens or U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPR) or 2) foreign nationals, i.e., individuals who held immigrant or non-immigrant visas, were visiting from a visa-waiver country, were undocumented, or had an unknown status. We described the communicable diseases for which individuals were added to the DNB list and issued a PHLO. For those with suspected or confirmed TB, we described the final diagnosis based on laboratory confirmation of disease and categorized drug resistance as: 1) confirmed multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), defined as TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin; 2) confirmed extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), defined as TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the three injectable second-line drugs [10] ; or 3) confirmed non-XDR TB or non-MDR TB, which included mono-resistance to isoniazid or rifampin. Since removal from the DNB and PHLO for individuals with TB requires follow-up and treatment until noninfectious, we calculated the time each person spent on the list, which reflected the amount of time before becoming noninfectious and subsequent removal from travel restriction status. DHS notifies CDC when individuals listed on the DNB and PHLO try to travel; subsequently, individuals are often intercepted prior to or during travel. We examined interception events and dichotomized events as an individual attempting to obtain a boarding pass for a commercial flight departing within, to, or from the U.S. or as an interception occurring at a U.S. land border port of entry. We examined whether clinical follow up and referral to treatment were initiated after individuals on the DNB list and accompanying PHLO were intercepted before air travel or at a port of entry. We also compared DNB/PHLO processing times before and after 2011, when CDC and DHS leveraged a secure, Web-based information-sharing platform managed by DHS [11] , for sharing information including DNB/PHLO actions. All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.3, and we assessed significance at p < 0.05.
