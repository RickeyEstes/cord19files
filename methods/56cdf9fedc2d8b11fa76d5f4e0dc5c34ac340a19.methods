A retrospective study was conducted on 70 specimens (31 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 36 nasopharyngeal swabs and 3 bronchial aspirates, conserved at −80 • C) from patients with acute respiratory tract infection during the 2013-2014 period. Flu-positive samples (n = 49) were previously characterized as Flu A (n = 24) or Flu B (n = 25) either by an "in-house" rRT-PCR (h-rRT-PCR) 12 Flu A-positive samples were subsequently subtyped as H1pdm09 (n = 14) or H3 (n = 10) as previously described, 13 with modified primers SWH1.737-F (5 -ATT ACT GGA CAC TAG TAG AG-3) and SWH1.833-R (5 -GCA TTT CTT TCC ATT GCG AAT G-3 ), and Taqman ® probe SWH1.808-pr (5 -6FAM-TCG AAG CAA CTG GAA ATC TAG TGG TAC CG-BHQ1-3 ). The study protocol was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This was a non-interventional study with no additional investigation to routine procedures. No additional sampling or modification to the physician prescription was performed. Data analyses were carried out using an anonymous database. Data were analyzed with SPSS 15.0.1 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of all methods were determined. Two-by-two concordances were estimated by the Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement (k). Mean C t values of the h-rRT-PCR of positive and false-negative samples by each method were compared with the Mann Whitney U test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.
