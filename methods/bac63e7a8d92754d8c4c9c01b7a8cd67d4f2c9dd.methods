A paper survey was offered to all adults either presenting for emergency care or accompanying a patient to the emergency department (ED) of 3 hospitals in St Louis, Missouri during March through December 2011. Two of the hospitals were academic urban hospitals; one serving exclusively pediatrics patients (annual ED census 44,000) and the other was an adult facility (annual ED census 36,000). The third hospital was located in a suburban area and served all ages (annual ED census 55,000). All ED visitors/patients were approached during recruiting hours (recruiting hours/shifts consisted of day and night shift, and all days of the week). The only exclusions were age younger than 18 years, those presenting with an Emergency Severity Index of 1 (i.e., those with very high medical acuity), and those who were incapable of reading or speaking English. Only one person per group (patient and his/her accompanying family or friend(s)) could take the survey. Completed paper surveys were collected anonymously.
