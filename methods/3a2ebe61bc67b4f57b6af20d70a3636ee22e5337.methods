The data of a microbiological laboratory that serves a 1,400 bed tertiary care university hospital were analysed for species and frequency of bacterial organisms isolated from the respiratory and pulmonary tract. We analyzed 120 mouth wash solutions, 4,300 throat swabs, 6,420 tracheal secretions and 1,250 bronchial alveolar lavages collected between January 2006 and October 2007. The ten most frequently isolated organisms were summarized as top 10 organisms. Furthermore a literature review was performed to analyse the potential of the cultivated microorganisms to cause disease in healthy or immunocompromised patients. In addition, standard manuals of microbiology and infectious diseases were reviewed to collect data on physiological flora and on organisms that are known to cause infections of the respiratory and pulmonary tract. Finally a Medline search using the key words "bronchoscope", "cross infection" and "pseudo outbreak" was performed to identify outbreaks and pseudo-outbreaks in which organisms had been associated with bronchoscopic procedures.
