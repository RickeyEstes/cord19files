Serum samples were examined by method of indirect IFA and ELISA (double-antigen sandwich described as SARS-CoV nucleocaspid antigen in Gene-industry). Method of indirect IFA: Dilute the prepared serum with 1:10, extinct under 56ºC for 30 minutes, dilute with 1:20, draw 20 ul out, drop in different holes in the antigen piece, set negative and positive comparative serums, warm culture in a 37ºC for 30 min, PBS shake and wash 3 times, mixed with isothiocyanic acid Luciferin, warm culture in a 37ºC for 30 min, PBS wash 3 times, observe with fluorescence microscope. The antigen -capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (3) was established for the detection of anti-N protein antibody present in sera. A100-μl volume of serum was added to the well coated with recombinant N protein, and the plate was incubated at 37ºC for 30 min and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. A 10-μl volume of labeled antigen was added,and the plate was incubated for another 30 min and washed as already described,and then 100-μl of TMB substrate solution (0.1mg of tetramethybenzidine hydrochloride/ml, 0.01% H 2 O 2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH5.8)was added,the mixture was incubated at 37ºC for 20 min,the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 2 N sulfuric acid,and the absorbance at 450 nm (A 450 ) was determined .Samples with an A 450 of >0.15 (average A 450 +5 standard deviations of 900 samples from healthy people) were considered to be positive.
