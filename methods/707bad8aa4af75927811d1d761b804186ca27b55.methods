This pilot project involved the use of the patient biosimulator (Medical Education Technologies, Inc. [METI], Sarasota, FL) to demonstrate particle dispersal during a cough. When the biosimulator ''coughed,'' fluorescent powder was dispersed into the air, allowing the study subject to visualize the impact to themselves and the environment. The study subjects were able to see the particles move directly from the patient to the air and contaminate the environment as well as the subject's physical person (Fig 1) . The effectiveness of PPE was demonstrated using a black light that showed areas of fluorescent powder contamination and areas in which PPE provided a barrier, thereby preventing contamination. We used pre-/posttest knowledge assessments and observations of HCW-patient interactions to evaluate the impact of the visual demonstration of respiratory disease transmission on PPE use by HCWs. The study was conducted during the peak of the 2005 influenza season (January to March) to ensure that the HCWs could be observed interacting with the greatest number of patients with respiratory symptoms. The study was conducted at a university medical center in a large metropolitan city. Training sessions and observations took place in the ED. Initially, 22 RNs were recruited into the study; 2 subjects withdrew from the study following job transfers. An effort was made to recruit an equal number of day shift (7 am to 7 pm) and night shift (7 pm to 7 am) nurses into the study. The university hospital institutional review board approved the study. Eligible RNs were identified by the ED nurse manager and were informed of the study during scheduled staff meetings and by posted flyers. Eligible RNs were those nurses who were employed by the hospital; therefore, mobile or per diem nurses were excluded. During the staff meetings, the investigators provided a brief overview of the study, answered questions, and determined staff members' willingness and eligibility to participate in the study. The RNs who agreed to participate were provided with a consent form to sign. After the consent form was signed, all subjects were scheduled to attend classroom training. This training focused on mechanisms of disease transmission, standard precautions, and appropriate use of PPE. The 20 subjects were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received classroom training plus biosimulated visual training, and the control group received classroom training only. After group assignments were made, a colored sticker was placed on the subjects' identification badges to indicate participation in the study. Observers with experience in the education and training of health care personnel were trained to recognize and evaluate the use of PPE by study participants during real patient interaction. The observers were blinded to the subjects' group assignment. A work schedule was provided to the observers to allow equal opportunity for evaluation on both shifts throughout the observation period. The study was designed to continue until a minimum of 10 patient-subject interactions were observed for each study participant or until the ED activity indicated that the presentation of symptomatic patients had declined to a point that observation opportunities were minimal. Personal handheld computers were used for data entry by the observers. The investigators developed software, and training was provided to the observers. Use of the handheld data collection device allowed the observers to collect and record information in an unobtrusive manner and minimize data entry errors. Written scenarios and monitoring of real-time nursepatient interactions were observed in an effort to promote interrater reliability between the 2 observers. The 2 observers participated in specific education and evaluation sessions held prior to the study, during the study, and after completion of the study. Sessions were held with both observers together as well as separately. Scenarios were presented to determine the ability of each observer to identify the care setting (eg, triage, assessment) specific types of PPE (eg, mask vs N95 respirator), and symptoms exhibited by the patient (eg, temperature readings, cough, rhinitis). During all reviews, both observers consistently demonstrated 100% accuracy. Data were collected at 3 points in time: (1) Participants completed a knowledge assessment prior to the classroom training. The pretest phase included an assessment of subject's knowledge of respiratory pathogen transmission as well as standard precautions; (2) once classroom training was completed, the subjects retook the knowledge assessment; and (3) observations began after the posttest had occurred. Observations of the subjects' use of PPE were made in the weeks immediately following the completion of training. A patient-subject interaction was considered appropriate for study inclusion if the observers noted that the patient exhibited respiratory symptoms (ie, cough and/or fever). If the patient-subject interaction was appropriate, the observers evaluated the subject's behavior with regard to PPE use. The observers also recorded the patient's symptoms, the time and location of the care, and the care that was being provided. Type of care provided was coded as triage, physical assessment, invasive procedure, noninvasive procedure, and resuscitation event. Knowledge related to respiratory pathogen transmission and standard precautions guidelines were measured by a questionnaire developed for this study. Evaluations of the patient-subject interaction by the 2 trained observers included the date/time of observation, presenting diagnosis, procedure(s) performed during the observation episode, presence of respiratory symptoms, patient cooperation as related to each procedure, and a list of all PPE items used or worn by the observed HCW. The opportunity for the observer to make special comments that may impact the use of PPE (eg, if the patient is masked during the observation episode) was included in the data collection form. Table 1 . The 2 groups were found to be similar on most demographic variables. The age range was 23 to 56 years with a mean age of 38 years. The 2 groups were primarily female (95%), with slightly less than half (48%) having a college or graduate degree (bachelor's degree or master's degree in nursing).
