A comparative policy analysis of documents in BC and ON was conducted to understand key aspects of PHHR policy and planning during implementation of public health renewal activities. We defined policy as those 'courses of action (and inaction) that affect the set of institutions, organizations, services and funding arrangements of the health and health care system. It includes policy made in the public sector (by government) as well as in the private sector' [18] (p. 6). Policy analysis is the systematic and disciplined examination of policy with the objective of understanding the process, content, or outcomes of policy [18, 19] . In this analysis we were interested in analysing the content of PHHR-relevant policy and planning documents within the context of change in public health. The research team consisted of academic researchers and government decision-makers with public health expertise in both provinces; team members are also investigators on the larger RePHS study.
