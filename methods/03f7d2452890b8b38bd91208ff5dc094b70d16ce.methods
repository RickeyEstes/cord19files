The Infection Control Continuous Quality Improvement (IC-CQI) tool was developed in an acute teaching hospital in London, with over 1,200 inpatient beds and 8,000 staff spread across 7 hospitals on separate sites, providing emergency, general medicine, surgery, critical care, maternity, neonatal, and cancer services. Hand hygiene compliance monitoring was established, but other aspects of infection control practice were not systematically monitored. To create an IC-CQI tool and reporting framework the infection prevention team used the Pronovost Knowledge Translation Cycle 17 to review the current hand hygiene monitoring tool, and to develop a quality improvement data collection tool. The Barriers and Mitigation tool 18 was used to identify workplace improvement barriers and potential solutions that involved "walking the process": observing clinical processes and compliance measurement as they occurred in different clinical areas. A double loop learning cycle 19 was used to ensure that the context, values, assumptions, and culture of the whole organization were included in proposed quality improvement intervention using the Hexagon tool 20 framework to assess feasibility and how to engage with stakeholders. A variety of arrangements including questionnaires, day to day contacts with auditors, feedback from users via the IC-CQI data input system, discussion groups, and IC-CQI training sessions were made for providing feedback on the data collection tool and process, to meet the operational needs, including time constraints, of different practitioners and clinical areas. Modifications to the tool and implementation of the change were made in response to feedback. No other routine infection control performance data were collected apart from monthly hand hygiene compliance data collection and reporting that took place continuously across all clinical areas until this was replaced by the IC-CQI system. Intermittent validation was then undertaken of IC-CQI results including hand hygiene product availability, isolation practices, appropriateness of use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and compliance with standards of invasive devices insertion and management throughout the implementation period.
