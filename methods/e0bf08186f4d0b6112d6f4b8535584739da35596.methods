Study location and animals. Only puppies between 1 week to 4 months of age submitted for routine autopsy evaluation at the Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Southern Brazil to determine the cause of death by their owners between January 2013 to December 2017 were included. All autopsies and histopathologic findings were done by veterinary pathology residents (n = 7) under the supervision of two animal pathologists. These animals originated from several cities within the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil. The biological data of the puppies are given in Table 1 ; all data relative to breed, gender, age, clinical manifestation, and pathologic findings from autopsy reports were reviewed and tabulated. The owners of all dogs agreed to have the death of these animals investigated and consented to the usage of the results for scientific purposes. Organ selection, histopathology, and histochemical analyses. The FFPE tissue blocks and/or glass slides of all selected cases were reviewed; when necessary additional glass slides were prepared from the FFPE SCiEnTifiC REPORTS | (2018) 8:13477 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31540-0 blocks and routinely processed for histopathology with the Haematoxylin and Eosin stain (H&E). Only sections of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, lung, small intestine, eye, and liver were evaluated during this study. These organs were selected for analyses due to: 1) all were present in each puppy; 2) the infectious disease agents investigated are known to produce specific histopathologic pattern(s) in these organs; and 3) to maintain the uniformity of the pathologic investigation. In addition, when available, the target organs (e.g., eye, thymus, palatine tonsils, and urinary bladder) of these viral agents were also revised. Furthermore, the eye of a puppy with the "blue eye" phenomenon from a previous study in which five infectious disease agents were identified 10 was evaluated for histopathologic findings associated with CAdV-1, since in that previous study 10 the histopathologic features of the ocular lesions were not described. In specific cases, histochemical stains were used to assist in the identification of infectious disease pathogens; these included Gram, PAS, and GMS. The principal histopathologic pattern observed in each organ was reviewed, tabulated, and then related to specific infectious disease agent(s) due to the intralesional presence of these by IHC. Furthermore, all puppies were screened for CDV by RT-PCR, since this is the most prevalent and endemic infectious disease agent of dogs in urban cities of Brazil 15,16 . Detection of traditional infectious disease agents by immunohistochemistry. Selected FFPE tissue sections were fixed on silanized slides with Poly-L-lysine 0,1% (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), deparaffinized and hydrated in decreasing alcohol baths. Antigen retrieval (Supplemental Table 1 ) was done with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using either the electric pressure cooker system (Electrolux Pressure Cooker PCC10, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) or proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Subsequently, there was blocking of endogenous peroxidase with distilled water and hydrogen peroxide (6%) for 25 min. All primary antibodies were diluted (Supplemental Table 1 ) and incubated in a humid chamber at 4 °C for 18-20 hours. The SuperPicTure ™ Polymer Detection kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) served as the secondary antibody and was incubated onto the FFPE sections in a humid chamber for 25 min at 25 °C. Binding between tissue antigens and antibodies was visualized by adding the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Frederick, MD, USA) for 3 min. Finally, all slides were counter-stained with Harris haematoxylin and assembled with a commercial resin. Positive antigen controls consisted of FFPE tissue sections from previous studies 13, 18, 38, 63, 64 ; negative controls consisted of the diluents of the primary antibodies which substituted each primary antibody. Positive and negative controls were included in each assay. Positive immunoreactivity for CDV, CPV-2, and CAdV-2 was considered when there was cytoplasmic immunolabelling within epithelial cells; positive immunoreactivity for CAdV-1 was considered when there was intranuclear/intracytoplasmic immunolabelling in hepatocytes and intracytoplasmic in other epithelial cells. Molecular identification of canine (distemper) morbillivirus. Viral RNA was extracted from the urine or cerebellum of all dogs as described 65 , and then used in RT-PCR assays designed to amplify the 287 bp of CDV N gene 63 . Urine and fragments of the cerebellum were collected during autopsy and maintained at −80 °C until used in molecular analysis. Viral RNA from previous studies 10, 63 served as positive controls in all RT-PCR assays. Nuclease-free water (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as negative controls in all RT-PCR assays. All RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and examined under ultra-violet light. The RT-PCR products obtained were submitted for direct sequencing using the forward and reverse primers of each assay. Animal welfare issues. All methods used during this investigation were approved by and carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Universidade Estadual de Londrina relative to the usage of animals submitted for autopsy evaluation. The owners of all animals used during this study give consent for their usage in diagnostic and scientific activities.
