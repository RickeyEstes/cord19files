RABV challenge standard CVS-11 was kindly provided by Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, and passaged in BSR to establish the primary, master, and working virus seed lots. The working seed were used in the RFFIT and live virus animal model. 50 rabies-negative human serum samples were kindly provided by Shanghai RAAS Blood Products Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) 36 for the specificity determination of the rabies PBNA. 320 post-vaccinated human serum samples were collected from a phase III clinical trial for a rabies vaccine produced in Vero cell (chinadrugtrials. gov.cn ID: CTR20140821) were kindly provided by Hualan Biological Engineering, Inc. (Henan, China) . Healthy volunteers received rabies vaccination intramuscularly on day 0 (2 doses), 7 (1 dose), and 21 (1 dose). Of the 320 serum samples, 32 were collected on day 7 before the second vaccination, while 288 were collected on day 35. The national standard for anti-rabies immunoglobulin collected from post-vaccination individual was established and calibrated with the 2nd International Standard for anti-rabies immunoglobulin, human (NIBSC code: RAI). Two serum samples used as the internal control for the RFFIT were also collected from post-vaccinated individuals and calibrated using the International standard. The assigned value for the national standard was 37.0 IU/ml. The assigned values for the internal control samples A and B were 2.2-3.6 IU/ml and 7.1-12.9 IU/ml (average ± SD) respectively. Written informed consents were obtained from all the volunteers. Fluc from pcDNA3.1.fluc and sCMV.fluc from psCMV.fluc were amplified and cloned respectively into pSG3Δ Env to generate pSG3Δ Env.fluc using restriction endonuclease digestion (Hpa I) and direct ligation (In-Fusion). Similarly, sCMV-fluc was constructed to generate pSG3Δ Env.sCMV.fluc. All the primers used in this section were listed in Table 1 .
