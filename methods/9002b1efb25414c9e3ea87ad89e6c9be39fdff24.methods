A non-systematic, narrative review to retrieve the scientific evidence on imported enteric (i.e., typhoid and paratyphoid) fever diagnosed in high income countries was carried out to describe relevant clinical and public health features. The search engine PubMed was used to select peer-reviewed articles, published from 1January 2013 to 30 October 2019. References of the selected manuscripts were carefully assessed to detect important articles not included in the primary search. No detailed selection criteria were adopted to choose the articles. The following keywords were used to find articles on imported enteric fever-related diagnosis, therapy, epidemiology, and prevention: "typhoid fever", "enteric fever", and "travel". In total, 207 records, published between January 2013 and October 2019, were found. Based on titles, abstracts, and full-texts, 71 (34.3%) studies were deemed suitable. Twenty-three (32.4%) were focused on epidemiological characteristics of enteric fever, fourteen (19.7%) on vaccines, fourteen (19.7%) on antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp. serotypes, ten (14.1%) on population groups at higher risk of acquiring typhoid fever, and ten (14.1%) on diagnosis and treatment.
