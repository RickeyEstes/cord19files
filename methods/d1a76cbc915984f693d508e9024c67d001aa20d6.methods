The Scopus database was searched for all Englishlanguage literature on the economic evaluation of mask or respirator use for the control of respiratory infection transmission. Scopus includes 100 % coverage of both MEDLINE and EMBASE [14] . The majority of the relevant literature identified in the initial Scopus search included influenza or tuberculosis as either the single focus or one of the diseases to control. For this reason, these terms (influenza OR tuberculosis) were used in addition to the generic terms related to infection and transmission, i.e. they did not prevent the identification of articles focused on other infectious respiratory diseases. The final search strategy contained publications until the 1st of August 2014, and used the search terms (as keyword, title or abstract): 'facemask*' (or 'mask*' or 'respirator' or 'N95' or 'non$pharm*' or '{personal protect*}') AND 'economic*' (or 'cost*') AND 'infect*' (or 'transmi*' or 'influenza' or 'tuberculosis'). The 806 results from this initial Scopus search were screened (Fig. 1) . The abstracts of these articles were reviewed on the basis of whether they were economic evaluations (e.g. cost-effectiveness, cost-utility or costbenefit studies), and whether the intervention being evaluated involved masks and/or respirators as a strategy to prevent the transmission of respiratory infections. From this process, 112 full text articles were considered potentially relevant and their full texts were further reviewed for eligibility. Of these, only six were confirmed to be economic evaluations of mask or respirator infection control interventions. One additional study by Dan et al. [12] was identified from the reference list of a systematic review [13] . These were the main studies used in our qualitative synthesis. Four other costing studies [15] [16] [17] [18] have been published but these examined the cost of the intervention only and were not classified as full economic evaluations (i.e. they did not examine the health impacts or the cost savings from prevented illness). Data from the included studies was independently extracted intro a spread sheet by SM and this was reviewed by ATN. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between these authors.
