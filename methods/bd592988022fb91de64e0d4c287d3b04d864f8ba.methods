We used four types of input-age, gender, diagnoses (three-digit ICD-9 codes), and results of laboratory tests on blood samples added to the record in the seven days before a given test was ordered-to build simple, robust models for whether the result of a test would be within the reference interval (''normal'') or outside of it in a given direction (''abnormal''), treating high and low results separately. We based our study on 10 years of records from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), a 585-bed tertiary care center in Boston, MA. We first anonymized records and reconciled test names (work approved by BIDMC Committee on Clinical Investigation's Institutional Review Board for Research Involving Human Subjects, protocol 2012-P-000229/ 01). Informed consent was not obtained because patient records/ information was anonymized prior to analysis. Each blood test (the test of interest), over 69.4 million in all, was marked as an in-house test (performed at the hospital) or a sendout (performed off-site). For each test, we compiled a list of all instances in which the test was ordered and performed. For each instance, we recorded the patient's age, gender, and any diagnoses or other blood-test test results from the seven days prior to the result of interest. When a test was ordered multiple times within a seven-day period, we considered only the most recent one (i.e., the one closest in time to the sendout order) as input data. For relevance, we considered only those tests that were ordered at least 1,000 times over the entire 10-year period, for an average of at least twice a week. We randomly divided the resulting instances into a training set and a test set (see below for details). All tests had either two (reference vs. abnormal) or three (low, normal, or high) possible response values. For tests with three values, we performed two separate rule searches: one for high vs. not high-i.e., grouping normal and low-and one for low vs. not low.
