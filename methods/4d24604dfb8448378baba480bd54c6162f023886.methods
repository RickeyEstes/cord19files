The University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database contains records on all Manitobans diagnosed with IBD between 1984 and 2010. Each individual is identified by a unique personal health identification through which all health system contacts can be tracked dating back to 1984. In 1995, we validated an administrative definition of IBD based on frequency of health system contacts. 5 We identified all persons with IBD and created a matched cohort of controls, matching 10 controls without IBD by age, sex, and area of residence to each IBD case. Our administrative definition of IBD allowed updating our database with new cases on an ongoing basis. Starting in 1970, 6-digit family health registration numbers, shared by a mother and all of her offspring, have been used in Manitoba and allow for the accurate linkage of the health care utilization profiles of mothers with their children. 6 The infections included those likely to require antibiotic therapy and also viral infections; it was considered that, if a child was sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital, even if the discharge diagnosis was that of a viral infection, at some point the child may have received antibiotic therapy. However, we also included a separate analysis excluding what were diagnosed as viral infections. We assessed for the occurrence of those events within the first year of life. We also assessed for those events within the first 3 years of life. Inpatient and outpatient diagnoses were combined in each category to increase the power to determine if any diagnoses with these conditions were associated with a later diagnosis of IBD. We assessed for maternal diagnosis of IBD and we assessed for mode of delivery (cesarean section vs vaginal
