To measure activities by endpoint fluorescence reading, peptidase reactions were proceeded at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 μ M Ang II or apelin-13. The reactions were stopped after 30 minutes by 80 °C heat inactivation for 5 minutes. The reaction mixtures were then directly added to phenylalanine detection buffer contain 1 μ L enzyme mix and 1 μ L developer in 96-well plates at 37 °C for another 20 minutes before fluorescence readings were measured. We note that removal of all protein contents before adding kit components as suggested by manufacturer's instructions is not necessary, as our results in supplementary Figure S1A showed that protein contents neither increase background levels nor impede reaction. The reaction buffer for rsACE2, HEK293 cells and rsACE2-infused serum samples contains 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, 136 mM NaCl and 10 μ M ZnCl 2 . For measuring endogenous activities in serum and tissue samples, before adding Ang II or apelin-13 substrate, the lysates were first desalted using Zeba TM spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jos, CA, USA) -a step to remove endogenous phenylalanine and therefore reduce background readings. In consideration of a large number of peptidases including metallopeptidases may need divalent ions for their activities, the reaction buffer for desalted sera and tissue lysates contains additional 10 μ M ZnCl 2 , 2.5 mM CaCl 2 and 2.5 mM MgCl 2 . The reactions with tissue lysate was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 minutes followed by heat inactivation, and then the phenylalanine assay. In the reactions using kidney samples, 10 μ g desalted kidney lysates were incubated with 0.5 μ M Ang II in a 20 μ L reaction at 37 °C. At different time points the reactions were stopped by heating and the phenylalanine was measured as described above. To measure the kinetic constants (K m and V max ) of enzyme, 0.1 μ g rsACE2 was incubated with various concentrations of Ang II or apelin-13 substrate (0.195-200 μ M) for 2 min followed by heating inactivation and phenylalanine detection. The rate of increase in fluorescence intensity in the initial phase (0-2 min) was calculated and converted to nmol/min/μ g protein according to the substrate-fluorescence intensity standard curves. The values of kinetic constants K m and V max were obtained by fitting the corresponding data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graphpad Prism 5 software.
