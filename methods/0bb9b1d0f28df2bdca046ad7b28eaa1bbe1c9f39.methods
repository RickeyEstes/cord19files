Using the same search filter as for the 2005 document (this is described in detail in the previous publication [1] and website documents-http://www.ersnet.org; http://www.escmid. org) we identified relevant manuscripts in PubMed published from July 2002 to May 2010. Thereby we retrieved 15 261 titles and loaded them into an electronic database. From these, 1677 titles were identified as potentially relevant publications by the expert panel members. The same process of evidence appraisal and grading (Appendix 1) and recommendation development and grading (Appendix 2) as in the 2005 document was used. The document takes each clinical question for which there was a recommendation in the 2005 guidelines and presents new information when available, followed by a new recommendation. In some circumstances, because of lack of new evidence, or sometimes even in the presence of new evidence, the recommendation is unchanged from 2005. Where this is the case it is indicated. In some parts of the guidelines new questions and recommendations have been added to cover relevant areas not included in the 2005 guidelines (e.g. aspiration pneumonia).
