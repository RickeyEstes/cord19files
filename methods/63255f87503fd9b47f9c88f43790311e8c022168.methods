Sixteen male F344 rats (COBS®CDF®F344/Crl) obtained from the National Institute on Aging contract colony at Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were used in this study. Four animals were obtained at each of the following ages: 3, 18, 30, and 36 months. Upon receipt from the supplier animals were housed in groups of 2-3 in wire mesh cages with pine shaving bedding. Each animal was prepared with unilateral electrodes in the right olfactory bulb and left dorsal hipp0campus while under barbiturate anesthesia. In addition, a 25 ga. stainless steel cannula was implanted in the left nasal passage just rostral to the main olfactory epithelium. Electrodes and surgical procedures are described in greater detail in a separate report [3] . Approximately 3 weeks following surgery, during which interval electrophysiological data were gathered [3] , animals were peffused intracardially, under barbiturate anesthesia, with isotonic saline followed by 1/4 strength Karnowsky's fixative (1% formaldehyde, 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3). The heads were stored overnight in fixative. The brains were removed and each olfactory bulb was dissected along with a part of the rostral forebraln and blocked in the coronal plane. The nasal fossae were dissected and decalcified using RDO (DuPage Kinetic Laboratories. Naperville, IL). The caudal portion of the nasal fossae and the olfactory bulb blocks were embedded in glycol methacrylate (JB-4, Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Coronal sections of the nasal fossae, 5 ~m thick, were taken at several levels through the main olfactory epithelium and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Coronal sections of the left ol- In actuality, both cell body and nucleus were measured for each mitral cell selected for study as described in the text. Calibration 20/xm; 5/zm-thick glycol methacrylate section stained with toluidine blue. factory bulb, 5 tzm thick, were taken at intervals of 50/xm through the entire extent of the MOB and stained with toiuidine blue. The volume of the internal granular layer (IGL) of the MOB was determined according to the procedure of Hinds and McNelly [61. For each animal, 25-30 sections were selected at various intervals encompassing the entire rostrocaudal extent of the IGL. The outline of the IGL in each section was drawn with the aid of a projecting microscope at a magnification of 45 x and the cross-sectional area was determined planimetrically. In keeping with the protocol of Hinds and McNelly (J. W. Hinds, personal communication), the mitral body layer (MBL) was taken as the superficial boundary of the IGL (Fig. 1) . The intervals between sections selected for analysis were chosen so that the change in the IGL cross-sectional area did not exceed _+20% in successive sections. The volume of the IGL was computed as the sum of the volumes between adjacent sections, estimated by multiplying the means of the two cross-sectional areas by the interval between the sections. Cross-sectional areas and mean volumes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei were determined according to Hinds and McNelly's methods [61, modified slightly to adjust for the thicker sections used in the present study. For each animal, 3 sections were selected for analysis at uniform intervals between the rostral extremity of the anterior olfactory nucleus and the rostral extremity of the MBL. All measurements were performed at a final magnification of 970× using a microscope equipped with a camera lucida attachment. Cells lying within the MBL were identified as mitral cells by the presence of abundant Nissl substance in the perikaryal cytoplasm. The entire MBL in each section was scanned and every 2nd or 3rd mitral cell having distinctly discriminable perikaryal and nuclear boundaries was measured. In this manner, approximately 30 mitral cells in each section were measured. The number of nucleoli in the plane of section was noted for each measured cell. For each mitral cell studied, the major and minor axes of the perikaryon and nucleus were determined. The perikaryal boundary was defined by the extent of cytoplasmic Nissl substance (Fig. 2) . In all subsequent computations, cellular and nuclear profiles were treated as circular, with radii equal to the geometric means of their respective major and minor axes. Thus, for example, the cross-sectional areas of each The area measurements shown in these distributions were not corrected for Holmes" effect nor "lost cap" and, as such, constituted the raw data on which various transformations were performed to derive mean perikaryal and nuclear volumes for each animal (see~text). mitral cell and mitral cell nucleus were estimated as the areas of the equivalent circles. Cross-sectional perikaryal area, exclusive of the nucleus, was computed by subtraction. The average cell volume, including the nucleus, for each animal was estimated as the volume of a sphere having a radius equal to the arithmetic mean of the individual cell radii. To estimate the average nuclear volume, the mean observed nuclear radius was computed for each animal, corrected for Holmes' effect and "lost cap" according to the method of Freedman [4] , and this corrected mean radius used to compute the volume of an equivalent sphere. Average perikaryal volume, exclusive of the nucleus, was computed by subtraction. It should be noted that the validity of the estimates of cellular and perikaryal size relies, in part, on the assumption that any section through the nucleus passes through the center of the cell (cf., [6] ). Although failure of this assumption would result in an underestimation of average cellular or perikaryal size, there is no reason to suspect that such an effect would be age-dependent. Freedman's correction procedure for the "lost cap" relies on an estimate of the proportion, k/r, of the actual radius for which the profile is not discriminable due to contrast deficiency. In the present study, the value of k/r was estimated according to the formula: where P10 and Pao are the 10 th and 90 th percentile observed nuclear radii for a given age group. This method for estimating k/r follows the suggestion of Freedman (
