A list of more than 30 Zika preventive behaviors (or their variants) that USAID implementing partners across USAID-supported countries were promoting was compiled by informally reviewing numerous project materials and documents. All of these preventive behaviors were related to the transmission dynamics of Zika virus-transmission by a vector (Aedes aegypti) that also transmits arboviruses such as dengue and sexual transmission. A team of experts in SBC programming and vector control was enlisted to categorize and refine the behaviors. All of the Zika prevention messages were first grouped together by behavior to create a condensed version of about 15 behaviors. Through an iterative review process including experts and discussions with partners, the list was distilled to 7 key behaviors ( Table 1) . Behaviors were excluded if they had limited effectiveness preventing Aedes aegypti-borne diseases (such as Zika) or reducing Aedes aegypti mosquito populations (after a quick literature scan and input from experts) or due to other criteria.
