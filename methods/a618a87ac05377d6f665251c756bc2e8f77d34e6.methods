This survey is an ongoing assessment of influenza coverage rates in France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, and Germany. During [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] four target groups were specified. 1. Individuals aged ‡65 years 2. Individuals who suffer from a chronic illness 3. Individuals who work in the medical field 4. Combined group of individuals aged ‡65 years or who suffer from a chronic illness or who work in the medical field. For example, in Germany the group of chronic illness sufferers is defined according to the German Standing Commission on Immunization, as children, adolescents and adults suffering from chronic diseases of respiratory organs, chronic cardiovascular or liver diseases, as well as nephropathies and diabetes, or other metabolic disorders. In our study, people suffering from heart diseases, pulmonary diseases, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses were included in the chronic illness group. The survey questions have been published previously. 6 The questions covered reasons to get vaccinated this winter, reasons for not getting vaccinated against influenza, and options that would encourage persons to get vaccinated against influenza. For the 2005 ⁄ 06 survey, questions on influenza pandemics and avian influenza were added. The survey populations were representative of the adult population from age 14 years (Germany, Italy, Spain); from age 15 (France), or from age 16 (Great Britain). In Spain, persons above age 75 were not covered. Sample weights were applied to correct for small deviations from the applicable age and gender quota and the annual datasets were pooled. Statistical evaluation used SPSS Ò version 13 for Windows. Bivariate associations of categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared test. A chi-squared test for trend was used to assess time trends. In the case of continuous variables, differences of means were tested using oneway anova. For all statistical tests, two-sided P = 0AE05 was used as the level of statistical significance. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) were reported as appropriate. Due to the descriptive nature of these data, no correction for multiple testing was made. Covariates identified as predictors of influenza vaccination in univariate analysis were considered as candidates for multivariable analysis. Logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of the outcome of interest, i.e. vaccination coverage.
