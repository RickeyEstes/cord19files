Mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) were organized to investigate reported cases of SARS and to assess hospital infection control practices. Activities of mobile teams included (1) categorization of SARS cases by use of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data in comparison with the WHO case definition of SARS, 15 (2) direct observation and demonstration of recommended SARS infection control practices, usually simultaneously, and (3) provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals actively evaluating patients for SARS infection. When a possible SARS case was reported, a mobile team was dispatched. The number of mobile teams was limited by availability of staff from the national health department and accessibility of the hospital. Mobile teams were generally led by a medical epidemiologist or other official from the national health department and often included members experienced in infection control, communications, and hospital engineering. Most teams were equipped with PPE, blood specimen tubes, nasopharyngeal swabs, culture media, and specimen cooler. Patients were later categorized as probable SARS, suspected SARS, or excluded from SARS after review by members of the national health department. Because of time and resource constraints, mobile teams generally visited a hospital only once during the observational period. We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed by mobile teams at the time of their first visits to hospitals during investigations of reported cases in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, during the early days of the outbreak from March 11 to April 21, 2003. We used a standardized written questionnaire to obtain data from at least one representative mobile team member to each hospital investigated. We selected WHO recommendations, revised April 24, 2003, as a reasonable benchmark for comparison in this analysis (Table 1 ). 14 The first version of WHO recommendations was initially released on March 16, 2003 . 16 Each national health department and other organizations had recommendations that varied over time. Since WHO indicated that a private negative pressure room was the preferred method to isolate a patient with SARS, we considered a private negativepressure room the standard of comparison for patient isolation in this analysis, although other methods might be acceptable (eg, cohorting of patients with SARS). Team investigators used a strip of tissue paper to measure qualitatively the negative air pressure at the entrance of a patient's isolation room. We considered a double-layered gown equivalent to a single gown with an apron.
