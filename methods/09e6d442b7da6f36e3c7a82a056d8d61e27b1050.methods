Conventional peptide-based Biacore assay. A mouse antibody capturing kit from GE was used for Biacore CM5 chip surface preparation. Following standard protocols provided by the manufacturer, the rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (GE) was first immobilized on the chip surface via amine coupling to the free carboxyl groups on the CM5 chip surface using standard NHS/EDC procedures. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against hCXCR5 clones 16D7, 79E7 and MAB190 (R&D Systems) were then captured by the anti-mouse antibody. Next, the hCXCR5 N-terminal peptide (MNYPLTLEMD LENLEDLFWE LDRLDNYNDT SLVENHLCPA TEGPLMASFK AVFVP) was injected over the captured anti-hCXCR5 antibodies at various concentrations to generate kinetics sensorgrams. Reversed peptide-based Biacore assay. C-terminal biotinylated peptide (MNYPLTLEMD LENLEDLFWE LDRLDNYNDT SLVENHLCPA TEGPLMASFK www.nature.com/scientificreports Capturing hCXCR5 on Biacore sensor chip surface. For direct NTA chip capture, following 1 min injection of 0.5 mM NiCl2, purified hCXCR5 receptor at concentration of 50 ng/ml diluted in HBS-N buffer was injected with a flow rate of 5 ml/min to achieve capture level between 300-700 resonance units (RU), depending on experiment purpose. Stabilization of hCXCR5. Ni-affinity captured hCXCR5 receptor protein was stabilized with limited cross-linking by flow over the mixtures of 20 mM EDC and 5 mM NHS for 7 min. Subsequently, excess cross-linkers were quenched with 1M ethanolamine for 10 min. The surface stabilized receptor chip was primed with running buffer before subsequent assay steps. Regeneration of captured-stabilized hCXCR5 surfaces. At the end of each binding cycle, the GPCR surfaces were regenerated with injection of 50 mM HCl for 1 min at the flow rate of 50 ul/min. Kinetic characterization of hCXCR5 ligand and antibodies. CXCL13 and 3 anti-hCXCR5 mAbs were each tested in triplicate in 2-fold dilution series for binding to hCXCR5 in HBS-EP1 running buffer. All samples were injected at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Capture-stabilize CD52 virus-like particles (VLP). Full-length CD52 coding sequence (ATGAAGCGCTTCCTCTTCCTCCTACTCACCA TCAGCCTCCTGGTTATGGTACAGATACAAACTGGACTCTCAGGACAAA-ACGACACCAGCCAAACCAGCAGCCCCTCAGCATCCAGCAGCATGAGCG-GAGGCATTTTCCTTTTCTTCGTGGCCAATGCCATAATCCACCTCTTCT-GCTTCAGTTGA) was cloned into pEF_DEST51 vector (Invitrogen). Following the user guide for MembranePro TM Functional Protein Expression System from Life Technologies, CD52 VLP prep was obtained. After activation of the C1 chip surface by standard NHS/EDC procedure, the anti-CD52 antibody Alemtuzumab was immobilized and CD52 VLPs were then captured by the anti-CD52 antibody at 1300 RU level. The captured VLPs were further stabilized by limited crosslinking using 20 mM NHS/5 mM EDC for 7 min at flow rate of 5 ml/min and excess crosslinkers were quenched by injection of 1 M ethanolamine for 10 min. Kinetics assays with three anti-CD52 mAbs at concentrations from 0-80 nM were then performed. Data processing and analysis. All biosensor data processing and analysis was performed using Biacore T100 Evaluation Software (GE, version 2.0.1). For kinetic analyses, data were locally fit to a 151 interaction model. CV (coefficient of variation) was calculated as the standard deviation (STDEV) divided by the mean.
