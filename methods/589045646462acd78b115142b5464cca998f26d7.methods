Pre-euthanasia Evaluation on Vascular Function. For Dynamic MRI-derived vascular function index, rabbits were anesthetized with 2.5% sodium pentobarbital (0.4 ml/kg) and then placed in the prone position with lower limbs flexed for MRI scanning using a 1.5-T superconducting system (ACS-NT Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a maximum gradient strength of 30 mT/m. A bolus of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.3 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly injected by an automatic pump linked to a previously placed 21-gauge catheter into an auditory vein. Dynamic MRI scans were performed in the prescribed plane with the following parameters: short T1-weighted gradient echo sequence, TR/TE 5 4/1.4 msec, flip angle 5 15, slice thickness 5 5 mm, in-plane resolution 5 0.86 3 0.86 mm, average 5 1. The temporal resolution was approximately 0.6 s per image acquisition. A series of dynamic images were obtained in 600 s to cover the wash-out phase 3, 24, 37, 38 . The vascularization index 'Peak Enhancement Percentage' (PEP) and permeability index 'Permeability Surface Area Product per Unit Volume of Tissue' (PSr) were accordingly calculated using our established protocol 24, 25 . Post-euthanasia Evaluation. Under general and deep anesthesia with 2.5% sodium pentobarbital by intravenous instilment (0.4 ml/kg), the rabbit abdominal cavity was opened for perfusion with a confected radiopaque silicone rubber with a combination of neutral buffered formalin (10%) and heparinized normal saline (50 U/ml) using our established protocol 24, 25, 39, 40 . Then, trabecular structure of osteonecrotic lesion in bilateral proximal femoral samples was quantificationally differentiated by micro-CT. After that, the completely decalcified proximal femoral samples by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were subjected to Micro-CT-based angiography. Thereafter, the decalcified proximal femur was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 mm thickness along the coronal plane to classify the osteonecrotic lesion repair process with histomorphometry of marrow circulation by OM and local phosphorylated Src by expression by immunoblotting, respectively. Quantificational Differentiation of Trabecular Structure in Osteonecrotic Lesion: Proximal parts of bilateral un-decalcified femoral samples were taken for measurement of trabecular structure in osteonecrotic lesion using our established protocol 24, 25 . A histogram was generated to display the size (thickness) distribution of trabecular bone. A color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image to produce a visual representation of the size distribution of trabecular bone 24, 39, 41 . Classification of Osteonecrotic Lesion Repair: Classification of osteonecrotic lesion repair was blindly made by two pathologists using OM (Aixoplan with Spot RT digital camera, Zeiss, Germany). Osteonecrotic lesion formation was identified based on diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow necrosis 42 . Appositional bone formation with osteoblast-like cells around the osteonecrotic lesion was classified as 'Reparative Osteogenesis', whereas granulation tissue creep linked to necrotic bone resorption was classified as 'Destructive Repair' 43 . Rabbits with no dominant 'Reparative Osteogenesis' or 'Destructive Repair' were termed ''unclassified''. Micro-CT-based Micro-angiography for Vascular Architecture: Proximal parts of bilateral decalcified femoral samples were taken for intraosseous 3-D Micro-CTbased micro-angiography using our established protocol 24, 25 . A histogram was generated to display the size (thickness) distribution of angiographic structure. A color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D image to produce a visual representation of the size distribution of angiographic structures 24, 39, 41 . Histomorphometry of Marrow Circulation: For micro-vessel density (MVD), fifteen successive hematoxylin and eosin-stained 6-mm-thick sections from every decalcified sample were scanned initially at low magnification and then at high magnification to identify vascular 'hot-spots' 44,45 using the Optical Microscope imaging system (Zeiss). Selection of the hot-spot has been adopted as a standard procedure for angiogenesis studies in both solid neoplasms and for hematological oncology 46 . It is thought that such areas of increased concentration of micro-vessels may represent the emergence of a neoplastic clone with a higher angiogenic potential 47 . For each countable micro-vessel, an outline was traced to calculate the total count of micro-vessels per total examined optical fields in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit (Micro-vessel Density) using image analysis software (ImageJ 1.32j, NIH, USA). For edema area (EA), the above histological sections were scanned to identify the interstitial marrow edema zone by OM. For each section, four randomly selected fields (up, down, left, right) were examined. The marrow edema zone was automatically traced by thresholding using ImageJ 1.32j 24 . The total area of the edema zone per total examined optical field area in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples (Edema Area) in one rabbit were calculated accordingly. For size distribution of leakage particles, the above sections were examined with OM to identify leakage particles in the region corresponding to the scanned volume of interest during the above-mentioned Micro-CT-based micro-angiography. An easily distinguished black radiopaque particle (perfused angiographic substance) outside of a blood vessel was defined as a leakage particle. For each leakage particle, the outline was manually traced to quantify its area and perimeter using ImageJ 1.32j. Based on the stereology principle in bone histomorphometry 48 , leakage particle size was calculated as follows: Thickness 5 2000/ 1.199 3 (Area/Perimeter). A histogram to display the size distribution of all the leakage particles in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit was generated using Excel 2007 (Microsoft, USA). Local Marrow phosphorylated Src protein and total Src protein expression by Immunoblotting: Marrow tissues were harvested and lysed in homogenization RIPA Lysis Buffer (R2031-75, United States Biological, USA). Homogenates were precentrifuged at 2,500 g for 10 min at 4uC, and the collected supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 0.5 h at 4uC. Protein concentration of the tissue lysate was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (#23225, Pierce, USA). Protein (20 mg) was heated at 95uC for 4 min in gel-loading buffer (Sigma), subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, USA) using a TRANS-BLOT SD Semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% defatted milk for 0.5 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody, i.e., anti-Src phospho-Y418 at 15500 (Biosource InternationalUSA) 16 , anti-Src at 15500 (Biosource International, USA) and b-actin (as an internal control) at 152000 overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody (anti-goat IgG at 151000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. Proteins (Src-phospho-Y418) were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL plus Immunoblotting Detection www.nature.com/scientificreports System (Pierce), and then Src-phospho-Y418 and total Src expressions were normalized to the band intensity of b-actin using a molecular imager system (Bio-Rad). Data presented are representative of at least three separate experiments. Data analysis. For statistical analysis, data are expressed as the mean 6 SD. Data from repeated measurements (MRI-derived vascular function index) was analyzed by Two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Data from non-repeated measurements, including micro vessel density, edema area, and protein expression level, were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc multiple comparison tests (Student-Newman-Keuls test when equal variance was assumed, or Games-Howell test when equal variance was not assumed). Fisher's exact probability test was performed to determine the difference in incidence data (reparative osteogenesis and destructive repair) among groups. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical significance level was P , 0.05.
