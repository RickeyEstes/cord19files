The experiments were undertaken in the PC4 facility with HEPA filters installed in the pipeline connecting sampler and vacuum pump to prevent the equipment contamination. For the experiments, each device was filled by 50 ml of B10 4 TCID 50 ml À1 (Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) concentrated suspension of SARS Guy et al., 2000) . RT-PCR was used for control of reproduction of virus in the Vero cells. Amplification was performed with BNI in S and BNI in As primers (courtesy of Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany). The results were calculated in TCID 50 ml À1 and the rate of natural decay was obtained as the ratio of concentration (TCID 50 ml À1 ) at certain time by the initial concentration of SARS in the liquid at the beginning of experiment. Three experimental runs were undertaken with three different devices to identify the reproducibility of the results and inter sampler variation. To investigate the behaviour of the rate of natural decay in different environments, two liquids were used for preparation of viral suspensions; sterile water and microbial maintenance fluid. The maintenance fluid prepared from Hank's solution containing 2% volumetric of inactivated bovine serum, 100 U ml À1 of penicillin and 100 mg ml À1 of streptomycin was used to create conditions for lowest possible rate on natural decay. To avoid an extensive foam formation which could unfavourably interfere with the physical bubbling process, the antifoaming agent Antifoam A (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis) was added to the collection media. Some following observations confirmed that the virus maintenance fluid with addition of antifoaming agent did not contribute towards alternations of physical bubbling process with no excessive foam generated. Also, as was confirmed by measurements according to the previously developed procedure (Agranovski et al., 1999) , physical efficiency of the sampler charged with virus maintenance fluid was the same as for the one operated with sterile water (>95%) with no increase in hydrodynamic resistance of the device detected.
