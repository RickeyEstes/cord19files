• PATIENTS AND SAMPLES: Ocular fluid samples analyzed in this study were from 629 uveitis patients who visited the ophthalmology clinic of the University Medical Center Utrecht from October 1, 2001 until June 30, 2006 and were suspected of infectious uveitis. The patients were classified using the uveitis nomenclature according to the recommendations of the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature working group 2005. 31 All patients had undergone the uveitis screening consisting of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red and white blood cell counts, determination of serum angiotensinconverting enzyme levels, serologic tests for syphilis, and chest radiography. Selected patients also underwent serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi. For all 629 patients aqueous sampling was performed for diagnostic purposes. The samples were stored at Ϫ80°C within 5 hours of collection before processing for laboratory analysis. Initial analysis was performed for HSV, VZV, and in the case of posterior uveitis also for Toxoplasma and CMV, by PCR and by Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC), to determine intraocular antibody production. Of the 629 patients, 486 were negative for the above mentioned agents. A sufficient amount of ocular fluid remained for this study in 139 of these cases. Forty-nine patients had anterior uveitis (AU) and 90 had posterior uveitis (PU) or panuveitis (Table 1) . Of the 49 AU patients, 2 were immunocompromised as a result of immunosuppressive medications (1 for lethal midline granuloma and the other after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancy). Of the 90 patients with PU and panuveitis, 8 were immunocompromised, 5 of whom had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 3 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs ( Table 1) . The remainders of ocular fluid samples from patients with PCR-and/or GWC-confirmed infectious uveitis (ocular toxoplasmosis, n ϭ 13; HSV anterior uveitis, n ϭ 10; rubella virus-associated Fuchs heterochromic uveitis syndrome (FHUS), n ϭ 14) and from patients with cataract in the absence of intraocular inflammation (n ϭ 11) served as controls. • NUCLEIC ACID ISOLATION AND REAL-TIME PCR: The ocular fluid samples were analyzed for the presence of adenovirus, EBV, HHV6, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis DNA and of coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and NL63, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus 1 to 4, HPeV, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and rubella virus RNA. If not done previously, samples from patients with anterior uveitis were also analyzed for CMV and Toxoplasma. DNA and RNA were extracted from 30 L of ocular fluid using the MagNa Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid isolation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). To monitor the quality of the extraction and the subsequent amplification procedure, a standard dose of phocine herpesvirus type 1 and encephalomyocarditis virus was added to each sample as an internal control prior to extraction. [32] [33] [34] Nucleic acid was collected in a volume of 240 L. For detection of RNA viruses, copyDNA (cDNA) was produced by mixing 40 L of extracted nucleic acid with 60 L of reverse transcriptase mix (Taqman, reverse transcription reagents; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) and incubating the mixture for 10 minutes at 25°C and 30 minutes at 48°C. The cDNA synthesis reaction was stopped by incubating for 5 minutes at 95°C. Per amplification reaction 10 L of extracted nucleic acid (for DNA detection) or 10 L of cDNA (for RNA detection) was used. Real-time PCR assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, New Jersey, USA). For Chlamydia trachomatis, 25 L of extracted nucleic acid was analyzed using the Cobas Amplicor Chlamydia trachomatis detection kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche). All samples were examined once. In case of positive outcomes the real-time PCR reaction was repeated. Two human parechovirus-positive samples were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. Samples for which the internal control was inhibited were excluded. The primers and probes used are listed in Table 2 . • ANTIBODY DETECTION ASSAYS: Intraocular production of antibody against rubella virus (Goldmann-Witmer coefficient) was assessed as described previously. 1 Serum and intraocular immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers against HHV6 were determined using the Biotrin International Human Herpes Virus 6 IgG immunofluorescence assay (Dublin, Ireland). Serum and intraocular IgG against EBV was determined using the Panbio VCA IgG ELISA (Grenoble, France).
