Let Y be our response variable, which is the number of daily admission to a regional hospital due to respiratory illnesses, and X = (X 1 , . . . , X p ) be the row-vector of covariates (with possible lags) affecting the response variable. The potential covariates in our study include (SO 2 , NO x , RSP, OZ, Temp, Humi). Let t start (=8 March 2003) denote the full outbreak of the SARS epidemic and t end (23 June 2003) the end of the SARS epidemic. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures and air quality on the reduction of respiratory illnesses, with consideration of weekly effect, we consider the following candidate models: The individual terms in the model are considered as follows. (i) ε t is a zero-mean, constant variance error term. (ii) λ t measures the impact of public health measures with ξ 1 and ξ 3 being real values representing the lower and upper asymptotes, respectively, ξ 2 being a positive value representing the growth rate and ξ 4 being a real value representing the time of maximum growth. That is, the effect of public health measures as measured by the shift in the total number of illnesses. By noting the magnitude of impact decreases eventually over time due to many factors including behavioral and memory dynamics, the growth curves are widely used in psychological research to model the changes over time (Mcardle and Nesselroade, 2002) . The logistic growth curve is a special case of the generalized Richard growth curve (Richard, 1959) . A negative value of ξ 1 indicates a reduction of the number of illnesses, meaning an effective impact of public health measures. A positive value of ξ 3 means that the impact of public health measures will fade and vanish over time. We do not use the full Richard curve because it involves complicated computing due to a limit or embedded cases (Shao, 2002) and the special case here is good enough to fit the data. Bear in mind that we do not use the data during the SARS epidemic as it is highly unstable. (iii) Due to the hospital system in Hong Kong where only emergency departments are in normal service during weekends, the effect of the day-of-the-week is indicated in previous studies (Xia et al., 2002; Xia and Tong, 2006) . Here the dummy variables are defined as with day 1 to 6 referring to Saturday to Thursday respectively and Friday as the reference day. The second term measures the effect of the day-of-the-week which is also important (Dominici et al., 2000; Forster De and Solomon, 2003; Bruckmann and Wichmann-Fiebig, 1997; Xia and Tong, 2006) . (iv) The effect of environmental and weather factors on the illnesses is characterized by a Multiple Index Model defined as g(X) = g(β 11 X 1 + · · · + β p1 X p , . . . , β 1M X 1 + · · · + β pM X p ) = g(XB) with M < p and E(ε|X ) = 0 almost surely. Here g( ) is an unknown smooth function and B = (β 1 , . . . , β M ) is the coefficient matrix with β j = (β 1j , . . . β pj ) T being the jth direction or components, () T denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix. Without loss of generality, the standardized version of X = (X 1 , . . . , X p ) is used in the model, i.e. E(X j ) = 0 and Var(X j ) = 1 (j = 1, . . . , p). To ensure the uniqueness of the coefficient matrix, one should impose some identification condition on B. Usually it is assumed that B T B = I M×M , that is, B is an orthogonal matrix. Xia et al. (2002) used the minimum average variance estimation technique (MAVE) to estimate B in the multiple index model and then cross validation (CV) to determine D. A brief outline of the method is given below.
