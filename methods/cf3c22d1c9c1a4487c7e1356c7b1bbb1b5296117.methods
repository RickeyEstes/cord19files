Construction and expression of recombinantORF6 protein in Escherichia coli and human promocyte HL-CZ cells For generating bacterial and mammalian expression of recombinant ORF6 protein, the SARS-CoV ORF6 gene of the SARS-CoV TW1 strain genome (GenBank Accession No. AY291451) was amplified by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from genome RNA template and cloned into the pTriE-4 Neo vector for the production of the recombinant ORF6 protein fused with an N-terminal His-tag. The primers included 5 0 -ATCGGAATTC-TATGTTTCATCCGTT-3 0 and 5 0 -ATCGGCGGCCGCTGGATAAT-CTAACTC-3 0 . The forward primer contained an EcoRI restriction site; the reverse primer included a NotI restriction site. The amplified RT-PCR product was cloned into the pTriEx-4 Neo vector (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), resulting in construct named pTriEx-ORF6. For the production of E. coli-synthesized ORF6 protein, pTriEx-ORF6 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The induction expression and purification of E. coli-synthesized ORF6 protein were performed as described in our prior reports. 10, 11 Finally, the recombinant ORF6 protein was purified using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography as described in our previous study, 12 and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The immunoreactive band was developed with tetranitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-idolylphosphate (TNBT/BCIP) (Gibco, Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) (Invitrogen).
