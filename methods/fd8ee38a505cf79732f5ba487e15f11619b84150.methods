Data on the occurrence, year, and location of the 446 patients with scrub typhus on Jeju Island were obtained from the infectious disease surveillance web statistics of the KCDC, and the incidence of scrub typhus by year and region was investigated. The total population of Jeju Island and the population by region were based on the average population from 2011 to 2015 from the National Statistics Office data in Korea. In order to divide the administrative districts into urbanized areas and rural areas, they were divided into 'dong' areas and 'eup'-'myeon' areas, respectively. The case reports contained basic personal information such as sex, age, address, occupation, and disease-related factors (date of onset, type of work, experience of recent outdoor activities, and clinical symptoms). In order to investigate the relationship between scrub typhus and occupation, the occupation-related exposures of the subjects were divided into four categories: 1) those working in the agriculture, forestry or livestock industry; 2) other outdoor workers; 3) those engaged in occupation-unrelated one-time or hobby agriculture, forestry or livestock work (including vegetable gardening, weekend gardening); and 4) those engaged in simple outdoor activities (including hiking, picnic). In order to analyze the risk factors for scrub typhus infection in the case reports, the types of outdoor work and activities performed by subjects were analyzed; these activities were also analyzed to determine whether the 6 regional public health centers demonstrated different characteristics.
