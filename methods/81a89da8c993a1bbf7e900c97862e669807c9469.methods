This study was a semiquantitative descriptive study using direct observation, interviews, and document studies performed during the period of April-May 2016. The aim of this study was to understand the compliance with OHSEMS in each laboratory. More specifically, the compliance in five aspects of the OHSEMS: OHSE policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The results of study the were compared with the laboratory OHSEMS standards that were divided into three categories of OHSEMS achievement in laboratory: >70%, 50-70%, and <50%. The laboratory OHSEMS inspections were performed in 90 laboratories in seven faculties: Faculty A (Engineering), B (Science), C (Medicine), D, 14  72  15  68  16  61  17  63  18  78  19  73  20  59  21  63  22  73  23  84  24  67  25  74  26  75  27  61  28  58  29  68  30  65  31  52  32  48  33  51  34  70  35  22  36  79  37  48  38  27  39  46  40  40  41  40  42  51  43  70  44  82  45  56  46  26  47  36  48  24  49  42  50  25  51  53  52  42  53 20 E, F, and G (Health). The informants interviewed were the head of laboratory, laboratory technicians, a laboratory technician assistant, and students. Two types of data were collected: primary and secondary data. The primary data collection was performed through direct observation by using a checklist on the implementation of laboratory OHSE management system implementation and collecting information from resource persons/informants on the evaluation of the higher education institution laboratory OHSE management system through interviews. The secondary data were collected to review the documents related to the laboratory OHSE management system implementation.
