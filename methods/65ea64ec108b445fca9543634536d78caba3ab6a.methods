Cellulose-bound overlapping peptides (10 mers) derived from all proteins encoded by the 15 Orfs of the SARS genome were synthesized using an AutoSpot robot provided by Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments. The software used for designing the arrays was from DIGEN, Jerini Biotools GmbH, Berlin, Germany. Membranes derivatized with a polyethylene (PEG) linker and a free amino terminal, as well as 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (fmoc) amino acids were obtained from Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments. The fmoc amino acids (0.25 M) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma, Oakville, Ont. Canada) and then activated with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, Sigma) and N, N V -disopropylcarbodiimide (DIPC, Sigma) for at least 15 min. They were then delivered to the membrane in 60-nl aliquots per spot by the robotic synthesizer. Fifteen minutes after completion of each cycle, the membranes were removed from the apparatus and treated with 2% acetic anhydride in DMF to acetylate any free remaining amino groups. They were then washed and further treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to remove the fmoc protecting group. This was followed by washing with DMF and methanol, and finally by air drying. The membrane was then precisely repositioned on the robotic apparatus to initiate the next coupling cycle. After the final cycle, the side chain protecting groups were removed by treatment with a solution of the following composition: 5 ml of 50% trifluoracetic acid; 5 ml dichloromethane (DCM); 300 Al triisopropyl silane (Sigma); and 200 Al water. Membranes were then washed twice with DCM, twice with DMF, and twice with methanol. After air drying, membranes were stored in a sealed bag at 4 jC until used. Membranes were rehydrated by treating first with methanol, then 50% methanol followed by washing three times in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline/0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T). They were then blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 jC. After washing three times with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated at 37 jC for 1 h with 1/100 dilutions of serum samples of patients and controls. After washing, membranes were treated with 1/5000 dilutions (0.2 Ag/ml) of goat antihuman IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After washing in TBS-T, membranes were developed with an ECL chemiluminescence kit provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, England). Four milliliters of the two ECL Western blotting detection reagents were mixed before being applied on the membranes. The membranes were scanned using a Bio-Rad Fluorescent Imager (Hercules, CA) and saved for later analysis. The membranes were regenerated by incubation in 8 M urea/1% SDS overnight followed by 60 min in 50% ethanol/10% acetic acid. After this step, membranes were washed three times in methanol, and after air drying stored at 4 jC in a sealed bag until reuse. In initial development of the SARS-CoV serum neutralization test, comparisons were made between the microneutralization test and a 50% plaque reduction assay. Testing of several sera consistently produced assay results where the 50% plaque reduction titer was 2-fold greater than in the microneutralization test. Following this validation, the microneutralization test system was adopted for greater convenience despite the 2-fold greater sensitivity of the plaque reduction assay. Typical results of this assay are illustrated in Fig. 2.
