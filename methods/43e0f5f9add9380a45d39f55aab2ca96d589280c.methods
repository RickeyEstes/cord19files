All leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database were analysed while the ones published in 2018 were excluded because Scopus as a secondary source has not yet archived all the publications from the primary sources for this year. The Scopus was used because it is the most widely accepted and frequently used database for analysis of scientific publications in different fields [22, [31] [32] [33] [34] . The search was completed in November 2018. A bibliometric filter to capture leishmaniasis related publications from the Scopus database was created by using the key words 'leishmaniosis, or 'Leishmaniasis' or 'leishmania' or 'kala-azar' in the 'title' selection mode. All documents referring to leishmaniasis research during the last two decades were assessed with the following aspects: document types, languages, yearly publications, countries and collaboration patterns, institutions, journals, h-index, citations, and research hotspots. The analysis focused on providing outputs for the top ten prolific of the following: countries, journals with their impact factors (IF), cited articles, and institutions as in the most previous bibliometric studies [19, 33, [35] [36] [37] . In the current study, IF for the most prolific journals were extracted according to the 2017 journal citation report (JCR) at the time of study. Based on downloaded publications from Scopus database, bibliometric maps were created to determine the hot topics using the VOSviewer software version 1.6.9 (freely available at www. vosviewer.com). The collected data from the Scopus were limited to all 22 Arab countries, including "Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Syrian Arab Republic, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Somalia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen" [38] .
