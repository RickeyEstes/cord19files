A retrospective review was conducted to all reports of Gramnegative and Gram-positive isolates from all units at SQUH which is a 570-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Muscat, Oman. The study has been conducted for a period from January 2012 to December 2012. Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were identified and tested. Definition of MDRO was based on the recently proposed joint definition by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) [25] . Two prevalence rates were calculated: (1) prevalence rate of MDRO patients and (2) prevalence rate of MDRO isolates. Both prevalence rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases with index by number of monthly inpatient admissions for the whole year. The prevalence rates were reported per 1,000 admissions. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of prevalence rates were calculated using the Poisson distribution method of binomial variables. The 95% CI were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. The trend in the prevalence rates over a 12-month period was calculated and analyzed to identify a statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend, and a cutoff value for statistical significance was taken at value of 0.05. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 20.0, IBM) was used for all statistical analyses. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Sultan Qaboos University, Medical Research Ethics Committee at College of Medicine and Health Sciences. Table 1 shows the cumulative frequencies and rates of hospital-acquired MDRO among patients and isolates at The Scientific World Journal 3 As shown in Figure 1 , the prevalence rates of MDRO patients and isolates were relatively steady throughout the period from January to August 2012. In September, there was an abrupt increase in the prevalence rates which continuously elevated until the end of the year. Overall, the increasing trends for prevalence rates of MDRO patients and MDRO isolates were both found to be statistically significant (trend, = 0.04, = 0.03, resp.). Table 2 depicts that bloodstream infection and pneumonia were the most frequently occurring infections caused by hospital-acquired MDRO (24.6% and 24.3%, resp.) followed by urinary tract infection (UTI) (18.8%). Surgical infections were encountered among 9.7% of all MDRO affected patients.
