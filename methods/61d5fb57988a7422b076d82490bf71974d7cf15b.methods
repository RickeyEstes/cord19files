Data from patients in this study were prospectively collected through the community-acquired ALRI surveillance SISEA from April 2007 to July 2010 in two provincial Cambodian hospitals. This surveillance project focused on ALRI epidemiology in Cambodia, a Southeast Asian tropical country. The patient recruitment and assessment methodology is described elsewhere [5e8]. SISEA was approved by the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research (number 024-NECHR). Patients' informed consent was obtained prior to any investigation. Briefly, after including inpatients with lower tract respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days and excluding patients with known immunodeficiency [5e7], hospital physicians recorded demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data as well as on-site biological testing results and outcome. They assigned a final diagnosis to each patient, including that of lung sequelae superinfection. On admission, blood, non-induced sputum, throat and nasopharyngeal samples were collected for direct examination, cultures and molecular diagnostic techniques, performed at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. Procedures for viral and bacterial assessment have previously been described [6,7,9e12] . Direct sputum examination for acidfast bacilli (AFB) were performed at the hospital laboratories for each patient on admission and repeated during the following two days. In accordance with Cambodia's national TB recommendations, culture was not systematically performed. A single chest radiograph per patient was performed on admission. Expert pulmonologists blinded to the patient's condition re-interpreted chest radiograph and then reviewed patients' medical files to assign a final diagnosis to each included case. We extracted from the SISEA database adult patients (aged 15 years and above) with ALRI and abnormal chest radiograph on admission. We then excluded from analysis patients with other respiratory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, post-tobacco emphysema, pneumothorax and thoracic deformation. We thus classified patients into three groups: ALRIPS, ALRI on presumed previously healthy lung (ALRIHL), and pulmonary TB. We finally excluded patients with positive AFB smears and pulmonary sequelae to avoid confusion in groups' comparison ( Fig. 1) . The ALRIPS group was defined as patients with clinical and biological signs compatible with ALRI and presenting postinfectious pulmonary sequelae on chest radiograph on admission. Post-infectious pulmonary sequelae were defined as radiologically-diagnosed lung lesions highly suggestive of a previous lung infection such as TB, abscesses, purulent pleurisies or bronchiectasis. Severe sequelae were defined by at least combination of two features such as retraction, pleural thickening, fibrosis, bronchiectasis and cavities. Fig. 2 illustrates severe sequelae. Moderate sequelae were defined by the above features taken separately. The ALRIHL group was defined as patients with clinical, biological and radiological signs compatible with pneumonia, pleurisy, pleuro-pneumonia or pulmonary abscess and chest radiograph showing no signs of post-infectious sequelae. As recommended by WHO, pulmonary TB, was confirmed by bacteriology or diagnosed by a clinician [13] . Smear-positive and smear-negative cases met the WHO definition [13] . The definitions of clinical conditions, diabetes, renal impairment, cardiovascular disease and severity were described elsewhere [6, 7] . First-line antibiotherapy was defined as the antibiotics regimen received during the first three days of hospitalization.
