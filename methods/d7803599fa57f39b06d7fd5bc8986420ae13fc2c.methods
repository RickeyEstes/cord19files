Viral genome sequencing and sequence analysis. Viral RNA was extracted from virus-infected allantoic fluid using a viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was carried out with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and genome segments were amplified by PCR using primers listed in Supplementary Table S3 . The PCR reaction mixture contains 0.5 μ l of Phire hot start II DNA polymerase (Thermo, Carlsbad, CA), 5 μ l of 5X buffer, 0.5 μ l of 50 μ M forward primer and reverse primer (Tri-I Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan), 3 μ l of 2.5 mM dNTPs (GeneTeks BioScience, Taipei, Taiwan), 5 μ l of cDNA and 10.5 μ l of nuclease-free water. For PCR, the initial denaturation was at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. All the amplified PCR products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels electrophoresis. DNA sequencing was conducted by a commercial service (Tri-I Biotech). Each nucleotide was determined from at least three identical results generated from separate PCR products. Nucleotide sequences were assembled using DNAStar software (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Sequences of the reference IBV strains were retrieved from GenBank with the accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table S4 . Multiple sequence alignments and sequence identity were analyzed with the Clustal W method available in BioEdit 7.2.5 software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA software version 4 50 , and the bootstrap values were determined from 1,000 replicates of the original data. Antisera production and cross neutralization test. Antisera against 3575/08, 2575/98 and 2296/95 were prepared in 3-week-old SPF chickens as previously described 24 . The antiserum against Mass-type H120 was purchased from Charles River Laboratories (North Franklin, CT). Cross neutralization test was performed with the protocol previously described 24 . Briefly, four-fold diluted sera were incubated with the same volume of 100 EID 50 homologous or heterologous virus at room temperature for an hour, respectively. The virus-serum mixtures were then inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. Seven days after inoculation, the eggs were opened and examined for typical lesions caused by IBV infection (embryo dwarfing or malformation). The neutralizing titer of each serum against homologous or heterologous virus was determined by the last serum dilution that protected 50% of the embryo and calculated by Reed-Muench method 49 . In addition, the cross neutralization r-values between strains were calculated by the method described by Archetti and Horsfall 51 . Antigenic (serotype) difference between two given strains was defined as follows, when r: 70-100%, same serotype; r: 33-70%, different subtype (minor); r: 11-32%, different subtype (major); r; 0-10%, different serotype 52 .
