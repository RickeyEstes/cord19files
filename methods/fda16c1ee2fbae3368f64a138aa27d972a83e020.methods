Immunoblot analysis: Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, containing proteinase inhibitors 5 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF) for 15 min on ice followed by centrifugation at high speed for 15 min, 4 o C.

Precipitates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, 4 o C for 15 min, and the air-dried pellets were then diluted in 1X SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved in SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with appropriate primary antibodies (Table S2) . Immunofluorescence: ~4X10 4 (U2OS) or ~1X10 5 (HeLa) cells grown on coverslips were treated with the indicated stressors. Following the stress treatment, cells were washed twice with 1X PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min and washed twice with 1X PBS. The cells were then blocked with 5% normal horse serum in 1X PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide (NHS/PBSA) for 1 h at RT. All primary antibodies (Table S2) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with cells overnight at 4 o C, followed by three washes with 1X PBS, 10 min each. Next, appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer along with Hoechst (1 μg/ml), incubated with the cells for 1 h at RT, washed three times with 1X PBS and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Prolong Gold. All experiments were performed at least thrice. Cell lysates were mixed at 4 o C for 15 min, spun down for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and the supernatant All rights reserved.

The cleared lysates were added to pre-incubated anti-GFP (3E6, Invitrogen)-DYNA magnetic beads (10004D, Invitrogen) complex and incubated for 2 h at RT. The beads were washed once with CLB, twice with high-salt CLB (300 mM NaCl), followed by a final wash with CLB. The precipitates were then boiled with 1X SDS sample buffer for 10 min at ~85 o C. All experiments were performed at least thrice. Statistical analysis: Data are presented as mean ± SD and groups compared using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism8.
