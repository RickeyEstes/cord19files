Many vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika fever, malaria, etc., are transmitted from vector to host as well as from host to vector. Following previous literature (Earn et al., 2008; Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2001; Keeling & Rohani, 2011; Grenfell, Dobson & Moffatt, 1995) , the transmission mechanism can be explained by the vector-host epidemic models based on the differential equations, i.e., compartmental models.
