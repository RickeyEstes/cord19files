Data used in this study are previously unreleased national data provided by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of China, which include the numbers of health professional students by school and major. The datasets were generated from yearly statistical forms that each higher education institution submitted to local education authorities and the MOE [3] . The data, spanning from 1998 to 2012, were analyzed by descriptive analysis. Our analysis of the MOE dataset was focused on higher education institutions (HEIs) that offer education for public health, with at least one program in the first-level discipline: public health and preventive medicine. These programs are offered through junior college, bachelor, master, or doctorate degrees. China's HEIs can be grouped into two types: regular HEIs and HEIs for adults. Typically, the former admits high-school graduates as full-time students by the national college entrance examination, while the latter provides adults with higher education on a part-time basis through distance education or select on-campus courses. Regular HEIs may best represent China's higher education of health professionals because they are dominant in the educational system and all top HEIs are regular ones. Furthermore, a person who wishes to study health science at HEIs for adults should be an in-service health professional or have obtained a license for practice [21] , making it difficult to estimate the effects of education output on the development of health workforce. Therefore, only regular HEIs are included in our analysis.
