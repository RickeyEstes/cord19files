This evaluation was designed as a prospective simulation. Volunteers were recruited to visit the emergency departments of the 3 participating New York City area hospitals. The chief complaint and history of present illness was scripted in advance, and there were specific rules of conduct. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) symptoms. Although most volunteer patients had SARS-like presentations, to make the drill more realistic for the clinical staff, some volunteers had non-SARS chief complaints. As such, although the clinical staff may have become aware that a drill was being conducted, the clinical presentations and complaints were not homogenous. In addition, none of the clinical or clerical staff working on the day of the drill was aware that syndromic surveillance was being evaluated through the exercise. Data were sent electronically to the NYC-DOHMH twice per day, using standard protocols [4] . The NYC-DOHMH performs daily spatial cluster analysis on emergency department visits for selected syndromes at participating hospitals in New York City. The number of drill participants was estimated to exceed the number of excess cases typically observed in statistically significant respiratory syndrome clusters in the NYC-DOHMH system. A P value of less than .01 is used by the NYC-DOHMH as their threshold for investigation of an increased syndrome cluster.
