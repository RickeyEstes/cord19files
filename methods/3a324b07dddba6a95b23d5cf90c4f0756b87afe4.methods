Philadelphia County encompasses an area of 369 km 2 in south-eastern Pennsylvania, and is coterminous with the City of Philadelphia (population 1,517,550 in the year 2000 [17] ). The population receives public-health services from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH). IPD has been a notifiable condition in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania since 2002; Pennsylvania uses the uniform case definition endorsed by the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [18] . A case is considered "confirmed" when a consistent clinical syndrome occurs in association with the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal or pleural fluid). Data on IPD case occurrence in Philadelphia was obtained from PDPH records, and included date of onset, age, sex, race and ethnicity of the patient, isolation site, and fatal outcome (if known).
