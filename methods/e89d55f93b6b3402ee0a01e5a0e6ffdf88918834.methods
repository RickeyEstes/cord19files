The conduct of a PBL case of patients infected with SARS was evaluated at two CHCs in Hawaii, with multidisciplinary health professional and student participants. The case focused on common public health preparedness issues, including recognition, information gathering, communication, dissemination, and ethics, as well as teamwork and functioning within a multidisciplinary group. The participants were members of a communitybased interdisciplinary training curriculum conducted at the CHCs. They included six first-year medical students, three second-year nursing students, a nurse practitioner, three social workers, two social work students, one health education specialist and one public health student. The groups met twice over 2 weeks, for 3 hours each session. The sessions opened with a summary of the PBL process. The first 3-hour session consisted of reviewing and discussing the case and identifying learning issues, while the second session 1 week later had students return with their researched learning issues and present them to the group. Sessions were facilitated by experienced PBL tutors. An educational specialist observed both sessions and administered a short pretest questionnaire of participant's familiarity with bioterrorism issues, as well as a longer, more in-depth evaluation follow-up, administered online through anonymous survey software. Nine participants (3 medical students, 2 nursing students, 1 social work student, 2 social workers [grouped together for evaluation purposes under Social Workers], and 1 public health student) participated in the self-reported evaluation.
