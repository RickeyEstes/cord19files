This prospective study was carried out in the Union Territory of Chandigarh (located in north India with a population of 1.05 million residing in urban, rural and urban-slum areas, of whom 11.3% are children), over 24 consecutive months from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013. The study was coordinated from the Advanced Pediatrics Centre (APC) at PGIMER Chandigarh, a tertiary care centre with nearly 20 000 annual in-patient admissions and 100 000 out-patient visits. Enrolment of children aged 1 month to 12 years, fulfilling the WHO IMCI case definition of CAP designed for children <5 years [6] [7] [8] , was carried out through active and passive surveillance (Figure 1) . Tachypnea was defined as respiratory rate >60/min for infants <2 months; >50/min for infants 2-12 months; >40/min for children >12-60 months; and >30/min for children >60-144 months. Active surveillance was conducted in 30 anganwadi clusters, selected to represent the population of Chandigarh, where trained research team members visited households daily, inquiring for clinical symptoms of pneumonia. Passive surveillance was carried out by research staff stationed in the Out Patient and Emergency Departments of the APC, by evaluating clinical signs of CAP in children presenting to these Departments. If symptoms were reported and tachypnea confirmed, the child was presented to a Medical Officer for confirmation and inclusion. Children with duration of illness >7 days; those who had received antibiotics for >24 hours at presentation or those with previous hospitalization within the preceding 30 days, were excluded. Children with wheeze received a single dose of bronchodilator (Salbutamol 0.15mg/ kg by nebulization), and those whose symptoms disappeared were excluded. All children received standard treatment including antibiotics, other medications as required and supportive care as per institution guidelines. confirmation of the diagnosis by a medical officer was required. Children whose symptoms of CAP disappeared with a single dose of bronchodilator were excluded. After obtaining written parental consent to participate, a total of 2345 children were enrolled in the study and included in analysis.
