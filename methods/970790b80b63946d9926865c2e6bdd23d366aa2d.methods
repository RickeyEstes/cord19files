In general, the examination methods are: (a) necropsy-following after sacrifice, (b) serology, (c) bacteriology and (d) parasitology. Most of these methods are described in special publications (Feldman and Seely, 1988; Kunstyr, 1992; Owen, 1992; Kraft et al., 1994) and in various textbooks. Reliable results are only obtained if appropriate and sufficiently sensitive methods are used for health monitoring. It is therefore evident that the methods must be adapted to the actual 'state of art', i.e. to introduce new proven methods as they become available. Microscopic methods such as stereomicroscopy are commonly used for monitoring for ectoparasites. Adhesive tape, flotation or direct microscopy of wet mounts taken from the intestinal tract are used for detection of endoparasites. Monitoring for bacteria is usually done by culture methods. However, serology or PCR may in some cases be superior or the only reliable approaches (e.g. for Streptobacillus moniliformis, Clostridium piliforme or Mycoplasma pulmonis) (van Kuppeveld et al., 1993; Goto and Itoh, 1994) . Monitoring for viral infections is primarily done by serological methods. PCR, as an example of a new method, might be applicable in the case of acute infections (clinical disease) or for agents causing persistent infections (e.g. parvoviruses under specific conditions; Gaertner et al., 1995; Besselsen et al., 1995) . However, the lack of macroscopical changes during necropsy or lack of histopathological changes are still commonly used as the sole basis for declaring a population negative for a specific organism. This must be considered insufficient and unacceptable. Serological methods must be selected properly as they may differ in their sensitivity and specificity (Smith, 1986; Lussier, 1991) . Unexpected serological results should always be confirmed by an independent method or, preferably, by virus isolation or antigen detection in order to avoid false-positive results. Some acceptable serological methods for the most common viral and some bacterial pathogens are given in Table 8 .8.
