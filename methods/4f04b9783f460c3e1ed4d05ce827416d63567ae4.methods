We screened Hajj and Umrah returnees from October 2014 to April 2015 for MERS-CoV and influenza virus infections; during this period Hajj occurred from October 1e6, 2014. In-flight announcements for all airlines arriving from Mecca and landing at Srinagar airport were arranged for disembarking passengers, and advised pilgrims with current respiratory symptoms or fever to report to the medical team stationed in the arrival hall. Disembarking passengers were also questioned about the symptoms and enrolment in the study was offered to symptomatic passengers after their informed verbal consent. Data on demographics, symptoms, and history of prior influenza vaccination were recorded in a predefined case report form. Two swabs (nasopharyngeal and throat) were collected from each participant and pooled in viral transport media; and then transported to the laboratory in Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) within 3e4 h of collection. Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for MERS-CoV using a WHO recommended protocol (targeting region upstream of E protein gene (upE) of MERS-CoV [8] and influenza viruses. Patients with positive results for influenza viruses were contacted for assessment for therapy by the medical clinic at SKIMS or by respective physicians and treated if indicated. Descriptive statistics was used to assess various prevalence rates. Comparison of proportions was performed by SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) Version 17 software, IBM Limited, USA. Values have been expressed as percentages and a pvalue of <0.05 was considered significant. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee of SKIMS.
