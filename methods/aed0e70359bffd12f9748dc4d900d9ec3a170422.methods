Preparation of Npl4, Ufd1, and Cdc48. The codon-optimized cDNAs of yNpl4, hNpl4, and yUfd1 were synthesized (Eurofins) to improve their expressions in Escherichia coli. For crystallization, the gene encoding yNpl4 113-580 or yUfd1 288-305 was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 expression vector using BamHI and XhoI sites or pCold-GST expression vector using NdeI and XhoI sites, respectively, to produce the N-terminal GST fusion proteins. For GST pulldown assays, the fulllength yNpl4 and yUfd1 genes were cloned into the pGEX-6P1 expression vector using BamHI and XhoI sites 15 , and the Cdc48 gene was cloned into the pET21a expression vector using BamHI and XhoI sites. For SPR analyses, the gene encoding yNpl4 113-580 or hNpl4 105-608 was cloned into the pET28a expression vector using NdeI and XhoI sites to produce the N-terminal His 6 -tagged proteins. For fluorescence anisotropy-based affinity measurements, the GWCCPGCC sequence was attached to the C-terminus of yUfd1 288-305 . The yUfd1 288-305 -GWCCPGCC gene was cloned into the pCold-SUMO expression vector using NdeI and XhoI sites to produce the N-terminal His 6 -tagged SUMO fusion protein. Mutations were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. Primer sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table 1. E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with each expression vector, and cultured in LB medium containing 100 mg L −1 ampicillin for the pGEX-6P1 or pCold expression vectors or 50 mg L −1 kanamycin for the pET28a expression vector at 37°C. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached~0.5, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM to induce protein expression, and the culture was further continued for 18 h at 20°C for the pGEX-6P1 and pET28a expression vectors and for 24 h at 15°C for the pCold expression vector. The cells transformed with the pGEX-6P1 or pCold-GST expression vector were disrupted by sonication in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5% Triton X-100, and purified by a Glutathione Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) and a Resource Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). The GST tag of GST-yNpl4 113-580 was cleaved by HRV3C protease, and the sample was further purified by a Resource Q anion exchange column and a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM βmercaptoethanol. To prepare the yNpl4 113-580 -yUfd1 288-305 complex for crystallization, a two-fold molar excess of GST-yUfd1 288-305 was incubated at 4°C for 10 min with yNpl4 113-580 . The GST-yUfd1 288-305 -yNpl4 113-580 complex was purified by a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The GST tag of GST-yUfd1 288-305 -yNpl4 113-580 was cleaved by HRV3C protease. To remove GST, the sample was passed over a Glutathione Sepharose FF column pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM βmercaptoethanol. The cells transformed with the pCold-SUMO or pET28a expression vectors were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100, and purified by a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (Qiagen) and a Resource Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), except for Cdc48. For preparation of Cdc48, the Cdc48expressing cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Tris (2-carboxiehyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 100 μM ATP) and disrupted by sonication. After addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.1%), the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 29,300 x g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was incubated with TALON resin (Takara). After extensive washing, Cdc48 was eluted in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.1) containing 100 mM NaCl, 0.3 M imidazole, 5 mM MgCl 2, 100 μM ATP, and 0.5 mM TCEP. To further enrich for hexameric Cdc48, the solution was loaded on a Superose 6 10/300 column equilibrated to 50 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5 mM TCEP with a flow rate of 0.25 mL min −1 . To prepare the yUfd1-His 6 -yNpl4 113-580 complex for SPR analysis, the cells expressing GST-yUfd1 and those expressing His 6 -yNpl4 113-580 were mixed and disrupted at the same time by sonication in PBS containing 1 mM DTT and 0.5% Triton X-100. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Glutathione Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). The GST tag of GST-yUfd1-His 6 -yNpl4 113-580 was cleaved by HRV3C protease, and the sample was further purified by a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl. Preparation of Ub chains and ubiquitylated substrates. Ub was overproduced in E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) transformed with the pET26b expression vector harboring the Ub gene in LB medium containing 50 mg L −1 kanamycin at 20°C. The SeMet-labeled Ub, Ub (P19M V26M), and Ub (I30M) was overproduced in the methionine-auxotroph E. coli strain B834 (DE3) cells in the customized medium equivalent to LeMaster medium (Code No. 06780, Nacalai tesque) with 30 μg mL −1 L-SeMet (Nacalai tesque) and 50 mg L −1 kanamycin at 20°C. The cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The cleared lysates of Ub and Ub variant were incubated for 5 min at 80 and 60°C, respectively. The denatured and insolubilized E. coli proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000×g for 60 min. The supernatant was purified by a Resource S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaCl. The purified Ub was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 10,000 MWCO filter (Millipore). K48-, K63-, and M1-Ub 4 , and SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 were synthesized enzymatically. For K48-Ub 4 synthesis, E1 (0.25 μM), E2-25K (5 μM), and Ub (2 mM) were mixed in the reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.6 mM DTT) and incubated at 37°C for 15 h. For SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 synthesis, E1 (0.25 μM), E2-25K (5 μM), and Ub (2 mM) were mixed in the reaction buffer and incubated at 37°C for 15 h. For K63-Ub 4 synthesis, E1 (0.25 μM), Ubc13 (10 μM), MMS2 (10 μM) and Ub (2 mM) were mixed in the reaction buffer and incubated at 37°C for 15 h. For M1-Ub 4 synthesis, E1 (0.2 μM), UbcH7 (5 μM), HOIP (residues 697-1072; 0.1 μM) and Ub (2 mM) were mixed in the reaction buffer and incubated at 37°C for 15 h. Each reaction solution was mixed with four volumes of 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and loaded onto a Resource S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 140 mM NaCl. The synthesized Ub 4 species or SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 were eluted with a linear gradient of 140-400 mM NaCl in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). Peak fractions containing the Ub 4 species or SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl. The purified Ub chains were concentrated to~1 mM and stored at −80°C until use. For preparation of Ub n -GFP substrates, the gene encoding Ub-sfGFP-cytochromeb2 derived tail (Ub-GFP) 42 was cloned into the pET21a expression vector using NdeI and EcoRI sites. Ub n -GFP substrates were enzymatically synthesized and purified by column chromatography 14 . For K48-Ub n -GFP synthesis, 10 μM Ub-GFP, 1 μM E1, 20 μM gp78RING-Ube2g2, and 400 μM Ub were incubated in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl 2 at 37°C overnight. For K63-Ub n -GFP synthesis, 20 μM Ubc13/ MMS2 was used, instead of 20 μM gp78RING-Ube2g2. Ub n -GFP substrates were bound to Ni-NTA beads, washed, and then eluted in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.3 M imidazole. The elution was loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column equilibrated to 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol. Fractions containing long Ub chains (approximately Ub 10 in average) were collected for ATPase assay. Crystallization. For crystallization of yNpl4 113-580 and the yNpl4 113-580 -yUfd1 288-305 complex, the E123A, K124A, and E125A mutations were introduced into yNpl4 113-580 so as to reduce excess surface conformational entropy 27 . For crystallization of the yNpl4 113-580 -SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 (WT, P19M V26M, or I30M) complex, yNpl4 113-580 was mixed with the SeMet-labeled K48-Ub 2 in a molar ratio of 1:1.2.
