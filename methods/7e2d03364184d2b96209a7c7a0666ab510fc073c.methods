As part of documentation of PEI best practices in the African region in selected countries descriptive studies were carried out in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from October to December 2014. The studies used two standardized electronic questionnaires and self-administered and in-depth interviews and group discussions as well as on examination of documents and observation during laboratory visits and assessments. The first was to collect detailed information on best practices and the second questionnaire to collect information on the contribution or impact of the resources acquired for the eradication of polio on the laboratory infrastructures, functioning, services, equipment and staff. Both laboratories have undergone trainings organized by the regional office on different methods to determine poliovirus (PV) serotypes and whether the virus was wild or related to vaccine strains (known as intratypic differentiation or ITD) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Any wild poliovirus is further characterized to determine if it is an importation or indigenous virus [12, 13] .
