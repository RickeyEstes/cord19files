Our power calculations are based on three main processes: 1. Simulation of CC data, including selection of CC strains from a fixed set of realized CC genomes, and QTL location, and simulation of phenotypes. 2. QTL mapping, including determination of significance thresholds. 3. Evaluation of QTL detection accuracy, power, and false positive rate (FPR). These are described in detail below, after a description of the genomic data that serves as the basis for the simulations. Data on realized CC genomes CC strains: Genome data on all 19 autosomes and the X chromosome were obtained for a set of 72 CC strains (listed in Appendix C) available at the time of writing from http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/ index.py?run=FounderProbs. Genome data were in the form of founder haplotype mosaics (see below) for each strain, estimated with genotype data from the MegaMUGA genotyping platform (Morgan et al. 2016) applied to composites of multiple mice per strain. Since genotyping, some of the 72 strains have become extinct, and more may do so in the future (Darla Miller pers. comm.), although it is also possible that more may be added. At the time of writing, however, these were all genomes that had been observed at UNC. Of the 72 CC strains used in the simulations, it is planned that 54 will be maintained and distributed by The UNC Systems Genetics Core, along with another 5 whose genome data were not available in time for this study (see Discussion) to give a UNC total of 59 strains (listed in Appendix C). A subset of the UNC 59 will also eventually be maintained by The Jackson Laboratory, which will also potentially maintain 11 of the 72 not among the UNC 59. The 72 strains used in the simulations included two that were more closely related than others: CC051 and CC059. These strains, which are among the UNC 59, were derived from the same breeding funnel (making the number of independent strains available from UNC arguably 58). Their relatedness, though not explicitly modeled in the simulations, is nonetheless marked in the figures, which include an indicator denoting 58 as a currently realistic maximum for strain number in CC studies. Reduced dataset of haplotype mosaics: The genomes of the CC, as with other MPPs, can be represented by inferred mosaics of the original founder haplotypes (Mott et al. 2000) . Founder haplotype mosaics were inferred previously by the UNC Systems Genetics Core (http:// csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=FounderProbs) using the hidden Markov model (HMM) of Fu et al. (2012) applied to genotype calls from MegaMUGA, a genotyping platform providing data on 77,800 SNP markers (Morgan et al. 2016) . The HMM inference provides a vector of 36 probabilities for each CC strain for each of 77,551 loci (each defined as the interval between adjacent SNP markers) across the genome. Rather than using all of the available data for our simulations, we used a reduced version: since adjacent loci often have almost identical descent, mapping using all loci is both computationally expensive and-at least for the purposes of the power analysis-largely redundant. Thus, prior to analysis, the original dataset was reduced by averaging adjacent genomic intervals whose diplotype probabilities were highly similar. Specifically, adjacent genomic intervals were averaged if the maximum L2 norm between the probability vectors of all individuals is less than 10% of the maximum possible L2 norm ( ffiffi ffi 2 p ); this reduced the file storage from 610 MB to 288 MB, and the genome from 77,551 to 17,900 intervals (76.9% reduction in positions to be evaluated in a scan).
