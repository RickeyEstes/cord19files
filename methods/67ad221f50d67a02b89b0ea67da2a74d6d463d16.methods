Genome sequences of human Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and MERS coronavirus strains were downloaded from the NCBI Virus Variation Database 24 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/) on Dec. 20 and Dec. 31 (2015) , respectively. Because the number of MERS virus sequences is small, compared with the other two viruses analyzed, a time-series analysis was conducted for the months having at least three strains, and when the number of strains for a certain month was less than 3, these were combined with those of the nearest neighboring month that had the lower number of strains than the other neighbor. From the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource 27 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/), a total of ca. 200,000 segment sequences derived from ca. 25,000 influenza A and B virus strains were obtained on Sep. 1 (2015) . We calculated mono-and oligonucleotide occurrences in eight genome segments of influenza virus strains and summed up the occurrences for each strain. To prevent possible misassignment from a large number of pH1N1 strains, relatively small numbers of human classical H1N1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis. Influenza virus is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, and therefore, the sequences analyzed are complementary to viral genome sequences. Computer codes are available from K.W.
