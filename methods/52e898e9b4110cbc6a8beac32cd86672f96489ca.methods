A previous study indicated that the 2014 outbreak in Tokyo was related to climate conditions permitting the amplification of Aedes vectors and the annual peak of vectorial capacity [15] . In order to identify potential disease hotspots for dengue outbreaks, the Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, which was previously formulated and validated against dengue incidence [2, 16] , was utilized for Japan and South Korea. The CRF index was constructed based upon three climate and two non-climate datasets as shown in Table 1 . Briefly, monthly climate raster files for temperature, precipitation, and humidity were obtained from January 2006 to December 2017. The night-lights data were used to estimate population density at the refined resolution. Because climate raster datasets were at relatively coarse resolutions, the raster datasets were further downscaled to a finer spatial resolution using a nearest-neighbor resampling algorithm [2, 16] . As indicated by Lee at al. (2017(a), 2017(b)) [2, 16] , it was presumed that a current outbreak is a consequence of the climate conditions consistently observed during the past months, rather than single temporal values at present, and the 12-month moving average was estimated by province for each climate dataset during the study period. Temperature and humidity were positively associated with dengue incidence. However, due to the negative relationship observed between precipitation and dengue cases, the precipitation variable was reversed [2, 16, 23] . Thus all three climate datasets go towards the same underlying concept (risk for dengue fever) of the index. The datasets were standardized by subtracting the mean and by dividing by the standard deviation. The values were then averaged, and converted onto a scale from 0 to 100, with a higher number indicating higher risk. The final CRF index was adjusted by population density and elevation. The full details on the construction of the CRF index are available at [2, 16] . The CRF index was first estimated at the provincial level to observe any signals prior to the epidemic in 2014 and to compare with the rapid increase in the number of autochthonous cases reported in Tokyo, Japan. Then, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution to identify potential disease hotspots for dengue fever in Japan and South Korea. The CRF index was categorized into 10 risk levels by cutting off every 10th value between 0 and 100. Given that there was a recent outbreak during the summer of 2014 in Tokyo, the CRF index estimated during the same epidemic period in Tokyo was used as a proxy to explain the potential climate-and non-climate-likelihood of having a dengue outbreak if dengue viruses are introduced. In other words, any geographical locations where risk levels determined by the CRF index were equal to, or higher than, the proxy category, were identified as highrisk areas for potential dengue outbreaks given the influx of dengue viruses into the areas.
