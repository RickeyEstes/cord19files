We combined qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the experiences of pregnant women during the SARS outbreak. The qualitative ethnographic interviews fathomed the psychological and behavioral responses of pregnant women. The quantitative survey measured the prevalence of the identified psychobehavioral responses, as well as the levels of anxiety and depression using a casecontrol design. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board.
