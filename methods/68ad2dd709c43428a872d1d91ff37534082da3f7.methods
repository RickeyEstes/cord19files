Recognising the dispersion of SimEx materials, a scoping review of academic literature as well as an institutional search was undertaken. 11 A wide search strategy was employed to identify all relevant materials. Searches of different hazard types, exercise types and subject areas were combined (online supplementary appendix 1). The initial search returned 668 articles for screening with an additional 17 identified through bibliography review. Titles and abstracts were reviewed against inclusion and exclusion criteria (table 1) , reducing the number for fulltext review to 32. For the institutional search, institutions involved in the development, implementation or evaluation of SimEx were identified by experts in the field, as well as through relevant articles. Their websites were searched for applicable materials. Ultimately, 31 institutions, ranging from academic to national response agencies, were reviewed (online supplementary appendix 2), identifying 73 materials which were reduced to 19 following the screening of aims and objectives (figure 1). The final materials identified (n=51; online supplementary appendix 3) (32 emerging from the literature and 19 emerging from institutional review) were analysed by two independent reviewers for their scope to test aspects of health systems using the WHO Health System Framework, consisting of six independent but inter-related building blocks (table 2) . Resilience was considered to be addressed if materials demonstrated evidence of an integrated emergency response, maintenance of essential functions or reorganisation of services within the context of a PHE. A smaller number of materials (n=8) were BMJ Global Health ► Does the material look at aspects of health service delivery in the event of a simulated event? ► Does the material test a function of specific building blocks of a health system in consideration of other related building blocks? ► Does the material test preparedness and response of healthcare facilities alongside national incident management system? ► Does the material look at impact of emergencies on provision of routine essential health services? ► Does the material look at how PHEs impact health service delivery at subnational and district-level facilities? ► Does the material examine the standard of care during PHE? identified for examination of their scope to test resilience from a functional perspective (figure 1 and box 1). Materials were excluded from this portion of the analysis if they did not report either an exercise or objectives in sufficient detail to support this analysis. This portion of the analysis (n=8) involved five journal articles and three guidance materials (online supplementary appendix 4). A library of publicly available materials to support the development of SimEx was compiled in parallel to the review process.
