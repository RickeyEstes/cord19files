Preparation of CHIKV stocks. An Indian isolate of Chikungunya virus, DRDE-06 (Genbank accession no: EF-210157.2) belonging to East Central and South African (ECSA) genotype maintained at Virology Division, DRDE, Gwalior was used in the present study. The C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus larval cell line) was obtained from National Center for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune. The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 80 U gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.1 g/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ). Briefly, monolayer of cells were grown at 90% confluency and washed with plain medium prior to infection. The virus was allowed to adsorb to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium. Following adsorption, the inoculum was removed by washing once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and replenished with maintenance medium (EMEM-TPB with 2% FBS). The culture medium was harvested on appearance of cytopathic effects after 48 h post infection. Aliquots were stored in a − 80 °C freezer. RNA extraction. Viral RNA was isolated from 140 μ l of the clarified infected culture supernatant using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer's protocol. The viral RNA was quantified, aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C up to use. Molecular cloning and construction of expression plasmid. The obtained RNA was denatured at 70 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) 30 primer with M-MulV reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for 1 h. The primers for recombinant DNA cloning were designed according to the sequence provided in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) ( Table 1) . CHIKV DNA fragment (~3.7 kbp) encoding the structural polyprotein was amplified using the synthesized cDNA as a template. The oligonucleotides F1 and R1 were used for the amplification of structural polyprotein. The amplified product was again subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers F2 and R2 having NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes sites. The PCR product was purified with the use of PCR purification kit from Qiagen and restriction digestion of the purified PCR product was done. The pET28c vector was digested using the same NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes. Both the digested products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and the digested bands were excised. The DNA was eluted from these excised bands of agarose gel using DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen, USA). The two DNA fragments were ligated overnight at 15 °C with T4 DNA ligase. The ligated mixture was transformed into E. coli cells DH5α (DE3) and the culture was spread on Luria Bertani (LB) agar plate having 50 μ g/ml kanamycin. The plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The colonies were picked and screened for the presence of structural polyprotein encoding gene insert. The confirmed constructs containing the gene encoding structural polyprotein of CHIKV was used as a template for the amplification of both the inactive CVCP (residues 106-261) and the active C-terminal truncated CVCP (residues 106-259). The amplification of CVCP was carried out using oligonucleotides: F3 and R3 for inactive CVCP, and F3 and R4 for active CVCP having NdeI and XhoI sites. Using the same protocol described above, the PCR amplified products were subcloned into pET28c vector containing Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site instead of thrombin. Positive clones containing the insert were identified by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion of isolated plasmids. Further, DNA sequencing of the isolated plasmids was done to confirm the presence of gene fragments encoding inactive and active CVCP. The N-terminal Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavable His 6 -tag was incorporated in both the constructs to facilitate protein purification using Ni +2 affinity chromatography.
