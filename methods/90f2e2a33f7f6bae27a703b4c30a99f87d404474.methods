Mice. This study was approved by the University of Bristol's Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. Specified pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Margate, UK), Harlan (UK) or B&K Universal (UK) and were housed in same-sex groups of five mice per cage, maintained in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with environmental enrichment and were fed on commercial rodent diet, ad libitum (EURodent diet 22%; PMI Nutrition International, LLC, Brentwood, MO, USA). Wild mice were live trapped at sites in the southern UK (Fig. 1 , Supplementary Table 1) using Longworth traps baited with rolled oats and carrots, left overnight and inspected at least every 24 h (ref. 24) . Trapped mice were transferred to a conventional animal house for 2-7 days post capture and maintained under the same conditions as the laboratory reared mice, except that they were housed individually. Mice were trapped between March 2012 and April 2014. Mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. Mice were weighed, measured, and bled out by cardiac puncture and dissected. Blood was collected into a heparinized container, centrifuged at 13,000g at 18°C for 10 min and plasma was aliquoted and stored at À 20°C. Spleens were aseptically removed, weighed and single cell suspensions prepared by homogenization through a 70 mm cell strainer (BD Biosciences); cells were counted by microscopy using a haemocytometer and live cells enumerated by trypan blue exclusion 25 . Eye lens mass was used to determine age according to the formula described elsewhere 26 . Infections. We determined the intestinal parasite and ectoparasite fauna of the wild mice as described in ref. 24 . We assayed each mouse for evidence of microbial infection using ImmunoComb kits (50MTV103 and 50MIC103, Biogal Galed Labs, Israel), an ELISA-based product to detect antibodies to Corona, Mouse Hepatitis, Sendai, Minute, Noro and Parvo viruses and to M. pulmonis. However, because mouse hepatitis virus is a corona virus and the manufacturer's data sheet lacked clarity as to the antigens used in the assay, corona virus data were excluded to avoid over estimation of the number of viruses present in any particular sample. Genotyping. Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 mm tail tips which were digested with 0.8 mg ml Table 5 . DNA was purified using standard phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated in ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA pH 8, 10 mM Tris pH 8) and quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies). A total of 167 wild mice from site HW (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 3) and two C57BL/6 (designated L88 and L90) mice were genotyped at 1,168 autosomal loci using the GoldenGate Mouse MD mouse chip (GT-18-131, Illumina) following the manufacturer's instructions. The loci on this chip were chosen to differentiate C57BL/6 mice from other commonly used mouse strains. Technical replicates of the laboratory mouse DNA (15 replicates per sample) indicated that the genotyping error rate across the 2,336 nucleotides was o1%. Our genotyping of C57BL/6 mice showed perfect concordance with published data (http://support.illumina.com/ array/array_kits/mouse_md_linkage/downloads.html) for this strain. We constructed a pairwise distance matrix of the number of genotyped nucleotide differences among individuals, and included reference genotypes for other laboratory strains (C57BL/6J, NOD/Ltj, 129S1/SvlmJ, CBA/J, AKR/J, FVB/NJ, C3H/HeJ, BALB/cJ, DBA/2J, SJL/J) provided by Illumina (http://support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/mouse_md_linkage/ downloads.html). The distance matrix was then used to construct a nearest neighbour joining tree in MEGA6 (ref. 27) . Serum protein ELISA. Serum concentrations of haptoglobin, SAP and AAT were determined using in-house sandwich ELISAs. Briefly, 96-well microtitre plates were coated with 50 ml per well of goat polyclonal anti-mouse haptoglobin (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; 1 in 4,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-SAP (Calbiochem, Watford, UK; 1 in 6,000) or chicken polyclonal anti-AAT (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; 1 in 6,000) diluted in PBS coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed twice with PBS-Tween (0.05% v/v Tween-20 in PBS) washing buffer and blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% w/v bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween. The plates were washed twice, 50 ml of each test serum (diluted 1 in 10,000-1,00,000 for haptoglobin; 1 in 400 for SAP; 1 in 80,000 for AAT) in blocking buffer added to duplicate wells, incubated overnight at 4°C and washed. For analyte detection, 50 ml of affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody to SAP, haptoglobin or AAT (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Portland, USA; biotinylated in-house using NHS-LC-Biotin, Cayman Chemical Company Co, Ann Arbor, USA), diluted to 0.1-0.5 mg ml À 1 in PBS-Tween, added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed, incubated with 50 ml per well of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.125 mg ml À 1 ; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in PBS-Tween for 30 min at room temperature, washed again and developed with 100 ml per well of tetramethylbenzidine solution (Tebu-bio, Peterborough, UK) for 15-20 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 ml per well of 2 M H 2 SO 4 and the plates were read at 450 nm on a Dynex MRXII plate reader (Dynex Technologies, Worthing, UK). SAP, haptoglobin and AAT concentrations were determined by interpolation of optical density units for standard curves generated from purified proteins or standards. SAP was purified from normal mouse serum using phosphorylethanolamine-sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and anion exchange (DE-52) chromatography, as previously described 28 . Standards for haptoglobin and AAT were purchased from Immunology Consultants Laboratory. Serum IgG and IgE ELISAs were performed using Ready-SET-Go Kits (88-50400 and 88-50460) from eBioscience (Hartfield, UK), following the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that we diluted the test samples for the wild mice 1 in 400,000 for IgG and 1 in 200 for IgE respectively 10 . Faecal IgA ELISA. Faeces were removed from the hindgut of mice, weighed and dissolved in 50 ml PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail at a final concentration of 20% v/v (SIGMAFASTTM Protease Inhibitor cocktail Tablets, EDTA-free) to form a slurry that was left at room temperature for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant removed. The IgA concentration of these supernatants was measured using a commercially available mouse IgA ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Mouse IgA ELISA Ready-SET-Go, 88-50450, eBioscience). Faecal supernatant samples were serially diluted starting from a 1:500 dilution (in PBS with 1% v/v Tween and 10% w/v BSA). Standard curves were constructed using the mouse IgA supplied with the kit, and this was used to interpolate the IgA concentrations in our samples expressed as the mg concentration per g of faeces. Spleen cell cultures. Spleen cells were suspended in complete culture medium (RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% v/v FCS, 100 U ml À 1 penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine; all Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at a concentration of 1.5 Â 10 6 cells per ml and 0.1 ml aliquots were dispensed into each well of 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK). One of the following stimulants (0.1 ml) was added to each well: anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (each at 5 mg ml À 1 ; eBioscience, Hartfield, UK), CpgG1826 (at 1 mg ml À 1 ; MWG Eurofins, Ebersberg, Germany), PG (at 10 mg ml À 1 ; Sigma, Poole, UK), LPS (2.5 mg ml À 1 ); 0.1 ml complete culture medium was used as a negative control. Cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 for 15 h, centrifuged at 400g for 5 min and approximately 0.15 ml of supernatant was removed, divided into two aliquots and stored at À 80°C until assayed for cytokines by bead array. Flow cytometry. Freshly isolated spleen cells were stained for leucocyte surface markers with intracellular staining for Foxp3 following permeabilization of cells 25 . Samples were analysed on an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, USA). Details of the antibodies and their combination into staining panels are provided in Supplementary Table 6 . Gating strategies for lymphocyte subpopulations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 . Ly49h genotyping. To complement the flow cytometry analysis of Ly49 markers, we genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus (also known as Klra8 (ref. 29)), where a deletion has previously been associated with inducing susceptibility to mouse cytomegalovirus infection 18 . We genotyped 98 randomly selected HW mice at the Ly49h locus by PCR as described in ref. 30 using primer pair D6Ott174 that lies within the putative deletion (such that non-amplification indicates the mouse is homozygous for the deletion) combined with amplification using the primer pair D6Ott175 as a control for amplification of this locus. We used DNA from control mice, specifically C57BL/6 and B65.BXD8 without and with the deletion 30 , respectively, as controls. Cytokine bead arrays. Cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants were assayed using Bioplex Pro kits (M60-009RDPD & MD0-00000EL, Bio-Rad, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions, and analysed on a Luminex 100 (LuminexCorp, Austin, USA) running Bioplex Manager software. Initially supernatants from 31 wild and 10 laboratory mice were analysed for 32 cytokines and chemokines (Supplementary Data 4) and these data used to identify analytes where concentrations above the assay's limit of detection were observed in at least some animals and where the data were not highly correlated with other analytes. This resulted in the selection of nine highly informative analytes comprising IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-g and MIP-2a (Fig. 7) . Data that were below the assay's range were set to values of 0.001 for the purposes of statistical analyses. Statistical analyses. Owing to technical or sample volume limitations, not all parameters could be measured for all mice and thus sample sizes vary on a test-by-test basis and are reported either alongside the data or in the degrees of freedom. Data that were normally distributed (body mass; spleen mass:body mass ratio) or that could be normalized (age; log 10 transformed) were analysed using general linear models. All other data were analysed using repeated non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests, unless otherwise indicated). The comparison of wild and laboratory mice compares 181 wild mice from site HW and 64 laboratory mice (LMC 1-4, 9-41, 64, 65, 68-82, 85-93, 95) (Supplementary Data 1). Owing to the different sample sizes, and the differing proportions of male and female mice between the laboratory and wild animal groups, separate, univariate general linear models were used to analyse the effect of sex on the age of wild mice and also the effect of animal group (that is, wild versus laboratory) and the effect of sex within these groups on body mass and spleen mass:body mass ratio. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare spleen mass and viable spleen cell number between animal group and sex within group. The remaining variables were tested for any effect of sex within each animal group. Where variables differed significantly by sex for either group, we divided the mice into four groups: laboratory female, laboratory male, wild female and wild male. Kruskal-Wallis H tests were then applied with post hoc pairwise comparisons (Dunn-Bonferroni), controlling for Type I error inflation. Associations between immunological and morphometric parameters among wild mice were assessed by Pearson correlations (two-tailed) on untransformed data. Finally, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare differences in cytokine production between groups. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v.21 (IBM Corp., New York, USA). Box plots were produced using R software via the website, boxplot.tyerslab.com. Data availability. Genotype data referenced in this study are available in Mouse MD Linkage Panel Support 31 .
