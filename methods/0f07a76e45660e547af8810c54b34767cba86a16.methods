The risk of importation of cases of COVID-19 to Africa from China was estimated based on origin-destination air travel flows from January, 2019; 8, 11, 12 number of cases in Chinese provinces; and the population in each of the Chinese provinces that reported transmission. Air travel flows counts the number of origin-destination tickets and account for any connection at intermediate airports. 11 Case data included all confirmed cases recorded until Feb 11, 2020. 13 Human population data per province 14 were used to estimate incidence in China. Province-level incidence data were linked to the three airports with the largest volumes in each province (figure 1). 12 The province of Hubei was not included among the possible locations able to export the virus, given the travel ban introduced by Chinese authorities on Jan 23 and 24, 2020. 5 The importation risk per country in Africa was measured as the probability of importing a case from the infected provinces in China, accounting for the origindestination travel flows originated from such provinces and for their different epidemic levels (appendix p 2). For sensitivity, we considered a larger area as the basin of attraction of the airports of Beijing and Shanghai, which included their neighbouring provinces (appendix p 2). For each African country, the most likely origins of potential case importation were identified by computing a country's exposure to each Chinese province, measuring the probability of a city in China being the origin of a travelling case to the country. Similarity between exposure profiles of different countries was quantified with entropy-based metrics, 15 and used to group countries with similar importation patterns via agglomerative clustering (appendix p 2). The WHO IHR MEF is a set of four components developed by WHO to support the evaluation of a country's functional ability to detect and respond to a health emergency. The IHR MEF is composed of a mandatory self-reporting of capacity (the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting [SPAR] 10 ), and three voluntary compo nents, namely the Joint External Evaluation, 16 the after-action reviews, and simulation exercises, which are all collected and dissemi nated by WHO. SPAR generates data and has indicators for all African countries for 2018. 17 Joint External Evaluation is consolidated through joint internal and external evaluation processes. In Africa, Joint External Evaluation data were only available for 43 countries from 2016 to 2019. 16 The 2018 SPAR database 17 contains 24 indicator scores, organised and grouped according to the following capacities (bracketed number shows indicators per capacity 10 ): legislation (three), IHR Coordination (two), zoonoses (one), food safety (one), laboratory (three), surveillance (two), human resource (one), national health emergency framework (three), health service provision (three), communication (one), points of entry (two), chemical events (one), and radi ation emergency (one). The SPAR index was derived to quantify each
