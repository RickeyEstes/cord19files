Euthanasia of chickens was carried out by intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbital and confirmed through cervical dislocation. Viruses and cells. Recombinant A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08 H9N2 virus (UDL01-WT) was generated using reverse genetics as previously described (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . UDL01-KO whereby a stop codon was introduced at aa position 12 in the PB1-F2 ORF was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in the PB1 genetic segment prior to rescue. Virus stocks were produced via passage in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs; the allantoic fluid was harvested after 48 h and titrated by plaque assay on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC). MDCK and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Biosera), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 % non-essential aa (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary chicken kidney cells (cKCs) were prepared in house as previously described (Penzes et al., 1994) from 2-3-week-old Rhode Island Red chickens and maintained in EMEM, 7 % BSA (Sigma), 1 % penicillin/ streptomycin and tryptose phosphate broth. Both MDCKs and cKCs were maintained at 37 C with 5 % CO 2 . Ex vivo chicken tracheal organ cultures (cTOCs) were prepared as previously described (Armesto et al., 2009 ) and maintained in EMEM supplemented with 1M HEPES and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin; these were maintained under liquid at 37 C with no addition of CO 2 . Validation of segment 2 gene expression. To analyse viral gene expression from transfected plasmids, a previously published strategy was adopted (Wise et al., 2011) . Briefly, nucleotides 1-380 of UDL-1/08 PB1 were cloned into AgeI/KpnI sites of pEGFPN1 (Clontech). Using site-directed mutagenesis the position of the EGFP ORF was adjusted into frame with either the PB1 or PB1-F2 reading frames, while concurrently removing the GFP ATG codon. Additional segment 2 mutations as detailed in the results section were made using site directed mutagenesis with the WT segment plasmids as templates. 2 µg of each plasmid was transfected into HEK 293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 12 h after transfection, 10 µM MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium for a further 12 h. Cells were harvested and the presence of alpha-tubulin and PB1-, PB1-N40-and PB1-F2-GFP was detected via Western blot using rabbit anti-alpha tubulin (Abcam) and mouse anti-GFP (Gene Tex) antibodies with IRDye 800CW/IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies (LI-COR) and visualized using the Odyssey CLx (Li-Cor). Densitometric analysis was performed using Image Studio software (Li-Cor) from three independent experiments and the intensities for PB1-, PB1-N40-and PB1-F2-GFP were normalized to alpha-tubulin. Fold change in protein expression relative to the WT was calculated. with 2 µg ml À1 TPCK trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). They were then incubated at 37 C for 72 h. Plaques were developed using crystal violet stain containing methanol. The limit of virus detection in the plaque assays was 6.67 p.f.u. ml À1 . Minimum lethal dose and minimum infectious dose assays. Groups of five, 10-day-old embryonated hens' eggs were inoculated into the allantoic cavity with 100 µl of 10-fold decreasing concentrations of each virus in PBS from 10 000 to 0.001 p.f.u. The embryos were monitored in a double-blinded study by two people, twice daily until 72 hpi or until signs of end point as defined by lack of embryo movement and/or severe haemorrhage. Eggs were chilled at 4 C to confirm death and the allantoic fluid was harvested and presence of infectious virus determined. The influenza viral infectivity assay was performed by inoculating a 96-well plate of MDCK cells with 100 µl of undiluted allantoic fluid for 1 h at 37 C. Following washing in PBS, serum-free DMEM was added to the cells for 12 h. Cells were fixed with 50 % methanol : 50 % acetone and immune-stained for influenza nucleoprotein (NP). NP was detected using a mouse a-NP antibody produced at The Pirbright Institute and an IRDye 800CW a-mouse secondary antibody (Li-Cor) and visualized using Odyssey Imaging Systems (Li-Cor). The MLD was defined as the lowest viral dose resulting in death of all infected embryonated chicken eggs and the MID defined as the lowest viral dose required to produce infection in all embryonated chicken eggs. Infection and transmission of virus in chickens. Mixed, sex-specific pathogen free (SPF) Rhode Island Red chickens bred at The Pirbright Institute poultry production unit were used at 3 weeks old. Preinfection sera were obtained from all chickens and all were negative for reactive influenza antibodies against A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL01/08 (UDL01). Chickens were split into three groups: Mock, UDL01-WT and UDL01-KO. The UDL01-WT and UDL01-KO were housed in self-contained BioFlex B50 Rigid Body Poultry isolators (Bell Isolation Systems). Chickens were inoculated intranasally with 100 µl (50 µl nare À1 ) of PBS for Mock group or UDL01-WT or UDL01-KO either at a low dose of virus (5Â10 3 p.f.u.) or high dose (1Â10 5 p.f.u.). Naive sentinel birds were introduced into the isolators with infected birds 24 h or 5 days after direct inoculation to assess transmission. Birds were humanely euthanized 14 days post inoculation and sera samples collected for analysis of virus specific antibodies. Sample collection from chickens and the isolator environment. Infection of birds was assessed by swabbing both the buccal and cloacal cavities daily with sterile polyester tipped swabs (Fisher Scientific) which were transferred into viral transport medium (WHO, 2006) , vortexed briefly, clarified and stored at À80 C prior to virus detection. On days 2 and 5 post inoculation, four birds from each group were humanely culled and organs (nasal tissue, trachea, lungs, oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, ileum, colon, blood and spleen) were snap frozen. Prior to processing, the organs were thawed on ice and homogenized inside a tube containing a 5 mm steel bead in a Bead Mill (Retsch MM 300) under the conditions of 20 Hz for 4 min. For infectious virus quantification, 20 % w/v of organ to PBS containing 1 % penicillin/streptomycin was added to the tube prior to homogenization; this was then clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant was used in plaques assays. For environmental sample collection, approximately 1 ml of drinking water was collected from both water sources inside each isolator. To the sample, 10Â DMEM was added to achieve 1Â DMEM. Approximately 1 g of dry food was added to 1 ml of viral transport medium and vortexed briefly. Both environmental sample types were clarified of debris by centrifugation at 450 g for 2 min and stored at À80 C prior to virus detection by plaque assay. qRT-PCR of viral M gene. For viral M gene detection from chicken tissue, 750 µl of Trizol LS (Life Technologies) was added prior to homogenization. RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues by chloroform extraction and purification with a RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Quantification of vRNA copies was undertaken using a single-step realtime reverse transcription PCR, the Superscript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies). Primers and a TaqMan probe specific for a conserved region of the influenza A matrix gene were used as described previously (Spackman et al., 2002) . Cycling conditions were: 50 C, 5 min; 95 C, 2 min and then 40 cycles of 95 C, 3 s and 60 C, 30 s, using a 7500 fast real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). A T7 transcribed RNA standard of the M gene was run alongside each assay to generate a standard curve. Genome: p.f.u. ratios. Three independently produced viral stocks in embryonated chicken eggs for each virus were assessed. The p.f.u. were determined using standard plaque assay on MDCK cells. In parallel, RNA was extracted and the number of influenza M gene copies determined via qRT-PCR as previously described. The genome : p.f.u. ratio was calculated and the mean for each virus reported with SD. Statistical analysis. All statistics were performed using the statistical function on GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). Statistical calculations included two-tailed paired Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney Utest. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Bioinformatics. In June 2015, all sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genomes/FLU/Database/nph-select.cgi?go=database) as full-length DNA sequences; we excluded identical sequences through the collapse function. All sequences were analysed using MEGA6: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) . For PB1-F2 length analysis, full-length PB1 sequences were downloaded and the PB1-F2 ORFs were extracted, aligned and translated. Only sequences with methionine at the canonical aa position zero were analysed to only include C-terminal truncations. For species analysis, separate sequence sets were downloaded for human, swine and avian. The avian orders and specific subtypes were categorized from total avian sequences after download. For analysis of PB1-F2 by pathogenicity, matched full-length HA and PB1 sequences were downloaded. The sequence surrounding the cleavage site of HA was extracted, aligned and translated. Viruses were classified as HPAI if they contained >2 basic aa (Arg, Lys or His) upstream, proximal to the cleavage motif as defined previously (OFFLU, 2014) .
