For a fully traced transmission tree (i.e., the information of the infector v and time of symptom onset t are collected), the infector v(i) for each case i (except the index case) and the duration between symptom onset of case i and symptom onset of its infector v(i): t i -t v(i) should be known. From these it is straightforward to estimate the generation interval distribution and transmissibility of infection. In reality, however, it is rare and difficult to record all the information. Based on the partially known contact tracing data and dates of symptom onset, Hens et al. [14] illustrated an inference method to reconstruct the most likely transmission tree that involved with only one virus. Here we further develop it to a transmission tree during an outbreak that involves with two viruses of similar epidemiological characteristics. In general, a possible transmission tree can be described by p ij (v,w,φ;θ), the probability that case j is the infector of case i, given the duration between symptom onset of case i and case j, given the information on the possible infector v and the known contacts w, and given the types φ of infection of both cases. Following Hens et al [14] , its total log-likelihood is given by: The sum runs through all the non-zero p ij . Here g(Δt |θ) denotes the probability density of the generation interval distribution of influenza infection, with θ representing the set of parameters that characterise the probability density distribution. Different distributions such as gamma, lognormal and Weibull can be used to describe the distribution of generation intervals [14] . Here we assume it follows a Weibull distribution: The distribution has two parameters (i.e., θ = {a, b}): scale parameter a and shape parameter b, such that the mean is Compared with outbreaks that involved one virus and one transmission process [14] , this outbreak [12] involved two viruses and five possible transmission processes: from A/H1N1 to A/H1N1; from A/H3N2 to A/H3N2; from coinfection to A/H1N1; from co-infection to A/H3N2 and from co-infection to co-infection. However, the data given in Liu et al. [12] only provide the relevant information for three transmission processes: from A/H1N1 to A/H1N1; from co-infection to A/H1N1; and from co-infection to co-infection. The simple calculations show that the mean generation intervals (and their standard deviations) for the three transmission processes are 1.8 (0.8), 1.2 (0.4), 1.6 (0.6) days, respectively. In this data there is no evidence that they differ. As no data is available for the transmission processes that were involved with A/H3N2 [12] , it is difficult to estimate their generation intervals and judge how they differ from those generation intervals involved with pandemic A/H1N1. Nevertheless, a recent systematic review [15] indicates that the generation interval of pandemic A/H1N1 virus was similar to that of the seasonal flu. Further, as observed by Liu et al. [12] , the three different types of infections have similar epidemiological characteristics. In view of these, the same generation interval distribution is assumed for the three types of infection. The probability that case i is infected by case j, p ij , can be calculated as the probability of observing the duration between the symptom onsets in cases i and j, g(t i -t j |θ), times the probability of a potentially infectious contact between i and j, π ij , normalized by the probability of i being infected by any other case k: The probability of a potentially infectious contact between i and j, π ij , is based on the contact information (v,w) collected during the outbreak and the types φ of infection of both cases i and j. To distinguish different types of infection and to reflect the fact that there is only limited mixing between students in building 1 and building 2, we define the following, ψ ij ¼ 1 if case i and case j reside in the same dormitory and are the same type of infection or if case j is a co−infection; ψ ij ¼ w if case i and case j reside in different dormitories and are the same type of infection or if case j is a co−infection; The variable w defines the extent of contact rates between students in two dormitories in relation to contact rates within dormitories: w = 0 implies that contacts between dormitories are forbidden and w = 1 suggests that contacts between dormitories are the same as that within each dormitory. Student access to the college clinic was not restricted. The original numberings of patients in Fig. 2 of Liu et al. [12] are given in accordance with the order of symptom onset within each building. For the convenience of our analysis, the forty patients have been re-indexed in the order of symptom onset as 1, 2, …, 40 (see Fig. 1 ). If cases i and j form a likely transmission pair (i.e., v(i) = j) and there is only one possible infector, π ij (v,w,φ) = ψ ij and p ij (v,w,φ;θ) =1. If the outbreak investigation reveals that case i is not the index case and does not contact any of the i-1 cases that developed symptoms before case i, the probability of a potentially infectious contact is π ij (v,w,φ) = ψ ij /η i-1 Here η i-1 is the 'effective' number of infections that developed symptoms before case i and are of the same type of infection as case i or co-infection, and is calculated as Given the contact information (v,w), the most likely transmission tree can be obtained by finding the values of parameters θ = {a, b} that maximize the total loglikelihood (1). The downhill simplex method [16] was used to locate the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE), θ , of the parameters. We also used the MCMC method to sample the values of parameters θ and find their medians, 2.5 percentile and 97.5 percentile. From the probabilities that case i is infected by case j: {p 1i , …, p Ni }, we can sample a transmission tree in which all cases are connected and case 1 is the index case ( Fig. 1) and further estimate transmissibility. The case reproduction number is the average number of secondary cases generated by primary cases, which measures the transmissibility of infection. The overall casereproduction number on day t, R t , can be estimated by summing over all these infectious contacts: We can further estimate the infection type-specific reproductive numbers when both case i and case j are of the same type of infection: Here the symbol δ ij,TYPE is defined as: δ ij,TYPE =1 if both cases i and j are of the infection TYPE; δ ij,TYPE = 0 otherwise. To characterise the interaction between two types of virus within co-infected individuals, we further estimate the reproductive numbers of A/H1N1 and A/ H3N2 due to co-infected individuals as: Here Δ ij,TYPE is defined as: Δ ij,TYPE =1 if infector case j is co-infected while the infectee case i is singly infected with type TYPE; otherwise Δ ij,TYPE =0. The strain interactions within co-infections are estimated as: Here ϕ 1 measures the effect on infectivity of A/H1N1 within co-infections and ϕ 2 measures the effect on infectivity of A/H3N2 within co-infections. Fig. 1 One plausible transmission tree. The tree was constructed under the assumption of limited mixing rate between students in two dormitories in relation to within building mixing rates (w = 25 %). In the construction, the other possible sources of seasonal A/H3N2 virus (e.g., the two question marked boxes above building 2 and clinic in Fig. 2 of Liu et al. [12] ) have been ignored. The thick arrows represent transmissions from Liu et al. [12] while the thin arrows display one of the most likely transmissions
