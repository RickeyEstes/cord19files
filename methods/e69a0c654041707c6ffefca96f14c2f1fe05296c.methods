Cell culture and virus passaging D. melanogaster (S2) cells were grown at 28˚C in Schneider's Drosophila Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin using standard laboratory procedures. To generate the initial Flock House virus inoculum, S2 cells were plated at 50-70% confluency in a six well plate and were transfected with 2.5μg of pMT plasmid containing FHV RNA1 (NC_004146) and 2.5μg of pMT plasmid containing FHV RNA2 (NC_004144) using Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid transcription was induced 24 hours post transfection with the addition of 50mM CuSO 4 . Virus was then allowed to propagate for 3 days post induction. For successive passages (Passages 1-9), S2 cells were grown in T-25 flasks to 70-90% confluency (~1 x 10 7 cells), then infected with 1mL of viral inoculum from the previous passage. Virus was grown for 3 days, then fractions were harvested for viral purification or inoculation of the next passage.
