The tests were conducted in a non-occupied, unventilated test chamber (L Â W Â H=3.78 m Â 2.44 m Â 2.64 m=24.3 m 3 ). This facility was developed in the Center for Health-Related Aerosol Studies at the University of Cincinnati and used in our previous studies (Choe et al., 2000; Grinshpun et al., 2002) . A closed-loop air ventilation system with two HEPA filtration units was utilized to clean the chamber between experiments. A small fan was used to achieve a uniform aerosol concentration pattern inside the chamber. The electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI, TSI Inc./ Dekati Ltd, St. Paul, MN, USA) was used to determine the concentration and aerodynamic particle size distribution in real-time. This instrument utilizes the cascade impaction principle and also has a directreading capability. When performing the concentration and size distribution measurements, the particles were directed to the ELPI inlet through the Kr 85 charge equilibrator (3M Company, St. Paul, MN, USA). The ELPI is also capable of measuring the charge distribution of the collected particles. When the instrument was used in the charge-detection mode, the Kr 85 charge equilibrator was detached from the system. The time resolution of the ELPI was adjusted to 10 s. The data were recorded in 12 ELPI channels (each channel = impaction stage), from 0.04 to 8.4 mm. The latter sizes represent the midpoint diameters of the respective impaction stages (the midpoint = the geometric mean of the stage's boundaries). The ELPI operated in the center of the chamber. The natural aerosol concentration in the chamber was not sufficiently high for accurate direct-reading measurements, especially after the first 5-10 min of the operation of an ion emitter, which removed a considerable number of airborne particles. To increase the initial background aerosol concentration, we used a smoke generator. The generated smoke particles primarily covered a submicrometer aerodynamic size range (Cheng et al., 1995) . Overall, the data recorded in the first 9 measurement channels of the ELPI (d a =0.04-2.0 mm) were sufficient. Three ion emitters were tested: a stationary negative ionic air purifier, VI-2500 (L Â W Â H=20 cm Â 16.5 cm Â 8.5 cm), as well as two portable purifiers, positive AS150MM (+) and negative AS150MM (À) (L Â W Â H=6.5 cm Â 4 cm Â 2.2 cm). The ion density produced by the non-thermal corona discharge in the chamber was measured in our experiments for each device with the Air Ion Counter (AlphaLab Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) continuously every 10 s during about an hour. This device is capable of measuring within the range of 10 1 -2 Â 10 6 ions cm À3 . First, the natural decay of the aerosol concentration was determined. Prior to the test, the smoke aerosol was generated and mixed in the chamber for 20 min so that it was uniformly distributed and the average total particle concentration exceeded the level of $1.3 Â 10 5 cm À3 . Then the ELPI began recording the data (t=0) starting from the initial concentration C initial (d a , t=0). It operated continuously for 1 h, and the aerosol concentration C natural (d a , t) was measured. To quantitatively characterize the natural decay, the non-dimensional fractional concentrations were determined every 10 s. After this, the test aerosol was generated and mixed in the chamber again to reach the same initial concentration level. At t = 0, the ion emitter located in the center of the chamber was turned on and C initial ionizer (d a , t=0) was determined (the distance from the ion emitter to the inlet of the ELPI was approximately 0.2 m). Then the aerosol concentration, C ionizer (d a , t), was measured with the ELPI in a 10-second time intervals during 1 h, until the particle count decreased below the limit of detection. The chamber was cleaned by a close-loop ventilation system at 10 air exchanges per hour for about 4 h to insure that the ions generated during the test had been removed and the initial natural aerosol concentration in the chamber had been restored. Then the experimental procedure was repeated for the next ion emitter under the test program. The air temperature was 23711C and the relative humidity was 4279% during each experiment as monitored with a Thermometer/hygrometer (Tandy Co., Fort Worth, TX, USA). To quantify the efficiency of the particle removal exclusively due to the ion emission, the air cleaning factor (ACF) was determined. For every particle size, ACF is defined as the ratio of the concentration measured at a specific time point during the natural decay to the concentration measured at the same time point when the ion emitter was operating: The data on ACF were presented as a function of the particle aerodynamic size and the duration of the ion emission. The aerosol concentrations C ionizer (d a , t) were also compared to C initial, ionizer (d a , t=0), and the decay was characterized by the non-dimensional concentration In addition to the particle size and concentration measurements, the particle charges were measured with the ELPI that operated in its electrical charge detection mode. The data were revealed using the software made available by Dekati, Ltd., Tampere, Finland. The particle charge distribution was also assessed using the diffusion charging model (Hinds, 1999) : where n(t) is the number of elementary charges acquired by a particle during a time t due to the diffusion charging; d p is the particle physical diameter; k=1.38 Â 10 À23 J K À1 is the Boltzmann's constant; T is the air temperature (K); K E =9.0 Â 10 9 N m 2 C À2 is a constant of proportionality of the Coulomb's electrostatic equation; e=1.6 Â 10 À19 C is the elementary charge; c i is the mean thermal speed of ions; and N i is the ion density in the air. In our calculations, we assumed that d p Ed a since the particles were closeto-spherical and their density was 1 g cm À3 (Cheng et al., 1995) . The average values and the standard deviations were calculated for each set of conditions as a result of at least 3 replicates. The data were statistically analyzed using the Microsoft Excel software package (Microsoft Co., Redmond, WA, USA).
