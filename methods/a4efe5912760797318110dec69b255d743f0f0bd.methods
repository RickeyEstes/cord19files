Animals C57BL/6J mice (8 to 10 weeks old, 22 to 25 g) used as wild-type controls were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University. CXCR2 −/− mice (on the C57BL/6J background) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All mice were maintained under environmentally controlled conditions (ambient temperature, 22 ± 2°C; humidity 40 %) in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had access to water and food ad libitum. All experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University.
