Our general methodology is described in Fig. 1 . Starting from reported epidemiological data, we consider the cumulative number of cases, C, and numerically produce a smooth interpolation of its evolution (panel 1). Data collection procedures for the examples discussed in this article are given in Technical Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material. We then use this smoothed data to estimate incidence, G, as described in Technical Appendix 2 (see Supplementary Material). The crucial point of our approach is that rather than plotting C as a function of time, we plot the estimated incidence G, as a function of cumulative cases, C, G(C) (panel 2). For many outbreaks, the graph of G as a function of C has a single "hump" and can, at first order, be approximated by an inverted parabola (panel 3). This inverted parabola, whose equation contains two parameters, defines a simple model for the evolution of the outbreak, which can be used to predict future number of cases given an initial condition (panel 4). We developed a method, detailed in Technical Appendix 3 in Supplementary Material, that automatically associates a parabola to available epidemiological data of one-wave outbreaks. It works on partial (for ongoing outbreaks) or full (for outbreaks that have completed their course) data sets and proceeds as follows: rather than attempting to estimate the parabola parameters from the cumulative epidemiological curve, we fit the graph of G(C) to its parabolic approximation and the graph of C(t) to its corresponding time course, simultaneously. Doing so therefore demands that the two unknown parameters describing the parabola be chosen to provide good approximations of two different (albeit related) plots. This approach is easily applicable to ongoing outbreaks for which limited data are available, and can therefore be used for forecasting.
