We conducted a prospective and observational study of adult patients with bronchiectasis attended in the specialized clinic of two tertiary care university hospitals during the period 2011-2015. In our specific specialized clinic, patients are referred from primary care, other hospitals, other specialties or any other medical facilities. We confirmed the diagnosis of bronchiectasis by computerized tomography scan of lungs along with compatible symptoms and aetiology of bronchiectasis had been investigated according to Spanish guidelines [5] previous to study recruitment. Local committees approved the study and patients gave written informed consent (Biomedical research ethics committee Hospital La Fe 2011/0342). Patients were enrolled in the study when they presented the first exacerbation (after signing the informed consent) and required new antibiotic treatment or hospital admission and no subsequent exacerbations for every patient were included. Exclusion criteria were: a) severe immunosuppression, such as in solid-organ or bone-marrow transplantation or HIV/AIDS, or receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive drugs (â‰¥20 mg prednisoneequivalent per day for 2 weeks or more); b) active tuberculosis; c) cystic fibrosis (CF); d) pulmonary interstitial disease and e) hospitalization in the preceding 21 days.
