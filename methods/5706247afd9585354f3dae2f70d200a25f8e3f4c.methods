Sample collection. The collection protocols have been described previously (Hall et al., 2014a) . For this study, four bat guano samples were collected from each of four separate bat roosts on Codfish Island (Whenua hou) (Fig. S1 , 46u 479 S 167u 389 E). Samples were kept at 4 uC and nucleic acids were extracted within 48 h. M. tuberculata is found only in New Zealand and is listed as 'nationally endangered'. Relatively small populations of this bat are present only in remote areas of unmodified old forest. The bats are highly secretive and difficult to locate, as they frequently change roost sites and also roost in trees upwards of 15 m above the forest floor. Codfish Island is an active conservation study site where movements of this bat species are well known, and thus allowed the collection of fresh guano. Access to Codfish Island is restricted to scientists and conservation staff. Sample preparation and metagenomic sequencing. Bat guano was resuspended in 2 ml of sterile PBS, followed by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min. Nucleic acid was extracted from 400 ml of supernatant using an iPrep Purelink Virus kit (Life Technologies), with elution into 50 ml of RT-PCR molecular-grade water (Ambion). DNA and RNA were co-purified during extraction. Given resource constraints, only two of the guano samples were selected for metagenomic sequencing, and the remaining two samples were used only for confirmatory PCR assays. For the purpose of finding RNA viruses, DNA was removed using DNase treatment by Ambion DNA-free (Life Technologies), and 8 ml of DNA-free RNA was incorporated into first-strand cDNA synthesis primed by random hexamers (Life Technologies), including an RNase H digestion. This step was not required for the complementary approach that sought to find DNA viruses. The cDNA and DNA from previous steps were then amplified by multiple displacement amplification using a Whole Transcriptome Amplification kit (Qiagen) to ensure that w1 mg of DNA was produced. This is the minimum amount required for library preparation using an Illumina TruSeq DNA Library Preparation kit. DNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq2000 instrument producing 250 bp paired-end reads (New Zealand Genomics Limited). Samples were indexed using barcodes so that each metagenome could be linked specifically to the original DNA and RNA. Bioinformatics workflow. FastQC (Andrews, 2010) was used to check sequence data quality, with reads trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit with a base pair quality score threshold of 28 (http://hannonlab. cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html). Trimmed reads were then compared with the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database (downloaded in April 2013) using RAPSsearch2 (Ye et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012) , an alternative to BLASTX (Altschul et al., 1990) . Taxonomic assignment of the RAPSearch2 output was performed using MEGAN 5.2 (Huson et al., 2007; Huson & Mitra, 2012 ) with a threshold for assignment of bit scores w50 and read complexity w0.44. Paired-end read data of interest was then extracted and assembled into contigs in Geneious 6.1.7 (Biomatters; http://www.geneious.com). Confirmatory PCR. For conserved genes of interest from the metagenomic data that would allow further taxonomic assignment and phylogenetic analysis (i.e. vertebrate virus capsid, helicase or RNAdependent RNA-polymerase gene regions), specific primers were designed using the Primer3 plug-in for Geneious 6.1.7. A 25 ml reaction volume of Invitrogen Platinum SuperMix (Life Technologies) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions, including 5 ml of DNA or cDNA. Primer sequences are detailed in Table S2 . PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by purification using USB ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix) and Sanger sequencing on a capillary sequencer (model 3100 Avant; Applied Biosystems). Phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequences produced by the confirmatory PCR assays were translated into protein sequences and compared with reference virus genomes downloaded from GenBank. Only sequences with an ORF of w150 aa were considered for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were aligned in MEGA6 (6.06) using CLUSTALW with a gap opening penalty of 10 and gap extension penalty of 0.2 (Tamura et al., 2011) . Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed in MEGA6 using all available amino acid sites with 1000 bootstrap replicates and the nearest-neighbour-interchange method.
