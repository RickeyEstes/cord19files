The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the extent of the challenges of disaster management rather than to undertake an in-depth assessment of individual studies. For this reason, we conducted a scoping review rather than a systematic review. The aim of the scoping review was to rapidly map the key concepts underpinning the research area using the main sources and types of evidence available (11) . A scoping review can be used to address topics that are too broad for a systematic review, or have not been previously reviewed comprehensively (11) . Although we did not use meta-analysis (an approach commonly used for systematic reviews), systematic review methods were used where possible to minimize bias in the identification and inclusion of the studies (12) . The 'PPRR' continuum offered a preliminary framework which was used as a guide to identify the progress and challenges of disaster health management. The major health electronic databases including Pro-Quest, PubMed, EBSCO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched to identify publications such as public reports and peer-reviewed journal articles, which were relevant to the research aims. The search terms and their logical relation (e.g. AND) were: 'disaster OR emergency' AND 'medical OR health OR hospital' AND 'management OR preparedness OR response'. Additional references were identified through an examination of the references from recent pertinent publications (snowballing) and through scrutiny of the contents pages of highly relevant journals for the previous 2 years. The research inclusion criteria were: 1) journal articles, governmental and institutional reports written in English or Chinese in the past two decades; 2) studies comprising relevant evaluations of the status or description of the progress and challenges of disaster management (i.e. disaster prevention, preparedness, responsiveness, and recovery) of the healthcare system in China; and 3) other jurisdictions that had direct relevance to disaster health management in China (e.g. disaster healthcare management, disaster medical responses, emergency medical care, and emergency healthcare systems). The research exclusion criteria were: 1) studies that only focused on disaster management of specific healthcare systems of other countries, without any implications to China; and 2) studies with no detailed evaluations or descriptions that could assist in informing the identification or description of the progress and challenges of disaster health management in China. The article titles were scanned by two reviewers independently for relevance to the research aims; then the abstracts were appraised for relevance, significance, and utility. Next, the full text format was retrieved for the remaining publications and analyzed in relation to their contributions to two areas: the identification of the main progress and challenges of disaster health management in China and the description of such progress and challenges. Initially, a total of 362 potentially eligible publications were retrieved. Of these, 231 were excluded through the screening of their titles and abstracts. After scanning the full text of the remaining 131 publications, 37 relevant publications were identified as potentially relevant to the current study; they included governmental and institutional reports and journal articles written in English or Chinese. After an analysis of these publications, all 37 were assessed as relevant to the study's aims, and thus were included in the review.
