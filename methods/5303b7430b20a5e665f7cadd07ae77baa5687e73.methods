An overview of the multiple steps used for this analysis is shown in Figure 1 . Briefly, we simulated one training dataset that was used exclusively to determine all of the model parameters for both the LR and SL approaches and perform an initial evaluation. We then evaluated the fitted models with multiple independent simulated datasets (validation datasets) to estimate the variation in the model performance.
