We performed a laboratory-based surveillance study, in which we tested all archived respiratory specimens from hospitalised patients over 1 year (July 2008 to June 2009) with clinically diagnosed ILI meeting the following criteria: age ≥1 year, signs of ILI according to treating physician, duration of ILI symptoms ≤10 days and respiratory specimens sent for influenza testing. Clinicians at all participating hospitals received regular training in WHO protocols for the management and recognition of influenza/ILI. Archived respiratory specimens (nose swab, throat swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal wash, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) were obtained from 12 sites in three countries across SEA (three sites in Indonesia, four sites in Thailand, five sites in Vietnam). Influenza testing capacity was created for a randomised clinical study comparing two dosages of oseltamivir for severe influenza by sites in the South East Asia Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network, as described elsewhere. 13 The specimens used for this study were stored at À80°C until further testing. Where more than one specimen type was available for each patient, they were prioritised in the sequence endotracheal aspirate/bronchoalveolar lavage > nasopharyngeal aspirate > throat swab > nasal swab/ washing. This retrospective study for additional testing on archived specimens after full anonymisation of specimens was approved by the institutional review boards of each site.
