We calculate finite-population reproductive numbers for directly transmitted diseases under three heterogeneity assumptions: heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing rate (assumed to be independent of disease status), R m ðNÞ; heterogeneity in mixing rate when infected, R tm ðNÞ; and heterogeneity in the probability of contracting an infection per contact, R sp ðNÞ. Two other assumptions: heterogeneity in the probability of transmitting an infection per contact, R tp ðNÞ and heterogeneity in mixing rate when susceptible, R sm ðNÞ, are shown in the Appendix. We also talk about the different infinite population reproductive numbers. The basic reproductive number in a homogeneous population, which we refer to as "R null " and the infinite population reproductive numbers with heterogeneity, R 0 . We numerically calculate each of the five finite-population reproductive numbers using two distributions of the underlying heterogeneity. We use gamma distributed and log-normally distributed heterogeneity for R m ðNÞ, R tm ðNÞ, and R sm ðNÞ and beta distributed and logit-normally distributed heterogeneity for R tp ðNÞ and R sp ðNÞ.
