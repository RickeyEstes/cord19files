The mRPE65 model is constructed by adding three palmitic acids onto the sRPE65 model obtained previously (Guo et al., 2006) . This was carried out using the Autodock program and the VMD program. The model allows for a qualitative discussion of the role of these three palmitic acids. Because the palmitic acids are covalently attached to the protein, the bond lengths and angles are fixed. Initially, in the model of sRPE65, the position for the carbonyl carbon atom of a palmitic acid was calculated according to known bond lengths and angles. Then, the Autodock program was used to add the palmitic acids to the sRPE65 protein model and to fix the specific carbon atom at the calculated position. The deviation for this process is about 0.01 Ã… due to finite grid size. Finally, the VMD program was used to adjust the position of the long carbon chains of the palmitic acids to reduce the energetically unfavorable contacts between the palmitic acids and the protein. After obtaining this model of the mRPE65 protein, the interactions between the all-trans retinyl ester and the protein were evaluated and the binding site of mRPE65 for the ester was also modeled. The Autodock program and the Ligplot program are used to study the interactions between the mRPE65 protein and the all-trans retinyl ester. The Autodock program can calculate the binding energy of a ligand when it binds with a protein (Goodsell and Olson, 1990; Morris et al., 1996 Morris et al., , 1998 . Recently this program is used to screen the drug candidates against severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease that has spread mainly throughout eastern Asia (Wei et al., 2006) . Since the docking process in the Autodock program begins with a population of random ligand conformations in random orientations at random translations, it gives different docking results at different times even if all initial conditions are the same. Thus, in each docking study, the average value of twenty trials was used to represent the final docking energy results. Because the final docking energy results are a statistically averaged value, they are only used for a qualitative analysis. It is anticipated that the binding site of mRPE65 for the all-trans retinyl ester is in one of the three hydrophobic domains of mRPE65. Therefore, initially the Autodock program was used to study the docking energies of the all-trans retinyl ester in the three domains of mRPE65 by docking the all-trans retinyl ester near the center of each domain. Because the LEU450MET and TYR368HIS mutations can cause dysfunction of the protein (Kim et al., 2004; Wenzel et al., 2001; Yzer et al., 2003) , these two residues may be related to the binding of the ester. Therefore, the all-trans retinyl ester is also docked near these two residues and the effects of the LEU450MET and TYR368HIS mutations on the binding energy of the ester were examined by using the Autodock program. The mutated protein is obtained from the Jackal software package. To find out the binding site of mRPE65 for all-trans retinyl ester, an iterative method was used to approach the binding site. At first, the Ligplot program was used to analyse the docking results of alltrans retinyl ester near the center of domain two and LEU450 by generating the schematic diagrams for the protein-ester interactions. These diagrams indicate which residues in the mRPE65 protein model interact with the alltrans retinyl ester. After obtaining these diagrams, those common binding residues showing up in the diagrams more than eighteen times among the total twenty trials were selected and the ester was docked near the center of these residues to obtain the docking results for the first iteration. Then the Ligplot program was used again to analyse the docking results of the first iteration and select the binding residues, which appear in the binding site more than 18 times among the total 20 trials. Finally, the ester was docked near the center of these residues and the docking results for the second iteration were obtained. By using the same strategy, the docking results for the third iteration can be obtained. To study the effects of the LEU450MET and TYR368HIS mutations on the ester binding, the Autodock program is used to study the docking energies of the all-trans retinyl ester around the center of the binding site with these two mutations. The VMD program is also used to study the effects of these two mutations on the structure of the binding site.
