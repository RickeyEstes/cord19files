Toxicity assays. LDH assay. To assess membrane disruption and cell death the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the growth medium of HEK293 or VeroB4 cells was measured. The assay (LDH cytotoxicity detection system) was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). As positive control 0.02% Triton X-100 was added to the medium 1-2 h prior performing the assay; empty wells were used with medium only, as negative control. MTT assay. HEK293 or VeroB4 cells were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mg mL −1 tetrazole 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Read-out of MTT assay was carried out as described previously 81 . Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS 50 mM Tris (pH8.0)) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitor (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), benzonase (Merck Millipore), 5 mM DTT (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany), and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) inhibitor cocktail. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were placed in Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 0.05% Tween (Sigma Aldrich) and 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody (diluted in TBS/0.05% Tween) overnight at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were used: Actin Subsequently, blots were washed and probed with the respective horseradish peroxidase-or fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The immuno-reactive bands were visualized either using ECL detection reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or directly by excitation of the respective fluorophore. Determination of the band intensities were performed with BioRad, ChemiDoc MP. In the case of ATG14 oligomerization, lysates were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on Wes™ (ProteinSimple) using the 60-440 kDa cartridges. In general, protein quantification was performed by normalization to the intensity of Actin, which was determined on the same membrane. For quantification of lipidated LC3B, the intensity of LC3B-II was always referred to the signal intensity of the corresponding LC3B-I, following the guidelines for the determination of autophagy 43 . was discarded and cells were carefully rinsed 3x with pre-cooled 1x PBS. 500 µl of pre-cooled 1x PBS was added and cells were scraped off and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C and 300 × g for 5 min The supernatant was removed carefully and cells were resuspended in 100 µl RIPA lysis buffer and incubated for 20 min at 4°C for efficient lysis. Then, SDS loading buffer (4x NuPAGE LDS, ThermoFisher Scientific) was added and samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 min Samples were stored at −20°C and processed as indicated in the respective sections.
