A retrospective descriptive record-based review and analysis of travel-associated diseases was conducted over the period from 1999 to 2013. All travel-associated infectious diseases that were reviewed and included in this study were detected by the routine communicable disease surveillance and the central public health laboratory results during the specified study period. The studied travel-related infections include: dengue, chikungunya, cholera (classical form), lymphatic filariasis, Neisseria meningitides, measles, Schistosoma haematobium, poliomyelitis, leptospirosis and typhoid. The patient should be a resident in Oman who met the case definition for the specific disease. In addition, subjects must have reported traveled to a country endemic with that disease during the investigation, and should have been out of Oman during the full incubation period of the disease. Case definitions were based on the National Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control SOP manual [18] . As malaria surveillance in Oman is a separate program, data about malaria was not included in this study. However, all malaria cases reported during the study period were imported [19] . Included subjects are residents of Oman (Omani and non-Omani), based on the clinical presentation and incubation period of each disease, included subject has to be free from the infection under consideration (manifesting or incubating) before travelling, and has to meet the case definition for the specific disease. The primary dependent variables for the surveillance data were the diagnosed travel-associated diseases. Independent variables include: basic demographics (age, sex and nationality), country of exposure and disease progression (admission and outcome). Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (statistical program for the social science, version 18). Frequency distributions were used to determine the percent of travelassociated infections. This study is free from any ethical constraints as it is a secondary analysis of the data collected routinely for the purpose of public health surveillance and reporting. The data analysis was conducted at the Department of Communicable Diseases. No personal identifying information linking the patients with the results of the study were disclosed with the findings of the study.
