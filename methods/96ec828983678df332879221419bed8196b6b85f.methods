Details on the study design, in-/exclusion criteria and participants were previously published 15, 16 and can be found in the Supplementary Methods. In brief, healthy non-smoking adults, aged 18-50 years, were enrolled in a single-centre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (2015-2016). LAIV was administered prior to experimental inoculation with pneumococcus and pneumococcal colonization rate and density were determined 15, 16 . Participants randomly received either LAIV and intramuscular placebo or intramuscular vaccination paired with nasal placebo. Pneumococcal inoculation was performed as previously described 28, 29 . We excluded individuals who carried pneumococcus based on culture at baseline (i.e. day −4). Sample collection and pneumococcal detection. Nasal wash samples for pneumococcal detection were collected on days 2, 7, 9 and 29. Additional nasal washes were performed at days 14 and 22 in volunteers who were carriage positive at day 2, 7 and/or 9. Next, nasal washes were processed as described previously 28, 29 . As per the study protocol, pneumococcal detection was performed using (1) conventional culture [28] [29] [30] [31] and (2) qPCR targeting the pneumococcal lytA gene 32 . Nasal lining fluid samples (Nasosorption™, Hunt Developments) for Luminex analysis were collected and stored at −80°C as previously described 33 . Sample selection and DNA isolation microbiota analyses. We selected baseline (day −4) and day 2, 7 and 29 nasal wash samples (four time points; Fig. 1 ) for microbiota analyses. Bacterial DNA was isolated from 200 µL resuspended nasal wash pellet (see Supplementary Methods) by bead beating in phenol 32 and quantified using a qPCR with primers directed at the 16S-rRNA gene 21, 34 . DNA was subsequently eluted in one aliquot of 50 μL elution buffer and stored at −20°C until further analysis. 16S-rRNA sequencing. Amplicon libraries of the 16S-rRNA gene (V4 region) were generated, and sequencing was executed as previously described 7 . Amplicon pools were paired-end sequenced in seven runs using an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Bioinformatic processing included trimming, error correction, assembly and 97%-identity binning of reads into Fig. 4 Associations between cytokine levels and nasal microbiota at baseline. Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (a) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) (b), we assessed the links between cytokine levels day 0 and baseline nasal microbiota. It is assumed that the dependent variables (log 10 + 1-transformed relative abundance operational taxonomic units [OTUs] ) respond in a unimodal or linear fashion to the predictor variables (log 2 -transformed cytokine levels) for CCA and dbRDA, respectively. We simultaneously plotted the samples (data points, n = 71), significant (p < 0.05) predictor variables (cytokines; arrows) and the OTUs that were most strongly associated with the first two axes (n = 10 for each axis, excluding overlapping OTUs). Samples were coloured according to carriage 3 outcome (red, high-dense carriers, n = 36; blue, non-carriers, n = 18 and orange, lowdense carriers, n = 17), ellipses denote the standard deviation of the samples in each group. Note that carriage 3 outcome was not accounted for when simultaneously modelling cytokine/microbiota data, yet still are clearly discriminated, suggesting that baseline microbiota and cytokine levels at day 0 (following live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and prior to pneumococcal challenge) are related to pneumococcal receptiveness. Data separation by carriage 3 outcome was higher when ordination was based on both microbiota and cytokine data (dbRDA and CCA; standardized absolute β-coefficient 0.43 and 0.32, respectively) compared to microbiota alone (non-metric multidimensional scaling [NMDS]; 0.22; Fig. 2 ). This was also true when coefficients were split between Xor Y-coordinates. An extensive description on our method to compare data separation by carriage 3 Table 9 ). Luminex analysis of nasal lining fluid. Cytokines were eluted from stored Nasosorption filters using 100 µL of assay buffer (Thermo Fisher). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g to clear them prior to acquisition. Samples were acquired using a 30-plex magnetic human Luminex Cytokine Kit (Thermo Fisher) and analysed on a LX200 (Bio-Rad) with xPonent3.1 software (Luminex Corp) following the manufacturer's instructions. A representative subset of 12 cytokines was selected for further analyses (based on co-clustering analyses and literature 44 ). Samples were analysed in duplicates and samples with a coefficient of variation >25% were excluded. Variable definitions. In the manuscript describing the initial results of the LAIV-EHPC project, focussing on the effect of LAIV on pneumococcal carriage, results based on both pneumococcal detection methods (i.e. conventional culture and molecular) were presented, underscoring the importance of the increased sensitivity of molecular techniques 15, 16 . For this manuscript, we therefore decided to test two carriage outcome variables on the basis of nasal washes from days 2, 7 and 9: (1) carriage 2 outcome (based on pneumococcal detection using conventional culture only), carriers, with a culture-positive sample at any point and non-carriers, who were culture-negative at all times; and (2) carriage 3 outcome (combination of pneumococcal detection using both conventional culture and molecular techniques), coded as high-dense carriers (culture-positive at any point), low-dense carriers (qPCR-positive and culture-negative) and non-carriers (qPCR-and culture-negative at every point). Initial explorative analyses demonstrated higher explanatory power of carriage 3 outcome, that is, the variable incorporating qPCR results. We therefore decided to use this outcome variable throughout the rest of the manuscript instead of carriage 2 outcome. Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed in the R version 3.3.0 within R studio version 0.99.902. We provided a detailed schematic on the research questions/associations explored and a data analysis flow chart depicting an overview of the methods used ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Detailed information on our statistical analysis can be found in the Supplementary Methods. In short, using PERMANOVA tests, we studied the associations between carriage outcome and the overall microbiota composition at baseline and each subsequent time point. In conjunction, we assessed the association between microbiota composition and month (i.e. seasonal effects), the presence of virus(es) at baseline and the interaction between LAIV or presence of viruses at baseline and carriage outcome. The relationships between microbiota composition and carriage outcome were visualized using NMDS plots. Differentially abundant OTUs at baseline associated with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome were detected using several statistical techniques, including (1) ANCOM 45 and (2) metagenomeSeq 46 . Differences in α-diversity according to carriage 3 outcome were tested using (1) Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests and (2) linear mixed-effects models with carriage outcome, time point and the interaction between carriage outcome and time points as fixed effects and subject as random effect. We used the multcomp package to determine significant differences within specific contrasts. To assess the microbiota dynamics related to carriage 3 outcome over time, we performed an unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The optimal number of clusters and biomarkers for each cluster were determined as previously described 7 . Comparisons of cytokine levels according to carriage 3 outcome was performed using a linear model, including vaccine, carriage outcome and the interaction between vaccine and carriage outcome. We simultaneously assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota and day 0 cytokine levels using CCA and dbRDA. Reporting summary.
