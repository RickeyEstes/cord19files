We searched literature in PubMed and Google Scholar on classification methods for virus metagenomics data, using the terms "virus metagenomics" and "viral metagenomics." The results were limited to publications between January 2010 and January 2017. We assessed the workflows with regard to technical characteristics: algorithms used, reference databases, and search strategy used; their user-friendliness: whether a graphical user interface is provided, whether results are visualized, approximate runtime, accepted data types, the type of computer that was used to test the software and the operating system, availability and licensing, and provision of a user manual. In addition, we extracted information that supports the validity of the workflow: tests by the developers, wet-lab experimental work and computational benchmarks, benchmark tests by other groups, whether and when the software had been updated as of 19 July 2017 and the number of citations in Google Scholar as of 28 March 2017 (Data Sheet 1; https://compare.cbs.dtu.dk/ inventory#pipeline). We listed only benchmark results from in silico tests using simulated viral sequence reads, and only sensitivity, specificity and precision, because these were most often reported (Data Sheet 2). Sensitivity is defined as reads correctly annotated as viral-on the taxonomic level chosen in that benchmark-by the pipeline as a fraction of the total number of simulated viral reads (true positives / (true positives + false negatives)). Specificity as reads correctly annotated as non-viral by the pipeline as a fraction of the total number of simulated nonviral reads (true negatives / (true negatives + false positives)). And precision as the reads correctly annotated as viral by the pipeline as a fraction of all reads annotated as viral (true positives / (true positives + false positives)). Different publications have used different taxonomic levels for classification, from kingdom to species. We used all benchmark scores for our analyses (details are in Data Sheet 2). Correlations between performance (sensitivity, specificity, precision and runtime) and methodical factors (different analysis steps, search algorithms and reference databases) were calculated and visualized with R v3.3.2 (https://www.r-project.org/), using RStudio v1.0.136 (https://www.rstudio.com). Next, based on our inventory, we grouped workflows by compiling two decision trees to help readers select a workflow applicable to their research. We defined "time-restrained diagnostics" as being able to detect viruses and classify to genus or species in under 5 h per sample. "Surveillance and outbreak tracing" refers to the ability of more specific identification to the subspecies-level (e.g., genotype). "Discovery" refers to the ability to detect remote homologs by using a reference database that covers a wide range of viral taxa combined with a sensitive search algorithm, i.e., amino acid (protein) alignment or composition search. For "biodiversity studies" we qualified all workflows that can classify different viruses (i.e., are not focused on a single species
