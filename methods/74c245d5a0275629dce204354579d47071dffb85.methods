We retrieved the data related to laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from September 23, 2012 until May 17, 2019 for this retrospective analysis from the disease outbreak news in the WHO website:(http://www.who. int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/). The WHO received all the case reports (describing details case-by-case) of MERS-CoV in a narrative format on behalf of the national-international health regulation focal point of 27 countries of the world. Data will be updated periodically on the mortality and the incidence of the MERS cases. We have retrieved the main epidemiologic information of each MERS patient. To calculate SEYLL(without discounting or ageweighting), we categorized the dataset related to MERS cases into 3-year age groups based on each person's age at the time of death. Then, the age at the time of death for each individual in the mentioned age groups were subtracted from the relevant reference age using the following equation: where Ni m (Ni f ) represents the number of male (female) deaths in the age group i, multiplied by the respective standard life expectancy, Li m (Li f ) based on the 2000 Coale-Demeny life table with life expectancy of 80 years for men and 82.5 years for women [15] .. The SEYLL for each individual were then added together to estimate the total SEYLL for all MERS patients who died in a particular year. Finally, we calculated the SEYLL for all age-groups and both genders by cause of mortality and reported these as percentages. All the statistical analysis were conducted using the SPSS, version 21 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). Quantitative and qualitative measures were expressed by mean Â± S.D. and absolute frequencies and percentages, respectively. Chi-square test was used to determine the frequency distributions between probable risk factors and the final outcome (dead/alive) of the laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Table 1 . Any p-value given was two-sided and was considered statistically significant at 0.05.
