We conducted a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey that addressed MERS and its diagnosis and prevention among medical students in May 2015. The study selected individuals to represent the 9000 medical students in Wannan medical college. A multi-stage, random cluster sampling design was used to designate study subjects. All students were divided into grades. Grades 3 and 4 were selected. Each of the above randomly selected grades was divided into multiple majors. The majors of nursing, clinical, management, and public health were randomly selected. Then, one to two classes from these majors were randomly selected to represent the population. Finally, 223 students were selected and 214 responded. The response rate was 95.6%. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wannan Medical College and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. A written form of consent was obtained from all participants.
