Study Area. Taiwan (23.778°N, 120.930°E) is an island country at the border of tropical and subtropical climate zones. Due to its geographic proximity to dengue endemic countries in Southeast Asia ( Fig. 2A) , dengue outbreaks in Taiwan are triggered by imported index cases from endemic regions. Large outbreaks have occurred in the tropical monsoon regions of southern Taiwan, particularly in the cities of Tainan (TN) and Kaohsiung (KH). These two large tropical cities feature high temperatures and high humidity, high population density, and highly urbanized landscapes, all of which provide appropriate breeding habitats for Aedes aegypti, the main vector mosquitoes of dengue virus. Thus, as dengue outbreaks occur frequently in late summer and wane in winter, the two cities form natural settings for the repetitive observation of dengue invasion and epidemic propagation. Dengue data. Dengue fever is listed as a notifiable infectious disease in Taiwan. This means that physicians are mandated to report suspected cases in which the patient lives in or has a history of travel to a dengue-affected area and has corresponding symptoms, including fever, rash, eye pain, leukopenia, etc. The reported cases are then confirmed by standard laboratory tests, including real-time PCR, ELISA, and antigen detection 28 . These surveillance data are recorded and provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Welfare 29 . The dengue database starts in 1998, when the electronic reporting system was implemented, and we include all records since 1998-01-01. Individual-level information, including date of disease onset and X-Y coordinates of residence, is also provided. Each pair of residence coordinates is listed as the center of a basic statistical area, which is the smallest geographic unit for socioeconomic surveying in Taiwan. There was a total of 78,749 confirmed dengue cases (4.4% of them were imported cases) in Taiwan from 1998 to 2017, 92.5% of which occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities. is estimated first. The sum of these probabilities is, by definition, the expected number of infectees caused by individual j, i.e., the individual reproductive number. The transmission probability itself is estimated based on solely temporal relationships (non-adjusted) or in combination with spatial relationships (spatially adjusted). In the non-adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the temporal weight g(a) determined by the generation interval between infector j and its infectees. Cases in the same temporal cohort (i.e., with the same onset day, a 1 = a 2 = a 3 ) share the same transmission probability from previous infectors. They also share the same individual reproductive number since their relationship to subsequent cases is again identical. For the spatially adjusted method, p ·j is proportional to the spatial weights f(d), modulated by the distance between the infector and the infectees in space. Therefore, individual reproductive numbers of cases in the same cohort can be distinguished. The five most severe epidemics selected by the outbreak size were included in this study. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org). Figure 2B shows the historical records of dengue epidemics in Taiwan since 1998; the five most severe outbreaks were included in this study. Among the five outbreaks, two occurred in Tainan (2007TN, 2015TN) , and three occurred in Kaohsiung (2002KH, 2014KH, 2015KH). The sizes of the outbreaks ranged from 22,784 cases in 2015TN to 1,183 cases in 2011KH. Generally, dengue outbreaks start in June, reach their peak around September, and end near the end of the year or early the next January. In this study, we analyzed the largest outbreak, 2015TN, to demonstrating our method, while detailed results for the other four epidemics are presented in our supplementary results. Of the 22,784 total infections in 2015TN, only 19 cases (<0.1%) were imported from foreign countries, suggesting that indigenous transmission was well established. In contrast with Kaohsiung city, very few outbreaks occurred in Taiwan before 2015. Quantifying the temporal transmission dynamics. The renewal equation specifies the relationship between generations of incident cases, as shown in Eq. (1). It can be applied to estimate time-varying effective reproductive numbers due to its simplicity and generality regarding the temporal transmission dynamics 11, 13, 30 . x a x a 0 R t represents the population-level time-varying effective reproductive number at time t. b x denotes the number of incident cases at time x, and − b x a in the denominator denotes the number of potential infectors generated at a days (a ≥ 0) prior to time x. The hat notations stand for observed case numbers. g(a) stands for the distribution of the generation interval, which is used as a weighting function for representing transmission potential at time interval a. It can be specified by the nature of disease transmission process. Importantly, the generation interval, also known as generation time, is the period between the infection of an infector and the infection of its infectees. It is a fundamental parameter reflecting the natural history of pathogens. Since the generation interval may vary between individuals, it can be described by a probability distribution, g(a), where a is a time interval. Therefore, the function can be regarded as the transmission weight between a pair of cases whose observed generation interval equals a (Fig. 1B) . The representation of transmission weight (also referred to as transmission likelihood 15 ) as g(a) is the basic component of the process of estimating effective reproductive numbers in the renewal equation and the following proposed method. The generation interval of dengue, in particular, is composed if four periods: host incubation, vector incubation, host infectious period and vector infectious period 31 . Nonetheless, showing compatibility with empirical data and mathematical convenience, gamma distributions are frequently used to model the generation interval of dengue collectively 32 . In this study, we used a gamma distribution with mean = 20 days and standard deviation = 9 days in our analysis, in accordance with a previous study 25 . individual reproductive number. In order to capture spatial variations among individuals, we adopted another method developed by Wallinga and Teunis 15 to estimate individual reproductive numbers (R j ). We refer to this method as the non-adjusted method (i.e., non-adjusted for spatial effect). The transmission probability between pair of cases can be described mathematically as where p ij is the probability that case j infects case i. Note that we use superscripts to index time-invariant, individual (or pairwise) attributes (e.g., R j , p ij ) and subscripts for time-varying attributes (e.g., R t ). g(·) is the temporal weighting function, representing generation interval. Given the onset time interval = − >ˆt ij is the transmission weight of the case pair (i, j). The pairwise transmission weight is then normalized by all received transmission weights of case i (from all potential infectors k ≠ i) to produce consistent estimation of transmission probability. The resulting p ij is interpreted as the probability of individual i being infected by individual j. Therefore, R j as the average number of secondary cases caused by individual j is the sum of all p ij involving j as the infector, as shown in Fig. 1A and Eq. (3). Spatially adjusted reproductive number. In this study, we extend a previous method with a spatial weighting function, f d ( ) ij , in order to account for the effect of spatial variation on dengue infections. We refer to this extended method as the (spatially) adjusted method. The transmission probability for case pair (i, j) becomes where d ij is the distance between the pair (i, j) and f is a function relating transmission weight to the distance between cases. The specifications of the temporal difference t ij and g remain the same as in the previous method. Likewise, the spatially adjusted individual reproductive number R j sp is the sum of those p ij sp involving j as the infector (Eq. 5).  The spatial weighting function is also called the transmission kernel and is a monotonically decaying function with respect to distance, reflecting neighborhood transmission 32 . Thus, unlike the generation interval, which is typically marked with a temporally lagged effect because of the latency period of infectiousness, the spatial weighting function decreases monotonically as distance increases, which means people would be easily get infections if they live near each other. It reflects people in the nearby neighborhood may share common environmental sources of dengue infection. There are several kinds of spatial kernels used in the literature, including exponential decay 25 and power-law decay 33 . In the context of dengue transmission, we adopted an exponential decaying kernel with mean = 125 m 27 . This approach accounts for both temporal and spatial relationships when estimating individual-level reproductive numbers. Apart from the component of the generation interval inherited from the previous method, the distance-decayed spatial weighting function captures the spatial risk of dengue infection. To calculate the population-level effective reproductive number from individual estimates, the R j values can be further aggregated to form the Adjusted R t given a specified time step τ 13 :  Quantifying the preconditions of spreaders. To explore the phenomenon of spatial expansion, two types of spreaders are of interest: early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are defined as those cases that trigger a new cluster (by introducing the disease into an unaffected area). There are usually few or no cases of the disease, and the cluster tendency is low until several early spreaders emerge. Succeeding spreaders are defined as those cases that were infected by early cases nearby. Although there is a clear distinction between the two spreaders in theory, most individuals lie on a spectrum between these two extremes. We have therefore quantified this property according to the clustering tendency at the location and time immediately before the emergence of that spreader. In other words, clustering tendency is used as the measure for the precondition of a dengue case, and the median clustering tendency is used as the cutoff to classify all dengue cases. If the precondition clustering tendency is higher than the median, the case is categorized as a succeeding spreader; otherwise, it is characterized as an early spreader. We used kernel density estimation (KDE) to quantify spatial clustering tendency in order to (1) determine the preconditions of a specific spreader and (2) compare the distributions of spatially adjusted effective reproductive numbers and case clustering patterns. The clustering tendency at the location of case j is defined as 34 where h is called the kernel bandwidth or smoothing parameter (i.e., the parameter controlling the extent of smoothness), d ij denotes the distance between case i and the locality of case j, and K(·) is a spatial smoothing function characterizing the contribution of each individual over the relative distance d h / ij .
