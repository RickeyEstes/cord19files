Degree and weight distributions of ITN. Highway buses and high-speed trains are the major means of transportation in China. After constructing ITN (see Fig. 4 ) based on high-speed trains and highways data, the number of links k i is recorded for each node and the degree distribution P(k) is obtained (Fig. S1(a) For the weights in Eq. (2), we record the actual populations in each node and reduce them to N i in units of 5000 and the distances r ij between pairs of nodes in km according to the China official website. The frequency of high-speed trains S ij is obtained based on the routes and schedules of all high-speed trains. For each route that originates from a city A and terminates at a city B, we record the cities, say Table S1 in SI).
