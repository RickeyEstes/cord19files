Real CPI data collection. Using the PEARL application, we collected real CPI data amongst 174 undergraduates for 28 days (between October 31 and November 27, 2011) in a typical college in southern China (South China Agricultural University, or SCAU). To mitigate potential bias rooted at geographical locations, this data-gathering program was also carried out at a college in northern China (University of Science and Technology of Beijing, or USTB) to collect real CPI data from 87 undergraduates for 28 days (between October 24 and November 20, 2011). On the mobile phone of each volunteer, a PEARL client was installed to scan nearby PEARL clients via Bluetooth technique every 5 minutes. The detected Bluetooth addresses and scan time were recorded. Thus, in every 5 minutes, the CPI data was obtained among the individuals, from which a basic network was reconstructed with every node representing an individual, and every edge representing a 5-minute CPI among two individuals. The summation of all 288 (24 × 60/5 = 288) basic networks in a certain day formed a daily aggregation of CPI networks, where edge weights denote the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day. The PEARL CPI data sets are accessible via http://bioinfo.ict.ac.cn/pearl/. Real influenza records were also collected from the SCAU undergraduate volunteers who participated in the PEARL program. In particular, all the volunteers were required to report their health condition from September 25 to October 21, 2011. Due to the memory loss, only 76 out of the total 174 volunteers reported this information. Among these volunteers, 13 were infected by influenza, but only 8 could remember the exact dates. Thus on a certain day, the number of volunteers who reported to be infected, denoted as #infected, can be calculated as Here, recall ratio denotes the ratio of the infected volunteers who can recall the exact dates of infection. As mentioned above, recall ratio can be estimated as 8/13. Thus, the infected ratio was estimated as = × infected ratio infected # 76 13 8 (Supplementary Table S1 ). All data collection protocols were approved by Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Written informed consents were obtained from all participating volunteers. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Simulating disease spread using SEIR model. The spreading process of respiratory infectious diseases was simulated using SEIR model 6 . SEIR model describes disease transmission processes where individuals transit step by step among four possible disease states, namely, susceptible (S), exposed/latent (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R). At every step of epidemic simulation, every exposed individual becomes infectious with probability δ, while every infectious one causes each susceptible neighbor in the contact network (having interaction with the infectious one at that step) to be exposed with probability β, and infectious ones recover with probability γ. The probabilities express how likely an individual changes its states at a step, and thus highly depend on how long a step takes (called unit time t). These probabilities were calculated as below. Here, the parameters β 0 , δ 0 , and γ 0 denote respective probabilities within time t 0 . [1, 4] days, and γ − 0 1 ranges over [3, 5] days; In ref. 17, δ − 0 1 ranges over [1, 2] days, and γ − 0 1 ranges over [1.5, 4] days; In ref. 4, β 0 = 1.5 × 10 −4 sec −1 ; In ref. 18 , β 0 was set as 1.5 × 10 −4 sec −1 or 1.5 × 10 −4 sec −1 ; In ref. 19 , β 0 was set as 2.8 × 10 −4 sec −1 or 6.9 × 10 −4 sec −1 . Based on these studies, we set the parameter ranges as β 0 in [0.1, 7.0] × 10 −4 sec −1 , δ − 0 1 in [1, 4] days, and γ − 0 1 in [1.5, 5] days in this study. The real CPI networks are usually constructed at a specific time resolution, as CPIs among individuals are dynamic. To simulate disease spread on dynamic CPI networks, the unit time of simulation was set according to time resolution. For example, the SCAU networks were constructed through Bluetooth scan every 5 minutes; thus, the unit time was set as 5 minutes accordingly for epidemic simulation. The unit time for other CPI networks used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2 . Our simulation starts with one of the individuals (called index individual) being exposed and the others being susceptible, and stops when no individuals are exposed or infectious. To remove the potential biases in index selection and state transition, a total of 10,000 simulations were performed with index individuals selected at random. We considered the following four statistics of the simulation results: (1) The total infected percentage describes the percentage of individuals infected during the whole spreading process; (2) R 0 , also known as the basic reproductive number, represents the number of individuals infected directly by the index individual 6 . Epidemic outbreak occurs only when R 0 > 1 5 . In this study, R 0 is approximated as the average number of individuals infected by index individuals that are selected at random; (3) the peak epidemic time denotes when the number of infected individuals reaches its maximum value; and (4) the epidemic duration describes the duration of the disease spread. Evaluating disease control strategies. At present, the popular approaches to control the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases are targeted quarantine/vaccination, i.e., selecting a collection of individuals for quarantine or vaccination. The percentage of individuals selected is denoted as quarantine/vaccination coverage. A variety of network-based selection strategies have been proposed according to individual's characteristics calculated based on CPI networks, including degree (contact number), strength, betweenness, clustering coefficient (CC), and the primary eigenvector 4 . In this study, the disease control strategies were simulated by removing the selected individuals from the CPI network followed by running the SEIR models. We evaluated the following network-based strategies for disease control, including degree strategy, strength strategy, CC strategy, betweenness centrality strategy, and eigenvector centrality strategy (Supplementary Methods). Besides these network-based strategies, class cancelation is also commonly applied as a disease control strategy in boarding schools 14 . During class cancelation period in boarding schools, all students are ordered to stay within the campus, with all classes cancelled, thus showing a CPI pattern nearly identical to that at weekends. In our study, class cancelation was simulated by simply replacing the CPI networks at weekdays with the CPI networks at weekends.
