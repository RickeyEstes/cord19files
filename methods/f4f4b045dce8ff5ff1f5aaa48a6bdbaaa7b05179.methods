The mathematical model of epidemic propagation is the following (see Figure 1 ):  we use a compartmental model 17, 18 to describe the evolution of an individual through several possible conditions such as susceptible (compartment label -S‖), latent, i.e. infected but not yet infective (label -L‖), infective in the lung tropism and highly symptomatic (label -I‖), low symptomatic, infective in the gut tropism (-A‖); the -I‖ infected then go to -Detected‖ (D) stage while the -A‖ infected go to -Removed /recovered‖ stage (label -R‖). This is an adaptation of existing models and especially the SLIAR model [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .  We add to the model the possibility for an environmental, local, propagation route (that accounts for soiled water, etc.). This option is represented by the -E‖ label. With some probability, the contact between infected environmental elements and a susceptible individual gives rise to new infections.
