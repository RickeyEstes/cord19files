We collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital with respiratory tract infections during the time period November 13, 2006 to March 16, 2007 Hospital is the regional hospital for Mid-Norway covering a population of 640 000. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. The children were classified in two main diagnosis categories: lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other diagnoses not mentioned in the statistics included tonsillitis, gastroenteritis and fever. LRTI was diagnosed in the presence of dyspnea, signs of lower airway obstruction (wheezing, retractions) and/or a positive radiogram (infiltrates, atelectasis, air trapping). URTI was diagnosed when rhinitis, pharyngitis and/or otitis media was present in the absence of signs of LRTI. Using PCR the nasopharyngeal aspirations were examined for adenovirus, HBoV, coronavirus (OC43, 229E and NL63), enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus type 1-3, RS-virus, rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. All PCRs were real-time assays based on TaqMan probes. The target for the HBoV-PCR was the NP-1-gene. Selections of primers and probe were based the sequences published by Allander et al. (2005) . (Forward primer: CCA CGT GAC GAA GAT GAG CTC, reverse primer TAG GTG GCT GAT TGG GTG TTC, probe CCG AGC CTC TCT CCC CAC TGT GTC G, 5 6-FAM, 3 TAMRA.) The amount of virus in each sample was recorded semiquantitatively based on the C t -value (cycle threshold value) and grouped in three categories (high, medium and low viral load). The break points were set to C t 28 and C t 35. HBoV was recorded as the dominating virus in a sample when the C t -value was at least three cycles lower than the C t -value for any other virus. In addition all samples were collected on ordinary virus transport media without antibiotics and cultured for viruses and bacteria with standard methods.
