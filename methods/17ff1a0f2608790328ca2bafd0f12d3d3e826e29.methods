The Emergency Department has an ongoing airway registry that captured prospectively patient demographics, diagnosis, indications for tracheal intubation, the details of the physician attempting intubation, number of attempts, method of intubation, success rates and complications. Data is collected using a study form and is completed by the intubating physician immediately after the procedure. This project had the approval of the hospital's ethics committee. For the purpose of this study, the data was divided into three periods: The data is analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software for Windows (version 10.1; SPSS Inc). The Pearson 2 test is used to determine statistically significant differences among categorical data with the Fisher's exact test being used if one or more cells had a value of less than 30. Any comparison of outcome measures with a confidence interval that does not cross one (1.0) indicates that the difference is statistically significant.
