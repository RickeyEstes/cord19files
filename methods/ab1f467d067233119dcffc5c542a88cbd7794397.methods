Collaborative Molecular Modeling Environment (C-ME) is a collaboratory system developed for the purpose of supporting research projects involving the molecular systems biology and structural proteomics of the SARS Corona virus as well as a cancer diagnostic research project. These projects require a simple but secure process to store all relevant data in a variety of formats in a single location that are then available either through the C-ME client or through a web interface for those collaborators who do not have the C-ME client. The C-ME backend architecture enables these features and is built on Windows Server 2003, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS 2007). C-ME includes a public domain client application for the Windows XP and Vista operating systems that can be downloaded from http://c-me.scripps.edu. C-ME is built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software as an open-ended content management and sharing system. The primary advantage for using COTS components to build C-ME is that it reduces overall system development costs and requires less development time-only the components required to perform a specific function need to be developed. Developing a custom system from scratch could involve creating basic functionality, retrieving data from a database, or rendering or moving a threedimensional image on the screen, all of which might already be available commercially. C-ME uses COTS components for most of its back-end functions. Windows Server 2003, SQL Server 2005 and MOSS 2007 provide the central authentication, database, and Web infrastructure that enable an application like C-ME to be developed quickly. Windows Server 2003 provides the Active Directory authentication functionality. Users can be added and removed from the directory and permissions assigned according to project or affiliation. SQL Server 2005 is the relational database management system that provides the data storage, indexing, and retrieval functionality for all data stored on MOSS 2007. Thus, any information exposed by C-ME is actually stored in a SQL Server 2005 database and made available through MOSS 2007 either directly using a browser or through C-ME, using Web services to access the data. MOSS 2007 is the portal system that organizes and makes available the data that is used by C-ME including the root project image, Protein Data Bank (PDB) coordinate files, and 2-D images, as well as all annotations. The user can access this information with C-ME which uses Web services to read and write data to and from the MOSS 2007 server. The user also has the option to access that data through a standard Web browser ( Figure 2 ).
