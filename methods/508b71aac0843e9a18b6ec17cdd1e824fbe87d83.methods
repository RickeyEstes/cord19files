The trial was conducted between October 1987 and March 1988 in Munich, West Germany. A total of 6 0 men and women, aged 20-50 years, volunteered to take part. At the end of the trial 50 cases could be evaluated (dropout rate due to non-compliance 16%). Exclusion criteria were clinically overt circulatory diseases, history of respiratory diseases, or other physical treatment during the preceding half-year and during the observation period. All important variables were distributed comparably between the control and treatment groups. Thus none of the characteristics listed in table 1 were significantly different in the two groups. All participants of group 1 (n = 25) were given hydrotherapy at least five times per week for six months, while individuals from group 2 (n=25) abstained from this (or any comparable) treatment. In the first week, hydrotherapy consisted of showering arms and legs for 3 0 seconds with cold (18-4OOC) water after the whole body had been showered with warm (36-4OOC) water for five minutes. In the second week, a cold (18-24OC) whole-body shower was introduced following the warm shower (durations as before). Thereafter the treatment comprised five seconds whole body shower at 36-40OC. The latter time span was slowly (within two to three weeks) enlarged to one to two minutes. This sequence was repeated twice each session. A cold (12-18OC) shower always concluded the therapy (fig 1) . After thorough instruction by one of the authors, the volunteers were left to their own devices to carry out the procedure. No treatments were applied in the presence of, or shortly (one week) after a common cold; in this event each participant was treated symptomatically according to histher own choice. Common colds were diagnosed clinically. When typical (Gwaltney, 1976) catarrhic symptoms (rhinitis with nasal discharge or obstruction, sneezing, sore throat or cough) were felt, the affected volunteer called one of the authors who confirmed the diagnosis and took a blood sample. Thus blood counts, plasma viscosity, serum electrophoresis and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were quantified. These measurements were repeated later (after more than two weeks) in the subjects who remained completely free of common colds or other symptoms. Complications of common colds such as sinusitis, bronchitis, etc, were also confirmed by one of the authors and recorded in a diary. Each patient documented the duration of symptoms in a diary. The end of a common cold was defined as subjective cessation of catarrhic symptoms. The strength of each cold was judged subjectively, dividing it into three possible grades (weak=l, medium=2, strong=3). Each hydrotherapy session was entered into the diary for compliance control. The participants were asked to give additional information on variables such as drinking and smoking habits as well as level of 'stress' felt subjectively (table 1) . Outside temperatures were obtained from the local weather station. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-squared test. The control group was thus compared to the treatment group. The null-hypothesis was rejected when p was less than 0.05.
