The NCBI non-redundant (nr) and transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) databases were downloaded on August 31, 2018. Narnaviral sequences were identified in these databases using, tblastn (version 2.8.0) (Camacho et al. 2009 ), with the RdRp protein sequence of ScNV-20S and the updated RdRp sequence of ONLV1 (completed in this study) as queries. In total, 81 sequences were found by combined searches using these queries (46 in the nr database and 35 in the TSA database). Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based searches were carried out using hhsearch (Finn et al. 2011 ), based on an alignment of RdRps from rORF-containing narnaviruses, leading to the identification of a further 43 TSA database sequences. Phylogenetic trees were generated with MrBayes (version 3.2.7) (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) , using a mixed substitution model with sampling across fixed amino acid rate matrices (aamodelpr = mixed) and 5,000,000 generations. All other parameters were set as defaults.

A codon-based multiple sequence alignment of RdRp ORFs was produced by aligning the RdRp amino acid sequences with MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) (Edgar 2004) and then backtranslating to a nucleotide sequence alignment using the tranalign program in the EMBOSS suite (version 6.6.0.0) (Rice et al. 2000) . The alignment was then mapped to ONLV2 sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the ONLV2 sequence. Synonymous site variation was assessed using synplot2 (Firth 2014) , with a window size of 15 codons. Comparison of amino acid sequences was performed using plotcon from the EMBOSS suite (version 6.6.0.0) (Rice et al. 2000) with a BLOSUM62 substitution matrix and a window size of 15 amino acids. When analysing synonymous site usage in the rORF, the reverse complement of the RdRp alignment was used, and aligned nucleotides on the reverse strand were converted to the corresponding protein sequences using AMAS (Borowiec 2016) . Principal component analysis (PCA) of codon usage across species was performed using relative codon abundances (i.e. normalized by the abundances of the associated amino acids). The principal components were calculated using the RefSeq sequences of cellular organisms, and narnaviral codon abundances were projected onto the resulting principal component space. Figure 2 , the longest 5′-proximal ORF in the negative-strand R0 frame is shown in the bars to the right. Five highly similar TSA sequences for Pyropia haitanensis and six highly similar sequences for Phytophthora infestans RNA virus 4 (both indicated with asterisks) are collapsed to single taxa. Accession numbers are for the nucleotide sequences from which the corresponding protein sequences were derived.
