Estimating the incubation period distribution. The incubation period of a disease is the duration of time between exposure to the pathogen and symptom onset 6 . This characteristic is imperfectly observed in most settings 7, 8 . We obtained previously published incubation period observations on 145 cases of Ebola in Guinea 9 , 170 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in South Korea 10 and 362 cases of smallpox [11] [12] [13] . We fit parametric distributions to the observed incubation period data using maximum likelihood techniques (see Supplemental Text). We ran sensitivity analyses to evaluate the influence of several outlying observations in the Ebola dataset. A model for active monitoring outcomes. We developed a probabilistic model that uses varying probabilities to alter the incubation period, thus estimating whether active monitoring would identify an individual infected with the pathogen of interest. Figure 1 presents the model schema, which involves a monitored individual having one of four outcomes: 1. no symptoms warranting clinical follow-up, 2. no symptomatic infection with the disease of interest, but occurrence of symptoms that necessitate ruling out of the disease of interest, 3. symptomatic infection with the disease of interest occurring during the individual's period of active monitoring, and 4. symptomatic infection with the disease of interest occurring outside the individual's period of active monitoring. Scenario 4 represents the highest risk of secondary transmission and may also reduce the chance of a positive clinical outcome for the sick individual. We use a population-level probabilistic model with five key parameters. For a given set of parameters, the model calculates the expected number of individuals in a particular population or cohort of a fixed size that experience each of the four outcomes listed above. Each outcome has a specific cost and model-based probability associated with it (see Supplement and Fig. 1 for details) . These calculations are repeated for a set of stochastic samples of possible parameter values (e.g. samples from the posterior distribution of incubation period parameters) to Since limited data prevent us from formally estimating variance, we created conservative (i.e. maximally wide) intervals for possible costs by using the endpoints of the plausible cost ranges. Additionally, the model determines the uncertainty associated with these estimates due to not having precise incubation period observations and having an unknown time between exposure and the beginning of monitoring for a particular individual (see Supplemental Text). For these pathogens, we assume that infectiousness coincides with the onset of symptoms [14] [15] [16] . Our model estimates the risks and costs associated with active monitoring programs for a range of active monitoring durations. To estimate the cost per person-day of monitoring, we used data on the number of individuals actively monitored by DOHMH and costs associated with the DOHMH Ebola response. Additionally, for the purposes of hypothetical cost calculations, we assumed that an individual who becomes symptomatic with the disease of interest while under active monitoring gives rise to no secondary infections, while an individual who develops symptoms after his/her active monitoring period ends could give rise to as many as 4 new Ebola infections (an upper estimate based on prior research 17, 18 ). Stratifying by exposure risk. Classifying individuals based on prior exposure risks enables targeted strategies in a range of public health response settings, including active monitoring. For example, in response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, CDC issued recommendations on risk stratification of individuals for a potential Ebola virus exposure ("high risk", "some risk", "low (but not zero) risk", "no identifiable risk") and for how long and how intensively individuals in each of these categories should be monitored 19 . DOHMH's active monitoring program, described previously 20 , was implemented consistent with CDC recommendations. However, creating, evaluating, and modifying such classifications in practice is a difficult task and requires situational awareness and data that would vary depending on the pathogen and outbreak setting. For the CDC Ebola risk strata, we estimated probabilities of a monitored individual developing Ebola. These estimates were based on extrapolated numbers of actively monitored individuals in the United States during 2014-2016 1 and public data on the four domestic cases of Ebola 21 (Supplemental Text, Table 2 ).
