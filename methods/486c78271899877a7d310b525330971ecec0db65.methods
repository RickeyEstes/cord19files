Tourism in Fiji is largely resort-based and therefore the accommodation sector is the prominent tourism sub-sector (about 70% of total expenditure is on accommodation; Ministry of Tourism, 2003) . Tourists spend most of their time at a resort, and most of tourists' resource consumption (e.g., water and energy) takes place at the resort level (for a full analysis of both accommodation and transport energy use, refer to Becken, 2004) . For the above reasons, it was considered appropriate to focus this analysis on the accommodation sub-sector. Data were collected from three sources: stakeholder and expert interviews, tourist operator interviews, and an accommodation survey. The stakeholder and expert interviews (N ¼ 14) were informal and notes were taken. The results and background information obtained informed the accommodation survey and industry interviews (N ¼ 9). The private-sector interviews were conducted at the resorts and included site visits. Interviews were semi-structured and designed to enhance or confirm knowledge gained in the accommodation survey. The interviews covered the operators' attitudes towards climate change, and adaptation and mitigation measures in place. All the interviews were undertaken between 15 April and 1 May and 23 August and 3 September 2004. The accommodation survey was designed as a mail-back survey and was sent out on 23 April 2004. The questionnaire sought information on energy consumption, climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, and environmental management. The survey was undertaken with the support of the Department of Energy and the Ministry of Tourism. The questionnaire was posted to all tourism accommodation providers in Suva, the Coral Coast, the Mamanuca Islands, and Nadi (N ¼ 116), together with a prepaid envelope for sending the survey back. The addresses of the businesses were taken from the 'Explore Fiji' brochure (March 2004) published by the Fiji Visitor Bureau on a monthly basis, and available to tourists free of charge. It is possible that this list of businesses is not comprehensive, but it covers the majority of providers and constitutes information that is easily available to tourists themselves. Two weeks after the accommodation survey was sent out, follow-up calls were undertaken. Some businesses claimed they had not received the survey forms, and the questionnaire was resent by fax or email. The same procedure was repeated after another week. Twenty-five accommodation providers replied to the survey, which represents a response rate of 21.6% (Table 1) . Two of the respondents were also among the operators interviewed. Unfortunately, the responses do not represent the true geographical dispersion of tourism. Resorts based on the Coral Coast are under-represented with only three accommodation providers sending back the survey. The Mamanuca Islands showed the highest response rate. This may be related to a possibly greater environmental awareness and involvement of these businesses as reflected in the existence of the Mamanuca Environment Society with 11 islands and 28 members. Overall, it is possible that the accommodation survey is biased towards businesses that are more interested in and aware of climate change, which may have aided their willingness to reply. Because of its small sample size, the accommodation survey has to be seen as indicative rather than truly representative. The same applies to the calculation of energy consumption rates, which give a rough estimate of what might be the average energy use of accommodation businesses in Fiji. The adaptation part of the accommodation survey is analysed descriptively, and relevant information obtained in stakeholder and manager interviews is added where appropriate. Analysis of the energy consumption part of the survey involved some calculations to derive energy benchmarks and CO 2 emissions. The data provided by respondents was in original units (e.g., kWh, litres, kilograms) or dollar terms (F$), and conversion factors were applied to estimate energy usage in megajoules (MJ) and CO 2 emissions in kilograms (Baines, 1993) . Carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity provided in Viti Levu through the main grid had to be estimated based on the information that about 24.5% of electricity is based on thermal generation, with the remainder being either hydropower or generated by burning bagasse from sugarcane, both of which were considered carbon neutral. No data were available on the ratio of fossil fuel input to electricity output for Fiji thermal power plants from which emission factors could be calculated. For this reason a New Zealand figure of 624 g of CO 2 /kWh electricity consumed (i.e., including transmission losses) was used (New Zealand Ministry of Commerce, 1995) ; in the knowledge that this figure might differ for the Fijian context. The emission factors for diesel and gas as used in this study were 68.7 and 60.4 g CO 2 /MJ, respectively. The following sections discuss, in turn, adaptation of the tourism accommodation sector to climate change, its CO 2 emissions and mitigation measures, and the barriers to implementing either adaptation or mitigation measures.
