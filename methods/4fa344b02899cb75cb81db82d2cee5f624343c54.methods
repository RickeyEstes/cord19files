Plasmid constructs and siRNA synthesis GRP78-expressing recombinant plasmid, pGRP78, and its original plasmid pCMV6-XL5 (named as pVector in this study) were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GRP78, siGRP78, (5′-CCAAG AUGCU GACAU UGAA dTdT-3′) and the negative control siRNA against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, siControl, (5′-GCACU UGUCU ACCUU GAUG dTdT-3′) were synthesized by RiboBio Corporation, Guangzhou, China.
