In our previous work ( Pinky and Dobrovolny, 2016 ) , we presented a two virus model to reproduce experimental data of coinfection taken from Shinjoh et al. (20 0 0) . As some studies have shown that coinfection is associated with long-lasting disease ( Aberle et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2015; Costa et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2013; Mazur et al., 2017 ) , we extend our model to be more biologically relevant and at the same time to examine possible mechanisms for chronic disease conditions. Our previous study exploring the effect of cell regeneration in coinfection models indicated that cell regeneration alone could lead to chronic infection, but only with a single virus ( Pinky and Dobrovolny, 2017 ) . Here, we will explore the phenomenon of superinfection, where a single cell can be infected by both types of viruses at the same time, both with and without constant regeneration of cells and cell death.
