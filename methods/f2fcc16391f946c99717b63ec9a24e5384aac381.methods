Ethics statement. This study did not involve human experimentation; the only human materials used were serum samples obtained from HIV-1-infected individuals with the approval by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University (Protocol No. SPHCC-125-2). The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All of these sera samples came from adults; no minor was involved in this study. Written informed consent for the use of the clinical specimens was obtained from all patients involved in this study. Peptide synthesis. A panel of peptides (Fig. 1a) , including T20, C34, C46, AP1, AP2, AP3, as well as NHR-derived N-peptides, N36 and N45, were synthesized with a standard solid-phase FMOC method, as described previously 8, 50 . All peptides were acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus. The peptides were found to be about 95% pure by HPLC and were identified by mass spectrometry (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). Concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar-extinction coefficient based on tryptophan and tyrosine residues. Qualification assay. Chromatographic analyses were performed using an ODS-C8 column (5 μ m, 100 mm × 2.0 mm ID) kept at ambient temperature. The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile-water-formic acid in the ratio of 50:50:0.1 (v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The sample injection volume was 10 μ L. Acetonitrile was HPLC grade, and other chemical reagents and solvents were analytical grade. A Thermo TSQ Quantum Discovery MAX triple-quadruple tandem mass spectrometer equipped with ESI source (San Jose, CA) and Surveyor LC pump were used for LC-MS analysis. Data acquisition and data processing were performed by using Xcalibur software and LCQuan 2.0 data analysis program (Thermo Finnigan), respectively. Optimized MS parameters were as below: 4800 V spray voltage, 40.0 psi sheath gas pressure, 1.0 psi auxiliary valve flow, and 300 °C of capillary temperature. When running collision-induced dissociation (CID), the pressure was set to 1.5 mTorr. The selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used for AP3 while the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode was preformed for T20. The following transitions were recorded: m/z 670.5 for AP3, m/z 1498.6 for T20. The masses of synthetic peptides T20, AP1, AP2 and AP3 were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS (Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5 ). Expression and purification of fusion protein N36-L6-AP1 and N36-L6-AP2. Using overlapping PCR, the DNA fragment encoding AP1 or AP2 peptide was attached to the 3′-end of the cDNA of gp41 NHR ("N36", 546-581), with a short linker ("L6", SGGRGG) between them. Then, the whole sequence was subcloned into the pET-28a vector (Novagen, USA) with an artificial SUMO-tag between the N-terminal His-tag and the target protein. The pET-28a-SUMO-N36-L6-AP1-or pET-28a-SUMO-N36-L6-AP2-transformed E. coli cells were induced by adding 1 mM IPTG and incubating overnight at 16 °C. Fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and the His-SUMO-tag was cleaved off by Ulp1 enzyme treatment at 4 °C for 2 h. The purified N36-L6-AP1 or N36-L6-AP2 was applied onto a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Fractions containing N36-L6-AP1 or N36-L6-AP2 trimer were collected and concentrated to different concentrations by ultrafiltration. Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination. The fusion protein N36-L6-AP1 was crystallized at 16 °C using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method. The drops were set on a siliconized cover clip by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 μ l protein solution (25 mg/ml N36-L6-AP1 trimer in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl) and 1 μ l reservoir solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 32% (w/v) PEG3350, and 0.2 M MgCl 2 ) against a 400 μ l reservoir solution. After one week, single crystals formed and were flash frozen by liquid nitrogen for future data collection. Fusion protein N36-L6-AP2 was crystallized in a similar way with a different reservoir solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 34% (w/v) PEG3350, and 0.2 M MgCl 2 ). To obtain the complex crystal of AP3 and NHR, synthesized AP3 was first mixed with peptide N45 at 1:1 molar ratio and then applied onto a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to isolate the formed 6-HB. Fractions containing N45/AP3 trimer were collected and concentrated to 30 mg/ml, then crystallized at 16 °C using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method.The drops were set on a siliconized cover clip by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 μ l protein solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl) and 1 μ l reservoir solution (0.2 M Ammonium Sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, and 25% w/v PEG 3350) against a 400 μ l reservoir solution. After 3 days, single crystals formed and were flash frozen by liquid nitrogen for future data collection. The datasets of N36-L6-AP1 were collected at 100 K at beamline 19-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, USA). The datasets of N36-L6-AP2 were collected on an in-house x-ray source (MicroMax 007 x-ray generator, Rigaku, Japan) at the Institute of Biophysics, ChineseAcademy of Sciences. The datasets of AP3/N45 complex crystals were collected at beamline BL-19U1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China. X-ray diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 program 51 . The phasing problem of all three structures was solved by the molecular replacement method using PHENIX.phaser 52 with a crystal structure of HIV gp41 NHR-CHR (PDB entry: 1SZT) as a search model. The final models were manually adjusted in COOT 53 and refined with PHENIX.refine 54 . All coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (N36-L6-AP1: 5CMU; N36-L6-AP2: 5CN0; and N45/AP3: 5CMZ). The statistics of data collection and structure refinement are given in Supplementary Table S2 . Determination of the cross-reactivity of the native and artificial peptides with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients by sandwich ELISA. A sandwich ELISA was conducted to determine the cross-reactivity of the peptides with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients. T20, C46, AP1, AP2 and AP3 were coated onto the wells of 96-well polystyrene plates (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at 10 μ g/ml. The wells were then blocked with 1% gelatin, followed by addition of 50 μ l of serially diluted sera from HIV-1-infected patients and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, HRP-labeled goat-anti-human IgG (Abcam, UK) and TMB were added sequentially. A450 was determined with an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan).
