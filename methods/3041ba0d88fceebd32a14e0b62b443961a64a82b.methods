EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was from Thermo Fisher. Complete protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche. For detection of in vitro-translated proteins, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (0.1 µg/ml) was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch). GST pulldown. Full-length Vps3 and Vps3 truncation mutants were cloned in pGEX5 vectors. The proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) grown at 30°C and lysed using sonification. Proteins were then immobilised on glutathione sepharose 4B beads (GE). HA-Vps8 was produced using a T7 in vitro translation kit (Promega) in combination with the Transcend Non-Radioactive Translation Detection System (Promega) that incorporates biotin-conjugated methionine. In vitro-translated proteins were incubated o/n at 4°C with the loaded sepharose 4B Beads. After that beads were washed and proteins were eluted using 1× sample buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Eluted proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analysed using western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped in lysis buffer (40 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% TX-100 and 5 mM EDTA supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche)). Cells were lysed for 30-60 min at 4°C followed by 20 min centrifugation at 13,000 r.p.m. at 4°C. Protein A beads were incubated with the desired antibody for 2 h at 4°C, washed and added to the collected supernatant. Beads and supernatant were incubated in a rotator at 4°C for 1 h. Beads were washed six times with lysis buffer minus protease inhibitors after which proteins were eluted using 1× sample buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Eluted proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting. Western blotting. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and scraped in E1A lysis buffer (40 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1%TX-100 and 5 mM EDTA supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche)). Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4°C followed by 20 min centrifugation at max speed at 4°C to remove cell debris. Proteins were eluted using 1.5× sample buffer for 30 min at 37°C, separated on a 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked at room temperature (RT) using Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS (1:1) for 1 h and incubated with selected primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS-T 0.2% (1:1). Membranes were washed in PBS-T 0.1% and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer in PBS-T 0.2% (1:1) for 1 h at RT. Finally, membranes were washed and imaged on an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor) for co-IP experiments. For GST-pulldown experiments, biotin-labelled proteins were detected using ECL (GE Healthcare), which were consequently exposed to Kodak XB films (Rochester For antibody uptake IEM, HeLa cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.01% BSA (D/B) and subsequently incubated at 4°C for 1 h with anti-β1 integrin (JB1A, Millipore) diluted in D/B to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. Cells were transferred to pre-warmed D/B, and integrin endocytosis was allowed for 2 h at 37°C after which cells were prepared for IEM as described above and labelled on section with rabbit-ant-mouse IGG (Z0412, Dako) and protein A 10 nm gold. Stimulation-induced integrin recycling assay. Integrin recycling was analysed essentially as described 34 . In brief, HeLa cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.01% BSA (D/B) and subsequently incubated at 4°C for 1 h with anti-β1 integrin (JB1A, Millipore) diluted in D/B to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. Excess antibody was removed by two washes with cold D/B. Cells were then transferred to pre-warmed D/B, and integrin endocytosis was allowed for 2 h at 37°C. Surface-bound antibodies that were not endocytosed were removed with two acid washes (0.5% acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl) at 4°C. For recycling, cells were stimulated with pre-warmed D/B containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). The pool of internal β1 integrins was monitored at the indicated time points by fixation and preparation for IF microscopy as described above. Cell adhesion and migration assays. For cell adhesion assays, 96-well plates were coated with 5 µg/ml FN (90 min) or 3 µg/ml Col-I (5 min) at 37 C, washed with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were trypsinised, resuspended in serum-free DMEM and seeded at a density of 5 × 10 4 /well. At the indicated time points, non-adherent cells were washed away with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, washed twice with PBS and stained with Crystal Violet (5 mg/ml in 2% ethanol) for 10 min. Stained cells were extensively washed with water and lysed with 2% SDS for 30 min. Plates were read at 590 nm. For cell-spreading assays, cells were seeded in plates coated with 5 µg/ml FN or 3 µg/ml Col-I, fixed at the indicated time points, and the number of spread cells was counted. For FA analysis, cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with 5 µg/ml FN or 3 µg/ml Col-I, and fixed at the indicated time points. Confocal images of vinculin staining were acquired using fixed settings, background-subtracted and thresholded in ImageJ 1.44, and FA number was then determined using the 'analyse particles' function. For cell migration assays, cells were sparsely seeded on the indicated matrix proteins, and phase-contrast images were captured every 10 min at 37°C and 5% CO 2 on a widefield CCD system using a ×10 dry lens objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Migration tracks were generated using ImageJ 1.44, and the average displacement and migration speed were calculated from~30 cells out of three independent experiments. The tail retraction phenotype was scored from the same movies. Proximity ligation assay. HeLa cells grown on sterile glass coverslips were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at RT. Then, cells were permeabilised using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked for 15 min using PBS supplemented with 1% BSA. Cells were labelled with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at RT for 1 h, washed and labelled with mouse PLUS and Rabbit MINUS antibodies for 1 h at 37°C. The PLA signal was visualised using the in situ PLA detection kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After labelling the cells were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI and imaged on a DeltaVision widefield microscope using a ×100/1.4 A immersion objective. Pictures were deconvolved using Softworx software and analysed using Fiji ImageJ v1.48q. Integrin recycling and capture ELISA. Integrin recycling was investigated essentially as described earlier 35 . Briefly, cells were transferred to ice, washed twice in PBS and surface-labelled at 4°C with 140 µg/ml NHS-SS-biotin. Internalisation was allowed for 15 min, after which the cells were washed with PBS, and remaining cell-surface biotin was removed with 20 mM MesNa. Recycling of internalised proteins was then induced in DMEM/FCS at 37°C, whereafter biotin was removed from recycled proteins by a second reduction with MesNa, which was quenched with 20 mM iodoacetamide. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and lysed in 1.5 NDLB buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaF, 1.5 mM Na3VO3, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5% TX-100, 0.75% Igepal CA-630 and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzynesulphonyl fluoride supplemented with complete protease inhibitors). Maxisorb 96-well plates (Life Technologies) were coated overnight with 5 μg/ ml anti-integrin α5 in 0.05 M Na 2 CO 3 (pH 9.6) at 4°C, and blocked in PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) with 5% BSA. Plates were incubated overnight with cell lysates at 4°C, washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidasestreptavidin in PBS-T/1% BSA for 1 h at 4°C. After washing, biotinylated proteins were detected with ortho-phenylenediamine in a buffer containing 25.4 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 12.3 mM citric acid (pH 5.4) and 0.003% H 2 O 2 . The reaction was terminated with 8 M H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was read at 490 nm. Statistical analysis. For calculation of correlation coefficients of co-localisation in IF experiments the signal intensity over a vector was plotted using the plot profile tool in FIJI ImageJ in the green, red and where needed, the far-red channel. Correlation coefficients between two plots were calculated using the function: correlðx; yÞ ¼ P P ðx À xÞðy À yÞ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ðx À xÞ 2 ðy À yÞ 2 q ð1Þ Correlation coefficients were calculated between the channels from at least 30 cells taken from three separate experiments. Correlation coefficients were averaged as follows. Individual correlation coefficients (r) underwent Fisher r-to-z transformation according to the formula: The mean of the z values was calculated and the resulting mean was transformed back to the mean correlation coefficient using: To assess the significance between two mean correlation coefficients the z-score and P-value were calculated using: Data availability.
