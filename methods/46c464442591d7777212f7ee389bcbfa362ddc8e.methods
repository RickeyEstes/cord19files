The NCBI non-redundant nucleotide (nr/nt) and transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) databases were downloaded on 31 August 2018. Narnaviral sequences were identified in these databases using, tblastn (version 2.8.0) (Camacho et al. 2009 ), with the RdRp protein sequence of ScNV-20S and the updated RdRp sequence of ONLV1 (completed in this study) as queries. In total, 81 sequences were found by combined searches using these queries (46 in the nr database and 35 in the TSA database). Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based searches were carried out using hhsearch (Finn, Clements, and Eddy 2011) , based on an alignment of RdRps from rORF-containing narnaviruses, leading to the identification of a further 43 TSA database sequences. To identify narnavirus-derived EVEs, we queried ONLV RdRp sequences AGW51766.2 and AGW51768.2 against the NCBI WGS database on 18 December 2019, using the NCBI tblastn interface, with default parameters except the taxonomy ID was set to 'Arthropoda' and the 'expect' threshold and word size were set to 0.1 and 6, respectively. Match sequences were downloaded, the match region extracted, translated, and reciprocally queried against the NCBI nr/nt database with tblastn, with the taxonomy ID set to 'viruses' and other parameters as above. Phylogenetic trees were generated with MrBayes (version 3.2.7) (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001) , using a mixed substitution model with sampling across fixed amino acid rate matrices (aamodelpr Â¼ mixed) and 5,000,000 generations. All other parameters were set as defaults. To check for homology to known proteins, we performed blastp searches against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database, using each of the protein sequences predicted to be encoded by an rORF separately as a query. We also applied HHpred (Zimmermann et al. 2018) , using rORF amino acid alignments as queries (five alignments, one for each of the main rORF clades in Fig. 2 , with-for definiteness-IABX01132835, KX883605, KX883500, excluding KX883602 being one of these clades), searching against PDB_mmCIF70_11_Oct and Pfam-A_v32.0. To check for potential capsid-encoding ORFs, all positivestrand ORFs !150 codons (between flanking stop codons and/or sequence ends), excluding the RdRp ORF itself, were identified and used as queries in HHpred. Among the 29 ORFs found in 124 narnaviral sequences, none were found to have matches to viral capsid proteins; indeed none had significant e-value matches to any known proteins (the minimum e-value was 10). RNA structures in the genomic terminal regions were predicted by scanning full-length narnaviral genomes with RNALfold (version 2.4.9) (Lorenz et al. 2011) , allowing a maximum base-pair span of 150 nt. For all comparisons of alphanarnaviruses 'with' and 'without' rORFs, sequences in which the longest stop codon-free region (beginning within the 5 0 -most 200 nt) occupied at least 90 per cent of the genomic sequence were assigned to the former group, whereas other sequences were assigned to the latter group. A codon-based multiple sequence alignment of RdRp ORFs was produced by aligning the RdRp amino acid sequences with MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) (Edgar 2004) and then backtranslating to a nucleotide sequence alignment using the tranalign program in the EMBOSS suite (version 6.6.0.0) (Rice, Longden, and Bleasby 2000) . The alignment was then mapped to ONLV2 sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the ONLV2 sequence. Synonymous site variation was assessed using synplot2 (Firth 2014) , with a window size of 15 codons. Comparison of amino acid sequences was performed using plotcon from the EMBOSS suite (version 6.6.0.0) (Rice, Longden, and Bleasby 2000) with a BLOSUM62 substitution matrix and a window size of 15 amino acids. When analysing synonymous site conservation in the rORF, the reverse complement of the RdRp alignment was used, and aligned nucleotides on the reverse strand were converted to the corresponding protein sequences using AMAS (Borowiec 2016) . Principal component analysis (PCA) of codon usage across species was performed using relative codon abundances (i.e. normalized by the abundances of the associated amino acids). The principal components were calculated using the RefSeq sequences of cellular organisms, and narnaviral codon abundances were projected onto the resulting principal component space.
