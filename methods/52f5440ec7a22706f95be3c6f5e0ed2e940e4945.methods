Upper respiratory tract secretions including nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, and endotracheal aspirate, as well as urine, saliva and stool specimens were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV (SARS-Coronavirus) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Paired acute and convalescent sera were collected. Laboratory confirmed SARS was defined as either a positive test in RT-PCR or an antibody titre rise of fourfold or above in convalescence. Adverse outcome was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. All patients were treated in the SARS infection isolation wards. Their vital signs and oxygen saturation were closely monitored. Serial biochemical, haematological tests, chest imaging including radiography and high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) were performed. All patients were empirically treated with betalactam and macrolide for atypical and typical pneumonia, together with intravenous ribavirin at 24 mg/kg per day as antiviral therapy. Corticosteroid therapy was commenced at the discretion of the attending clinicians. The corticosteroid regimen options were: intravenous hydrocortisone at 10 mg/kg per day; intravenous methylprednisolone at 1-3 mg/kg per day; or pulse intravenous methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg per day for 2-3 days. Other treatment options included lopinavir/ ritonavir, immunoglobulin, pentaglobulin, convalescence serum or any combination of the above.
