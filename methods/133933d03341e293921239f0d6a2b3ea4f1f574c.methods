Thermocouples were installed in a reaction well (below its microcentrifuge tube) at the bottom of the chamber containing the EPCM and in the exothermic reaction chamber for experiments performed to characterize the temperature profiles of the heaters. The temperature acquisition rate was 1 Hz. Initial experiments were focused on refining the dimensions of the heater, optimizing the quantity and quality of CaO and water, and testing EPCM formulations-with the goal of minimizing initial pre-heating time and variability during the specified incubation period. In the optimized device, 20 gm of CaO and 6.8 mL of water were added to the bottom chamber and mixed by rotary stirring for five strokes to initiate the heating and then the components were assembled as discussed above. To verify that the device could incubate a LAMP assay, the Eiken kits were used as per package insert instructions, except where noted below. Clinically relevant dilutions of genomic DNA were made in Eiken kit buffer to yield the DNA concentration and approximate parasite count noted for each experiment. All dilutions were prepared as single solutions and then aliquoted across treatment conditions to minimize preparation variation. No template controls (NTC) were prepared first and immediately sealed to reduce the possibility of contamination. Mineral oil was layered on the tops of the samples to minimize evaporation. All reactions were incubated at 63uC. Qualitative readout experiments were performed both with and without the Calcein reagent to determine if turbidimetric readouts were possible. To compare the performance of the NINA heater to a reference heater, these experiments were also performed in parallel with reactions incubated in both the test device and in the GeneAmpH thermocycler, programmed for a constant incubation at 63uC. Quantitative fluorescence experiments were performed in parallel with reactions incubated in both the test device and in the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner, programmed for a constant incubation at 63uC. For NINA incubated reactions, LAMP was terminated at the time (,36 min.) when the signal from the parallel reactions on the Tube Scanner began to indicate detectable amplification to avoid signal saturation in all dilutions. Termination was accomplished by flash chilling and later inactivating the reaction by heating at 80uC for 5 minutes. The fluorescence signals of the NINA incubated samples were then read on the SpectraMax M2 plate reader with l ex = 485 nm and l em = 515 nm. Figure S1 The workflow of a proposed NA amplification assay kit. The kit will be an instrument-free, electricity-free nucleic-acid amplification test that is compatible with whole blood, is temperature stable and contains contamination. 1) Initiate NINA heater by installing heater cartridge (a) into insulated housing (b), add EPCM module (c) and lid (d). 2) Set up for assay by opening single assay subkit. 3) Sample blood to calibrated line on collection capillary. 4) Transfer blood and blister contents to ''S'' tube and prefilled diluent to ''NC'' and ''PC'' tubes and mix all. 5) Amplify. Verify temperature ''ready'' indication on the NINA device through transparent view port in the lid, remove the lid, add the three tubes to the NINA heater, and replace lid. Incubate 45 minutes. Verify temperature is still in range through transparent view port (process control). 6) Quench to all three tubes by pushing cap to burst frangible seal and transfer ,10 mL diluted quencher to the amplified mixture.
