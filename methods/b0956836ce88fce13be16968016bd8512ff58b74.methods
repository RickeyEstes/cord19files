Case diagnosis. The diagnosis of clinical SARS cases was made according to the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory syndrome issued by the Ministry of Health, People's Republic of China in 2003 [2] . The index case was retrospectively diagnosed following the epidemiological survey. Confirmation with laboratory examination. Clinical SARS cases were confirmed by neutralization test, and serum samples were found positive for SARSCoV antibody. Definitions in this study. ① Super transmitter was defined as the SARS case who directly or indirectly infected more than 10 cases by one or more generations in the same transmission chain. ② Close contactors were defined as individuals who had face to face contact with SARS cases within four days before the onset of the symptoms (average incubation period) and the time when the isolated treatment was started, as well as individuals providing medical and nursing care, visitors, and those exposed to their secretions or body fluids. Close contactors were subdivided into two groups: one having contacts with SARS cases in the incubation period and the other doing so in the symptomatic period based on their times of contact. ③ Close contactors in the incubation period were defined as individuals in close contact with SARS cases without precautions within four days prior to the emergence of symptoms. ④ Close contactors in the symptomatic period were defined as individuals in close contact with SARS cases without precautions shortly prior to the time of illness onset or death or during the course of isolation.
