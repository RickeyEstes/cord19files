In vitro antiviral assays. Huh-7 replicons harboring HCV GT1b NS3-NS5B coding sequences. Huh-luc/neo-ET cells, harboring the persistently replicating I 389 luc-ubi-neo/NS3-3'/ET replicon containing the firefly luciferase gene-ubiquitin-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion protein and EMCV IRES driven NS3-5B HCV coding sequences containing the ET tissue culture adaptive mutations (E1202G, T1208I and K1846T) were seeded into 96-well plates (7.5x10 3 cells/well), and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/mL)/streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and 1x nonessential amino acids plus 1 mg/ mL G418 antibiotic at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. Media was then replaced with the same media minus G418 plus the test compounds in triplicate. Six wells in each plate received media alone as a no-treatment control. The cells were incubated an additional 72 h, and anti-HCV activity measured using the Britelite plus luminescence reporter gene kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT). Duplicate plates were treated and incubated in parallel for assessment of cellular toxicity by XTT staining. The resulting data was used to determine the test article concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 50% (EC 50 ) or 95% (EC 95 ) and to reduce cell viability by 50% (TC 50 ). PhenoSense HCV NS5B assay. This assay, developed by Monogram Biosciences (San Francisco, CA), was used to determine the susceptibility of various HCV replicon resistance test vectors (RTVs) to AT-511 and the positive control, SOF. RTVs containing the NS5B coding regions of HCV prepared from laboratory strains, as well as strains derived from patients (clinical isolates), with identified genotypes and resistance-associated variants (RAVs), were used to quantitatively measure differences in inhibitor susceptibility relative to the drug susceptible reference replicon, MB_GT1b_Con1_NS5B (Con1). Preparation of RTV RNA is described in S1 Protocol. RTV RNA was electroporated into Huh-7 cells and incubated in the presence and absence of inhibitors at 4 and 72-96 h. Replication capacity was determined by evaluating luciferase activity at the later time point in the absence of inhibitor and relative to the control reference replicon RTV, HCV genotype 1b (Con1). A replication defective Con1 replicon was utilized to determine assay background. The percent inhibition at each serially diluted inhibitor concentration was derived as follows: ½1 À ðluciferase activity in the presence of inhibitor � luciferase activity in the absence of inhibitorÞ� x 100 Inhibitor susceptibility curves were derived from these values and inhibition data was interpolated and reported as fold-change relative to that of the reference. Cell viability was determined using the alamarBlue 1 assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Other antiviral assays. The different cells and viruses were prepared as specified in S2 Protocol. Each assay was run in microtiter plates containing cell control wells (cells only), virus control wells (cells + virus), drug toxicity wells (cells + drug only), drug background wells (drug only) and experimental wells (drug or positive control + cells + virus). Samples were tested in triplicate with five half-log dilutions per compound. After cells, viruses and drugs were added, the plates were incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 , and the antiviral and cell viability assays conducted as described in S2 Protocol. In vitro metabolism assays. Huh-7 replicon cells. The Huh-7 replicons harboring the HCV GT1b NS3-NS5B coding sequences used for the HCV inhibition assay were incubated in 6-well plates (1.7x10 5 cells/well) with AT-511 at 10 μM for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. At each time point, the media was removed and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, collected in 1 mL cold 60% MeOH, and extracted overnight at -20˚C with internal standard added. After centrifugation, at 10,000 g and 4˚C for 10 min, the supernatant was analyzed for concentrations of AT-511 and its metabolites by LC-MS/MS as described in S3 Protocol. Untreated cells were collected at each time point as a negative control. Hepatocytes. Plated cryopreserved hepatocytes from humans (mixed gender, pool of 10 donors), male Sprague Dawley rat and male cynomolgus monkey were purchased from Sekisui XenoTech (Kansas City, KS), plated with Matrigel overlay in 6-or 24-well plates, and maintained overnight at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 with medium containing pen-strep antibiotics (Xeno-Tech). Cryopreserved male mouse (CD1), and fresh male Beagle dog and male cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes were obtained from BioreclamationIVT (Baltimore, MD) and were similarly plated with Matrigel in 6-or 24-well plates and maintained overnight in InVitroGRO™HI medium with Torpedo™ antibiotic (BioreclamationIVT). The protocol described above for measuring AT-511 and its metabolites in Huh-7 cells was repeated with the five different hepatocytes. Untreated cells were collected at 24 h, and the protein content of the cell lysates were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit to assess the number of cells in each incubation. Separately, plated human hepatocytes were incubated for 6 h with 100 μM AT-511, followed by washout periods of 0, 2, 6, 18 and 30 h. Cells were washed, lysed in 1 mL cold 60% MeOH overnight at -20˚C, and the lysates collected to determine the half-life of the active metabolite, AT-9010 by LC-MS/MS as described for the analysis of triphosphates in S3 Protocol. HCV NS5B polymerase (RdRp) assay. RdRp activity was determined by the incorporation of radiolabeled ribonucleotide into synthesized RNA. The 50μl RdRp reaction mixture, which contained 25mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5mM MgCl 2 , 25mM KCl, 17mM NaCl, 3mM DTT, 1μM UTP, 48nM in vitro transcribed RNA template that is complementary to HCV (-) strand 3'UTR region, 1μCi 3 H-UTP, 250 μM rCTP, 1 or 250 μM rATP, rGTP (the reduced amount should give a positive inhibitory response for the particular nucleotide analog being evaluated) and enzyme (derived from GT1b) prepared by Southern Research (Frederick, MD) , was added to serially diluted AT-9010 in 96-well plates. After 2 h incubation and extensive washing, radioactivity, measured by a microplate scintillation counter, was used to determine the potency of compound inhibition. HCV796 (Southern Research, Frederick, MD) was used as positive control for the assay. Human DNA polymerase inhibition assay. The polymerases were purchased from CHI-MERx (Madison, WI). Inhibition of DNA polymerase α activity was assayed in microtiter plates in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mM Mg acetate, 0.3 mg/mL BSA, 1mM DTT, 0.1 mM spermine, 0.05 mM dCTP, dTTP and dATP, 10 μCi 32 P-α-dGTP (800 Ci/mmol), 20 μg activated calf thymus DNA and the test compound at indicated concentrations. The DNA polymerase β and γ reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, KCl (10 mM for β and 100 mM for γ), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.4 mg/mL BSA, 1mM DTT, 15% glycerol, 0.05 mM dCTP, dTTP and dATP, 10 μCi 32 P-α-dGTP (800 Ci/mmol), 20 μg activated calf thymus DNA and test compound at the indicated concentrations. For each assay, samples were run in triplicate, and positive controls were included. The enzyme reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37ºC followed by transfer onto glass-fiber filter plates and subsequent precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Plates were washed five times with 5% TCA, once with 95% ethanol and dried. The radioactive content of each filter was measured and used to determine the extent of inhibition of each polymerase. POLRMT nucleotide incorporation assay. The nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) tested were AT-9010 (for AT-527), 2'-F-2'-C-methyl UTP (for SOF) and 2'-C-methyl GTP (for BMS-986094). GTP and UTP were used as positive controls. Single nucleotide incorporation and chain termination experiments were conducted and analyzed as described by Cameron et al [11] . Cytotoxicity assays. Cardiomyocyte assay. Human iPS cardiomyocytes (Cellular Dynamics; Madison, WI), in medium from Cellular Dynamics, were seeded in 96-well plates (1.5x10 4 cells/well) and incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 48 h. Test or positive control compounds were then added in triplicate and the incubations continued for 3 days. Cell viability was measured by XTT and CellTiter Glo staining. For the latter method, the medium was removed from test plates, replaced with CellTiter Glo reagent in fresh medium before incubating at RT for 10 min. The well contents were transferred to a white 96-well plate and luminescence measured within 15 min on a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux liquid scintillation counter. Bone marrow progenitor cell inhibition assays. Bone marrow progenitor cells, suspended in 6-well plates (1x10 5 cells/well) in Iscove modified Dulbecco medium containing 15% heatinactivated FBS, 10% giant cell tumor conditioned medium (Bone Marrow Plus, Sigma), 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-6, 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-3, 25 ng/mL recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, R&D systems), and 1% methylcellulose, were incubated with test or positive control compounds at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 14 days. The resulting number of colonies (greater than 30 cells) were compared to control wells to determine the extent of cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity assay. K562 leukemia cells (ATCC, CCL-243) seeded in 96-well plates (1x10 5 cells/well) were incubated in triplicate with test or positive control compounds in RPMI containing glucose, 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Plates were incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 3 days, and cell viability measured by XTT staining. Viability was compared with untreated cells to determine TC 50 values. Separately, K562 cells were incubated in triplicate with test compounds in glucose-free RPMI supplemented with 10 mM galactose. Test compounds diluted in RPMI containing glucose were evaluated in parallel. Following incubation at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 2 h, differential biomarkers associated with changes in membrane integrity for necrosis were measured by fluorescence (485/520 nm), and cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels for mitochondrial dysfunction were measured by chemiluminescence using the specific reagents provided in the Promega Mitochondrial ToxGlo kit (Madison, WI). Mitobiogenesis toxicity assay. PC3 cells (prostate adenocarcinoma; ATCC, CRL-1435) seeded in 96-well plates (2.5x10 3 cells/well) were incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO 2 for 5 days in triplicate with test or positive control compounds in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. One plate was used to measure cell viability by XTT staining. Cells in the remaining two plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed thrice with DPBS, and 0.5% acetic acid added for 5 min to block endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Nuclear DNA encoded Complex II SDH-A mitochondrial protein and mitochondrial encoded Complex IV COX-1 protein were measured spectrophotometrically using the Abcam Mitobiogenesis ELISA kit (Cambridge, UK) per the manufacturer's instructions. Cytochrome P450 studies. Metabolism by rhCYP3A4. AT-511 (5 μM) was incubated in triplicate at 37˚C with 50 nM rhCYP3A4 with cytochrome b5 in the presence of an NADPH regenerating system containing 1. Table) . Selective CYP inhibitors were screened as positive controls (S3 Table) . Except for CYP2C9 (15 min) and CYP2C19 (60 min), samples were incubated for 10 min at 37˚C, and the reactions terminated by addition of MeOH containing the internal standard propranolol. The quenched samples were kept on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 4˚C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the probe substrate metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A decrease in the formation of the metabolite compared to vehicle control was used to calculate IC 50 values [22] . Animal studies. Animal welfare. All animal studies described herein were conducted at WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, China) in strict compliance with AAALAC International and NIH guidelines as described in the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", National Research Council-ILAR, Revised 2011 and the People's Republic of China, Ministry of Science and Technology, "Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals", 2017. All studies were conducted in full compliance with protocols that were reviewed and approved by WuXi AppTec's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) prior to study initiation (IACUC numbers R20151119-Rat and SZ20150908-Monkeys-4), and all animals were assessed as to their general health by a member of the WuXi App-Tec veterinary staff upon arrival and prior to being placed on study. All animals were housed in rooms with controlled temperature (18 to 26˚C), relative humidity (30 to 70%) and light cycle (12 h artificial light and 12 h dark), with 10 to 20 air changes/hr and were provided with manipulatives/enrichment toys. Rat pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), group housed (during the 3-day acclimation period) or individually housed (during the study) and provided ad libitum access to purified (reverse osmosis; RO) water and food except when fasted overnight prior to administration of test article, 4 h after which access to food was restored. Two groups of five rats (single sex/group) were administered a single dose of 500 mg/kg AT-527, suspended in 0.5% CMC-Na and 0.5% Tween 80, via nasogastric gavage followed by a vehicle flush of 3 mL (about 3 times the nasogastric tube volume). This dosage was selected because it was close to the anticipated highest dose to be used in a repeated oral dose toxicity study and would permit accurate assessments of plasma concentrations of metabolites. Blood samples (200 μL) were collected via the saphenous vein using manual restraint at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post dose from three animals per sex, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h post dose from two animals per sex. Blood samples were transferred to tubes containing 4 μL 0.5 M dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K 2 EDTA) and 10 μL dichlorvos (2 mg/mL) to prevent coagulation and inhibit esterase activity, respectively, mixed and centrifuged (3000 x g, 10 min, 2-8˚C) to prepare plasma samples which were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at � -80˚C until LC-MS/MS analysis. Animals were observed for any unusual or adverse clinical signs just before and immediately after dosing and prior to each blood collection time point, with no such signs noted. After the 4-h blood collection, two rats per group were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation followed by rapid excision and snap-freezing of the heart and liver in liquid nitrogen. The frozen organs were broken into small pieces and approximately 0.5 g of each tissue was homogenized in 5 volumes (w/v) pre-chilled homogenization solution (30% 268 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 7. Monkey PK study. Male non-naïve cynomolgus monkeys were obtained from Hainan Jingang Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Hainan, China), group housed during the 5-day acclimation period or individually housed during the study in stainless steel mesh cages, provided ad libitum access to RO water, fed twice daily (~120 g Certified Monkey Diet daily; Beijing Vital Keao Feed Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and given daily treats of fresh fruit. Additional environmental enrichment included classical music and cartoons. Three groups of 5 monkeys each were administered 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg AT-527 as a powder filled in empty porcine hard gelatin capsules (size 0). The monkeys were fasted overnight prior to dosing and fed 4 h after dosing. Three dosages were selected to provide assessments of dose proportionality, the top two representing potential doses for a repeated oral dose toxicity study in monkeys, and the lowest predicted to be more therapeutically relevant. A pill gun was used to place the capsule beyond the root of the animals' tongues and their mouths were held loosely closed for approximately 30 sec to allow them to move the jaw and swallow the capsule. Immediately following capsule administration, 20 mL of water was given by mouth and then the mouth was opened to ensure the capsule was swallowed. Blood samples (~0.6 mL) were collected up to 72 h from three animals per dose group, and up to 4 h from the remaining two animals in each group, at the same time points described for rats. Animals were observed for any unusual or adverse clinical signs just before and immediately after dosing and prior to each blood collection time point, with no such signs noted. Blood samples were collected with a syringe from a peripheral blood vessel from restrained, non-sedated animals, immediately transferred to pre-chilled tubes con-taining~1 mg K 2 EDTA•2H 2 0 and 20 μL of 5 mM dichlorvos solution, mixed and placed on ice until plasma was prepared by centrifugation as described for rats. Immediately after centrifugation, plasma samples were extracted with 4 volumes ISS2, and the supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min, 4˚C) and stored at � -60˚C until analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described below. After the 4-hr blood collection, two monkeys per dose group were anesthetized with intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) and then euthanized as described for rats. Samples (~1 g) of liver and heart tissue were collected from each animal at the same organ location, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenate supernatants were prepared as described for rat tissues except one replicate of each tissue homogenate was extracted with 4 volumes of internal standard solution 2 (ISS2; 100 ng/mL labetalol, 100 ng/mL dexamethasone, 100 ng/mL tolbutamide, 100 ng/mL verapamil, 100 ng/mL glyburide and 100 ng/mL celecoxib in MeOH:ACN, 3:1, v/v) for determining concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1, M2, M3 and M4 and another replicate was extracted with 4 volumes of ISS1 for quantitating AT-9010 determining concentrations of AT-9010. All analytes were quantitated by LC-MS/MS as described below. LC-MS/MS analysis of rat and monkey plasma and tissue homogenate supernatants. For the analysis of AT-511 in rat plasma, aliquots were extracted with 10 volumes ISS2. The supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C) and 3 μL samples were injected onto an Acuity BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column and a Sciex API 4000 mass spectrometer (ESI positive ion, MRM mode). Mobile phases A (0.025% formic acid (FA) and 1 mM ammonium acetate (AA) in 5% ACN in water) and B (0.025% FA and 1 mM AA in 95% ACN in water) were used to elute samples (3 μL) at 0.6 mL/min with 10% B for 0.3 min followed by linear gradients to 60% B over 0.6 min and to 90% B over 0.2 min, and ending with 90% B for 0.4 min. The analysis of AT-273, M1 and M4 in rat plasma was the same except samples were extracted with 4 volumes of ISS2, 6 μL samples were injected onto a Gemini C18 5 μm, 4.6 x 50 mm column and a Sciex QTRAP 6500, mobile phase A was 0.3% FA in water, and samples (6 μL) were eluted at 0.8 mL/min with 2% B for 0.8 min followed by linear gradients to 30% B over 1.4 min and 98% B over 1.4 min and ending with 98% B for 1.4 min. The analysis of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 in monkey plasma was conducted the same as the analysis of AT-273, M1 and M4 in rat plasma except freshly prepared plasma samples were extracted prior to storage as described and 5 μL aliquots were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. For the analysis of AT-9010 in rat tissue homogenate supernatant, aliquots were diluted 1:2 with water and injected onto an Agilent Zorbax Extend C18 5 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column and a Sciex API 4000 mass spectrometer (ESI positive ion, MRM mode). Mobile phases A (0.001% ammonia and 0.18 mM DBAA in water (1:1, v/v) and B (10 mM dimethylhexylamine (DMHA) and 3 mM AA in 50% ACN in water) were used to elute samples (60 μL) at 0.7 mL/ min with 2% B for 0.8 min followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 0.4 min, isocratic elution at 30% B for 0.4 min, a linear gradient to 95% B over 0.4 min, and ending with 95% B for 0.4 min. The analysis of AT-9010 in monkey tissue homogenate supernatant was the same except the sample injection volume was 20 μL. Attempts to measure tissue levels of other potentially formed TPs, including 2,6-diaminopurine-2'-F-2'-C-methylribosyl-5'-triphosphate and 2-amino-6-methylaminopurine-2'-F-2'-C-methylribosyl-5'-triphosphate (M2-TP), also used this method. The analysis of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 in monkey tissue homogenate supernatant was the same as for the analysis of these analytes in monkey plasma except supernatants were diluted 1:3 with water prior to analysis using a Sciex API 4000 or 6500 mass spectrometer. For the analysis of M2 and M3 in monkey tissue homogenate supernatant, aliquots were diluted 1:3 with water and injected onto an Acuity HSS T3 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column and a Sciex API 6500 mass spectrometer (ESI positive ion, MRM mode). Mobile phases A (0.3% FA and 10 mM AA in water and B (0.3% FA and 10 mM AA in 95% ACN in water) were used to elute samples (1 μL) at 0.6 mL/min with 0% B for 0.4 min followed by linear gradients to 30% B over 0.5 min and to 95% B over 0.2 min, ending with isocratic elution at 95% B for 0.4 min. PK data analysis. Plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 from animals that were not used for tissue collection (3 rats/sex/dose group or 3 male monkeys/dose group) were subjected to non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 6.3, Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The linear/log trapezoidal rule was applied in obtaining the PK parameters. Supporting information S1 Table
