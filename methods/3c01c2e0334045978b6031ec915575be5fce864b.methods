Twenty-two commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs were selected for this study, including Perilla frutescens, Nelumbo nucifera, Hedyotis diffusa, Heliotropium peruvianum, Siegesbeckia orientalis, Glechoma hederacea, Eupatorium cannabinum, Scutellaria barbata, Orthosiphon spiralis, Houttuynia cordata, Selaginella doederleinii, Plantago asiatica, Eclipta prostrata (Linn.), Leonurus artemisia, Folium Eriobotryae, Agastache, Schizonepeta, Folium Isatidis, Hypericum sampsonii, Taraxacum officinale, Artemisia indica, and Mentha arvensis. These medicinal herbs were obtained from Hung Kuo Shin Medicinal Herb, Inc. (Taiwan, China). The 22 Chinese medicinal herbs were first ground to a fine power using a coffee grinder. Then, 0.5 g of ground, dry herb was placed into a 250-mL flask; 50 mL of HCL was then added to one set of weighed samples and 50 mL of distilled de-ionized water added to another set of samples. Extraction in acid yielded an estimate of total oxalate, whereas extraction in water yielded an estimate of soluble oxalate. Flasks were placed in an 80 ℃ shaking water bath for 30 min after which 50 mL of distilled ionized water was added to the solutions and mixed by swirling. Approximately 10 mL of the solutions were transferred into a 15-mL centrifuge tube. The samples were then centrifuged at approximately centrifugal force of 1778 × g for 10 min and filtered with Whatman filter paper #1 into storage containers. The oxalate contents of all samples were determined by an enzymatic procedure using an oxalate kit (Trinity Biotech, Jamestown, NY, USA). In this procedure, oxalate is oxidized to carbon dioxide and hydrogen perox-ide by oxalate oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide then reacts with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and 3-(dimethylamino) benzoic acid (DMAB) in the presence of peroxidase to yield an indamine dye that has an absorbance maximum at 590 nm. The following procedure was used: Sample preparation: a 1.0-mL volume of herbal extracts was pipetted into labeled glass culture tubes. A 1.0-mL volume of sample diluent (containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and a 7.6 pH buffer) was pipetted into the glass culture tubes containing the herbal extract and mixed using a vortex. pH levels outside of the range 5.0-7.0 were adjusted to this range using 5.0 N NaOH. The diluted herbal extracts were poured into labeled sample purifier tubes (containing activated charcoal). Each tube was vortexed for a few seconds and then placed in a metal rack mounted on a shaker and mixed for 5 min. The tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at approximately a centrifugal force of 1178 × g. Using a Pasteur pipette, an aliquot of the clear supernatants (at least 100 µL) was transferred from the purifier tubes into labeled microcentrifuge vials. Oxalate determination: reagents A and B were allowed to reach room temperature. Reagent A contained DMAB (3.2 mmol/L), MBTH (0.22 mmol/L), and buffer (pH 3.1). Reagent B contained oxalate oxidase (Barley, 3000 u/L) and peroxidase (horseradish, 100 u/L). A 10-µL volume of de-ionized water (for the blank), oxalate standard, or the herbal extract supernatants were pipetted to predesignated wells in the microplate. A total of 200 µL of reagent A and 20 µL of reagent B were pipetted into each well and mixed by gently tapping one side of the microplate. After 5 min, the absorbance was read at 590 nm using a microplate reader (Model EL 311, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont).
