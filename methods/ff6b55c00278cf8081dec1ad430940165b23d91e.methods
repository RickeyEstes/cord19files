The surveillance system and laboratory procedures have been published previously [23] . Briefly, residents of Sa Kaeo province, Thailand who were identified in active population-based surveillance for hospitalized acute respiratory illness were approached for enrollment into a pneumonia etiology study during September 1, 2003 through August 31, 2005 . Enrollment occurred in all 8 hospitals in Sa Kaeo province. A patient was eligible for enrollment if he/she had at least one sign of acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count) plus signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease (e.g. cough, abnormal breath sounds) and the physician ordered a chest radiograph within 48 hours of admission. Each enrolled patient had a nasopharyngeal swab, acute and convalescent serum, and demographic information collected. We considered repeat hospitalizations that occurred $14 days after the previous discharge date as individual hospitalizations. Chest radiographs were read by an expert panel as described previously [24] . In addition, a convenience sample of outpatients with influenzalike illness (fever plus cough or sore throat) was recruited from the outpatient departments from the same hospitals in Sa Kaeo Province during the study period [25] ; 8 outpatient departments participated during year one and 5 departments participated during the following year. Each outpatient participant had a nasopharyngeal swab and demographic information collected. During the second study year, September 1, 2004-August 31, 2005, we collected nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic information from control outpatients (i.e., patients who did not have a fever, and did not report a fever, cough, sore throat or diarrhea within the previous 3 days) from the outpatient clinics as described above. We sought to enroll the same number of controls from five age groups (#2 yrs, 3-5 yrs, 6-15 yrs, 16-54 yrs, and $55 yrs) during each month of the year, (median number/month for all controls = 25, range . The processing and testing of nasopharyngeal swabs were described elsewhere and included individual PCR assays for each pathogen and viral isolation for some viruses [23] . All specimens were tested by a laboratory blinded to patient status, e.g., hospitalized, outpatient, or control. Nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) 1, 2, and 3, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Table S1 ). HRV was detected from respiratory specimens by first testing with RT-PCR primers to detect rhinovirus/enterovirus as described in Roghmann, et al [26] . To discriminate between HRVs and human enteroviruses, PCR positive samples were retrospectively subjected to a second round of semi-nested PCR using HRV-specific primers as described in Miller, et al. [11] . Viral isolation was performed for RSV, HPIV, influenza viruses and adenovirus. Paired sera was tested for RSV, HMPV, HPIV 1,2 and 3, adenovirus, influenza, Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as described [23, 27] . For HRV, a positive RT-PCR result was considered a positive result. For other pathogens, a positive culture, RT-PCR, or four-fold rise in serology was considered a positive test result. Serologic testing and PCR assays for Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were only performed on patients enrolled during the first study year, September 2003-August 31, 2004 and interpreted as previously described [27] . In addition, diagnostic testing included urine pneumococcal surface antigen assay among pneumonia patients aged $18 years. HRV positive samples from hospitalized and control patients during September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005 were further identified to species by RT-PCR and sequencing of partial region of the VP1 (D. Erdman, unpublished, method available on request). Specimens that were VP1 negative were further tested using primers that amplified partial VP4/VP2 or 59NCR regions [28] . We calculated crude and age-specific (,1, 1-4, 5-19, 20-49, 50-64, $65 years) incidence for hospitalized HRV infections using population estimates from Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board for the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005 [29] . Because not all patients eligible for our study were enrolled, we estimated adjusted incidence to account for eligible patients who did not enroll. For the adjusted incidence we assumed the proportion of HRV detections in the enrolled patients was the same as the proportion of infections among all eligible patients. To determine whether HRV detections were epidemiologically associated with hospitalized respiratory illness, we compared HRV detections among hospitalized enrolled patients to detections among control patients without fever or respiratory symptoms. Because controls were collected from the second study year, September 1, 2004-August 31, 2005, this comparison was limited to hospitalized patients from the same year. Two-tailed P values of ,0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All participants were informed of the study objectives and written consent was obtained. This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Internal Review Board and the Thailand Ministry of Public Health Internal Review Board.
