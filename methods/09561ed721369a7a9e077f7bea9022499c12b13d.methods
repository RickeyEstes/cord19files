Wallinga and Teunis [1] (denoted WT method hereafter) proposed a network-based method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number by making use of the epidemic curve, N={N 1 ,…, N T }, where N t is the number of cases at time point t, and an estimate of the serial interval, p 1 ,…, p k , where p i describes the probability of a serial interval of length i and the maximum serial interval length is k. The estimator for R t is a function of the relative probability that case t i was infected by the j th case on day t′, denoted q t i ;t ′ j and is given by where n s denotes the number with symptom onset on day s. The relative probability that case t i was infected by the j th case on day t ′ ; q t i ;t ′ j , is a function of the probability that case t i was infected by case t j ′, and is entirely a function of the serial interval, such that P(t j ′ →t i ) = p t i −t ′ j .
