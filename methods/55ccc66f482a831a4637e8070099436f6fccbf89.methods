For both studies, an interaction with a person was defined as observation of physical (or almost physical) contact, such as the dog jumping up, sniffing a person, or a person patting the dog. An interaction with another dog was defined as two dogs being in close physical proximity with attention focused on each other, for example sniffing each other, or a bout of play, including chasing each other. Even though the dogs may not be in actual physical contact in such interactions, accidental contact is possible and aerosol transmission of a pathogen might occur.
