Protein production. The gene for SARS-CoV nsp12 encompassing the 931 N-terminal a.a. was chemically synthesized with codon optimization (Genscript). The −1 ribosomal frameshifting that naturally occurs to produce nsp12 was corrected to express the nsp12 open reading frame without frameshifting (Supplementary Table 3 ). The gene was cloned (Supplementary Table 4 ) into a modified pFastBac vector containing a 5′ Kozak sequence and C-terminal Thrombin protease site, hexahistidine, and Strep tags using the NEB HiFi DNA Assembly Kit (New England Biolabs). This plasmid construction adds additional a.a. MG to the N terminus of the protein and LVPRGSGHHHHHHAWSHPQFEK to the C terminus. This transfer plasmid was used to create recombinant bacmids by transformation into Escherichia coli DH10Bac (Life Technologies). The nsp12 bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells (Expression Systems) using Cellfectin II (Life Technologies). The recombinant baculovirus was amplified twice in Sf9 cells. Thirteen milliliters of the second amplification was used to infect 1 L of Sf21 cells (Expression Systems) at 2.8 × 10 6 cells/mL and incubated at 27°C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g and resuspended in 70 mL of 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. The resuspended cells were then mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 0.2% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Anatrace) and incubated with agitation for 10 min at 4°C. The cell lystate was then sonicated before clarification by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min and passing through a 0.45-µm filter. Cleared lysates were loaded onto Streptactin Agarose (Qiagen), washed with same buffer, and eluted with same buffer containing 2 mM desthiobiotin. Eluted protein was concentrated and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex200 column (GE Life Sciences) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM magnesium chloride, and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Fractions containing nsp12 were concentrated with an Amicon Ultra concentrator (Millipore Sigma). Full-length, chemically synthesized, and codon-optimized nsp7 and nsp8 genes (Supplementary Table 3 ) were cloned into pET46 (Supplementary Table 4 ) for expression in E. coli using Ek/LIC cloning (Novagen). While the sequence encoding the TEV protease site was cloned into pET46 when inserting nsp7, the TEV protease site for nsp8 was added in a second step using insertional mutagenesis. The N-terminal tags for nsp7 are MAHHHHHHVDDDDKMENLYFQG and for nsp8 are MAHHHHHHVDDDDKMENLYFQ. The TEV protease cleavage sites (ENLYFQ|G) were positioned to leave an N-terminal glycine on nsp7 and no additional N-terminal residues on nsp8. Plasmids were transformed into Rosetta2 pLysS E. coli (Novagen). Bacterial cultures were grown to an OD 600 of 0.8 at 37°C, and then the expression was induced with a final concentration of 1 mM of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and the growth temperature was reduced to 16°C for 14-16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 30 mM imidazole, and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Resuspended cells were lysed using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems) operating at 20,000 PSI. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min and then filtration using a 0.45-µm vacuum filter. Lysates were bound to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), washed with same buffer, and then protein was eluted with same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Eluted proteins were digested with 1% (w/w) TEV protease at room temperature overnight while dialyzing into 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 5 mM betamercaptoethanol. TEV protease-digested proteins were passed over Ni-NTA to remove uncleaved proteins and then further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex200 column (GE Life Sciences) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM magnesium chloride, and 2 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Fractions containing the purified proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra concentrators (Millipore Sigma). ARTICLE Electron microscopy and model building. Purified nsp12 was combined with nsp7 and nsp8 in a 1:2.2:2.2 molar ratio and incubated at 4°C overnight. Three microliters of the protein complex was combined with 0.5 µL of 0.42 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside and then immediately spotted onto UltraAuFoil 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 holey grids that had been plasma cleaned for 7 s with an Ar/O 2 gas mix. Grids were immediately blotted for 3 s using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) and then plunge frozen in liquid ethane. EM data were collected using a Talos Arctica (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV with a Gatan K2 detector 39 . A dose rate of 5.7 e − /pix/s was used with a 11.75-s exposure for a total dose of 50.5 e − /Å 2 , which was fractionated across 47 movie frames (250 ms/frame). One thousand six hundred and seventy-seven micrographic movies were collected using image shift and a defocus range of 0.4-1.0 µm using the Leginon data collection software 40 . Movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2 41 . All 47 movie frames were used to produce the aligned images. CTF parameters were estimated from the aligned micrographs using GCTF 42 . Particles were picked using DoG picker 43 and filtered after manual image assessment using EMHP 44 . Particles were extracted using RELION-3.0 45 and several rounds of two-dimensional classification was performed in Cryosparc v0.6.5 46 . Clean stacks were used to reconstruct and refine an SGD initial model using RELION-3.0. 3D classification was performed in RELION-3.0 to identify subsets of particles giving rise to a high-resolution reconstruction and the best subsets was subsequently re-refined in RELION-3.0 ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . The initial coordinates of rhinovirus serotype 16 polymerase 47 (1XR5.pdb) [10.2210/pdb1XR5/pdb] and SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 14 (2AHM.pdb) [10.2210/ pdb2AHM/pdb] were rigid body docked into the map and used as starting models for coordinate modeling. Rebuilding and sequence assignment was performed using Coot 48 . The coordinate models were refined using RosettaRelax 49 and phenix.real_space_refine 50 . Final models were assessed using Molprobity 51 and EMRinger 52 . Supplementary Fig. 3 . The full alignment was used as input for ConSurf 54 to generate the images in Fig. 2. nsp12 activity assay. The activity of SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase was tested using a modification of the primer extension assay previously described 7 . A 40-nt template RNA corresponding to the 3′ end of the SARS-CoV genome was annealed to a complementary 20-nt primer containing a 5′ fluorescein label. Primer extension reactions were assembled containing 500 nM nsp12, 1.5 µM nsp7, 1.5 µM nsp8, 250 nM annealed primer/template with 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM potassium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride, and 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before the addition of an NTP mix (500 µM each, final concentration). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 60 min and then analyzed by denaturing TBE-Urea PAGE with fluorescence detection (ChemiDoc MP, BioRad). Reporting summary.
