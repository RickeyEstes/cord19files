To assess the annual probability (PPlasma) that at least one Danish piglet being fed imported, contaminated SDPP becomes infected with PEDV, we set up and used a stochastic simulation model. Different variables were taken into account, according to the diagram reported in Fig. 1 (representing the SDPP producing layout), and using the information we found in literature. Fifteen Danish feed producing companies were consulted. They provided information about the volume and origin of SDPP imported to Denmark during a 1-year period. The probability that a matrix (in our case SDPP fed to na√Øve piglets) transmits the infection to animals depends on (1) the probability that the matrix is contaminated with PEDV and (2) the probability that an exposure to such a matrix leads to infection in a susceptible pig [3] . Thus, before assessing the PPlasma, we investigated the probability (PContBatch) that a batch of blood collected at the abattoir (abroad) is contaminated with PEDV. If contamination at the abattoir-level is impossible, there is no need to estimate the PPlasma. Otherwise, the PPlasma needs to be estimated. An alternative scenario analysis was subsequently undertaken, to investigate the impact of the main inputs on the PPlasma. According to the output of this analysis, we also investigated the impact of testing for PEDV the batch of raw blood collected at the abattoir, as a risk mitigation measure. The model was developed in @Risk 6 (Palisade Corporation). Runs were made using 10,000 iterations and Latin hypercube.
