Immunosuppressed adults (> 18 years old) who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL at the University of Rochester Medical Center between 2009 and 2016 were identified using an existing bronchoscopy database. Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to data collection. Only the first bronchoscopy per patient was included. Non-BAL bronchoscopies (i.e. bronchoalveolar washes) were excluded. Patients were categorized by type of immunosuppression: HIV/AIDS, any hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplantation (SOT), or other immunosuppression (solid organ malignancy on immunosuppressive chemotherapy, prednisone 40 mg daily, or two immunosuppressant agents). Clinical characteristics for each patient were documented and included; type of immunosuppression, duration and type of antimicrobial therapy, hypoxia, fever/hypothermia, complete blood counts, and presence of new CT abnormalities (nodules, consolidation, or ground glass opacities). Pneumocystis jiroveci was identified using an in house real time PCR assay targeting DNA specific to pneumocystis. This is a qualitative test with a quantitative threshold. It measures DNA concentration and counts the number of DNA replications cycles (cycle time) needed to produce a detectable concentration of DNA. Positivity was determined based on reaching a certain DNA threshold and the number of replication cycles required. If positivity is reached prior to 40 replications cycles the sample was considered positive. If positivity is reached after 40 replication cycles the sample was considered negative. Fewer replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggest higher burden of starting organism, whereas higher replication cycles (cycle time) needed until positivity suggests lower burden of starting organism. Viruses were identified using multiplex PCR (FilmArray Biofire) which identifies: 15 viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus (4 strains), metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A (3 strains), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza 1-4) and 3 atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydophila pneumonia, and Bordetella pertussis). Pneumocystis jiroveci identification by microscopy consisted of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain and Calcofluor white stain, and conventional identification of viruses utilized standard culture techniques. Cytomegalovirus in HIV/AIDS [16] , herpes simplex virus without concomitant dissemination [17] , and Candida, Saccharomyces, and Penicillium species identified by culture were not considered positive. Antimicrobial therapy was documented before and after BAL. A change in therapy was assessed seven days after BAL [9] . Antibiotics were classified as none, community acquired pneumonia coverage, or hospital acquired coverage. Anti-pneumocystis treatment was not considered antibiotic therapy.
