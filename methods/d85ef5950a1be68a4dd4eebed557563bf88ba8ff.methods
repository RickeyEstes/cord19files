Clinical samples and RNA extraction. The samples selected for this study were faecal samples from three healthy kittens and post-mortem tissue lesion samples from three kittens with FIP. These samples were all obtained from a previously reported epizootic outbreak at a single-site UK feline rescue centre (Barker et al., 2013) . The three tissue lesion samples, designated here as 26M (mesentery), 27C (colonic lymph node) and 28O (omentum), were from cats F/FIP, Z/FIP and J/FIP in a previous study (Barker et al., 2013) and had been collected within 2 h of death, placed in RNAlater (Life Technologies) for 24-48 h at 4 uC and then, after discarding the RNAlater, stored at 280 uC. The diagnosis of FIP was confirmed by post-mortem examination including histopathology and immunohistochemistry for the demonstration of FCoV antigen in lesions (Kipar et al., 1998) . The faecal samples (65F, 67F and 80F, previously named #65, #67 and #80) were collected from the healthy cats within 1 month of euthanasia of the cats with FIP (Barker et al., 2013) . Samples 80F and 27C were from cats that were littermates and were housed within the same pen. All three cats that provided faecal samples remained alive and without any clinical signs that could be suggestive of FIP for over 1 year post-sampling. Faecal samples were stored at 280 uC immediately after collection. Total RNA was extracted and purified from 20 mg tissue with a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) based on a previously described method (Dye & Siddell, 2007; Dye et al., 2008) . Briefly, 20 mg each tissue sample was disrupted in a 2 ml tube by adding 500 ml lysis buffer containing 1 % b-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and a 5 mm stainless steel ball bearing. The sample was homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at 30 Hz for 2 min and 470 ml lysate was added to a filter column and centrifuged for 30 s at 10 000 g. A 350 ml aliquot of the filtrate was added to 250 ml ethanol and run through a binding column to which DNase I was added to remove genomic DNA. Following multiple washes, the RNA was eluted into 50 ml nuclease-free water. The NucleoSpin RNA kit was also used to extract RNA from faecal samples using a method based on that described by Dye et al. (2008) . A faecal suspension was produced by vortexing 0.5 g faeces and 4.5 ml PBS five times for 30 s each. Subsequently, 100 ml of this suspension was centrifuged for 2 min at 10 000 g, and the supernatant removed and added to 350 ml lysis buffer containing 1 % b-mercaptoethanol (v/v). The protocol described above (from the filter column) was then followed. Histology and immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed tissue samples (26M, 27C and 28O) were routinely paraffin wax embedded and examined histologically to confirm the presence of typical FIP lesions. The immunohistochemistry served to demonstrate FCoV antigen within the lesions, as described previously (Kipar et al., 1998) . Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and virus-specific oligonucleotide primer design. FCoV RNA was amplified from faecal and tissue samples using qRT-PCR as described previously (Dye et al., 2008; Porter et al., 2014) . Oligonucleotide primer pairs (Table 3) were designed to produce a total of seven RT-PCR products (amplicons) spanning the entire coding region of the FCoV genome using the MacVector Primer3 software package. Initially, the primers were designed based on the genome sequence of FCoV C1Je, a serotype 1 FCoV (Dye & Siddell, 2007) . The primers were then compared with an alignment of 29 serotype 1 FCoV genome sequences (CLUSTAL W; sequences available upon request) and optimized to allow for sequence variation and compatibility of the primer pairs. All primers were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon. One-step RT-PCR. FCoV-specific primers were used to reverse transcribe and amplify the viral RNA contained in 2 ml extracted total RNA using a SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Life Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, a 50 ml reaction was set up on ice containing 2 ml RNA, 1 ml 10 mM forward and 1 ml 10 mM reverse primer, 25 ml 26 reaction mix (as supplied by the manufacturer), 2 ml SuperScript III RT/Platinum High Fidelity enzyme mix and water to a final volume of 50 ml. The reaction was incubated at 50 uC for 50 min to allow cDNA synthesis, and then raised to 94 uC for 2 min, followed by 41 cycles of 94 uC for 15 s, 50-66 uC (depending on the primer set) for 30 s and 68 uC for 1 min (kb of product size) 21 . The annealing temperature for individual reactions was determined by the melting temperature of the primers used. The reaction underwent a final extension phase at 68 uC for 7 min and was held at 4 uC. For each amplicon, 5 ml PCR product was separated on a 1 % agarose/TBE gel to confirm the PCR product size and to estimate the amount of DNA by comparison with standards. The PCR products were then pooled in approximately equimolar amounts and purified using Agencourt AmPure XP beads (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR Purification; Beckman Coulter), following the manufacturer's protocol, and eluted in nuclease-free water. NGS. Purified, pooled amplicons were sequenced at the University of Bristol Genomics Facility using the Ion Torrent platform (PGM with a 316v2 chip). A targeted, virus-specific cDNA single-end read library was produced. Briefly, DNA was fragmented using an Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library kit, ligated to Ion-compatible barcoded adaptors and size-selected for a target read length of 150-200 bases. The library was then amplified and purified using an Ion Plus Fragment Library kit and an Agencourt AMPure XP kit. The barcoded libraries were quantified and pooled in equimolar amounts using Bioanalyser quantification. Templates were prepared from the barcoded, pooled libraries using an Ion OneTouch 2 System. Routinely, four genomes were sequenced on a single 316v2 chip. Bioinformatics. Sequence data were analysed using bioinformatics tools including both de novo assembly (Trinity, http://trinityrnaseq. github.io/) and genome alignment (Bowtie2, http://bowtie-bio. sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) methods. Briefly, for samples 80F and 27C, a de novo consensus sequence was produced from the FASTQ reads using the Trinity assembled components and the MacVector assembly project tool (Grabherr et al., 2011) . In order to identify and correct possible errors in this assembly, the same FASTQ sequence files were then aligned with the assembled consensus sequence using Bowtie2. The alignments were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and the consensus sequence was manually corrected on the basis of the sequence reads. Subsequently, the FASTQ sequence reads for four samples (65F, 67F, 26M and 28O) were aligned with the corrected 80F consensus sequence using Bowtie2. Again, IGV was used to confirm each consensus sequence with regard to the relevant sequence reads. All of the assembled genome sequences were examined and confirmed to have the expected FCoV genome architecture and predicted ORFs. This workflow is illustrated in Fig. 5 . For selected viral genes, the encoded protein sequences were derived and phylogenetic reconstruction was done using a neighbour-joining algorithm based on an alignment generated by CLUSTAL W (MacVector).
