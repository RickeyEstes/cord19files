This descriptive questionnaire study took place in three hospitals located in the eastern New Territories of Hong Kong, namely Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH), North District Hospital (NDH) and Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH). The questionnaire was designed in four parts with questions relating to (1) participant characteristics, (2) general information about IFT, (3) equipment preparation and (4) management of adverse events en route. Draft questionnaires were distributed to three local experts for content validity. A pilot study was performed in the AED of another local hospital, the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH), to elicit feedback on the clarity and readability of the questionnaire. Amendments were made accordingly following the feedback received. Ethic approval was granted by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong -New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CRE-2006.247) prior to the commencement of this study. Participation was voluntary and the questionnaires were distributed to all registered nursing staff working in the AED of the three participating hospitals. Participants were expected to complete and return the questionnaires on their own during the calendar month of September 2006. All data was anonymized for further analysis. Participant characteristics as well as general information about IFT were illustrated with descriptive statistics. Participants' performance on the questions about equipment support and management of adverse events were scored (out of a maximum possible score of 40). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare participants' test scores with their clinical experience and details of any relevant courses taken. All data was entered on to an Excel spreadsheet and transferred to SPSS for further statistical analysis.
