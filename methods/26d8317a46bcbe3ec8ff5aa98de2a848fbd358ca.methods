Subjects with asthma exacerbation or AECOPD who were admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital during 1 Aug 2016 and 31 July 2017 were screened for this study. AECOPD was defined when a patient with age ≥ 40 years and background COPD (lung function parameters of FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 70%) [15] presented with at least two of the following major symptoms (increased dyspnoea, increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume) or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/ congestion, wheeze, sore throat, cough) for at least two consecutive days [16, 17] . Patients with asthma exacerbations were subjects aged ≥18 years, who had background asthma (with a consistent history, prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction and evidence of an increase in FEV 1 greater than 12% and 200 mL following bronchodilator or bronchial hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable) [3] , presented with either increasing dyspnea, wheeze or cough for at least 2 consecutive days. Control asthma and COPD subjects were recruited from the respiratory clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital. All recruited COPD subjects should have an FEV 1 / FVC ratio of < 70%. For asthma patients, they should have a clinical diagnosis of asthma (as above). These subjects should have no exacerbation of asthma or COPD for 6 weeks prior to the assessment. Patients with a history of lung resection or other significant pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, active infection such as pulmonary tuberculosis and having short life expectancies including subjects with terminal malignancy or intractable heart failure were excluded from this study. After obtaining consent from the patient, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was obtained from the patients within 1-2 days of hospitalization for exacerbation of asthma and COPD. This study was approved by the Joint CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CRE-2015.164). The NPA specimens collected were put immediately in viral transport medium and kept at 4°C during transportation. Both viral RNA and DNA were extracted from the specimens using QIAamp® MinElute® Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and subjected to compliance with the European Union In-Vitro Diagnostics requirement. 22 respiratory pathogens (coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (including H1 and H3), influenza A H1N1pdm09, influenza B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 & 4, rhinovirus/enterovirus, RSV-A and RSV-B, adenovirus, bocavirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). were assessed by RespiFinder® 2SMART (PathoFinder, Netherlands) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time multiplex PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q® MDx instrument (Qiagen, Germany) and detection was based on melting curve analysis. Specimens positive for HRV/ enterovirus were subjected to further sequencing work for virus typing, adopted from the method we described in our previous study [13] . Subjects were called back to our research clinic 6-8 weeks after discharge for lung function assessment. Spirometry pre and post-bronchodilator according to the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society standards was performed [18] . The updated predicted spirometry values for Hong Kong Chinese was used to calculate the predicted lung function [19] . The subsequent hospital admissions and mortality were recorded after the baseline assessment for up to 2 months. For control COPD and asthma patients, we identified patients from the out-patient clinic and called back these patients for assessment on a single visit for obtaining NPA. Their spirometry was tested in the same visit. We aimed at recruiting 400 episodes of AECOPD, 100 episodes of asthma exacerbation and 1/5 the number of exacerbation of subjects as controls. Given the potential seasonal variation in viral etiologies, we used the timestratified random sampling approach for patient recruitment (each month we recruited a similar number of subjects in different categories). Data were analyzed by the Statistical Package of the Social Science Statistical software (SPSS) for Window, Version 22.0.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were applied to the prevalence of different viruses found in AECOPD and asthma patients and comparisons with the control subjects were done by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Student t-test as appropriate. Clinical outcomes of the patients with different viruses were compared by chi-square test, Student t-test and Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. Figures were presented as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range), and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as significant.
