Since the daily numbers of calls are integer valued, it is natural to model them using Poisson distributions with parameters depending on explanatory variables. This motivated us to consider the Poisson GLM (Generalized Linear Model) regression as a first attempt. The response variable is the daily number of PE Link calls received by the call center that lead to hospital admissions. The explanatory variables included the daily temperature, the humidity and the range of temperature fluctuations. As our main concern is the impact of cold weather on service use, the temperature variable we use is the daily minimum temperature. The daily temperature range was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures. Since previous studies suggest the effect of weather on health status tends to be nonlinear [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , the impact of each of these meteorological variables was modeled as a polynomial function over the respective range of the variable. The degrees of the polynomials were selected using a popular model selection method, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [7] . To account for any potential seasonality effects associated with day of the week and month of the year, dummy variables for each of Monday, Tuesday, ..., Saturday, and February, March, ..., December were included in the explanatory variables, while Sunday and January were held as references. As the data plot shows non-cyclic variations in the daily call numbers, a polynomial function of calendar time over the study period was included to account for such secular trend. The degree of the polynomial for the time trend was selected together with the degrees of the polynomial effect functions for the meteorological variables in the model selection process using the AIC. As previous studies suggests that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 might have influenced Smoothed call rate at a specific temperature (or another variable) value was calculated by averaging all call rates associated with the specific temperature (or another variable) value the call rate as well [8] , the indicator for the duration of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 4 Feb-21 May 2003, was also included in the model. The terms in the best model at the end of the model selection process were each examined for statistical significance. Terms whose removal from the model would further reduce the AIC value were dropped to simplify the model. Due to the time series nature of the daily call counts, there might be auto-correlation among the call numbers, which, if left unaccounted for, could distort the inference on the covariate effects. Therefore, the residuals from fitting the simplified model was examined for significant auto-correlations by visually inspecting the ACF (auto-correlation function) plot. If significant autocorrelation was detected, then Poisson GLARMA (Generalized Linear Auto-Regressive Moving-Average) model [9, 10] would be fitted to the data to account for any auto-correlation among the count time series. The residual deviance statistic after fitting the Poisson GLARMA model was checked against the residual degree of freedom of the model for evidence of overdispersion of the data relative the Poisson distribution. If overdispersion was detected, then a negative binomial GLARMA model would be fitted to the data to account for overdispersion and reduce the chance of falsely declaring significant covariate effects. Various diagnostic plots of the residuals from fitting the final Poisson or negative binomial GLARMA model were inspected to see if the model fits the data well. If the temperature variable was significant in the final model, then the estimated effect function for temperature would be graphed and visually inspected to determine any critical temperature.
