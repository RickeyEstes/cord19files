The present study was conducted in the pediatrics department of SVPPGIP, SCB Medical College, a tertiary care teaching hospital in Eastern India over 2-year period (October 2011 to September 2013). Children aged 2 to 60 months with symptoms and signs of acute respiratory tract infections suggested by WHO were included [9] . WHO classification of acute respiratory tract infection in children presenting with cough, difficult breathing, or both is as follows: pneumoniarespiratory rate per minute >50 breaths (2-11 months of age) or >40 breaths (12-59 months of age); no lower chest indrawing; severe pneumonia-symptoms of pneumonia, and lower chest indrawing with or without rapid breathing; very severe disease-symptoms of severe pneumonia, inability to drink, convulsions, central cyanosis, being abnormally sleepy or difficulty to wake, stridor in calm child, or clinically severe malnutrition. Those with suspected bacterial etiology (e.g., streptococcal sore throat, lobar pneumonia, pneumatocele, and empyema), underlying chronic conditions, HIV, illness lasting more than a week, severe malnutrition, and those hospitalized in last one month were excluded. The Institute Ethics Committee approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal guardians. Nasal and throat swabs were collected and pooled into tubes containing 2 mL of virus transport medium (VTM, Copan, Brescia, Italy) and kept in refrigerator at 2 to 8 ∘ C. Then the samples were transported over ice to the laboratory (Regional Medical Research Centre, ICMR) situated at Bhubaneswar, a Grade 1 equipped virological laboratory [10] . Samples were kept there in −80 ∘ C until further processing. Total nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 L of each specimen using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all collected specimens, PCR or RT-PCRs were performed to detect infection with RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV, adenovirus (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human corona virus (hCoV), enterovirus (EV), and RV. The method used for each virus is described in the following references: PIVs 1-4, EV, RV [8] , IFV (A, B, and C), and RSV (A and B) [11] were detected by two multiplex nested RT-PCRs; hCoV [12] and hMPV [13] by two-step RT-PCR; ADV [14] by single-step PCR; and hBoV by touchdown PCR [15] . RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript II onestep RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). All products underwent electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. Typing for IFV, PIV, and RSV was performed according to PCR product size.
