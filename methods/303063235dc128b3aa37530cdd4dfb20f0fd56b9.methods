This was a single-center prospective observational study enrolling sequential patients admitted for LRTI, from October 2012 to September 2015, at the Department of Pediatrics of a tertiary care, University affiliated Hospital. This Department receives previously healthy children attending the emergency department (ED) from the geographic area of the hospital and from other local hospitals for chronic and/or severe disease. During the study period, a total of 119,682 children were seen at the ED, from which 3.3% were admitted as inpatients. Children aged less than two years old with the diagnosis of LRTI were enrolled. The discharge diagnosis was made by the attending physician, who also collected the clinical data by fulfilling a standardized written form, created specifically for the study, at patient's admission and discharge. We analyzed patient's demography (gender, age), comorbidities or associated chronic conditions (prematurity, very low birth weight, respiratory, cardiac, neurologic or genetic), clinical and environmental data (breast-feeding, passive smoke exposure, day care attendance), duration of symptoms and signs related to the acute respiratory infection, and physical examination on admission. Furthermore, we compared the amount of health resources used, namely diagnostic tests performed [including blood analysis, bacteriological cultures of respiratory specimens, chest X-ray (CXR)], treatments prescribed (bronchodilators, antibiotics, oxygen delivery and ventilatory support) and hospital length of stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Respiratory secretions, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or a nasopharyngeal swab, were obtained within 72 h of the child's admission. The strains were sent to the Microbiology Laboratory where the viral and bacteriological studies were carried out. Viral identification was performed through qualitative reading of a real-time PCR technique (Anyplex TM IIRV16 Seegene Inc, till early December 2015 and Allplex Respiratory Pannel I, II e III Seegene Inc, afterwards), both allowing for the simultaneous identification of 16 viruses: ADV, FLUA, FLUB, PIV1, 2, 3 and 4, HRV, RSVA and RSVB, HBOV, COV 229E, NL63 and OC43, MPV and enterovirus (HEV), the second kit with further differentiation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3). Viral coinfection was defined when multiple simultaneous viral pathogens were detected from the same respiratory sample and bacterial coinfection or secondary bacterial pulmonary infection based on positive bacteria cultures. Bacterial diagnostic tests were performed only if requested by attending physicians. Strains isolated from products of the respiratory system (expectoration, bronchial secretions) came as samples from a swab, based on the presence of epithelial cells, neutrophils and the morphology of the predominant bacteria. For all types of samples, macroscopically distinct colonies were isolated in pure culture. 26 Coinfection was admitted based on microbiological definitions because of the overlap between symptoms and clinical diagnosis, mainly of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 27 Disease severity was analyzed through hospital LOS in days, ICU admission and need for ventilatory support, both invasive and non-invasive.
