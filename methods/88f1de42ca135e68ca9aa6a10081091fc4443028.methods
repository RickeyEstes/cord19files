Data reported in this paper were obtained from published literature, reports, and gray literature available in the ASEAN countries. We used both online and manual search methods to gather the information and 'snowball' further data. The sources of online data include international and national journal articles and studies from multiple electronic bibliographic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE, and web-based statistics such as World Health Statistics (http://www.who. int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/en/); Global Health Observatory (GHO) (http://www.who.int/gho/en/); the Asian Development Bank Institute (http://www.adbi. org/); ASEAN (http://www.asean.org/), and the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/). The following main key search terms were used: UHC, health system, ASEAN integration, ASEAN countries, health insurance, health financing. In addition, search engines such as Google and Google Scholar were also used. The research team members conducted manual searches to collate government documents, reports, publications related to demographic, health system, and UHC in ASEAN member states.
