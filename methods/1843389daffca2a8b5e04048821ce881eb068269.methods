Study period and target diseases. During January 2010 to June 2017, we analysed NIDS and NHICS data to compare the number of national notifiable infectious disease cases of 80 infectious diseases 17 . Of these, 46 are been monitored for the possibility of imported or re-emerging cases; the diseases had not been steadily reported in the ROK. Therefore, these 46 diseases were excluded from this study. Among the remaining infectious diseases, those with less than ten patients per year in the NIDS and NHICS were excluded. Additionally, diseases that were included in the NIDS since 2013 (such as MERS-CoV, Zika virus, and hepatitis C virus) were excluded for comparability. Chronic infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B virus, syphilis, leprosy, and tuberculosis were also excluded due to possibility of duplicated case numbers and complex diagnostic codes. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection is not included in NIDS due to the special protection act for HIV/AIDS patients 18 Data sources. We assessed the number of patients imported from the NIDS web reporting system (http:// is.cdc.go.kr) in order to compare that with the surveillance performance of the NHICS. The standards for NIDS include confirmed and suspected cases; however, viral hepatitis A (HAV) and malaria are reported to the NIDS after confirmation. It is a legal duty for physicians to report infectious diseases using the online reporting system when diagnosis is made. To analyse the claim-based surveillance data, we retrieved health insurance data from the HIRA, which provides de-identified data after the review of claims. Since all medical service providers must contract with the National Health Insurance Service as a social health insurance scheme, it reimburses all medical costs according to diagnostic codes, based on ICD-10 19 . When a medical provider claims for reimbursement, HIRA takes 3 steps in reviewing the claim: automatic, general, and expert. Figure 1 shows the reporting system and data processing steps of the surveillance systems. R/C ratio. In report-based surveillance, reported cases (R) can be generated using the following formula:
