An online survey was administered to over 2000 random adults in the U.S. in October 2014. Respondents spent an average of 13 min to complete the survey. A Dillman online survey procedure was used to increase participation (Dillman, Smyth, & Christian, 2009 ). This included two reminder emails. In the end, a total of 1613 completed surveys were available for this study.
