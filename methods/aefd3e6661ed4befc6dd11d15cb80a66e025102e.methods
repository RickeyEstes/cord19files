A cross-sectional study was performed on children under 18 years of age hospitalized at the Fundación Cardioinfantil-IC, a tertiary university hospital located in Bogotá, Colombia. A total of 14,760 patients were discharged between October 2015 and December 2017, out of whom 502 children had a multiplex RT-PCR (FilmAr-ray® BioMériux). This city is located 2630 m above sea level with the characteristic weather and rains patterns of tropical countries and the Andes mountains. It is characterized by an annual mean temperature of 14°C with variations between 6 and 19°C, and peaks of rain from March to May each year, as well as from October to November. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Protocol: PM-1090-2018). The data was taken from the institutional electronic charts of children who were hospitalized for acute respiratory infections and who received multiplex RT-PCR (FilmArray® BioMériux), the analyte used in this technique for HMPV detection was Type 16, A1 IA10-2003 Zeptometrix 0810161CF. Patients who had had this test without experiencing respiratory symptoms and those who had been out of the city in the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization were excluded. The respiratory multiplex RT-PCR assay (FilmArray® BioMériux) was ordered for patients with upper and lower respiratory symptoms at the attending physician's discretion, and samples were taken from nasopharyngeal aspirates by the respiratory therapy specialist and processed within 30 min of collection, which is an institutional standard for sample handling. The RT-PCR detects 17 viruses and 3 bacteria and is currently considered to be the gold standard for detecting these microorganisms. Clinical behavior was assessed in terms of the main complications previously described for HMPV, such as length of hospital stay, need for transfer to intensive care, need for ventilatory support and duration of mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory infections were classified as rhinopharyngitis, laryngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, tracheitis, pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to the criteria of the attending physician. Severe ARI was defined as the need for oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) greater than 40%; the need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal cannula ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation; and/or hemodynamic instability requiring vasoactive support. Patients in whom HMPV was identified 48 h after admission, and who did not have respiratory symptoms on admission, were considered to have a nosocomial infection. Viral coinfection was established if two or more respiratory viruses were isolated on the RT-PCR assay, and bacterial coinfection was determined if blood cultures and/or orotracheal secretion cultures were positive and /or procalcitonin was > 0.5 μg/L. xAdditionally, the IDEAM (Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies) database was used. This is the governmental institution responsible for the analysis and detection of climate and meteorological changes in Colombia. Monthly rainfall patterns for the described study period were analyzed looking for an association with a higher or lower frequency of acute viral respiratory infections.
