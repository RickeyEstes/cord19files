We now present a SIR metapopulation model for the dynamics of HIV/AIDS, following closely a model presented by Keeling and Rohani [35] . The adult population in region i is divided into susceptible S i , Infectious I i and Removed R i , so that the total adult population in the region i is N i = S i + I i + R i . The exposed period from time of HIV infection to a stage when infected individual becomes infectious is very short, so that when an individual acquires infections, immediately becomes infectious [40] [41] [42] [43] . For this reason, we use the SIR model. The dynamics of each sub-population includes only individuals aged 15-64 years only, because this is the group of individuals who are sexually active, hence susceptible to HIV infections. To include different regions in our model, we define S ij , I ij , R ij and N ij to be respectively the number of Susceptible, Infectious, Removed and total adult individuals currently visiting region i but who live in region j. For example, infected individuals working and spending most of their time in region j and going back to visit their family in region i are denoted I ij . We assume a homogeneous mixing of individuals within the regions, meaning that any infectious individual has the same probability of transmitting the disease to any susceptible individual in the population. We define l ji to be the per individual rate per year of moving from region i to region j. We assume that r is the rate of return from visits to another region, which is assumed to be independent of the regions travelled between. We define N i ¼ P to be the total adult population who are currently in region i. We assume that the basic parameters governing the effects of the disease and population demographics are the same in all regions. We further assume that individuals return to their home region before departing for another region and there is no permanent migration and emigration between the sub-populations, so that individuals travel to other sub-population occasionally. In addition, we assume that the recruitment into classes occurs within home regions; i.e., S ii is the only term that increases through population growth. The susceptible class in region i are those newly-recruited into the sexually active cohort at the rate ν i = ν × p i individuals per year and the total susceptible individuals returning in region i from region j at the rate P The equation describing the dynamics of the susceptible individuals S ii in region i is given by Susceptible individuals from region j who are current in region i are recruited by the rate which is governed by the number of people who move out from region j, at the rate l ij S jj and those returning to regional j at the rate rS ij individuals per year respectively. The susceptible are lost by natural death at the rate μS ij and those acquiring HIV infections at the rate b i S ij individuals per year respectively. Similarly, the equation describing the dynamics of the susceptible individuals S ij in region i is given by The infectious population I ii is recruited at a rate b i S ii and those returning at a rate P j rI ji individuals per year respectively. Infectious are respectively reduced by those who die naturally at the rate μI ii , those who die due to the disease at the rate δ ii I ii , those who progress to the removed class at the rate γ ii I ii and those travelling out the region at the rate P j l ji I ii individuals per year. Together this gives The infectious population I ij is recruited by those acquiring HIV infections in region i at the and from those coming for a visit at the rate l ij I jj individuals per year respectively. They are lost due to those who progress to the removed class at a rate γI ij , return to region i at a rate rI ij , die naturally at the rate μI ij and die due to the disease at the rate δI ij individuals per year respectively. The non-linear ordinary differential equation describing the dynamics of the infectious individuals I ij in region i is given by The removed individuals R ii are respectively recruited by infectious individuals I ii who progress to the removed class at a rate γI ii and those returning from visits from different regions a the rate r∑ j R ji individuals per year. They are decreased due to those who visit other regions at the rate l ji R ii , die due to the disease at the rate δR i and die naturally at a rate μR i individuals per year respectively. The non-linear ordinary differential equation describing the dynamics of the removed individuals R i in region i is given by The removed individuals R ij are respectively recruited by infectious individuals I ij who progress to the removed class at the rate γI ij and those coming for a visit at the rate l ij R jj individuals per year. They are decreased due to those who return to region j at a rate rR ij , die due to the disease at the rate δ ii R ij and die naturally at a rate μR ij individuals per year respectively. The nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing the dynamics of the infectious individuals R ij in region i is given by The model is summarised in Fig 1. To compute the basic reproduction number R 0 of the system of equations from Eqs (1)-(6), we only consider equations of the states that include the infected individuals. These equations are referred to as the infected system [44] . In our model, we have assumed that the susceptible and the removed classes do not contribute to the transmission of HIV. The only class involved in the disease transmission is the infectious class. We therefore write the the system that represents the infectious individuals in a given region and those commuting between these regions as follows: The computation of R 0 by the next-generation operator begins with equations of the system that involve the transmission part describing the production of new infections and then with those involve transition part, describing changes in state among the infected individuals [45] . The transmission part is represented by : : Here S Ã represents the susceptible population at a disease free equilibrium point. Therefore The transition part, describing changes in state, is obtained from : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Here If the sum of the entries in each column is positive, then A is non-singular m-matrix [46, 47] . By Theorem 1, it can be observed that the matrix V is a non-singular m-matrix; hence V −1 exists. The basic reproduction number R 0 as proposed by van den Driesche and Whatmough [45], is the the spectral radius of the matrix G = FV −1 = (F 1 È. . .ÈF n )V −1 . So that R 0 = max{|λ 1 , λ 2 , . . .λ k |, λ 1 , λ 2 , . . .λ k 2 σ(G)} = σ(G). In this case, the basic reproduction numbers can not be written explicitly. However, it can be observed that the basic reproduction number depends on the travel rates, demographic and the epidemic parameters. Therefore, given the set of parameter values and the travel rates, R 0 can be computed numerically. Note that, in the absence of mobility and regions (with β i = β, l ij = 0 and r = 0), the model is reduced to the standard SIR model which has R 0 ¼ b d þ m þ g as the basic reproduction number.
