Strains, media and cultivation conditions. Microbial strains used in this study and growth media are listed in the Supplementary Table S2 and Table S3 , respectively. The propagation of vectors and plasmids was carried out in E. coli DH5α, grown in lysogeny broth medium (LB), supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Yeasts were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Becton Dickinson) or on solid yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (YPD) at 37 °C. For the generation of conidia, P. chrysogenum was cultivated on solid defined minimal medium (MM) at 25 °C, N. crassa on Vogel's agar plates at 37 °C under continuous light and A. fumigatus, A. niger and A. terreus were grown on PDA (Becton Dickinson) at 37 °C. T. rubrum was grown on oatmeal agar. Conidia were harvested in spore buffer (0.9% NaCl (w/v), 0.01% Tween 80 (v/v)). For transformation, 10 8 conidia of P. chrysogenum Δpaf 21 were grown in 200 mL CM for 38 h at 25 °C under continuous shaking (210 rpm). Conidia (1-2 × 10 8 ) of P. chrysogenum Q176 and P. chrysogenum pafB were cultivated in 200 mL MM for 24-144 h at 25 °C under continuous shaking for Northern, Southern and Western blot analyses and PAFB production, respectively. PAFB single ( 15 N) or double ( 15 N/ 13 C) isotope-labelling for NMR analysis was carried out by replacing the nitrogen and/ or carbon source in MM by 0.3% Na 15 NO 3 and/or 1% 13 C-glucose (w/v) (Euriso-Top), respectively. Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from P. chrysogenum Q176 liquid cultures using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Ten µg RNA per lane were loaded on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosiences) and hybridized with digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes (Roche). The primer pair opafB_fw/opafB_rev and opaf1_fw/opaf_rev was used for PCR-based amplification of the pafB and paf specific hybridization probes, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 ).
