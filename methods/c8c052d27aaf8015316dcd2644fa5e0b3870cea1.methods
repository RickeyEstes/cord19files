We built upon a previously published approach 6 using recent estimates of transmission dynamics for COVID-19 to account for critical questions and parameter uncertainties. Reflecting the uncertainty surrounding key parameters for COVID-19, we compared two sets of serial interval parameters: 1) from Nishiura et al 11 with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and 2) from Li et al 12 with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (Table 2) . Briefly, individuals in a stochastic branching model progress through a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) disease process focused on the early stages of epidemic growth. Upon infection, individuals progress through a latent period before onset of infectiousness; during the duration of infectiousness, the relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution. The time of symptom onset is measured as the difference between the incubation and latent periods, with negative values indicating presymptomatic infectiousness. During each hour of infectiousness, an individual can generate new infections following a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter k , with smaller values indicating more variability in infectiousness. Infectiousness while under individual quarantine (before symptom onset) and isolation (after symptom onset) can be reduced by a value between 0, indicating no reduction in the force of infectiousness, or 1, indicating no transmission during that hour. Upon isolation, an individual names a defined proportion of their contacts, who are traced within a defined number of hours and placed under either active monitoring or quarantine. Those under active monitoring are checked with a defined frequency, such as twice daily, and are promptly isolated if found to be symptomatic; however, prior to isolation, there is no reduction in infectiousness. A contact under individual quarantine has infectiousness reduced by a defined factor until onset of symptoms, at which time the contact is isolated. Using published values of the incubation period, the parameters for the maximum duration of infectiousness, time of peak infectiousness, and the time offset between the incubation and 3 .

As described previously, 6 two settings are defined with respect to the feasibility of interventions (Table 1) . A high feasibility setting, presented as the main results, is defined as one where 90% of contacts are traced and are put under either quarantine or active monitoring within half a day on average. Contacts under active monitoring are monitored twice per day on average. A contact under quarantine has infectiousness reduced by 75% until symptoms emerge and prompt isolation. When symptoms emerge in a contact under quarantine or active monitoring, they are isolated in a setting that reduces infectiousness by 90%. Assuming perfect intervention performance is not possible, the high feasibility parameters represent an upper-bound on the expected ability to implement interventions based on contact tracing. A low feasibility setting loosens these assumptions to account for imperfect recall of who may be exposed, delays in identifying or locating contacts, infrequent or untrained monitoring of symptoms, and imperfect isolation resulting in nosocomial or other infections. Unimpeded exponential epidemic growth driven by the basic reproductive number ( ) can be R 0 reduced by individual quarantine or active monitoring as measured by the effective reproductive number and , respectively. We present estimates of and under high and low R IQ R AM R IQ R AM feasibility settings. The difference is the number of secondary cases prevented by R AM âˆ’ R IQ quarantining one infected individual over active monitoring for that individual. If the prevalence of infection among traced contacts subject to quarantine or active monitoring is p, then the number of traced contacts who must be quarantined to prevent one secondary case is . We calculate this quantity from the model under varying assumptions about p. The number of days an individual is under quarantine or active monitoring is measured as the time difference between when an individual is identified via contact tracing and when symptoms prompt isolation -which is immediate for an individual under quarantine and determined by the frequency of monitoring for an individual under active monitoring. We assume individuals under active monitoring or quarantine who are uninfected are followed for a duration of 14 days until clearance, consistent with recent interventions. 13 We calculated the expected percentage of infections that result from presymptomatic infectiousness in the absence of interventions as the sum total of expected secondary cases caused by an individual prior to symptom onset divided by the total force of infection for that individual times 100. This percentage equals 0% when symptom onset precedes infectiousness and equals 100% when the entire duration of infectiousness concludes prior to symptom onset. 4 .
