We analyzed four data sets provided by public health officials in Mexico City. The first time series consists of early reports of suspect influenza infection from all hospitals in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area between 15 March and 30 April (hereafter S) ( Figure 1 ). This data included dates of self-reported onset of symptoms and hospitalization for approximately 3798 suspect cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 variant. While it is likely that these cases ranged from mild to fatal and that treatment ranged from home-based self-care to hospitalization, such individual-level clinical information was not available. However, prior to laboratory testing, it was unknown which of these infections were pandemic (H1N1) 2009 rather than typical influenza A or other respiratory infectious agents. After laboratory results from suspect cases were released on 4 June 2009, we received three additional epidemiological time series provided by the Mexico City Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud del Distrito Federal) from Mexico City (Distrito Federal) from 1 March to 30 May. These mutually exclusive data sets include symptom onset dates for cases where laboratory tests were negative for influenza A virus (hereafter N), cases where laboratory tests were positive for any influenza A strain, excluding pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (hereafter A), and cases with laboratory confirmation for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (hereafter C) (Figure 1 ). Using a network-based statistical approach, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the novel North American A ⁄ H1N1 variant during this period of spread. 11 This method initially estimates the time series of infection dates and the rates of removal through recovery, death or hospitalization, and then incorporates these values into a stochastic, network-based model to estimate the reproduction number. The estimate is refined with every additional day of time series data. For typical unmitigated influenza epidemics, values from this method typically converge to the best estimate of R within a few days, before the acceleration of the outbreak, and remain stable throughout the epidemic period. Therefore, any deviations from the converged value likely reflect external influences including social events and ⁄ or intervention [please refer to the supplementary material for more details]. The estimation method requires information about disease progression, specifically the duration of the incubation (t l ), asymptomatic infectious (t a ) and symptomatic infectious (t s ) periods, as well as the contact patterns underlying disease transmission (specifically the expected number of contacts for each new case). At the time of this study, little was known about these parameters for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak in Mexico City. Empirical data from contact investigations of confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Canadian province of Ontario suggest that the median interval between contact with a confirmed symptomatic case and development of symptoms is 6 days (95% CI 5-7 days). As such, we used a 5-day latent period and 2-day asymptomatic infectious period as a plausible upper bound for time from infection until development of symptomatic disease. Thus, we considered a wide range of possible values estimated for other strains of influenza and large urban centers, respectively ( Table 1 ). The infectious period of a case may be curtailed by hospitalization or selfisolation prior to recovery or death. We therefore directly estimated the distribution of removal rates via either natural causes or intervention by calculating the numbers of days between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization (type II and III triage protocol) or self-isolation (type I triage protocol) for all reported cases. We assumed that unreported asymptomatic or mild cases 12 remained infectious until recovery.
