Patients and clinical data. URTI and CAP patients between January 1 and December 31, 2013 were included in this study. URTI patients were recruited by the national respiratory virus surveillance project. The inclusion criteria for URTIs were as follows: at least 18 years of age, acute fever (body temperature ≥ 38.0 °C), and respiratory symptoms without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. Acute phase sera and nasal and throat swabs were collected from each outpatient when they sought medical care. Inpatients diagnosed with CAP were recruited through the China Severe Acute Respiratory Infections network (China SARInet). CAP was diagnosed following the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society; criteria included age of at least 18 years, with respiratory symptoms, chest roentgenogram, and/or computed tomography confirmed pneumonia 25 . Severe CAP was diagnosed according to published criteria 26 . Pneumonia patients with confirmed non-inflammatory pulmonary disease were excluded. BALF or tracheal aspirate specimens and sera were collected from each inpatient when clinically indicated. BALF or tracheal aspirate specimens were collected as second respiratory samples in patients with mechanical ventilation, followed by serial sputum collection. The clinical information for each enrolled patient was recorded using a standard form. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. All the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, including any relevant details. Written informed consent for scientific assessment was obtained from each patient as part of the clinical treatment contract.
