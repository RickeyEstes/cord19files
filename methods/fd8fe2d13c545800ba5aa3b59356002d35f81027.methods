We compiled laboratory-confirmed influenza virological reports for the influenza A subtypes H3N2, seasonal H1N1, and A(H1N1)pdm09 from recognized sovereign states and other administrative regions (i.e., entities not formally recognized as sovereign states such as New Caledonia) around the world (all referred to as 'countries' from now on). The study period included the 62 weeks from June 11, 2009, to August 10, 2010, coinciding with the official start and end date of the pandemic period, as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Our data sources included virological influenza data obtained by WHO in FluNet 11 as well as regional and national laboratory surveillance Web sites (e.g., http://www.euroflu.org, http://www.nicd.ac.za/). We analyzed influenza virological data from countries that reported laboratory-confirmed influenza results for ! 70% of weeks in the study period and that reported >120 positive A(H1N1) pdm09 samples during the study period. We obtained 2010 World Population Projections and population density by country. 12 In addition, we categorized countries by income groups according to World Bank classifications (high income, upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income) 13 to identify whether income groups were equally represented in our study (trend test). We examined each country's influenza virological data by calculating the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens identified each week, out of all A(H1N1)pdm09positive samples tested during the study period (weekly proportion). We then graphed the weekly proportions for each country to help us visualize the countries' influenza activity. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to create smoothed curves of influenza activity for each country (Figure 1 ). Using the smoothed data, we determined the following parameters of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity for each country: week of first detection of the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens detected during the week of highest activity (peak activity), number of weeks from first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection until the week of peak activity (time to peak), number of weeks when 90% of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens were detected (i.e., time encompassing the 5th and 95th percentiles of cumulative A(H1N1)pdm09 weekly proportion), and number of waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity during the study period. We defined a wave as the time period including an increase and subsequent decrease in A (H1N1)pdm09 activity and including a peak week of activity. A peak week was defined as a week during which the LOESSsmoothed proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was higher than the week immediately preceding it and immediately following it, and when the weekly proportion was at least 1% higher than in the troughs on either side. For example, Costa Rica showed only one wave of pandemic activity ( Figure 1 ); the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens identified during the peak week (week 27) was 6Á7%, and it was 0Á5% during the trough week that followed (week 43). The smaller increases observed later in the study period did not meet the peak definition. This method helped us to avoid counting spurious fluctuations as peaks and was selected after evaluating a range of thresholds. Countries were then classified into climatic regions by using their central latitude (i.e., the latitude at the center of the country): Northern and Southern temperate (central latitude ! |30°|), subtropical (central latitude |23Á5-29Á9| and tropical (central latitude |23Á4°|). 14 We also classified countries into two other categories: those where A(H1N1) pdm09 was first detected during the start of the country's historical influenza season and those where A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected at any other time. The start of the historical influenza season was defined as the time encompassing the 6 weeks before the start of the influenza season and the first half of the season. The timing of country's historical influenza season (i.e., typical month of start and end of the season) was only known for a subgroup of countries (17 in temperate regions and 22 in tropical-subtropical regions) based on data from a prior study. 15 In the case of China, data from mainland temperate and subtropical regions, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong SAR, were analyzed separately. We quantified the number of weeks between initial detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 in Mexico and the United States (third week in April 2009) and the first report of A (H1N1)pdm09 in every country. We then calculated the median number of weeks of first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection for each continent. We compared the parameters of A (H1N1)pdm09 activity described above (peak activity, time to peak, number of weeks between the 5 and 95th percentiles of cumulative A(H1N1)pdm09 weekly proportion, and number of waves) between countries in temperate and tropical-subtropical climatic regions. We also compared the same parameters of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity between countries where A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected during the start of countries' historical influenza season and those where A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced at any other time of the year. This was made for the subgroup of 39 countries for which we had data on the timing of the historical influenza season, as described above. In addition, we explored whether there was a correlation between the following variables: peak activity and the proportion of cases within the 12-week period around the peak; latitude and peak activity; latitude and number of weeks from detection of A(H1N1)pdm09 to countries' peak week; latitude and the proportion of total A(H1N1)pdm09positive specimens out of total influenza A-positive specimens during the pandemic. Lastly, we calculated the minimum doubling time of A(H1N1)pdm09 in each country using the following formula: doubling time = ln(2)/ln (weekly proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09/proportion in the previous week). We compared the mean doubling time in Northern Hemisphere temperate, Southern Hemisphere temperate, and tropical-subtropical countries. We used SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to conduct Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare continuous data, chi-square tests to compare categorical data, Spearman's test to identify correlations, and Cochran-Armitage test to identify trends.
