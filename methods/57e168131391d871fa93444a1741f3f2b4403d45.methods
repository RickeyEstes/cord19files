Viruses PEDV NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−) strains which belong to classical clade (G1) were propagated in Vero-KY5 (Vero) cells. Trypsin was not used to culture PEDV in Vero cells. The NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 strains were kindly provided by the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan, and the Fukuoka Chuo Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Fukuoka, Japan, respectively. The Vero cells were also provided by the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan. Briefly, Vero cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan), 0.3% (w/v) tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Viruses were propagated in Vero cells cultured in EMEM with 2% FBS and 0.3% TPB at 37°C. The titter of the PEDV NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−) strains were 2.8 × 10 6 TCID 50 /ml and 2 × 10 4 TCID 50 /ml, respectively. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus -TGEV (vaccine strain h-5; Nisseiken, Tokyo, Japan) was propagated in Vero cells; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus -PRRSV (live PRRS vaccine -Ingelvac PRRS® MLV-Boehringer Ingelheim company); Japanese Encephalitis virus -JEV and Getal virus -GV (live vaccine -Kyoto Biken company, Kyoto, Japan).
