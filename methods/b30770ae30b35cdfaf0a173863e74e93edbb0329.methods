Three patients admitted to a university hospital general intensive care unit with radiographically confirmed severe pneumonia underwent bronchoscopy and lavage, with the samples being analysed by both conventional microscopy and culture and nucleic acid extraction. The nucleic extract was then placed on a TAC able to detect 48 microbial genes using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), directed towards a range of established respiratory pathogens. Results are available with a time to threshold value which gives an indication of the abundance of that gene in the sample. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to a 6-bed medical unit of our ICU from 01/04/2013 to 30/11/2013. From 220 admitted patients, 123 were considered critically ill since they received tight glycaemic control. The other patients were excluded from the analysis since they stayed for less than 24 hrs in the ICU, mostly for monitoring purposes. Observational prospective study, conducted in eleven Portuguese ICUs of nine general hospitals. Patients with 18 years of age or older were eligible if they were ventilated and had a length of stay (LOS) in ICU greater than 7 days. Demographic data, along with the energetic intake in the first 7 to 10 days and type of nutritional support used were collected from the selected patients. Results 130 patients were enrolled, 63.8 % were male, the median age -64 ± 16 (19Ð91), median BMI Ð 27.9 ± 5.9 (18.8Ð49), ICU LOS Ð 15.4 ± 6,1 days, mortality rate of 26.9 % (35). 70 % of patients were admitted for medical reasons, 31.5 % had normal weight, and the remaining patients were either overweight or obese. Energy intake in the first 10 days was 12.4 ± 6.6 Kcal/Kg/day (0Ð34.1); excluding the first 3 days it rose to 15.6 ± 7.4Kcal/Kg/day (0Ð34.1). Nutritional support was evaluated over a period of 1,223 days in which 80 % of the days patients received nutritional support, 66 % by enteral route and 14 % by parenteral route. Prospective observational study was conducted during 6 months in the medical ICU in Songklanakarind hospital. Demographic data and clinical outcomes, including 28-days mortality, ventilator days, ICU and hospital length of stay, were collected. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D was measured within 24 hours after ICU admission. The 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/ml is generally defined as a deficiency state. The correlation of 25(OH)D status on admission and clinical outcomes were then analyzed with chi-square test or student T-test. The p-value less than 0.05 defined as clinically significant. We collected clinical data on measured 25(OH)D levels in adult medical patients upon hospital admission and followed them for 30 days. Regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, comorbidities and  We included RCTs enrolling adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery, which evaluated oral/enteral and parenteral n-3 PUFA compared to a placebo and reported clinically important outcomes. According to eligibility criteria, original studies were abstracted in duplicate. Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were incidence of POAF, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and hospital LOS. Hypothesis-generating subgroup analysis was performed to identify potentially more beneficial treatment strategies. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on 30 patients, hospitalized in our ICU for non-surgery causes. We dosed serotonin levels on admission day, at 7 and at 14 days. Patients with psychiatric disorders and malignancies were excluded as those who were in treatment with drugs that interfere with the metabolism of serotonin. Selected patients were randomly assigned either to receive placebo treatment (first group, N = 30) or to received 300 mg of 5hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (second group, N = 30). Psychiatric evaluation was performed using the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale. We included RCTs that evaluated clinical outcomes associated with intravenous selenium as single or combined strategy in parenterally or enterally fed patients. Overall mortality was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were infections, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and ventilator days. Subgroup analyses were done to elucidate the effects of selenium on mortality and infections (Table 41) . Results 21 trials met our inclusion criteria (n = 4129). When the results of the 20 trials reporting mortality were aggregated, no statistically significant reduction in mortality was found (RR 0.99, 95 %, CI 0.99, 1.08, P = 0.75, I2 = 0 %). In addition, there was no significant effect of parenteral selenium on infections (P = 0.15). There was no effect of IV selenium therapy on ICU LOS, hospital LOS, and ventilator days. Result of subgroup analysis is found in Table 41 . We included RCTs enrolling critically ill adults, which evaluated probiotics compared to a placebo and reported clinically important outcomes. According to eligibility criteria, original studies were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers. Overall infections was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were overall mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), diarrhea, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS. The data from 1,000,000 National Health Insurance beneficiaries were utilized. The study cohort consisted of 42,581 diabetic patients and 672,750 unexposed subjects. Among patients with diabetes, 1082 have been admitted with hyperglycemic crisis episodes. All adult beneficiaries were followed from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2012 to evaluate if pancreatic cancer was diagnosed. Cox regression models were applied to compare the hazards adjusted for potential confounders. Single-center prospective observational study. All patients admitted to 2 ICUs between January and April of 2014 for more than five days, were enrolled. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were collected at baseline. All blood glucose measurements during the first 5 days were recorded. Three insulin protocols were used, two using subcutaneous actrapid insulin depending if the patient is diabetic (DP) or not (NDP), and an intensive protocol (IP) using IV insulin depending solely on the glycemic value using a target value of 180 mg/dL. A glucose value of 70 mg/dL or less was considered moderate hypoglycemia and 40 mg/dL or less as severe hypoglycemia. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. were under 70 mg/dL and 5/1720 (0,29 %) were under 40 mg/dL. Depending on insulin protocol, the incidence of moderate hypoglycemia was 2,88 % in DP, 0,98 % in NDP and 0,96 % in IP; and in severe hypoglycemia was 0,89 % in DP, 0,25 % in NDP and 0,21 % in IP. One hundred and forty nine patients with glucose intolerance were analyzed during 1 week after ICU admission. Studied items were, 1) maximum value of SOFA score(SOFAmax), 2)mean of BG(BGm) and 3)standard deviation of BG(BGsd). BG was measured basically every 6 hours and insulin was used when BG was above 140 mg/dL. Correlation between SOFAmax and BG(BGm, BGsd) was analyzed according to the SOFAmax levels. Conclusions 1)BG control to hyperglycemia is one of the measures which bring the reduction of BG variability. 2)BG targets were considered to be obtained by the analysis of two-dimensional relationship between severity of the diseases and BG. 3)There is a possibility that strict BG control is more effective to severer(moderate to severe) patients, considering the results indicating higher correlation coefficient (R) in severer patients. 4)Glucose administration for increasing BG and BG variability might bring beneficial effect not only for hypoglycemic patients but also for a part of normoglycemic patients, judging from BG targets listed above. 5)Low BG variability in a part of severe patients may be related to lower variability of physiologic activity. 6)Analysis of the relationship between severity of the diseases and BG based on the fine BG control, including by the use of artificial pancreas, was considered to link to better BG control and outcomes. All eligible participants admitted Critical care unit which required constant rate of continuous RI infusion per standard MICU insulin infusion protocol for 24 consecutive hours were switched to receive single dose of glargine insulin subcutaneously by 100 % of their total daily insulin requirement calculated by cumulative dose of RI requirement in the previous 24 hours. The continuous insulin infusion was discontinued 2 hours after the transition. BG were monitored every 2 hours for the following 24 hours or until the study termination or discontinuation Prospective observational study conducted in eleven ICUs in nine Portuguese hospitals for six months. Included participants were patients who were expected to have a length of stay (LOS) in the ICU of 7 days or more. Data on demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were collected at baseline. All patients were assigned a target glucose of 180 mg/dL or less. All blood glucose measurements during the first 7 days were recorded. A glucose value of <40 mg/dL was considered as severe hypoglycemia. Results 155 patients were included, where 60.6 % were men, with an average age of 62. ± 17, ICU LOS was 15.2 ± 6.4 days and mortality rate was 25.  A total of thirty-one (31) patients who admitted to our medical ICU of tertiary care university hospital with DKA in last thirty (30) months was included in the study retrospectively. Hyperlactatemia was defined as serum lactate >2.5 mmol/L. The ICNARC and MINAP databases were interrogated to identify numbers for: HAC activation pPCI (primary percutaneous coronary intervention) Admissions to Level 3 Intensive Care. We compared data from the five months following the merger (May -September 2015) with the same months in 2014. High dependency and coronary care admissions were excluded. The in-unit mortality and length of stay were examined. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normal distribution data. Ethics approval was sought but deemed not necessary. Eighteen patients who were admitted to the ICU after resuscitation in the general medicine ward were studied. Patients were classified as gfair prognosis h (FP-group: 12 persons) if the patient survived more than 28 days or gpoor prognosis h (PP-group: 6 persons) if the patient died within 28 days. Blood samples were drawn for measuring blood chemistry and sepsis-related biomarkers (procalcitonin, presepsin, endotoxin activity assay) immediately after ICU admission. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test and Chi square test or Fisher's test. A value of p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. From September 2014 to June 2015, six secondary schools were included in the study. Two of them received a one-hour BLS session conducted by an intensivist assisted by 3 medical students. Sessions contained: a theoretical lecture and a practical simulation-based training using low-fidelity manikins (MiniAnnePlus®, Laerdal). Between 2 and 3 months later, both trained and non-trained students were assessed using a serious game reproducing real-life cardiac arrest situation (3D real-time simulation software, Stayingalive®, ILUMENS-Dassault system). Primary outcome was the time spent to complete the serious game (from onset of cardiac arrest to shock delivery and recovery). Secondary outcomes included knowledge of emergency call, hand placement during chest compressions and electrodes placement of automated external defibrillator. Adults with no CPR experience were recruited in a public movie center and among bachelor nursing students in Liège district. Volunteers were randomly assigned either to «T-CPR» or to «no T-CPR» and were submitted to a 6 minutes infant OHCA scenario. CPR performance data were extracted from video and infant manikin using Laerdal Simpad® SkillReporter. T-CPR increased significantly CPR attempts (74.1 % of U-NG group performed chest compressions, compared to 100 % of other groups; p = 0,0007) and overall CPR performance, but median time to first chest compression was longer in guided groups (p < 0,0001). The proportion of volunteers who managed to deliver ventilation during CPR was higher (p < 0,0001) in guided groups (81,2 % for U-G group and 83,3 % for T-G group) than in unguided groups (0 % for U-NG group and 46,1 % for T-NG group). While the tidal volume delivered was too high for each group, the fraction of time required to give ventilations was significant higher for guided groups. Conclusions T-CPR instructions have the potential to increase the number and the performance of bystander CPR in trained or untrained volunteers (3). Mouth to mouth ventilations was responsible for major interruptions in chest compressions. Moreover, we identified an overall tendency to hyperventilation. shows the predicted survival rates of initial CPR (staff v public). Ventricular fibrillation was induced in anesthetized pigs (dantrolene, n = 14 and amiodarone, n = 14 or saline, n = 10). After 8 min of untreated VF, chest compressions and ventilation were started and one of the drugs (amiodarone 5 mg kg -1, dantrolene 2.5 mg kg -1 or saline (sham)) was applied in a blinded fashion. After 4 min of CPR without epinephrine or other drugs, defibrillation with 200 J was performed. Standardized resuscitation including mechanical cpr and defibrillation according to protocol was applied in all animals. ROSC rates and cardiovascular as well as blood gas analysis and cerebral oximetry and perfusion measurements were calculated during the experiments. We reviewed database of post arrest patients undergoing TH who survived to discharge with consciousness (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance: CPC 1-3) in our hospital from 2006 to 2014. All hospital survivors were evaluated life or death status and death date on January 31st , 2015 by checking death certificates from national registry system. We contacted the survivors or their relatives by phone or mail and scheduled a follow-up visit to evaluate their ability. The patients who were unable to visit were assessed the functional disability by phone interview or using recorded follow-up data. The functional neurological outcome was scored on a disability rating scale. [1] This scale consisted of 1) arousability awareness and responsivity, 2) cognitive ability for self-care activities, 3) dependence on others and 4) psychosocial adaptability. The level of disability was defined as the followings: 0none; 1mild; 2 to 3.5-partial; 4 to 6moderate; 7 to 11moderately severe; 12 to 16severe; 17 to 21extremely severe; 22 to 24vegetative state and 25 to 29extreme vegetative state. In addition, survival rates at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after discharge were analyzed. Prospective cohort study at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, between September 8, 2010, and January 13, 2014. Resuscitated comatose OHCA patients admitted to an intensive care unit were included. Patients were treated according to a standardized treatment protocol including therapeutic hypothermia to 33°C for 24 hours. CKD and AKI were classified according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Patients with previously known CKD were excluded from further detailed analyses. Main outcomes were six-months mortality and good neurological outcome defined as Cerebral Performance Category 1-2. [1, 2] . Adoption of this approach will increase ICU admission at the regional PPCI centers. In this observational cohort study we analysed the ICU service dependency of the PPCI patients following OHCA. All adult patients admitted to our intensive care unit between April 2014 and March 2015 were analysed. Patients admitted from the PPCI pathway following OHCA were compared with all other unplanned admissions during the study period. Data regarding outcome and dependency was collected from the ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit Research Council, UK) database. Paired t-test & Chi square test were performed to estimate statistical significance levels. All consecutive patients who were suffering from OHCA and who were then transported to institutions participating in this registry were prospectively recorded in July 2012 to December 2013. Criteria for inclusion of this study were a witnessed cardiac arrest, age greater than 17 years, presumed cardiac origin of the arrest, and successful ROSC. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis was used to develop the best prediction model. The dependent variables were favorable outcome (cerebral-performance category: CPC 1-2) and poor outcome (CPC 3-5) at 1 month after the event. The explanatory variables were used concerning patient characteristics and resuscitation. This study was a prospective observational study conducted at a tertiary emergency medical care center in Japan. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) through invasive arterial pressure monitoring, and rSO2 were measured at every 3 minutes during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation of OHCA patients, and the relationships between absolute values in the measurements were compared using the two types of coefficient of correlation, within and between patients in order to perform the statistical analysis considering repeated measurement taken from a single patient. Prospective cohort study in patients monitored with continuous EEG after cardiac arrest in two Dutch ICUs. Twice a day a very strict stimulus protocol including five stimulus types (in this order: clapping, yelling patients name, passive eye opening, nasal tickle and sternal rub) was executed. Each stimulus was applied 3 times for 5 s with an interval of 30s. Each stimulus response was individually scored reactive, non-reactive, doubtful or unscorable (e.g. too much noise) by three independent, blinded raters (JH, MvP, MT-C). Reactivity was defined as a change in the amplitude or frequency in the EEG upon stimulation, excluding muscle artifacts. Iso-electric EEGs were excluded beforehand. Stimulus responses on which two out of three raters agreed were included in the analysis. We prospectively included all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted in our intensive care unit (ICU) from 2011 to 2014. They were submitted to target temperature management (34°C) for 24 hours. Outcome was assessed according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at ICU discharge. CPC 1 to 3 was considered as good outcome and CPC 4 to 5 as poor outcome. Recent guideline suggest to sample NSE at 72 hours after cardiac arrest. Results 132 patients were admitted from 2011 to 2014. 54 patients presented good outcome while 78 patients presented poor outcome according to CPC. The NSE serum concentration was sampled at the 3rd days after cardiac arrest. In the first group NSE value was 22.3 mcg/l. In the second group NSE value was 74,5 mcg/l. Nevertheless 8 patients presented poor outcome and NSE serum concentration < 40 mcg/l and 3 patients presented good outcome and NSE > 60 mcg/l (Fig. 83) . We observed great variability of NSE value in patients with poor outcome (Fig. 84) . Conclusions NSE could be an important biomarker of poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Further investigation is necessary to clarify timing for sample and cut off. Cases were identified retrospectively from the Scottish national ICU audit database. All patients with a diagnosis of cardiac or respiratory arrest were selected for full case note review. Baseline survey from May-November 2014 yielded 21 cases of which 3 sets of notes were unobtainable. Data collected included documented target temperature (TT), use of active cooling, hourly temperature data over the first 24 hours in ICU, and eventual outcome. A new TTM strategy, based on the TTM study protocol, was then introduced in February 2015. This was presented at the local ICU meeting and copies made available at each bed space for staff to refer to. Subsequently, all cases from March-September 2015 were identified by the same method and the same data set collected, totalling 20 cases of which 1 set of notes was unobtainable. We conducted a retrospective review of 54 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from out of hospital cardiac arrest, collecting data from our electronic medical records system 'Metavision' and analysed using SPSS v22.0. Ethics approval was obtained. We performed a retrospective cohort study of OHCA patients brought to the emergency room at St. Luke fs International Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, who underwent TTM between January 2006 and July 2015. Primary outcome was days to weaning from admission to the intensive care unit. Using the electronic medical record, we collected patient characteristics, resuscitation conditions, and examination data at admission. After characterizing weaning success using descriptive statistics, the relationship between ventilator weaning during hospitalization and resuscitation conditions were assessed with Cox regression. Infarction in the left ventricle was examine by Massoni's trichrome staining. Neuronal degeneration (damage/death) was examined for 56 days after MI using cresyl violet (CV) and Fluoro-Jade B (F-J B) histofluorescence staining. Changes in C-Fos immunoreactivity were examined by immunohistochemistry for c-Fos. We retrospectively investigated 218 patient between 11.2012 and 11. 2014. They were admitted in ICU and diagnosed as (AIS) according to the TOAST classification. They were 8.51 % of total 2561 patients hospitalized in the ICU in the same period. Brain CT or MRI were used on admission. The severity of neurological deficit were scoring based on NIHSS. The functional condition of patients was assessed on discharge by modified Rankin scale (mRS). Troponin I was monitored on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day. Inclusion criteria were age over 18,AIS less than 24 hours, CT/MRT on admission and Troponin I on 1st, 3rd and 5th day. Exclusion criteria were SAH or ICH renal failure, Acute coronary syndrome, Acute PE. The animals were randomly assigned to 4 groups: 1) (N + sham)group was given sham-operation with normothermia (N); 2) (N + ischemia)-group was given 5 min-transient ischemia with N; 3) (H + sham)-group was given sham-operation with H; 4) (H + ischemia)group was given 5 min-transient cerebral ischemia with H. H (39 ¡¾ 0.5¨¬C) was induced by subjecting the animals to a heating pad for 30 min before and during the operation. Animals were randomly assigned to sham-, ischemia-, sham plus (+) RIPoC-and ischemia + RIPoC-groups. RIPoC was induced by three cycles of 5 min and 10 min occlusion-reperfusion of both femoral arteries at predetermined points in time ( 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after transient cerebral ischemia). CV staining, F-J B histofluorescence staining and NeuN immunohistochemistry were carried out to examine neuroprotection in the RIPoC-mediated hippocampus 5 days after ischemia-reperfusion. Twenty patients with septic shock and brain dysfunction symptoms (acute alterations in mental status, delirium, coma, seizures and focal neurological deficits) [median age 54 years (26 to 65), APACHE II: 21 (15 to 29), SOFA: 8(1 to 15)] underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including gradient echo T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2-weighted and diffusion isotropic images, and mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient. MRI findings were classified based on lesion types and localizations. Blood was withdrawn simultaneously for biomarker analysis. Neurological recovery of all patients were evaluated using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) during discharge. This was a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Intensive Care-Toxicology Unit of the Clinical Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, that included all patients admitted for acute VPA poisoning (VPA >150 μg/l), in 2014. The patients were randomly allocated in 2 groups to receive standard therapy or 1800 mg of L-carnitine/ day together with standard therapy for 3 days. Plasma levels of valproic acid and ammonemia were determined every six hours. Data was statistically analyzed and the results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Prospective cohort study in comatose ICU patients with continuous EEG background patterns in two Dutch ICUs. Reactivity to auditory, visual and sensory stimuli was tested following a strict protocol. Visual analysis was regarded as the gold standard. Reactivity was defined as a change in amplitude or frequency in the EEG after stimulation, excluding muscle activity. Stimulus responses were scored by three independent experts (JH, MvP, MT-C), responses on which all three experts agreed were used. Data was separated in an independent training and validation set. Spectral characteristics of the EEG before and after each stimulus were compared. These were determined by both parametric and non-parametric methods. Epochs of 2, 5 and 10 seconds before and after the start of the stimulus were analyzed and averaged over 1, 3, 5 and 7 channel. We included adult patients with spontaneous ICH, treated in Finnish intensive care units (ICU) in 2003-2012 from a nationwide ICU database. Logistic regression was used to customize APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA for six-month mortality prediction. We created a reference model based on age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for comparison. We used a temporal split-sample technique for internal validation. We tested model performance by assessing discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow &#264; and GiViTI calibration tests). Our search strategy included Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, international guidelines and reference searches as well as the authors' collection on the subject.  This is a multi-centre retrospective cohort study conducted at four Canadian academic tertiary care centres. Population: All adult aSAH patients admitted to the study hospitals from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. Patients were identified from hospital administrative discharge records and existing local SAH databases. The diagnosis was confirmed by presence of blood in the subarachnoid space (on either imaging or lumbar puncture) due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm (as demonstrated on any of angiography, neuro-imaging or autopsy). Data Collection: Trained abstractors collected demographic data, aSAH characteristics, daily hemoglobin concentrations and nadir hemoglobin, other major aSAH co-interventions, and outcomes using a pre-tested case report form in reference to a standardized operations manual.  We retrospectively reviewed data from consecutive SAH patients (Jan 1, 2004 -Jan 1, 2015) and recorded demographics, neurological examination, radiological and transcranial Doppler findings, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, and mortality. NLR values were calculated from admission to the 5th hospital day. Medians were compared between groups using Mann Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis using stepwise backward method was generated to predict the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm and DCI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the accuracy of NLR to predict complications. We retrospectively analyzed data from a observational trial on aSAH. All patients with aSAH admitted to our ICU were included. Demographic, clinical, radiological and microbiological data were recorded. Infections were diagnosed according to current guidelines. Patients who died within 72 hours from admission were excluded from analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism. Significance was set at a p value < = 0.05. Results 159 patients were included: median age was 59 years old, 30 % was male. Aneurysm was located in anterior circulation in 139 patients and secured through coiling in 76 %. 74 patients (47 %) experienced 98 septic episodes: incidence was low (31 %) in less severe (World Federation of Neurosurgeons grade (WFNS) 1 to 3) and higher in more severe aSAH (WFNS 4-5 78 %, p < 0.001). Diagnosis was made at 4 ± 1 days from admission. VAP (79 %) and urinary tract infections (10 %) were the most prevalent infection. 1 patients had septic shock. Most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounting for 37 % of infections, while multidrug resistant bacteria were less than 5 %. ICU and hospital LOS were significantly higher in septic compared to non-septic patients, independently of WFNS category, as shown in Fig. 88 . Conclusions ICU-acquired infections are common especially in severe aSAH patients, predominantly VAP caused by Gram negative bacteria. Infections cause longer ICU and hospital LOS. Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of comatose patients after SAH monitored with CMD as part of standard care. variables were within normal ranges and did not differ between the two conditions. We conducted a prospective observational study during a year period (November 2014 to October 2015) with patients who had undergone elective craniotomy for brain surgery admitted postoperatively to ICU or IMCU of a tertiary 750-bed hospital. Main variables analyzed included demographic, comorbidities, ASA, APACHE II score, duration of anesthesia and surgery, surgical procedure and diagnosis, ICU and IMCU length of stay. Study outcomes were mortality, readmissions to ICU and re-operation rates. This retrospective chart review included adult patients with a diagnosis of severe TBI who had at least one LEV level drawn during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission from January 2010 to October 2015. Patients were evaluated for the following outcomes: LEV trough levels (drawn at steady state), LEV dosing regimen, % of patients reaching LEV trough goal, LEV duration of therapy, diagnosis of seizure during hospital admission, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality. The MREC for Scotland approved the use of BrainIT data for scientific purposes in 2002, and need for informed consent was waived. We first cleaned the database, which left 155 patients. These patients were then clustered based on 24-hour trajectories of CPP, ICP, HR, SaO2, and mean BP. To do this, we applied the general linear mixed model, a form of cluster analysis [2] , to the data to create three algorithms: Algorithm 1 clustered patients on minute-by-minute physiological data, Algorithm 2 used the same data with six outlying patients removed, and Algorithm 3 used hour-by-hour data, with the same six outlying patients removed as in Algorithm 2. Each algorithm's resulting clusters were paired to admissions data such as first GCS and outcome data as measured by eGOS. We used four electrode BI catheter connected to multi-frequency bioimpedance measurement device (Smartimplant Ltd.) (2) . BI measurement provided continuously from frequencies 100 Hz to 100 Khz. All data have been recorded simultaneously with ICP and arterial pressure (AP) values. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study using data from the National Trauma Registry of Canada. All patients admitted with a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury to one of the 114 participating centers from 2005 to 2013 were eligible. The registry contains information on age, gender, trauma severity, discharge status and discharge disposition. Data from the Discharge Abstract Database containing information on blood products, comorbidities, interventions and complications were linked to NTR observations. We conducted multivariate robust Poisson regression with a random effect at the center level. Missing data were handled through multiple imputation techniques. We conducted a cohort study of patients with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury admitted to the ICU of a level I trauma center (Halifax). Data related to pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels and red blood cells were collected. The association between hemoglobin level, red blood cell transfusion and mortality was evaluated using a robust Poisson model. We also constructed proportional hazard models with time-dependant variables (hemoglobin and transfusion) to evaluate survival. Neurological and non-neurological trauma complications as well as length of stay (LOS) in ICU or hospital were considered as secondary outcomes. We retrospectively assessed the hospital records of every patient with PGWH admitted to the ICU from October 1st, 2014 to September 30th, 2015. Exploratory analysis of clinical data, image results, treatment, complication and outcomes was made. The primary end point was the modified Rankin scale at hospital discharge. In this large multi-national, prospective, observational study from Switzerland, France and the United States [1] , we combined two ProADM cut-off values with a five-level ED risk assessment tool (Manchester Triage System, MTS) to further risk-stratify medical ED patients [2] .  We developed and implemented a six-month point-of-care simulation programme within the Royal Cornwall Hospital Emergency Department covering critical illness, paediatric, and major trauma presentations. A live clinically trained actor, rather than a high-fidelity mannequin, acted as the patient in suitable weekly simulations. A curriculum map was designed for each session detailing specific curriculum topics covered. Feedback was collected from 12 Emergency Medicine doctors using visual analogue scale questionnaires. The simulation team developed three simulation scenarios: Alarming Ventilator; Massive Haemorrhage; and Tracheostomy Emergency. Each scenario has learning points addressing both clinical and nontechnical skills and involves a structured debrief following the scenario. The initial program objective was to deliver a total of 15 simulations, including junior medical and nursing staff within each scenario. We developed the monitor system to track patient Ls flow and to show it in real time on a big display at ED in such a way of logistics system, which is connected with electronic health record (EHR). It can show time components such as door to intervention time. We named it Time Tracking Monitor (TTM) at ED. Results Our TTM system had three big appeals. First, it showed time data per examination or per intervention in real time. It helped to share patient Ls flow within medical staff. It would prevent to mistake. Second, this time data was being compared with a world standard time period based quality indicators such as door to balloon time in real time. It was also alerted if that time ran past the time limit. Moreover, we can analyze the relationship between diseases and time data because TTM has capability as database. Data analysis is used quality comparison among patients L individuals, within a hospital setting, among hospitals. Literature searches were carried out by the authors using Medline 1946-2015, Google Scholar, Cochrane Collection and international guidelines as well as reference searches. Our search converged on the role of comprehensive echocardiography in evaluation of syncope in parallel to utility of focused echocardiography in detecting structural cardiac disease. Three swine were consecutively anaesthetised using total intravenous anaesthesia and remained self-ventilating without endotracheal intubation at all times. A single 14G cannula (BD Venflon) was inserted sequentially into the second intercostal space of each hemithorax under US guidance. Real-time US was used to identify the development of pneumothorax. Lung-point shift was used to track pneumothorax expansion within pre-mapped numeric chest wall segments. In the event of respiratory distress, air was aspirated through the cannula. We adopted a novel technique for technical skill training, used initially for difficult airway training [4] , to train anaesthetic and ICU staff for EZ-IO® access. A theatre trolley is converted into a mobile training trolley with EZ-IO® training devices, tea and cakes. The trolley is operated by two anaesthetists and visits theatres during normal working hours: one anaesthetist takes over the care of a stable patient in theatre while the second delivers a 15 minute training session in the anaesthetic room to the listed anaesthetist and nurse/operating department practitioner (ODP). Training includes EZ-IO® device locations, all practical aspects of their use, and is followed by tea, cake and a questionnaire. Case report Results A 21-year-old male with a history of depression was admitted to our hospital emergency department two hours after the voluntary ingestion of a non-quantified amount of barium chloride, which the patient had procured and purchased online as a means for a suicide attempt. The clinical picture consisted of vomiting, diarrhea, and progressive generalized muscle weakness requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, with subsequent ICU admission. Severe hypokalemia was documented (minimum K+ 1.2 mmol/L), complicated by frequent ventricular premature beats with prolonged QT interval (corrected value was 640 ms). Magnesium sulfate and a K+ infusion were administered, but serum K+ remained low. Serum K+ was then 2.2 mmol/L and barium levels were 0.04 mmol/L (toxic range). Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was started. This resulted in a rapid decrease in barium levels and normalization of serum K+. Clinical improvement ensued with the correction of hypokalemia and restored muscular function, allowing spontaneous ventilation and extubation 6 hours later. Barium was persistently undetectable from 12 hours after the beginning of CVVHDF (<0.006 mmol/L). The patient was later transferred to the Psychiatry department, with an uneventful hospital stay. This is a retrospective review of patients with a cycling-related injury presenting to Saint Vincent¡¯s University Hospital (SVUH) from 1st of January to 31st of December 2014. Subjects were identified by interrogating the Maxims Clinical© patient information system in use at the ED. Triage records were searched for the keywords; "bike", "cycling", "cyclist", "pushbike", "bicycle". SVUH participates in the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) and data was extracted from this database, e.g. the injury severity score (ISS) for patients who fulfilled the criteria for TARN. This study a cross-sectional study. A semi-structured questionnaire was distributed to the nurses in the critical care areas in tertiary care hospital. These nurses have direct contact with patient care in clinical settings and must provide pain assessment and management to their patients. Measurement investigated like the demographic data, work ranking, level of education and years of experience. As well their actual level of knowledge and practice and the perceived barriers about pain assessment and management during their clinical work.  This prospective observational cohort study included 50 mechanically ventilated mixed ICU patients who were unable to report pain. The study was conducted in a tertiary ICU in a university hospital in Turkey. After obtaining permission from the author of the original study (1), CPOT was translated into Turkish and language validity was performed according to the reports obtained from 10 senior intensivists. Pain was assessed before and during non-painful and painful routine care procedures (touching with wet towel and suctioning respectively) using the CPOT and the BPS performed by a resident and an intensivist concomitantly. Tests reliability, interrater reliability, and validity of the CPOT and the BPS were evaluated. Guidelines were utilised to formulate audit criteria and standards. A proforma was developed for use in 50 adult patient cases who were mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit over a 3 month period between August and October 2015. All data were coded and entered into a spreadsheet for analysis. Initial recommendations for change have been made. Results 90 % of patient cases had a pain assessment documented within 6 hours of admission, scored utilising the VAS. 73 % of initial pain assessments were scored by nursing staff, with self-reporting occurring in the remaining 27 %. When pain scores were subsequently evaluated over a following 24 hour period, the mean number of scores documented was n = 5. When sedation scores were evaluated utilising the RASS over the same 24 hour period, the mean number of scores documented was n = 6 (ranging from -5 to +2). Of note, 60 % of patients did not have a formal sedation hold, with 66 % having no reason for this documented. In addition, only 46 % of patients had a goal RASS documented on the daily ward round, and of these 39 % met their target RASS. A before-after study at the medical ICU (total of 8 beds) of the university hospital was conducted on mechanical ventilated patients receiving sedative agents. Baseline characteristics, active problems and APACHE II were used as the criteria to match the patients between two groups, the retrospective group (no pharmacist interventions) and the prospective group (pharmacist interventions). Medical chart reviews were performed and data were collected over a 2-year period in the retrospective group. In the prospective group, pharmacists made interventions with the team to select sedative agents to individual patients based on underlying disease, active problems, renal and hepatic function, and causes of patient agitation. All notes from patients undergoing sedation in our ED between 1/1/14 and 30/4/14 were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of AE, as well as evidence of adverse events where not formally recorded. After implementation of a new sedation proforma incorporating the SIVA tool [1] , the data collection process was repeated retrospectively between 1/10/14 and 30/1/15. Prospective cohort study was conducted in the mixed ICU during July 2014 -July 2015. AWS patients were assigned in 2 groups: group D (dexmedetomidine) and group C (Control). In group D dexmedetomidine infusion at dose 0.  Over a 6-year period we retrospectively identified patients who received ketamine for hypoxic respiratory failure after admission to critical care. Ketamine dose, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, blood biochemistry, ventilator settings, and sedation score were recorded over the first 5 days of ketamine treatment. Complications (delirium, arrhythmias, malabsorption of feed) were documented. Chest X-ray findings were documented on the day ketamine was commenced.  The study was conducted over six months in a general intensive care unit. Data was collected on the day of the full moon and new moon of each month and 24 hours before and after). Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment methodintensive care (CAM-ICU). Patients who were too sedated to be assessed by CAM-ICU were excluded. Adult with a EuroSCORE > 6 or left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with bypass were included. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV, transcranial Doppler, middle cerebral artery), end-tidal PaCO2 (EtCO2, infrared capnograph), and blood pressure (BP, Finapres or intra-arterial) were continuously recorded supine during 5 minutes at rest preoperatively (T1),after 24 h (T2) and 7 days after surgery (T3). Diagnosis of delirium was performed using the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Autoregulation index (ARI) was estimated from CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by transfer function analysis using standard template curves. Changes in ARI at T1, T2 and T3 were assessed with repeated measures ANOVA.
