Ethics statement. This study was performed in strict accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Ministry of Educations, Culture Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Iwate University (Permit number A201536). Faecal sample collection from farm #A for metagenomic analysis. Faecal samples were collected from 20 neonatal Holstein calves at a farm (farm #A) in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, where cryptosporidiosis caused by C. parvum had consistently been reported in neonatal calves 39 . To achieve consistent sampling quality, all of the calves were housed and handled in the same way as much as possible. All of the calves were female and were born www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in identical cattle sheds. Birth weights ranged from 35-45 kg. Premature calves were excluded from the sampling. No vaccination programme was implemented for neonatal calves from farm #A. Within 2 h of birth, calves were fed 2 litres of colostrum, followed by 3 litres of colostrum twice daily for 4 days. An equivalent amount of a milk substitute (Pote-Mow Milk; NOSAN, Yokohama, Japan) was used thereafter. A calf starter (Bio calf Neo, NOSAN) was fed to all calves during this period. Faecal samples were collected from each calf every two or three days between birth and 15 days of age, resulting in a total of 120 faecal samples from farm #A across six sampling points. Each sample was divided between two plastic tubes. From the first tube, half of each sample was analysed for the presence of C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli K99 antigens using commercial immunochromatographic test (ICT) strips (Bio-X Diagnostics SPRL, Jemelle, Belgium). The remaining half of each faecal sample from the first tube was used to calculate the abundance of oocysts, as described below. The faecal score for each sample was recorded at the same time point, with the severity of diarrhoea scored according to the appearance of faecal material: normal (0), loose (1), muddy (2), and watery (3) . The second tube from each sample was preserved at −80 °C for DNA extraction. Faecal sample collection from farms in different locations. To examine the correlation between C. parvum and the faecal microbiome in the neonatal calves from different origins, 23 faecal samples were collected from calves aged 11-15 days born at farms located in Okinawa, Kagoshima, Iwate and Hokkaido prefectures, Japan ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The ages of the calves were very similar to those of calves from farm #A at the 6 th sampling point (10-15 days old). The faecal samples were preserved at −20 °C for DNA extraction. Technologies) . Raw sequences were demultiplexed and quality-trimmed using the following procedures: (i) trimming of bases with a quality less than Q15 from the 3ʹ end of each read, (ii) removal of reads with an average quality less than Q20, (iii) removal of reads without primer sequences at both ends and (iv) removal of reads with a total length less than 260 bp. These steps were carried out using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html) and BBtrim (http://bbmap.sourceforge.net/). Subsequently, 10,000 reads per sample were randomly sampled, using the random_sequence_sample.pl (https://www.ualberta.ca/~stothard/ software.html) algorithm for taxonomic assignment. These sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) defined at 97% similarity cutoff using UCLUST version 1.2.22q. Representative sequences for each OTU were classified taxonomically using RDP Classifier version 2.2 with the greengenes database (gg_13_8). qPCR analysis. qPCR assays were carried out to determine the abundance of C. parvum and Fusobacterium sequences in each of the samples. Faecal samples collected at the 6 th sampling point from farm #A along with the 23 samples from different origins were used for qPCR analyses. To determine the abundance of C. parvum sequences, a qPCR targeting the 18 S rRNA gene was performed with the following primers: forward, 5′-CTCGACTTTATGGAAGGGTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGAAACTTGAATG ATATGTCACATTTAA-3′ 40 . Reaction mixtures were prepared to a final volume of 20 µl and contained 0.2 µM of each primer, 0.4 µl of 50 × ROX reference dye, 10 µl of SYBR qPCR Mix (THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix, TOYOBO Co., Osaka, Japan) and template DNA. The qPCR was performed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 60 s, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 64 °C for 30 s. To determine the abundance of Fusobacterium sequences, a qPCR targeting the 16 S rRNA gene was performed using the following primers: forward, 5′-C(A/T)AACGCGATAAGTAATC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGTAACA TACGA(A/T)AGGG-3′ 41 . The composition of the reaction mixture was identical to that described above. The thermal cycler conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 60 s followed by 40 Control plasmids containing the 18 S rRNA and 16 S rRNA gene sequences from C. parvum and Fusobacterium, respectively, were constructed and used to generate standard curves for the qPCR assays. Briefly, each PCR product from the respective targets was cloned into pUC118 using a Mighty Cloning Reagent Set (Blunt End) (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The resultant plasmids were then linearised by digestion with EcoRI. The C. parvum and Fusobacterium loads in each sample (copy number/ng DNA) were determined based on a standard calibration curve generated from qPCR assays carried out using a dilution series (10 3 -10 8 copies/μl) of each of the control plasmids. qPCR assays were repeated at least twice to confirm the reproducibility of the results. Calculation of oocyst numbers in faecal samples from farm #A. Oocyst numbers in the C. parvum-positive samples identified by ICT strips were determined using the sugar flotation method, as described previously 42 . Briefly, 1 g of faecal sample was resuspended in water and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in sucrose solution (1.2 g/ml) before being centrifuged using the same conditions as above. Following centrifugation, oocysts present in the sample floated to the top of the supernatant and could be counted to give the approximate number of oocysts per gram (OPG). The average number of oocysts in 10 fields at a magnification of 400× was calculated under an optical microscope, with the average number converted into OPG by using the total number of fields under the microscope. The total number of fields for the optical microscope used in this study (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was 1,089. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.04 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Wilcoxon test was performed to compare the distribution of bacterial relative abundance in samples from in farm #A. The differences between the 1 st and the 6 th sampling points were examined respectively in the three groups: C. parvum-only-infected, rotavirus-only-infected, and the pathogen negative samples. Correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between the number of C. parvum oocysts and the relative ratios of Fusobacterium, as well as between the DNA copy numbers of C. parvum and Fusobacterium. The associations between C. parvum and Fusobacterium, based on the number of positive and negative samples for each determined by qPCR analysis of the faecal samples from different origins, were examined by Fisher's exact test.
