A scoping review was conducted to determine the extent and key themes within the literature on nurses' dual practice, as well as to identify areas for future research on the topic. Such knowledge synthesis method is commonly used to address exploratory research questions, to map the existing literature on a field or to preliminarily identify gaps in that literature [26] [27] [28] . We used the five Arksey and O'Malley's methodological steps to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/ exclude articles, extract the data, and report the findings [28] . As the methodological guidance for the report of scoping review is still under development, we used the PRISMA guidelines where appropriate [29] . In March 2017, we searched MEDLINE (through PubMed), the ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and the CINHAL Plus with full texts (through EBSCO). We used a set of keywords for the searches and, where appropriate, Medical Subject Headings for nurses combined with keywords and indexed terms related to dual practice (using the Bolean operator ' AND'). Additional file 1 provides full details for the initial search strategy for each of the databases searched. The grey literature also was searched by visiting websites dedicated to nursing and/or health workforce issues. To widen the scope of the review, the searches on databases and grey literature were not filtered for publication date, language, or publication type. Human resources for health experts (named in the Additional file 1) were a priori contacted to provide relevant references on forms of dual practices among nurses. A posteriori (early December 2017), and based on suggestions coming from the peer-review process, we expand the search terms in the database searches (adding the keywords 'temporary employment' and 'multiple employers') to provide a few additional records which were considered for the review results, as well. Iterative rather than strictly streamlined procedures are typical in the process of conducting scoping reviews [26] . A final search strategy included snowballing searches (reference list scanning, author tracking) performed on the articles preliminarily selected. References from databases or other sources were filtered through the same eligibility criteria. To be included, studies needed to address explicitly both nurses and dual practice issues. The working definition for the 'nurses' category contained explicit reference in the text to the professional label, with midwives included too. The working definition of dual practice, in turn, referred to concomitant practice in two (or more) distinct clinical services, either in the same or in different healthcare institutions. Public employment was considered the primary job, whereas the secondary (or subsequent) job(s) was considered the one(s) where fewer working hours were spent, periodically or regularly. Alternative labels for dual practice included 'moonlighting' , 'public-private work' , 'multiple profit-generating activities' , 'dual/multiple job-holding' , and 'second jobs'. 'Casualization of work' , defined as the process of replacing full-time and regular part-time staff with contract staff employed on an ad hoc basis, is another phenomenon related in many ways to dual practice [30] . As such, papers addressing this form of employment in relation to dual practice were also included. Documents in English, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish were included. With the exception of journal commentaries, editorials, and letters to the editor, we did not exclude references because of the type of article (such as opinion pieces), study output (e.g. final or preliminary results), countries or world regions, publication status (i.e. both peer-reviewed and grey literature), or publication date. Titles and abstracts were first screened by one of the authors (TJ) and then reviewed in duplicate by the first author (GR), who finally determined the suitability for the full-text review. Full-text review was carried out by one of three authors, all with a research track record in nurse workforce and/or dual practice issues (GR, IF, JB). Any of the authors were able to directly include or exclude papers on the basis of the eligibility criteria; agreement between two or more reviewers was sought for doubtful cases. Based on the overarching aim of the paper, the preliminary knowledge of the literature, and a priori consultation with health professionals [13] , we developed the following set of questions to guide the data extraction for the review: What are the forms in which nurses engage in multiple profit-generating activities? What are the different features of nurses' multiple job-holding? What is the prevalence of this phenomenon in nursing? Why do nurses engage in dual practice? What are the enablers and barriers for nurses' dual practice? What are the personal/ professional drivers and consequences? What are the consequences for health systems, specifically for the delivery of quality and safe nursing/health care? What are the consequences for nurses' welfare? What are the consequences for patients? What are health workers', managers', and patients' perceptions around this practice? Data extraction tables were then purposively built by the research team to collect data on the specific questions above, either using textual data or synthesis of the articles' findings/conclusions. Consistent with the scoping review methodology, the data extraction did not involve quality appraisal or grading of the evidence from the studies. A conventional form of qualitative content analysis, with coding categories derived directly from the text data, was used to analyse data retrieved for each topic [31] . The first author performed a first synthesis of the extracted material, that was then iteratively edited by two of the other authors (IF, JB) following the themes from the data extraction table.
