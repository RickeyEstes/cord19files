A systematic literature search was conducted via the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) on October 10 th , 2016, and updated on June 22 nd , 2017, using the following terms: virucidal activity alcohol (85 hits), virucidal activity ethanol ( (24 hits) . In addition, studies deemed suitable for this review were also included. Data were extracted from the publications and were selected when they provided original data on reduction of viral infectivity in suspension tests (49 studies) and on contaminated hands (17 studies). A solution or product was considered sufficiently effective against a virus in a suspension test when it achieved 4 log 10 reduction or the limit of detection was reached. There was no minimum criterion for the limit of detection so that solutions or products could have passed in an assay, although the initial viral titre may have been low or the cytotoxicity of the product may have been high, resulting in an overall low log 10 reduction of viral infectivity. Studies were not included when they provided data on the reduction of viral infectivity on inanimate surfaces or used other methods to determine efficacy (e.g. reduction of viral RNA).
