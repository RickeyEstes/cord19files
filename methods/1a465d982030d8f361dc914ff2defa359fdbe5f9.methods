Sequence preparation. In Phylogenetic trees and evolutionary dynamics. Phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates (nucleotide substitutions/site/year), and the time (year) of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated using a time-framed Bayesian evolution analysis approach via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference method, implemented in the BEAST package (v1.8.2) 19 . We used the GTR+ I+ Γ substitution model, a lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and a Bayesian skygrid tree prior. For the of ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 datasets, we used the HKY+ Γ substitution model and a strict clock model. The evolutionary parameters (only for substitution and molecular clock parameters, not the tree model) were linked for the dataset of E coding region by adjoining those of the complete genome sequences. MCMC analyses were run for 50 million iterations, sampling every 25 thousand iterations after a 10% burn-in. Two or three independent runs for each dataset were combined and assessed to ensure their convergence in Tracer (v1.6) 35 . The MCMC tree samples were used to summarize a maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees for each dataset using TreeAnnotator v1.8.1, which were visualized using FigTree (v1.4.2). The estimates were presented as mean values along with the lower and upper limits of the 95% highest probability density (HPD).
