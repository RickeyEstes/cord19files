In this study, we built a BUPTCM using Vensim (DSS) which is a simulation software for improving the performance of real systems. Vensim provides causal tracing of structure and behavior, and has Monte Carlo sensitivity, optimization and sub-scripting capabilities . We analyzed data from 2002 to 2020. First, we calibrated the parameters and verified that the simulation was consistent with the actual situation from 2002 to 2010. 1 Based on the simulation, we investigated Beijing's urban passenger transport energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from 2011 to 2020.
