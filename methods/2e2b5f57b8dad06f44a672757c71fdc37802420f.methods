An accurate model for the formation of TEM images would be based on quantum and relativistic aspects of the illumination of the specimen, electron-specimen interaction, microscopy optics, and the detection of the electrons. However, this would be a computationally unfeasible model. Therefore, we apply some simplifications and statistical modeling to obtain a feasible image formation model. A transmission electron microscope can be operated in different imaging modes depending on the illumination of the specimen, the contrast mechanism based on the interaction of the electrons with the specimen, and the detector type. In the dark field imaging mode, the detection of scattered electrons plays the major role in image formation, whereas it is the detection of transmitted electrons in bright-field imaging mode. We consider the bright field mode, used conventionally for ET in life sciences, in this study. In this imaging mode, a parallel beam of electrons illuminates the specimen, and the image is formed in the back focal plane of the objective lens by the electrons that pass through the aperture. For the image contrast mechanism, we only consider the amplitude contrast generated due to the electrons that are blocked from reaching the detector and we ignore the phase shift created by the electron-specimen interaction. This model is sufficient for medium-resolution contrast (beyond 2-3 nm) imaging however phase contrast should also be considered at higher resolutions where the features to be detected are smaller than the coherence length of the electron [9] . We also assume that successive electrons do not interact with each other so that they can be treated independently. This assumption holds for TEM imaging of biological specimens since the specimen is thinner than the mean distance between two successive electrons [10] . Under these assumptions the formation of the image can be expressed as: is the data acquired for the tilt angle θ, C is the data that would be acquired if there was no specimen, PSF represents the point spread function of the imaging system, * is the convolution operation, and ( ) Here, v b is proportional to the probability that an incident electron traveling along θ is scattered inside the bth voxel of the discretized specimen volume. The contribution of the bth voxel to the dth projection data, p d , is represented by a db . C and PSF in (1) can be determined by separate calibration experiments and they can be excluded from the equation by subtraction and deconvolution. After this basic preprocessing of the raw data, the problem reduces to estimate the parameters of distribution describing v b 's in (2) . In parallel beam projection geometry, the reconstruction space can be divided into slices orthogonal to the tilt axis and the slices can be reconstructed independently. Then the slices can be concatenated to reconstruct the final 3D volume. Therefore, the method will be described here for single slice of the volume to be reconstructed. The image formation geometry is presented in Fig. 1 . The parameter estimation can be realized for each slice independently by MAPEM method which maximizes a posteriori probability distribution using the Baye's rule as: ) P Data Img is the likelihood of the measured data to be observed given the image to be reconstructed. ( ) P Img and ( ) P Data are the a priori probability distributions. ( ) P Data can be assumed to be constant and excluded from the expression. In ET, very low dose of electrons is applied to a very thin sample in order to prevent radiation damage to the biological sample. Considering the characteristics of the signal and the noise, Poisson distribution can be assumed to represent the measurements. This assumption can be extended to model the number of electrons blocked by each pixel of the image. The statistical chain from generation of the electrons, via the scattering events inside the specimen, to the measurement detector, is assumed to be a cascaded Poisson process. This assumption is useful to satisfy the positivity constraint throughout the iterations. It was also utilized in the development of the adaptive regularization method described below (in Section 2.2). Using Poisson distribution and (2), the likelihood of observing the projection data, p, conditioned on the mean values λ ( | ( ) P Data Img ) can be expressed as: where λ b is the parameter of the Poisson distribution describing v b . By taking the logarithm and derivative of this expression with respect to λ b and equating it to zero, the maximum likelihood can be obtained as: Since v a b db is unavailable, it will be replaced by its conditional expected value at each iteration of the expectation maximization algorithm. The expected value can be calculated as: where ′ b is the pixel index of the image to be reconstructed. Using the expected value of v a b db in (4), the maximum likelihood estimate of λ can be expressed iteratively as follows. In addition to the likelihood term, C b L k , MAPEM reconstruction involves a regularization term, C b P k , that represents ( ) P Img . The overall update equation of the MAPEM is For ( ) P Img , local similarity in the small neighborhood of each pixel of the reconstructed image is a common choice. With Median Root Prior (MRP) [11] , the regularization term is expressed as: where () med operator represents the median filtering and β is the regularization parameter which controls the strength of this penalization filter.
