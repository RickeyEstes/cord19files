where X jk (t),Y jk (t), and Z jk (t) are the kth component of X j (t), Y j (t), and Z j (t), respectively. Multinomial(n, p 1 ,...,p G ) denotes a multinomial random variable with n trials and probabilities p 1 ,...,p G . We use Δt = 0.05 days in all of our simulations. The global epidemic simulator. We build the global simulator using 2015 worldwide flight booking data from the Official Airline Guide (OAG, https://www. oag.com/) and the Gridded Population of the World Version 4 (GPWv4, http:// sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4/) data set from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) at Columbia University. Worldwide air-transportation data: Our OAG worldwide flight booking data set contains all air bookings that have taken place in all commercial airports worldwide during 2015. Each data record contains the following information for a flight route: (i) origin airport, (ii) destination airport, (iii) connecting airports (if any), and (iv) passenger bookings for each month. The city and country served by each airport and the coordinates of each airport are known. The raw data comprises 0.947 million records. Parameterizing the WAN using these raw data would therefore generate 0.947 million connections in the network, which is beyond our computational capacity and unnecessary for an accurate description of global spread (because the WAN is densely connected) 3-6,12,42-44 . As such, we perform the following steps to exclude flight routes with weak traffic from the WAN without compromising the realism of the global epidemic simulator: 1. We exclude all routes with no bookings for one or more months during 2015. 2. We exclude all routes in which the origin or destination is a remote area with very small population size (e.g., hamlets, settlements, or communities in Alaska and Northern Canada). 3. We exclude all routes with strong seasonality as measured by normalized information entropy 11 : H ij ¼ À 1 logð12Þ P 12 m¼1 ρ ijm log ρ ijm , where ρ ijm ¼ F ijm = P 12 m¼1 F ijm and F ijm denotes the number of air bookings from origin airport i to destination airport j in month m. The measure H ij ranges between 0 and 1, and decreases as temporal variation in air-traffic increases (e.g., if air-traffic is the same across all months, then H ij = 1). On the basis of the distribution of H ij in our OAG raw data, we exclude all routes with H ij < 0.8 ( Supplementary Fig. 8a) . Global population data: The GPWv4 data set integrates the highest resolution census data from the 2010 round of Population and Housing Censuses collected from hundreds of national statistics departments and organizations 45, 46 . GPWv4 provides eight different data sets, most of which are specialized geospatial metadata that partition the global population into a grid of cells with resolution of 30 arcsecond (~1 km at the equator). We use the vector data set "Administrative Unit Center Points with Population Estimates, v4 (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020)" 47 , because it provides all the information that we need to build the global epidemic model, e.g., the coordinates of centroid are available for each of the~12.5 million administrative census units (ACUs). The WAN model: We combine our OAG data with the GPWv4 data to calculate the population size of the catchment area of each airport as follows: 1. We use the coordinates of the centroids of all ACUs and airports to calculate the great circle distance for all possible combinations of ACUs and airports within the same country. We use a Voronoi-like tessellation algorithm proposed by Balcan et al. 23 to link each ACU to its serving airport (i.e., the closest airport in its country). In this algorithm, we impose the constraint that the great circle distance between any pair of ACU and airport cannot exceed 200 km, according to the distribution of great circle distance for all combinations of ACUs and airports ( Supplementary Fig. 8b ). This reflects a reasonable upper bound on the distance of land transportation for reaching an airport 23 . Without this constraint, the algorithm may generate unreasonably large catchment areas for airports located in sparsely populated regions. Among the 7,995,985 ACUs with human habitats, only 45,692 are excluded from our model because of this constraint. The total population size served by an airport is the sum of populations for all ACUs assigned to that airport.
