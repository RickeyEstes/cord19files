We performed a prospective, observational study of premature infants in 2 NICUs in Syracuse, NY, during 1 calendar year (2009). Infants were eligible if they were born at less than 33 weeks, 0 days gestational age (GA), and were available for enrollment within 3 days of arrival in the NICU, which included transfer from another facility or following hospital birth. Neonates with medical and surgical diagnoses were included. GA was determined by menstrual dates and confirmed by ultrasound. Infants were excluded if they had a known or suspected immune deficiency, or were born to a human immunodeficiency virus-positive mother. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected using flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc, Corona, California) from each infant by study personnel trained in the proper procedure for obtaining a nasopharyngeal specimen (including intubated infants to ensure sample consistency) within 3 days of birth and on a regular twice weekly (Monday/Thursday) schedule thereafter until discharge. Sampling was deferred on a particular day if the procedure was deemed to place the infant at risk. Specimens were placed in 1.5 mL universal transport media (Copan) and frozen at Ã€70 C prior to testing with the xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP; Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). RVP is a multiplex PCR assay that detects influenza A H1, H3, and nonspecific; influenza B; RSV A and B; PIV 1, 2, 3, and 4; coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU-1, and OC43; rhinovirus/enterovirus; adenovirus; and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Clinical and demographic data were collected from the medical records. At each sampling timepoint, the use of mechanical ventilation and percent of inspired oxygen was recorded, along with the results of any microbiologic testing performed for appropriate clinical purposes. Clinical events (episodes of oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, or apnea) were recorded daily according to the existing criteria being used routinely by the nursing staff in both NICUs. To qualify as an event, the aforementioned change had to persist for longer than 20 seconds. Oxygen saturation below 88% and a heart rate below 100 beats per minute were the cutoff points used for desaturation and bradycardia events, respectively. Clinical deteriorations were defined as a sustained (lasting 3 days) increase in daily oxygen desaturation events from the prior baseline rate, an increase in oxygen requirement (as judged by the current inhaled oxygen concentration required for stable oxygen saturations, excluding transient desaturations associated with feeding), or an increased level of respiratory support (moving from nasal cannula to continuous positive airways pressure, or to intubation or mechanical ventilation). A diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was made if an infant required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks post-conceptional age. The 2 NICUs in the study were a level 3 unit with a daily average census of approximately 12 infants, and a level 4 regional center with a daily average census of approximately 55 infants. Throughout the study period, each NICU operated under its usual infection control procedures: all staff employed an extended hand and arm scrub on arrival to the unit, and standard precautions were in place at all times. All direct patient contact by medical staff required gloves. Contact precautions also were in place (gown and glove) for patients known to be colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA screening by PCR was performed on all patients at the regional center on a weekly basis. All children (age 17 years and younger) were excluded from the units and adult visitors were excluded if ill. Parents who had respiratory symptoms were discouraged from visiting but allowed to visit if they wore gowns, gloves, and a surgical mask. In the regional center NICU, twin and triplet births were separated into different nursing areas. No healthcare personnel were aware of the results of the respiratory virus detection tests during the study. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Fisher exact test or Student t test as appropriate. Time to infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection and the interval between previous and current infection dates for repeated infections. The marginal effects of several variables, including NICU units, sex, GA, and birth weight on time to infection were presented by Kaplan-Meier infection-free probability curves and tested by Log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was further fitted to examine the effect of each covariate, adjusting the effect of other covariates. A random-effect term was included to adjust the dependence among the multiple observations from the same infant. The proportional hazards assumption and possible outliers were visually examined through Schoenfeld and deviance residual plots. A path model, focusing on the direct and indirect effects of infection on the hospital stay, was proposed and confirmed by using SAS v. 9.2 PROC CALIS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) under which the algorithm was optimized via a Quasi-Newton method. Statistical significance was defined at a level of P = .05. The research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center and Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital, both of Syracuse, NY (Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects #2008.147 and #2008.4657, respectively).
