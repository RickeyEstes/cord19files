: BALB/C mice were intraperitoneally sensitized by ovalbumin with alum on day1 and 7, followed by challenge with 1% ovalbumin on day 21, 22, and 23. The lung cells were isolated and analysed by FACS analysis. T cells isolated from the bronchial lymph node and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were cocultured with or without ovalbumin in vitro in order to determine ability of sensitized alveolar macrophages to induce T cell proliferation. Results: After challenge, the percent of CD11chigh/CD11blow lung cells (alveolar macrophage) were not changed, but the MHC II expression of CD11chigh/CD11blow lung cells increased compared to PBS group. The proliferation of T cells increased 3 times in IP group than other groups without stimulation of ovalbumin. Furthermore, the BAL cells of IP group with stimulation of ovalbumin induced 8 times increase of T cell proliferation compared to that of other groups. Conclusion: It is suggested that the sensitized alveolar macrophages in BAL could facilitate the proliferation of T cells in asthma animal model.
