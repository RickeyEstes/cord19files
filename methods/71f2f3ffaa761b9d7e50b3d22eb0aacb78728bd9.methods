This study was conducted during the first three months (March-May 2003) of the SARS outbreak in Beijing, China, where Ditan Hospital was designated as a 'SARS hospital', meaning that suspected SARS patients were transferred and managed at this institution. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Beijing Ditan Hospital. The clinical case definition of probable SARS included a fever of ≥38°C, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, and close contact with a suspect or probable SARS case. Day 1 was defined as the day of fever onset. Sera, throat washes and feces were collected from hospitalised patients for testing with a quantitative SARS-CoV RT-PCR. As the early phase of the outbreak in Beijing had involved many healthcare workers [2] , patient self-collected throat washes and fecal samples were used to minimize further nosocomial transmission. For throat washes, patients were given 10 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl, asked to gargle for 30 seconds then spit the fluid into a 20 ml sterile plastic screw-topped plastic container. Patients were also asked to collect approximately 1 cm 3 feces and place it into a 20 ml sterile screw-topped plastic container. Five ml of the throat wash was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, then the supernatant further centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 hour. Ten ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) was used to dilute the fecal sample, then 5 ml was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 hour. RNA was extracted from the remaining 100-300 μl of the throat wash and fecal pellets using Trizol (Invitrogen, Beijing, PR China). 700 μl of sera were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 hour, the supernatant removed and RNA extracted from the remaining 100-300 μl pellet using Trizol. SARS-CoV RNA was detected in throat washes, stool and blood using a fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR assay (ShenZhen PJ Biotech Company, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, PR China), according to the manufacturer's instructions and performed on a BioRad iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Beijing, PR China). The SARS-CoV pol region primers used were P1 sense 5'GTTCTTGCTCGCAAACATAACACTT3' (position 15279-15303 in SARS-CoV Urbani strain, Genbank accession number AY278741), P2 antisense 5'AACAGCTTGACAAATGTTAAAGACA3' (15446-15470) and probe 5'TGTGTGGCGGCTCACTATAT3' (15373-15392). Internal controls were used in all runs, and no evidence of PCR inhibition in clinical samples was detected. Testing for other respiratory viruses was not carried out in this cohort of patients as they fitted the SARS clinical case definition during the outbreak. The PCR assay was negative when performed on RNA or DNA extracted from influenza A and B, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus isolates, and on plasma collected from otherwise healthy hepatitis C and B infected individuals (data not shown). Manipulations were carried out in a BSL2 facility with BSL3 practices. SARS-CoV isolation was not attempted on clinical samples during the outbreak due to safety concerns and time constraints.
