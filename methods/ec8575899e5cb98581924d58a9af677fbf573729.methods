Respiratory samples were collected from 17 patients admitted to three Seoul National University (SNU) affiliated hospitals during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea. The patients were categorized into severe (A-I) or mild (J-Q) groups depending on their oxygen supplementation requirements. The severe group required oxygen supplementation to maintain arterial saturation above 90%. Patients A-E received ventilator therapy, while patients F-I did not (Park et al., 2015) . The institutional review board at SNU Hospital provided study approval and waived the requirement for written consent. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using a UTM kit containing viral transport medium (Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murrieta, CA, USA). The RNA was extracted from respiratory samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). To detect the MERS-CoV genomic RNA, multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR was performed using the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) Real-time PCR Kit (Kogenebiotech, Seoul, South Korea) and all assays were performed using a ViiA7 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The results of genomic RNA titers have been presented in part in a previous publication (Oh et al., 2016) . The MERS-CoV sub-genomic mRNA was detected using Accu-Power RT-PCR PreMix (Binder Inc., Alameda, CA, USA). PCR primers were designed to detect sub-genomic mRNA that codes for the spike (S) (433 bp) and nucleocapsid (N) (662 bp) proteins (Table 1) . Forward primer was elaborated from the leader sequence and backward primers of 5 0 untranslated region (UTR)-S and 5 0 UTR-N were from gene sequences coding for proteins S and N, respectively. The PCR reactions were performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 C for 5 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 20 s, annealing at 55 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 C for 1 min. Sub-genomic mRNA was sequenced using a DNA Engine Tetrad 2 Peltier Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) and the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). If the sequences included the leader sequence and were consistent with the MERS-CoV genome by 98% using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software, they were confirmed as sub-genomic mRNA.
