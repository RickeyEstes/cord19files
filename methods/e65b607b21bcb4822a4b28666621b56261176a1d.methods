This observational epidemiological study was approved by the internal review board of the Singapore General Hospital ethics committee. On 5 and 6 April 2003, a cluster of healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients from two surgical wards (wards 57 and 58) in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) developed unexplained fever. In the midst of an outbreak of SARS, this event was ominous in a hospital that had no previous SARS cases and it was classified as a possible SARS outbreak. The source was unknown but we assumed that all patients in both wards had been exposed to the virus. A later epidemiological study using contact tracing pointed to an index case having infected a total of 24 HCWs, patients (excluding those in the study cohort) and visitors in the two wards. In view of the speed of the outbreak and the potential for spread to the rest of the 1400 bed general hospital, the SARS taskforce in the hospital together with the Ministry of Health (MOH) decided to isolate the entire cohort of patients on the two wards. This was effected on the 6 April (D-day) as follows: patients from both wards were transferred to a dedicated SARS hospital designated by the MOH. A team of 131 doctors, nurses, physiotherapist and ancillary staff from the affected surgical wards was seconded to take care of these patients. The rest of the surgical department was decommissioned. These patients were subsequently managed in two general wards and a high-dependency ward, and isolated from the rest of the dedicated SARS hospital. The patients were triaged on admission to the wards. Those requiring close hourly monitoring, invasive central venous pressure monitoring and tracheostomy care were admitted to the highdependency ward (ward C). The less seriously ill were admitted to the general wards. These patients were triaged accordingly: ward A, those who had a current fever or a recent history of fever related to a surgical cause (e.g. surgical infections and postoperative complications); and ward B, those who had no history of fever in their admission before transfer and included patients with chronic surgical problems. The wards were of an open design and patients were subject to cohorting. Limited numbers of isolation rooms were available on the general wards and in the high-dependency ward. No visitors were allowed and there was no interaction of patients between wards. Patients were discouraged from interacting with one another within the ward, but as their condition improved, many, in fact, did so. They shared facilities within the ward such as the toilets and bathing facilities. The HCWs looking after them wore full personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times using precautions for airborne, droplet and contact transmission. The PPE included 3M (1860/1860S) N95 particulate respirator masks, long-sleeved disposable gowns, goggles or visors, hair covers and gloves. The technique of applying and removing the PPE was standardized for all HCWs. The N95 masks were test fitted for all HCWs before patient contact. Gowns and gloves were discarded after each patient contact and strict handwashing was observed. Contaminated goggles and stethoscopes were cleaned with 70% alcohol before re-use as was other equipment necessary for routine physical examination. The use of PAPR (powered airway pressure respirators, 3M Jupiter) was indicated for procedures involving aerosolization such as suctioning and chest physiotherapy. The use of nebulizers in the general ward was prohibited. Surgical procedures were carried out in a specially designated operating theatre. All patients had baseline investigations carried out upon transfer. These included a full blood count, serum biochemistry (including liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase levels) and chest radiograph. Demographic and clinical data of the patient cohort were obtained from the case notes. Data on the clinical course were collected prospectively. The entire cohort was deemed not to have SARS at the onset of quarantine. Subsequently, patients were classified into four groups: (1) non-SARS; (2) observation for unexplained fever (temperature . 38 8C); (3) suspected SARS; and (4) probable SARS. Case definition of suspected and probable SARS status was according to prevailing guidelines at the time of the outbreak. 9,10 Patients were followed up daily and clinical parameters monitored at least three times per day. A fever . 38 8C or development of symptoms suspicious for SARS prompted a detailed clinical review and a possible upgrading of SARS status. Patients who were upgraded to an observation, suspected or probable SARS status were subsequently removed from the cohort and placed in isolation in a different part of the hospital. Such patients were subsequently co-managed with a team of infectious disease physicians. Patients remained in quarantine in the wards according to the following guidelines: 10 days must have elapsed after the last case of probable SARS had been isolated from the ward they were in and they had been afebrile and asymptomatic for a minimum of three days and have a normal chest radiograph. They were subsequently discharged home with an official home quarantine order. Patients requiring medical care continued to be managed within the quarantined wards. No transfer to another hospital was allowed. Deaths were managed according to SARS status as defined by the Infectious Diseases Act of Singapore.
