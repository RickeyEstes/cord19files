Biosensors can be mainly classified as optical, electrochemical, and mass spectrometric. Among biosensors, electrochemical biosensors with a volumetric transducer displayed a great potential in the detection of biomolecules [112] . Electrochemical biosensors are widely used for the detection of various analytes because of their rapid response, great sensitivity, simplicity, cost-effective, miniaturization, and portable. Fabrication of biosensors using the techniques of square wave voltammetry (SWV), CV, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) allows rapid biosensing for different types of analytes. EIS has enlighten at surface area and interaction modification agents and the electrode surface [113] . Because of occurrence of an electrochemical reaction at the electrode surface upon interaction with target molecule, impedance biosensors have been widely used for the environmental monitoring of disrupting chemicals and drugs, interaction between antibody and antigen, and DNA strains [114] . The EIS measurement studies the dielectric parameters of a biological system in wide frequencies. The EIS provides information about surface adsorption, ion exchange, diffusion, and charge transfer [114] . In another electrochemical technique, quantitative analysis using SWV is one of the most promising mechanisms in the fabrication of biosensors due to their ability to perform more sensitive answer for rapid biosensing when compared to differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. In pulse methods the procedures are based on the application of pulse changes of potential, and the current response is measured at a suitable time relative to the time of the pulse [115] . All pulse techniques are based on the difference in the rate of the decay of the charging and the faradaic currents related a potential step or pulse. The working electrode (WE) represents the fundamental component in electrochemical studies. The most commonly used WE materials are metal electrodes (Pt, Au, Hg, etc.) and carbon electrodes. It can be worked in more negative potential area by using carbon electrodes as well as good anodic potential windows. The most common form of carbon electrode is glassy carbon electrode. Moreover, carbon paste electrodes are also useful in many applications [116] . Siuzdak et al. worked on pathogen-detection methods. The nanocrystalline boron-doped diamond-based electrode (B:NCD) was used as platform of biosensor. The modified material is a highly promising material for the thirdgeneration biosensor due to its chemical inertness, wide potential window, low background current, biocompatibility, and high stability [117] . H5N1, Avian influenza virus, is determined by different methods such as the immunochromatography, the reversetranscription PCR (RT-PCR), ELISA, serological methods [9] , quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence. However, the electrochemical detection method received high attention because of providing low cost, small sample volume without amplification step, and user-friendly interface and portability [118] . Lee et al. reported the H5N1 detection with 1 pM of limit of detection (LOD). CV was applied to confirm the HA protein binding to multifunctional DNA structure on pAuNPs-modified electrode. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) immunosensor was developed using electrochemical techniques. Cocatalysis of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and nanoporous gold are used as modifier agents. The developed immunosensor gives a good linear relation between peak current and concentration of HBeAg (1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL as well as 0.064 pg/mL of LOD). The electrochemical DNA biosensing device becomes effective tool because of the properties such as rapid response time, high specificity, sensitivity, and user friendly. Electrochemical paper analytical device (ePADs) makes a great contribution on the sensor, because of paper being an inexpensive substrate. Singhal et al. describe their study about the fabrication of ePADs, by diagnosing the target DNA of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [119] . Electrical and optical methods were used in the study by Oliveira et al. [120] . Genomic DNA is detected in blood plasma of patients with hepatitis B without PCR amplification. The linear range of HBV-genomic DNA concentration was found as 1.55À6.68 ng/μL with LOD of 0.15 ng/μL. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) immunosensor was developed by Alizadeh et al. Hemin/G-quadruplex/ Fe 3 O 4 ÀAuNPs and H-amino-rGOÀAu were used as modifier agents [121] . The HBsAg immunosensor was also applied in spiked human serum sample. Smart electrochemical platform was formed by Wiang et al. An ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical biosensor using graphene quantum dots for detecting HBV DNA was made. The proposed sensor exhibits high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1 nM, and the linear detection range is from 10 to 500 nM [122] . EIS detection is one of the main concepts in label-free biosensing which are nucleotides (DNA/RNA), enzymes, aptamers, and antibodies detection. Moreover, EIS measurement is a nondestructive and relatively facile system. Shariati et al. developed a biosensor of HPV DNA. Impedimetric HPV DNA biosensor by AuNTs-polycarbonate electrode was fabricated. Biosensor in label-free detection showed the good linear ranges of 0.01À1 mM [114] . Nanocelluloses could be used to immobilize antibodies, enzymes, and noble metal NPs, all of which could enhance electrochemical immunosensor performance. Surprisingly, very little work has been reported on the application of nanocelluloses in electrochemical immunoassays. Liu et al. aim to develop a sensitive novel sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the measurement of Avian leukosis virus subgroup J [123] .
