The study hospitals were large, university hospitals with 1200 (hospital A), 900 (hospital B) and 850 (hospital C) beds. There were 20 general intensive care unit (ICU) beds in hospital A and 18 in hospital C. In hospital B, the number of beds increased from 12 before 2000 to 22 thereafter. All hospitals have burns and neurosurgery departments. Hospitals A and B also perform solid organ transplantations and cardiovascular surgery. Bone marrow transplantation is only performed in hospital A. Fatality rates comprised in-hospital deaths from all causes. Hospital BSIs were defined as BSIs occurring more than 48 h after admission. Data were collected prospectively in hospital B, and through patient chart review in hospitals A and C. Multiple isolates within the same infectious episode were counted once in the analysis. Nosocomial A. baumannii BSI incidence is expressed as the number of BSIs per 10 000 patientdays in hospital. Carbepenem consumption data are given in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 patientdays (1 DDD meropenemZ3 g; 1 DDD imipenemZ2 g). Chi-squared test was used for contingency tables. In hospital A, blood culture specimens were inoculated into BacT/Alert bottles (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC, USA). Identification of the isolates and susceptibility testing were performed using standard bacteriologic methods including an automated system (MicroScan, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, West Sacramento, CA, USA during 1997-2000, and Vitek II System, bioMÃ©rieux, Durham, NC, USA during 2001-2002). In hospitals B and C, blood culture specimens were inoculated into a 6B aerobic bottle and a 7A anaerobic bottle, and processed with the Bactec 9240 microbial detection system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by the disc diffusion agar method on Mueller-Hinton agar, according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards procedures. The identification systems used may not distinguish between closely related genotypic strains of Acinetobacter sp., and thus some of the organisms referred to as A. baumannii may belong to closely related strains.
