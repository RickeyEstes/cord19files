We reviewed the agenda items in the WHA from 1970 to 2012. Two data sources were used: agenda items from 2004 (57th WHA) to 2012 (65th WHA) were extracted from the WHO internet site [10] For all Health Matters, categories and sub-categories were created in order to analyse Health Matters further. Categories and sub-categories are set out in Table 1 . Categories were drawn from one of the 65th WHA agendas entitled "WHO reform" [11] . The five categories are (1) communicable diseases, (2) noncommunicable diseases, (3) health through the life course, (4) health systems, and (5) preparedness, surveillance and response. We added another category, (6) others, for agenda items which did not fit in these five categories. The sub-categories were developed with reference to the Handbook of Resolutions and Decisions of the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, Volumes I, II, and III [12] [13] [14] , and also in light of the functions of the WHO according to its Constitution, Article 2 [1] . In this labelling system, the health systems category includes items related to health policies, such as PHC, health for all by 2000, and MDGs, since health systems are strongly connected to the health policies. The sub-category 'Strengthening health systems' was defined according to the concept provided by the WHO in the Everybody's Business: Strengthening health systems to Improve Health Outcomes, WHO's Framework of Action [15] . The noncommunicable diseases category consists of 10 subcategories. One of them that includes the agendas entitled "prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases" or similar titles, was named as "noncommunicable diseases in general" to avoid any confusion between category and subcategory. Health issue milestones in the each category were selected from several publications and web sites [16] [17] [18] [19] . Each agenda item of Committees A and B from 1970 to 2012 was entered into Microsoft Excel. Then each item An agenda item covered by a single category was placed into the relevant category. In cases where an agenda item could apply to more than one category, we read the Report written by the Secretariat and related resolution of the agenda item, and decided on the most appropriate category for the agenda item. Therefore, no agenda item was placed in more than one category.
