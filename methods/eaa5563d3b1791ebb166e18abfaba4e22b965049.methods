Bacterial growth. Salmonella Senftenberg (kindly provided by Dr. George Golding, National Microbiology Laboratory) strains were grown overnight in 3 mL LB broth at 37 °C with shaking. Fifty μ L of bacteria were then sub cultured into 3 mL LB broth and grown at 37 °C with shaking for 4 hours to the approximate mid-log phase of growth. The bacteria were fixed at 1:1 v/v in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2% gluteraldehyde for 1 hour at room temperature. Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc (kindly provided by Dr. Robbin Lindsay, National Microbiology Laboratory) was grown in Ellinghausen and McCullough media modified by Johnson and Harris (EMJH) (Royal Tropical Institute, The Netherlands). The inoculate culture was placed at 30 °C for 14 days and then stored at room temperature in low light.
