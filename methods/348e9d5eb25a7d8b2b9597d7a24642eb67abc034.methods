The search strategy of databases focused on clinical trials, controlled clinical trials, reviews or systematic reviews in all children (0-18 years). The search was conducted on 10 November 2016 combining MeSH and free-text terms 'community-acquired infections' , 'pneumonia, bacterial' , 'community-acquired pneumonia' , 'antibiotics' and 'anti-bacterial agents' . PubMed was searched for relevant guidelines. Titles and abstracts, full texts and subsequent data abstraction were screened independently, followed by consensus discussion.
