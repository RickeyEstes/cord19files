HCWs in selected clinical units at a Toronto tertiary care health care institution, which treated patients with SARS, were asked to participate in the study. The assessment and care of patients who were suspected of having SARS or those diagnosed with SARS were limited to three specific hospital areas. These were "high-risk" units consisting of a special SARS unit, the intensive care unit (ICU), and the emergency department (ED). HCWs from these high-risk units constituted the study group. Eight selected units that were not involved in either the assessment or management of patients with SARS agreed to participate as a comparison group. The eight comparison units included two oncology units, three general medicine units, one cardiology unit, one general surgery unit, and one multiorgan transplant surgery unit within the same hospital system. An e-mail was sent to each unit manager, informing them about the study and asking for their permission to distribute the questionnaires to employees on their units. All contacted nursing units agreed to participate. Blank questionnaires with sealed boxes for collection of responses were placed at various designated work areas in each participating unit between June 16, 2003, and July 9, 2003. The self-report questionnaire consisted of a demographics section to identify respondents by age, gender, marital status, number of children, and the setting in which they lived. The questionnaire developed for this study contained 91 items in total, which were grouped into seven domains: (a) HCWs' perception of personal risk, (b) HCWs' perception of their risk to others (e.g., spouse/partner, family members, and friends), (c) confidence in IC measures, (d) confidence in information received regarding SARS, (e) impact on personal life, (f) impact on work life, and (g) depressive affect. These domains were chosen based on the available literature on stress in the workplace and the opinion of experts working and caring for SARS patients. A copy of the survey is available on request. The responses to the multiple-choice questions were scored on a 6-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. These responses were dichotomized into positive and negative responses. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was imbedded in the questionnaire. The IES-R [24] is a self-report scale, which assesses the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The IES-R has been found to be more sensitive to a more general construct of traumatic stress in those with lower symptom levels [25] , such as those who might be experiencing posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The response format of IES-R consists of a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 and provides three subscores for PTSD criteria: avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal. In this study, for the purpose of detecting the presence of PTSS rather than diagnostic PTSD, we used a total score of 20 or greater as a cutoff of significant stress in the HCW population based on other published studies [31, 32] . Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University Health Networks Ethics Board. Statistical analysis SAS version 6.12 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis for this study. The statistical analysis determined means, standard deviations, and frequencies. Frequency distributions were computed for responses to individual survey questions. Differences between means from study groups were analyzed using t test and ANOVA. Univariate and multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted. A P value â‰¤.05 was considered significant.
