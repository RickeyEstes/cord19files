The SARI Infection Control Subcommittee and the SARI Antibiotic Stewardship Subcommittee designed the survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was piloted in hospitals that included members of both committees. The final draft of the questionnaire was then circulated in September 2003 to the chief executives of all acute public hospitals, the complete list of which was obtained from the Irish Medical Directory and the Irish Department of Health and Children's reports on acute public hospital statistics. Private hospitals that carry out inpatient surgical procedures were also included in the survey. Survey questionnaires were sent to all 68 acute public and private hospitals, and reminder letters were sent and telephone contact was made for non-responders up to the end of December 2003. Completed survey forms were scanned into a database using an automated optical reader (Teleform, Cardiff Software, Vista, CA, USA). Results were analysed using Microsoft Excel and EpiInfo.
