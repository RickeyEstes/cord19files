In order to understand the IPCP adoption process in an LMI country setting, a case study of the Kiribati IPCP was undertaken in 2010, examining the program's evolution from 2003 until 2010. A single-case study approach was chosen for this project as it facilitated the exploration, within a specific context, of the adoption of an IPCP. This study seeks to explore the contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context. 23 The case-study method calls for a triangulating process using multiple sources of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, to explore the research questions to enhance rigour. 23, 24 Triangulation in this study was achieved through the analysis of multiple sources of data which are each causally separate and have been reported as such elsewhere. [20] [21] [22] Ethics approval was gained from the Ministry of Health, Kiribati and the University of Wollongong Human Ethics Committee (HE09/386).
