In the following section, we describe: (1) different strategies that can be employed to affinity tag HIV proteins, (2) purification protocols, and (3) ways in which the resulting data can be analyzed and integrated with other types of information. Characterization of HIV-human protein-protein interactions during infection would arguably result in a dataset that would be most physiologically relevant. In order to accomplish this, however, one would have to tag the proteins in the context of the viral genome, infect the appropriate cells with these genetically altered viruses and then purify and identify the complexes. So far Integrase, Vif and Vpr have been successfully tagged within the provirus while maintaining infectivity [32, 36, 48] . Affinity purification of these proteins from infected cells led to the discovery of the Vif/ Cul5 complex and the finding that DDB1 is an additional component of the Vpr/DCAF1 complex. While this strategy is a very elegant way to identify virus-host interactions, it is not applicable to most of the HIV ORFs due to the overlapping organization of the HIV genome. Tagging these factors on either the N-or C-termini would disrupt the functions of the essential, overlapping proteins and would have detrimental effects on the function of the virus. Similarly, placing tags on the individual factors that comprise the polyproteins (Gag, Pol and Env) would result in similar expression problems for downstream proteins and/or adversely affect processing events by Protease, which would result in a disabled or comprised virus.
