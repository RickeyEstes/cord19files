In this section, we outline how ORBiT can incorporate claims data to discover spatial and temporal patterns from the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season. The description of the ORBiT framework is provided elsewhere [34] . In this paper, we describe the claims data and the use of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a novel technique to analyze claims data to automatically discover spatial and temporal patterns.
