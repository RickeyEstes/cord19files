Materials. BSA was purchased from Solarbio (Beijing); IgG, IgG-FITC, and rabbit anti-human IgG antibody were obtained from Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai); graphene oxide was bought from XFNANO (Nanjing); Figure 5 . Selectivity. The concentrations of HSA and BSA were both 10 μ g mL −1 , the IgG-FITC was 1 μ g mL −1 , and the antibody-conjugated GO was 100 μ g mL −1 for each experiment. The blank sample did not contain analyte IgG or an interfering molecule. and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimde hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Japan). They were all of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Characterization Methods. The fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured under the excitation wavelength of 490 nm, with the slit width of 10 nm, and voltage of 500 V using a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). The emission peak of FITC was centered at 520 nm, and corresponding filters were introduced to obtain the analyte spectral region. For AFM measurements, sample solutions containing bare GO or modified GO were dripped on freshly cleaved mica using a pipette and then dried in ambient air. Surface topographic features were scanned in contact mode using a commercial AFM (CSPM 4000, Benyuan, China) equipped with a silicon cantilever.
