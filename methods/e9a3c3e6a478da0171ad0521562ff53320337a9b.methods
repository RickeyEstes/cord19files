A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial to assess for the clinical efficacy of early corticosteroid use on SARS patients was conducted during 20th April 2003 to 30th May 2003 in two regional hospitals in Hong Kong. Ethics approval was obtained from the Instituional Review Board of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. However, the study was terminated because the Hong Kong outbreak ended in June 2003. The study inclusion criteria were: (1) "Probable" cases of SARS with or without laboratory confirmation according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition (CDC, 2003) and (2) age 18-65 years. Exclusion criteria were: (1) late presentation on ≥5 days after symptom onset; (2) presence of co-morbidity (e.g. renal impairment, liver failure, congestive heart failure, major cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, malignancy, etc.); and (3) evidence of respiratory failure on admission as defined by blood oxygen saturation (Sa O 2 ) ≤ 90% or oxygen tension of Pa O 2 < 8 kPa without supplemental oxygen therapy (i.e. in room air). Informed consents from patients were obtained. Routine serial laboratory investigations and plain chest radiographs were performed as described Sung et al., 2004) . Extent of pulmonary infiltrates on each frontal chest radiograph was scored in percentages by radiologists (Wong et al., 2003) . Conventional, qualitative SARS-CoV RT-PCR assays were performed weekly on throat gargles and stool specimens for each patient; and paired SARS-CoV serology (indirect immunofluorescence assay, 2-4 weeks apart) were also obatined (WHO, 2003; Chan et al., 2004) . Plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations were measured daily from the day of admission until discharge. For plasma SARS-CoV RNA quantitation, blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes. Plasma was obtained by centrifuging the blood samples at 1600 × g for 10 min, followed by 16,000 × g for 10 min. Viral RNA was extracted from 0.28 mL plasma by a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA was eluted with 50 L of AVE buffer (included in the kit) and stored at −80 • C. One step quantitative real-time RT-PCR targeting the nucleocapsid gene of the SARS-CoV was performed as previously described to determine the plasma viral RNA concentrations (Ng et al., 2003) . Each sample was analyzed in duplicates, and the calibration curve was run in parallel for each analysis. Multiple negative water blanks were also included in every analysis. The clinical treatment protocol consisted of initial antibacterial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia Sung et al., 2004) upon admission. Intravenous rib-avirin therapy at a dose of 400 mg eight hourly was given if there was no clinical response after 48 h, for a total of 12 days. Also, cases were randomised in a double-blind fashion to receive either (1) "early" intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg every eight hourly, or (2) intravenous normal saline 5 mL eight hourly as placebo, for a total of 12 days, or until "pulse" methylprednisolone was given as rescue therapy. "Pulse" of intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone (500 mg/day for three consecutive days) was given for cases having persistent/recurrent fever plus radiographic progression of lung opacities ± hypoxemia as rescue therapy. Further pulses of methylprednisolone were given as required when no clinical or radiological improvement archived, up to a total of 3.0 g (Sung et al., 2004) . Detailed clinical, radiological, and laboratory data in patients treated similarly had been described elsewhere (Sung et al., 2004; Hui et al., in press ).
