In this paper, three kinds of data from the complete genomes of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses are analysed using the DL method proposed by our group [33] . They are the whole DNA sequences (including protein-coding and non-coding regions), all protein-coding DNA sequences and the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes. There are a total of N = 4 K (for DNA sequences) or 20 K (for protein sequences) possible types of K-mers (the strings with fixed length K). We denote the length of a DNA or protein sequence as L. Then a window of length K is used to slide through the sequences by shifting one position at a time to determine the frequencies of each of the N kinds of K-mers in this sequence. We define p(α 1 α 2 ...α K ) = n(α 1 α 2 ...α K )/(L -K + 1) as the observed frequency of a K-mer α 1 α 2 ...α K , where n(α 1 α 2 ...α K ) is the number of times that α 1 α 2 ...α K appears in this sequence. For the DNA or amino acid sequences of the protein-cod-ing genes, denoting by m the number of protein-coding genes from each complete genome, we define as the observed frequency of a K-mer α 1 α 2 ...α K ; here n j (α 1 α 2 ...α K ) means the number of times that α 1 α 2 ...α K appears in the jth protein-coding DNA sequence or protein sequence, and L j the length of the jth sequence in this complete genome. Then we can form a composition vector for a genome using p(α 1 α 2 ...α K ) as components for all possible K-mers α 1 α 2 ...α K . We use p i to denote the i-th component corresponding to the mer type i, i = 1,..., N (N mers are arranged in a fixed order as the alphabetical order). In this way we construct a composition vector p = (p 1 , p 2 ,..., p N ) for a genome. Yu et al [33] considered an idea from the theory of dynamical language that a K-mer s 1 s 2 ...s K is possibly constructed by adding a letter s K to the end of the (K-1) -mer s 1 s 2 ...s K-1 or a letter s 1 to the beginning of the (K-1)-mer s 2 s 3 ...s K . After counting the observed frequencies for all (K-1)-mers and the four or 20 kinds of letters, the expected frequency of appearance of K-mers is predicted by where p(s 1 ) and p(s K )are frequencies of nucleotides or amino acids s 1 and s K appearing in this genome. Then q(s 1 s 2 ...s K ) of all 4 K or 20 K K-mers is viewed as the noise background. We then subtract the noise background by defining The transformation X = (p/q)-1 has the desired effect of subtraction of random background in p and rendering it a stationary time series suitable for subsequent cross-correlation analysis. X can also be regarded as the relative difference between p and q. Then we use X(s 1 s 2 ...s K ) for all possible K-mers s 1 s 2 ...s K as components and arrange them according to a fixed alphabetical order to form a composition vector X = (X 1 ,X 2 ,...,X N ) for genome X, and likewise Y = (Y 1 ,Y 2 ,...,Y N ) for genome Y. Then we view the N components in the vectors X and Y as samples of these two random variables respectively. The sample correlation C(X, Y) between any two genomes X and Yis defined in the usual way. The dissimilarity D(X, Y) between the two genomes is then defined by D(X, Y) = (1 -C(X, Y))/2. A dissimilarity matrix for all the genomes under study is then generated for the construction of phylogenetic trees. This method to construct phylogenetic tree is referred to as the dynamical language (DL) method [33] . Finally, for convenience to compare the results with those of the previous works, based on the distance matrices, we construct all trees for data sets 1 and 2 using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method [51] in the softwares Phylip [52] (version 3.66) and SplitsTree4 [51] (version 4.10).
