Cells and transfection. HEK293T cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (HyClone) supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator. The cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids. Full-length HA-tagged Ub mutants, in which all but one Lys residue (HA-K48-Ub or HA-K63-Ub) was replaced with Arginine (Arg), were the gifts of Tomohiko Ohta (St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Japan) 55 . pcDNA3.1-Flag-Ub and the IPS-1 expression vector were previously described 56, 57 . The expression plasmids for wild-type RIG-I (pEF-Flag-RIG-I), its constitutively active mutant (pEF-Flag-RIG-I-N), and p125-Luc (IFN-β -Luc) were kindly provided by T. Fujita (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan) 58 . The luciferase report plasmid (PRDIII-I) 4 -Luc for IRF3 was kindly provided by S. Ludwig (Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany) 59 . The pNF-κ B-Luc reporter for NF-κ B, the pISRE-Luc reporter for ISRE, and the internal control plasmid phRL-TK were purchased from Stratagene. The HA or Myc epitope tag was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCAGGS-MCS 60 vector to generate the pCAGGS-HA or pCAGGS-Myc plasmid, respectively, encoding an N-terminal HA or Myc tag, respectively. To construct pCAGGS-HA/Myc/USP15, the cDNA fragment encoding full-length USP15 was amplified by PCR (GenBank accession no. NM_006313) and inserted into the pCAGGS-HA or pCAGGS-Myc plasmid. The mutagenesis of individual amino acid residues (C269A and H862A) in USP15 was performed with overlap extension PCR. The detailed sequences of the specific primers used are available upon request. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing.
