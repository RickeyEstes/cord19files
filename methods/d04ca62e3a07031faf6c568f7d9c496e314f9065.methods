To explore and discuss the current state of knowledge in this area of interest, an exploration of the literature was performed to provide a narrative. A systematic review or meta-analysis was not performed as this is an exploratory review of the common themes within this topic, to identify directions for further research. This included a search for works published in English available via MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Ovid, for the years 2004 through to September 2015. Search terms included; infection control/prevention and emergency department(s), triage, and transmission based precautions and emergency department(s), and triage. The date range selected was to take into consideration the effect that recent epidemic/pandemics may have had on ED practice. Identified articles were used to select additional key terms for further searches. Other relevant articles were identified from the bibliographies of these papers. Articles and documents sought in the review were those that examined the identification of conditions caused or likely to be caused by important pathogens and subsequent implementation of appropriate IPC measures at triage and during admission to the ED. More specifically the search was to identify literature that: examined the implementation of TBP upon presentation and admission to the ED to prevent transmission to both health care workers (HCW) and other patients/visitors; and relevant specifically to pathogens transmitted via the contact, droplet and airborne routes and their associated IPC practices in non-emergency (i.e. not mass casualty, epidemic, pandemic, or bioterrorism) situations in the ED setting. Conference abstracts were excluded from the search.
