Data acquisition. I downloaded the raw intensity microarray data (CEL files) of 25 old subjects (age $ 60 years) and 15 young subjects (age # 45 years) posted at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number: GSE11882) 5 . Data processing. I processed the original raw intensity data (CEL files) using the Expression Console software by Affymetrix with the library for the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chip, and choosing the RMA algorithm (510 (k) FDA approved) with the standard settings. Statistical methods. I first assessed the quality of the data by examining the expression of all housekeeping genes by all 40 subjects (25 old and 15 young). With regard to the housekeeping genes, there was no statistically significant differential expression between the two groups (Supplementary Table 7 ). As can be seen by the results of K-Means clustering analysis in Fig. 1a , the two groups cannot be discriminated based on the expression of the housekeeping genes. Having, thus, established the quality of the data, I investigated for any differential expression among all gene variables using three different and independent methods. 1) Using a methodology that I have developed and introduced previously 38-42 , I performed ROC curve analysis on all gene variables in order to assess their discriminating power with respect to the two groups (old vs. young), and with respect to this method, I set statistical significance at ROC AUC $ 0.920. Table 8 . In order to minimize the number of false negatives in the case of the third method 43, 44 , for the final selection of significant variables, I imposed the condition that if a given gene variable met the significance criteria of all three methods, or those of the first method and those of only one of the other two methods, it would be deemed significant. Excluding multiplicities (different transcripts that corresponded to the same genes), thirty six genes made up the final list of the most significantly differentially expressed genes between the two groups, as assessed by the aforementioned three different and independent methods of statistical significance (Table 1) . In greater detail, to assess statistical significance, I used to assess statistical significance, I used the following three different and independent methods. 1) ROC curve analysis. I performed ROC curve analysis on all gene variables in order to assess their discriminating power with respect to the two groups (old vs. young), and with respect to this method, I set statistical significance at ROC AUC $ 0.920. 2) Fold Change. For all gene variables, I defined fold change (FC) as the mean expression value of the old subjects over the mean expression value of the young subjects, and I set statistical Y) . 3) P-value. I used the independent t-Test for parametric gene variables (both normality and homogeneity of variance conditions were met); the Aspin-Welch unequal-variance test (AW) for gene variables that met the normality condition but not the homogeneity of variance condition; and the Mann-Whitney U test (MW) for the non-parametric gene variables, i.e., for those variables that i) the normality condition was not met or ii) the normality and the homogeneity of variance conditions were not met. Taking into account that there are 54,675 probe sets (including those of the housekeeping genes) in the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chip, and using the Bonferroni correction, I set the significance level for the entire study at a 5 9.15 3 10 27 . Therefore, in order for any variable to be deemed significant according to the P-value method, the following condition must be met: P , a. Regarding the Mann-Whitney U test (MW), since none of the non-parametric variables had any sets of ties (a subject from one group having the same expression value as a subject from the other group), I used the exact probability for all MW tests. Incorporating the three aforementioned independent methods of statistical significance assessment, and in order to minimize the number of false negatives in the case of the third method 43, 44 , I set the overall significance criterion as follows: in order for any variable to be included in the final list of the most significant variables, it would have to meet the significance criteria of the first method (ROC AUC $ 0.920) and those of at least one of the other two methods [FC $ 1.10 (or FC # 0.91) and/or P , 9.15 3 10 27 ]. Mathematical modeling. Utilizing the final 36 most significant genes, I wanted to explore the possibility of developing -via mathematical modeling -a function that could identify as correctly as possible the age status (O or Y) of an unknown subject based on the expression of any combination of those 36 most significant genes. To that end, I randomly selected approximately 70% of the subjects [11/15 young subjects and 18/25 old subjects] that could be used only for the development phase of such function. In other words, a function could be developed only by the exclusive use of those 29 subjects. The remaining 11 subjects (4 young and 7 old ones) were designated unknown (test) subjects and were used solely for the purpose of validating any promising function generated in the development phase. This split into two fixed sets, whereby one is used only for training and the other only for validation, represents the simplest implementation of K-fold cross validation 45, 46 . A function was deemed promising in the development phase only if it exhibited a sensitivity $ 0.90 and a specificity $ 0.90 in connection with the 29 subjects of the development phase. Pertaining to the validation phase, and in connection with the 11 unknown subjects, a promising function would have to exhibit the same minimum classification accuracy (a sensitivity $ 0.90 and a specificity $ 0.90) in order to be accepted. I was able to generate one such function (F 1 -henceforward also referred to as super variable) that fulfilled all of the aforementioned criteria. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the equation of F 1 as a function of 7 genes. The cut-off score of the F 1 was determined by taking into account the results of the following two analyses: 1) calculation of the optimal point on the ROC curve based on the 29 F 1 scores of the 29 subjects used in the development phase [optimal point is defined as the point with the highest sensitivity and the lowest false positive rate (1specificity)] and 2) calculation of the 99.99% confidence intervals for the mean F 1 scores of the two groups (O and Y) of those 29 subjects and their respective standard deviations. The 99.99% confidence intervals were calculated based on a bootstrap sample size of 100,000. Taking into account the aforementioned ROC optimal point, as well as the relative overlap of MO and MY [MO 5 LLO -SDO and MY 5 ULY 1 SDY] (LLO: the 99.99% confidence lower limit for the mean of the O group; SDO: standard deviation of the O group; ULY: the 99.99% confidence upper limit for the mean of the Y group; SDY: standard deviation of the Y group), the cut-off score of the F 1 super variable was determined to be 53.450. If a subject's F 1 score is , 53.450, then that subject is classified as Y (young); otherwise, if the F 1 score is $ 53.450, then that subject is classified as O (old). It should be pointed out here that, based on the equation of the F 1 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), a given F 1 score is just a numerical value and does not signify age or number of years. In addition to the main validation method explained above, and in order to further assess the performance of the F 1 super variable, I employed two other and different cross validation methods: 1) a 10-fold cross validation and 2) a leave-one-out cross validation 47 . Both of those methods yielded a misclassification rate of 0.05 and a mean-squared error of 0.05 in connection with the F 1 super variable. The results of those methods, along with the confusion matrices generated by them, are shown in Supplementary Table 9 . As can be seen in Supplementary Table 9 , each one of those two and different validation methods resulted in a correct classification of all of the young subjects and in a correct classification of all but two of the old subjects. Computer software. All analyses in this study were carried out with custom software written in MATLAB R2012b. All computer programs in connection with the model were also created using MATLAB R2012b.
