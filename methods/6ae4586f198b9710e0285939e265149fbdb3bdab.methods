Ethics statement. All animal work was conducted in strict accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines. The University Health Network (UHN) has certification with the Animals for Research Act (Permit Number: #0045 and #0085 of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs) and follows NIH guidelines (OLAW #A5408-01). The animal use protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) of the UHN. Infections and subsequent sample collection were performed under 5% isofluorane anesthesia in an effort to minimize suffering. Infection and ferret monitoring. Maintenance and monitoring of infected ferrets has been previously described 23 . Briefly, male ferrets 4-6 months old were bred in an on-site SPF ferret colony (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada). Prior to infection, all ferrets were screened for influenza and shown to be seronegative by HI assay against circulating influenza A and B strains (2010-2011 WHO Influenza Reagent Kit for Identification of Influenza Isolates (WHO collaborating center for surveillance, epidemiology and control for influenza infection division)). The kits contain the circulating influenza strains for the particular year. Prior to infection, ferrets were randomly selected and pair-housed in cages contained in bioclean portable laminar-flow clean-room enclosures (Lab Products, Seaford, DE) in the BSL-2 animal holding area. Baseline body temperature and weight were measured on Day 0 for each animal. Temperatures were measured by using a subcutaneous implantable temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE). Upon infection, ferrets were anesthetized and infected 1mL of virus preparation for each ferret (0.5mL in each nostril). Ferrets were infected with Marton/43 (N 5 12), FM/47 (N 5 10), USSR/77 (N 5 12), Taiwan/86 (N 5 10), NCal/99 (N 5 14) , and NY/09 (N 5 12). All viruses were used at 10 5 EID 50 except for FM/47 which was infected at 10 6 EID 50 since it was reported to be a milder virus 14 . Clinical signs (body temperature, body weight, level of activity, nasal discharge, and sneezing) were observed daily for 14 days pI. We examined animals at the same time each day for consistency. Nasal discharge includes crusty nose, mucous, and transparent exudates/ fluids. The scores were calculated from the total animals displaying any nasal discharge symptom over the total number of animals. The sneezing scores were calculated from the total animals found sneezing over the total number of animals. Scores were calculated daily for 14 days and only the peak values for each infection are www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1698 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01698 summarized. The inactivity scoring system is based on the reference Reuman et al., 1989 59 to assess the inactivity level: 0, alert and playful; 0.5, alert but playful only when stimulated; 1, alert but not playful when stimulated; 2, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index was calculated as follows: S (day 1 to day 14) [score11] n /S (day 1 to day 14) n, where n equals the total number of observations. A value of 1 was added to each observation unit score so that a score of 0 could be divided by a denominator, resulting in an index value of 1.0 as the minimum value. Determination of influenza specific antibody responses. Influenza specific antibody responses from the uninfected or infected ferrets were measured by HI as previously described 23 . Briefly, receptor destroying enzyme ([RDE], Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY, USA) treated ferret anti-sera was serially diluted and HI titers were determined by the highest dilution that completely inhibited influenza hemagglutination (4HAU) of turkey erythrocytes. Comparative analysis of hemagglutinin sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of influenza hemagglutinin DNA sequences were conducted in MEGA5 60 using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model 61 , 500 bootstrap repetitions were performed. To analyze the protein similarity of influenza hemagglutinin from different H1N1 strains, the aminoacid sequences from the protein region HA135-295 were aligned using ClustalW2 62 . This region of the HA protein is part of the hemagglutinin receptor binding domain (HA-RBD), which is located in the external surface of the virus and it concentrates most of the antigenic potential of the HA protein 36 .
