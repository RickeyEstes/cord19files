For all hospitals that had admitted SARS patients in Hong Kong, the numbers of probable SARS patients and of hospital staff in three job categories were obtained. These three categories included nurses (group N), nonmedical support staff (group S; healthcare assistants, ward assistants [cleaning staff], general service assistant SARS in Three Categories of Hospital Workers, Hong Kong [clerical staff]), and other medical or technical staff (group O; physicians, allied health workers, technicians, pharmacists, dieticians, radiologists, radiographers, and medical students, and the like). All were full-time staff. The Hospital Authority and individual hospitals kept lists of infected workers who were hospital staff members. These lists were provided to the authors, with data already grouped into the three categories and the two time periods; no further breakdown of the data was available. Most data were obtained from the Hospital Authority; supplementary data were obtained from a few hospitals. The number of these three types of workers who became probable SARS patients, according to the World Health Organization definition (1), was recorded. These figures were further stratified into two groups: patients whose onset of symptoms occurred 1) before April 17, or 2) on or after April 17, which was approximately the mid-point of the epidemic. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to test the significance of differences in proportions. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to examine the association between the number of SARS patients admitted into a hospital and the number of healthcare workers who contracted SARS in the same hospital. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare differences in attack rates among the three types of workers. SPSS for Windows Release 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for the data analysis; p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Differences in attack rates among the 16 hospitals were tested by using Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (StatXact-4 version 4.0.1, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA).
