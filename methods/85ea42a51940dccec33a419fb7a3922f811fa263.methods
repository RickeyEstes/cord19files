The original epidemic curve excluded those cases without a history for date of onset of illness, whereas re-analysis included these cases and plotted cases on an epidemic curve substituting the date of presentation to hospital for date of onset of illness. During the early phase (import and escalation phases) of the outbreak, case definition was in accordance with the Ministry of Health criteria 6 in the absence of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and a serology test. Re-analysis, therefore, also included cases initially excluded if they did not fulfil the Ministry of Health diagnostic criteria of SARS 6 requiring cases with contact history of either direct case contact or contact with an endemic area. These cases were now reclassified according to WHO criteria, 7 with cases classified as 'probable' cases only where their signs and symptoms were in accordance with criteria for one of three WHO definitions for 'probable' SARS. All 5327 cases available from the SARS epidemic database, collated by the Disease Control and Prevention Centre, Beijing, 6 were now included in the epidemic curve. Cases were categorized into 15 occupational groups, with restaurants combined with hospitality services and the military and police services combined. 8 Re-analysis included an epidemic curve for 'probable' SARS cases only and calculations of the Beijing population-based rate, stratified by age and sex, using the Fifth General Census of China (version 2000). The original analysis did not include a spot map. Re-analysis included cases plotted for 18 geographic areas with rates calculated per 100,000 residents and then regrouped into three geographic areas according to distance from the city centre: inner city, 5-10 km, and more than 10 km from the inner city. Denominator data were not available to calculate specific exposure rates, such as number of hospitalized patients for a healthcare-acquired infection rate, number of healthcare workers for an occupationally acquired rate or healthcare worker hours for occupationally acquired rate per hours of exposure. The epidemiologic curves were developed using Microsoft Excel 2000, and SPSS version 10 was used to calculate case fatality rates (CFR), odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals for proportions, rates, odds and rates, and tests for significance.
