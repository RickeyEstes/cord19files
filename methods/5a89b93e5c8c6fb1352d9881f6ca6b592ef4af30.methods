Chemicals and Reagents. All toxins were purchased from List Biological Laboratories. FP59 was a kind gift from S. Leppla (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). An FDA-approved drug library comprising of 1,581 drugs was purchased from Johns Hopkins, titled, Johns Hopkins Clinical Compound Library (JHCCL) version 1.0. The drugs arrived as 10 mM stock solutions in sealed microtiter plates and were made using DMSO or water as solvents. Drugs were arrayed in 96-well plates and screened at a stock concentration of 10 mM. The library was stored at − 20 °C until use. Prior to use, the library of drugs was thawed at 25 °C. Compounds that were determined to be compounds of interest, were isolated and reproduced from 10 mM solutions. Amodiaquine, Chloroquine, Cinchonine, Primaquine, and Quinidine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All drugs were prepared at 10 mM using DMSO as a solvent. Desethyl-amodiaquine and desethyl-chloroquine were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. Anti-N-terminal MEK-2, anti-tubulin, and anti-PA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Purified human cathepsin B protein used for NMR experiments was purchased from ACROBiosystems. Cellular Drug Screens. RAW264.7-pGIPZ(− ) 2 mouse macrophage cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Bioexpress) and 100 μ g/mL penicillin and 100 μ g/mL streptomycin. RAW264.7-pGIPZ(− ) cells (10,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates (100 μ l/well) 24 hours before the assay. During the drug library screen assay, 0.75 μ l of 3.3 mM drugs were added to 150 μ l of cell-containing media to achieve 16 μ M of each compound per well. Cells were treated with compounds for 1 hour at 37 °C 5%CO 2 , and then challenged with anthrax toxins, such that the final toxins concentrations were 0.5 μ g/ml. Cells were treated with toxin and drugs for 6 hours. As rodent cells are resistant to diphtheria toxin, C32 human melanoma cell line was used for diphtheria toxin screening, where cells were treated with 2 μ g/ml for 24 hours. Determination of cell viability by 3-(4,5-dim ethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed as described 46 . Cell viability is shown as the percentage of surviving cells obtained relative to cells treated with DMSO (100%). FRET MAPKKide LF activity. For drug testing in 96-well plates, the reaction volume was 250 μ l per well, containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 5 μ M MAPKKide conjugated with DABYL and FITC (List Biological Laboratories, Inc), and 3.3 μ M of JHCCL compound. The reaction was initiated by adding LF to a final concentration of 6 μ g/ml. Kinetic measurements were obtained at 37 ºC every 40 sec for 40 min using a fluorescent plate reader. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 nm and 523 nm, respectively, with a cutoff wavelength of 495 nm. Toxins Treatments. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells/well 1 d before toxin treatment. Various concentrations of LF or FP59 combined with a fixed concentration of PA (500 ng/mL) were added to the wells, and cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. In other toxin treatment experiments, cells were pre-treated with various concentrations of drugs, and then treated with constant concentrations of 8.3 μ g/ml of C. difficile toxin B, 500 ng/ml of P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A, or 500 ng/ml of Cholera toxin for 6 hours. RAW264.7 survival was measured by MTT assay. Each data point shown for MTT assays indicates the mean ± SD value obtained in triplicate assays done in a representative experiment. At least three such experiments were routinely carried out. MEK Cleavage Assay. RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with 66.67 μM of AQ for 1 hour. Following the pre-treatment, the cells exposed to 1 μg/mL of PA and LF at 37 °C for up to two hours in the presence of 16.67 μ M of AQ. The cells were then washed with cold PBS for 5× and lysed with RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cell lysates were quantified using the BCA protein quantification kit (Pierce) and loaded onto 4-12% denaturing gels (Criterion XT Precast Gel, Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis for several hours, the gel was transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes; membranes were probed with anti-MEK-2 or anti tubulin antibodies. Quantitative Western blot analyses of the bands were accomplished using the VersaDoc 1000 instrument (Bio-Rad) or Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Biochemical Assay of PA Binding and Internalization. Cells were pre-treated with AQ as described above for 1 h, either at 4 °C for PA binding or at 37 °C for PA internalization assays cells were exposed to 1 μ g/mL of PA at 4 °C for 1 h for binding assay or at 37 °C for 1 h for internalization assay. Cells were then washed with PBS solution three times and lysed in RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Western blot analysis was performed using anti-PA antibody anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Chemiluminescence of bands and their relative intensities were revealed using a VersaDoc 1000 instrument (Bio-Rad). Caspase-1 Activity Assay. Cells were treated with AQ for 1 h before addition of 500 ng/ml LF-PA for an additional 2 h. FAM FLICA ™ Caspase 1 Assay Kit was obtained from ImmunoChemistry Technologies LLC. FLICA reagent was added for 1 h. FLICA fluorescence was visualized as follows: cells were washed three times in PBS, fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, and examined under a fluorescence microscope (DM5500 B; Leica). Staining Cells with Lysosensor Green DND-189. Cells were treated with AQ for 1 h before an addition of 500 ng/ml PA for an additional hour and then stained with Lysosensor Green DND-189 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and fluorescence was visualized as follows: cells were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, and examined under a fluorescence microscope (DM5500 B; Leica). Cathepsin B Activity Assay. Cathepsin B activity in total cell lysates was determined using an InnoZyme ™ cathepsin B activity assay kit (EMD Milipore) and performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cathepsin B activity in cellular lysates was tested in the following way: RAW264.7 cells untreated with drugs were lysed, and equal amount of cathepsin B containing protein lysate was added to the substrate solution (EMD Milipore) with and without AQ, CQ, DEAQ, or DECQ at concentrations of 4, 8, 16, 33, or 66 μ M. Cellular cathepsin B activity with and without drugs was tested by pre-treating cells with drugs for 1 hour, followed by lysing cells and testing cathepsin B activity with a fluorescently labeled substrate. The activity of 0.5 ng/μ l of purified human cathepsin B was mixed with and without drugs without pre-incubation and detected with a fluorescently labeled substrate. Fluorescence intensity indicating cathepsin B activity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm (Molecular Devices, Spectra Max 384 PLUS).
