We used the Human Genome NCBI build 36 version 1, the reference Mouse sequence for C57BL/6J (NCBI build 36) , and Escherichia coli strain K-12 substrain MG1655 (accession number U00096). See additional file 4 for all the build numbers and accession IDs of the genomes for Figure 1 . All genomes sequences can be found on ftp:// ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/. The build number for all the bacteria genomes for Figure 2 can be found in our additional file 5. Genome statistics are based on all chromosomes and reverse complement strands for each organism.
