We investigated homologous relationships between pairs of residue segments. In total, 1612 non-membrane proteins from PDB_SELECT25 ([issued on 25 September 2001] Hobohm and Sander, 1994) were used in the analysis. In this non-redundant data set, no pair of sequences shares sequence identity of more than 25%. The solvent-accessible area for each residue was calculated using the DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983 ) algorithm for every protein. A protein sequence is treated as a succession of residue segments. As the residue-residue correlation is notable in 15-residue segments (Liu et al., 2003) , we used a window width of 15 for further consideration. By sliding a 15-residue window along the protein sequence, each segment of the data set serves as a query segment.
