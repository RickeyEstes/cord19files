An exhaustive literature search of the US National Library of Medicine's PubMed database from January 1966 to October 2007 was conducted without language restrictions. The key search terms used were ''religion,'' ''culture,'' ''hand hygiene,'' ''hand washing,'' ''hygiene,'' ''alcohol-based hand rub,'' ''Buddhism,'' ''Christianity,'' ''Hinduism,'' ''Islam,'' ''Judaism,'' ''Orthodox Christianity,'' and ''Sikhism.'' Bibliographies of retrieved articles were also hand-searched for additional studies. Relevant books on culture and health were consulted as well. Leaders from the most important religions affiliated with the World Council of Churches (a fellowship of churches associated in an ecumenical movement to promote Christian unity) and the Muslim World League (an Islamic nongovernmental organization that promotes Islamic unity) were individually consulted to gather knowledge regarding the importance of hygiene, hand hygiene, and alcohol prohibition within the precepts and holy texts of their faiths. A total of 2332 articles were retrieved through the Medline search. Many of the articles referred to ''culture'' in the microbiological sense and had to be eliminated, together with numerous articles restricted to mental health. Of the remaining articles, only 27 referred to cultural and/or religious aspects influencing health, in particular hygiene, hand hygiene practices, and alcohol prohibition according to the most important religions; these were retained for review. The literature review and consultation with religious leaders were performed by 2 of the authors (B.A. and D.P.), who identified the relevant issues to be considered and then brought these to the attention of the task force members through a formal consensus process. The task force comprised experts in infection control and behavioral theories, as well as anthropologists and psychiatrists. They met in April 2005 and were consulted by e-mail and telephone in 2006 and 2007 to finalize the article after an additional literature search.
