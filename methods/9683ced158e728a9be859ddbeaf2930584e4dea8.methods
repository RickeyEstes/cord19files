Filovirus-specific antisera generated from ERBs. The bats used to generate the filovirus-specific antisera in this study originated from an ERB breeding colony 35 . A total of 124 ERBs were divided into seven groups (Table 1) (Table 2) , prepared in 0.25 mL of sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). After eight weeks, the bat groups were subcutaneously challenged with 4 log 10 TCID 50 of homologous virus. The bats were euthanized two to four weeks thereafter by cardiac exsanguination under isoflurane anesthesia, followed by an overdose of isoflurane. Whole blood collected into serum separator tubes (Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) at euthanasia was allowed to clot and then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min. The sera were transferred into polypropylene CryoElite Wheaton vials (DWK Life Sciences, Millville, NJ, USA), and then temporarily stored under liquid nitrogen vapors in the biosafety level four laboratory (BSL-4) until they were double bagged, passed through a dunk tank containing 5% Micro-Chem Plus (National Chemical www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Laboratories Incorporated, Inc., Philadelphia, PA, USA) and transported to the gamma-cell irradiator. The doublebagged serum aliquots were sandwiched between layers of dry ice and then exposed to 5 × 10 6 rads of gamma-cell irradiation using a cobalt-60 source. Filovirus-naïve sera collected from ERBs. Sera obtained from filovirus-naïve bats from the breeding colony and negative control bats from previous experimental studies 33, [35] [36] [37] were used as filovirus-naïve sera. These sera were collected and processed in the same manner as outlined above. Husbandry. All bats were group-housed according to filovirus inoculum in a climate controlled BSL-4 animal area, with a 12 h day/12 h night cycle. Bats received a quantity of fresh fruit, supplemented with protein/vitamin powder, equal to their body mass daily and water ad libitum. (Table 3 ) and uninfected control antigen lysate for the filovirus IgG indirect ELISAs were prepared as previously described [38] [39] [40] . Briefly, roller bottles of Vero E6 cells were inoculated with virus and the cultures were harvested when ≥90% of cells exhibited evidence of infection by immunofluorescence assay. Filovirus antigen lysates were prepared from the cultures by detergent basic buffer extraction of infected cells. Uninfected control antigen lysate was generated in the absence of virus, but otherwise prepared in the exact same manner.
