Data was obtained from the NHC for the period 10 th January to 8 th February, 2020. The NHC is a cabinet-level executive department under the State Council of China which is responsible for public health, medical services and health emergencies in China. Data from before the 10 th January was not included in this analysis because cases identified before 10 th January were based on symptomatic diagnosis and no standardized testing method was available. Although the NHC provides information on suspected and confirmed cases, only data from confirmed cases was used in this analysis, to avoid confusion of routine seasonal influenza cases with nCoV. 13 Confirmed cases were analysed using by applying four different estimation techniques, to allow for different assumptions about epidemic growth and the epidemiology of the disease: • Exponential growth (EG), which assumes an exponential growth curve to the virus and estimates the basic reproduction number from the Lotka-Euler equation 14 • Maximum likelihood method (ML), in which the likelihood of the cases is expressed directly in terms of " on the assumption of a simple SIR model structure 15 • Sequential Bayesian Method (SB), in which the posterior probability distribution of the basic reproduction number is estimated sequentially using the posterior at the previous time point as the new prior 16 • Time-dependent reproduction numbers (TD), in which the basic reproduction number at any time point is estimated as an average of accumulated estimates at previous time points 17 These methods were implemented using the R0 package in R. 18 All these models require no assumption about recovery time, but in some cases require an assumption about the generation time of the epidemic. All methods were applied to the data for the whole period (January 10 th to February 8 th ), to the period only before the closure (January 10 th to January 23 rd ), and to only the period after the closure of Wuhan city (January 23 rd to February 8 th ) Because some of these methods are driven by a Suceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, but an asymptomatic latent phase had been identified in the early progress of the disease, we also estimated the basic reproduction number using a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. An analytic expression for the basic reproduction number was obtained from the model using next generation matrices, 19 and predictions of cumulative cases were fitted to the data on national cases using maximum likelihood estimation to identify the optimal value of " . 20 A Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo sampling method 21 was used to estimate a credible interval for the basic reproduction number. In this model the latent phase was fixed to last 5.2 days, 8 and the recovery period was fixed at 7 days. Although the biological recovery period of the disease has not been clearly established, the period from onset of symptoms to isolation in specialist hospitals was assumed to be 7 days, and the recovery compartment of the SEIR model acts as a proxy for isolation in these models. All MH estimates used 20,000 Monte Carlo Iterations with a burn-in period of 5,000 iterations and a normally distributed proposal distribution. Because all five modeling methods use different assumptions and tools and are likely to produce widely varying estimates of the basic reproduction number based on different aspects of the epidemic process, we combined all five estimates to produce an overall value for the basic reproduction number. We calculated a weighted average of the five basic reproduction numbers by calculating weights from a Poisson loss function, 22 which is similar to a Poisson likelihood but which was not used for estimation of parameters in any of the models. We also estimated a weighted standard error from the models. Where standard errors do not overlap point estimates in the pre-and post-closure periods, we conclude there is a significant difference in the epidemic process between the periods. Finally, we estimated the predicted epidemic trend from all models in each period, and plotted these against the observed number of cases for each period. Mathematical details of the models are presented in the supplementary appendix. All results are presented as values of the basic reproduction number with its 95% confidence interval. For the MH method the inter-quartile range of the posterior distribution of " is presented.
