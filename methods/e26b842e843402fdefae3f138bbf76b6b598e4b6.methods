The procedures were as follows: (a) Coating of wells of the microtiter plate with the first antibody. 0.05 M carbonate buffer solution, pH 9.6, was used to dilute rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum to 1:15, normal rabbit serum to 1:lO and 1,380 sera of healthy adults to 1:2 which were then used to coat wells of microtiter plates separately with 100 pi/well and placed at 37Â°C for 2 h. To the naked eye, the blank control appeared colorless, the negative result appeared light yellow and the positive result appeared from deep yellow to brown. A spectrophotometer for ELISA (MB-1 type, Beijing), with a wave-length of 492 nm, was used to determine the P/N ratio (positive value/negative value). The substrate control was adjusted to 0. The negative serum control (normal rabbit serum) was 0.05. The positive serum control (rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum) was 0.12. Those tested sera showing deep yellow to brown color and higher P/N ratios were considered
