As CV method does not use sequence alignment, statistical re-sampling cannot be carried out in the usual way of random choice of nucleotide or amino acid sites with replacement. Instead, we pick up proteins at random from the pool of all proteins in the genome of an organism. We used four datasets of protein sequences encoded in the genome: On each of these datasets, jackknife and bootstrap tests are performed in the following way. In the CV method, a species is represented by a composition vector made of overlapping K-residues, designated as "K-peptides" hereafter, from all proteins in the genome. To do jackknife tests, we first take randomly 90% of proteins from the whole protein pool. This is done for all species and a CVTree is constructed by carrying out the crucial "subtraction procedure" (1). The topological distance between this tree and the original CVTree inferred from the whole protein pool is calculated. This re-sampling is performed 100 times and the average topological distance between these 100 trees and the original 100% CVTree at the same K is taken. Then the protein fraction is decreased to 80%, 70%, …, 10% and the average topological distance at a given K is plotted against the protein fraction (Figure 1) . Suppose a species' genome contains M protein products. In order to do bootstrap tests, the same number M proteins are drawn at random from the pool. The drawing is done with replacement, i.e., some proteins may be drawn repeatedly and some others may be skipped at all. The topological distance between a bootstrap tree and the original CVTree with the same K is calculated. Again the average topological distance of 100 bootstrap trees is retained as the final result (see the discussion of Figure 2 below). In doing a bootstrap test, the probability that a designated protein is drawn at the first try is 1/M; the probability of its being skipped is 1 1/M. The probability of its being dropped at M tries is (1 1/M) M and the probability of being drawn is 1 (1 1/M) M . At the limit of very big M, the latter goes to 1 1/e 0.63212, where e=2.71828 is the base of natural logarithm. This means that in performing a bootstrap test, though M proteins are drawn from the pool on average, only 63.21% of the protein assortment is kept. Therefore, we superimpose the results of bootstrap tests for various K conditionally against protein fraction 0.6321 in Figure 1 of jackknife tests. We used the topological distance to measure the difference between phylogenetic trees. The definition of topological distance could be found in the previous literature (14, 15) . An unrooted tree with N terminal leaves has N 3 internal edges. Cutting any of these internal edges defines a split of the set of leaves into two subsets. To measure the distance between two trees constructed for the same set of leaves, we compare the two lists of split-trees obtained by cutting each of the N 3 internal edges. If the two lists are identical up to reordering, the two trees have the same topology and the topological distance d T =0. In general, the topological distance is defined as (16) : d T = 2×(number of distinct split-trees) The factor 2 was introduced to incorporate more general cases of multi-furcating nodes (CV method yields only bifurcating trees). Therefore, if the two trees have entirely different topologies, the topological distance between them reaches the maximal value d T = 2×(N 3). We have written a program to implement the definition of topological distance. In fact, we adopt a relative topological distance by dividing the calculated d T by its maximal possible value 2×(N 3), thus the factor 2 drops out and the relative distance varies between 0 and 1.
