Information about the ventilation system settings and restaurant size were not available, so we could not perform computational fluid dynamics simulations [25, 26] or multi-zone modelling [27, 28] of fluid dynamics analyses to determine the infection risk due to the airborne route; we instead investigated whether the fomite route could produce similar spatial attack rate patterns. Specifically, we applied a multi-agent model to simulate the transmission of noroviruses from the index patient to susceptible hosts via surface contact and calculated the exposure doses and infection risks. Seven representative serving pathways of waiters were considered under different scenarios, using various values for two important parameters: the dose-response parameter on the mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tracts, Î· m , and the viral load, L 0 . For each scenario, least-squares fitting was used to compare the distributions of the predicted infection risks with those of the reported attack rates.
