A literature review was conducted of infectious disease risks in China, and with a focus on [1] : recent outbreaks including the 2003 SARS outbreak and the H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks and [2] diseases identified as highly relevant for Chinese VFR travellers. Only diseases identified as highly relevant for Chinese VFR travellers, either due to a known increased risk for VFR travellers in general [26] or relevance across multiple urban and rural regions of China, were explored. The diseases identified include hepatitis A and B, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Hepatitis A and B and tuberculosis are prevalent across China [27, 28] , and tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid are all known to disproportionately affect VFR travellers [7] . The Medline database Published literature were retrieved from the Medline database for each included disease using a combination of keywords and MeSH headings, for example, 'SARS' and 'China' or 'Hong Kong'. Articles were assessed using their titles and abstracts and selected for possible inclusion based on their relevance. Articles potentially relevant to travel health, articles discussing the spread of the outbreak, and articles discussing potential future outbreaks in China or Hong Kong were considered for inclusion. All study designs, including review papers, were considered for inclusion. As H7N9 was a new outbreak virus that had only caused outbreaks in China, no restriction of the search to articles on China was applied. Articles published before 31 March 2014 were included. Studies were restricted to English language. References of all relevant articles, including reviews, were checked to identify additional studies. We also searched the grey literature, including the WHO, CDC and Australian government websites for information on infectious risks of relevance to Chinese VFR travellers. In addition, a general overview of other infectious disease risks present in China, according to the WHO, CDC and Australian government websites, was prepared. To provide a geographical reference for readers unfamiliar with the location of Chinese provinces, maps showing the origins of the recent SARS and avian influenza outbreaks were prepared. Maps of selected diseases which have a geographically uneven distribution were also prepared from data identified in the literature review indicating affected provinces.
