We consider the population on the Diamond Princess ship as a close cohort with N = 3711 individuals. Following [6], we simulate the transmission process stochastically. For a given COVID-19 case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the number of secondary cases follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution with a mean at Reff(t) and a dispersion parameter at k [7] . The Reff(t) is the effective reproduction number, and Reff(t) = R0[N -C(t)]/N, where C(t) is the cumulative number of cases at the t-th day and R0 is the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 to be estimated. The time delay between symptom onset dates of a primary case and any of its associated secondary cases is the serial interval (SI). Hence, for a given primary case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the symptom onset time of each associated secondary case is expected to be the summation of t and SI of COVID-19. It is conventional to assume the SI to follow a Gamma distribution with mean at 4.5 days and standard deviation (SD) at 3.1 days [8, 9] . We collect the confirmed cases time series released in the situation reports of COVID-19 infections in Japan [5] . We simulate the courses of the COVID-19 outbreaks stochastically starting from one infectious index case on January 20, 2020. We calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of R0 and k by fitting model to the number of confirmed cases with Poisson-distributed likelihood framework. The 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of R0 and k are calculated by using the profile likelihood estimation framework with a cutoff threshold determined using a Chi-square quantile [10] . We repeat the fitting and estimation procedures above under an alternative scenario with mean SI at 7.5 days and SD at 3.4 days, which was estimated in [2] . We evaluate the modelling performance .

Under the later scenario with mean SI at 7.5 days, we find that the R0 is larger than 5 which is not in line with WHO estimates and hard to justify in a 'quarantine' setting. In particular, the later scenario yields a higher AIC by 10 units than the former scenario with mean SI at 4.5 days. Thus, we argue the former scenario is most likely the reality, and consider it as the main results. Furthermore, we consider four 'what-if' scenarios and they were • scenario (0): the best-fit model, i.e., baseline scenario; • scenario (1): 1000 susceptibles were removed on February 11, 2020; • scenario (2): the R0 was reduced to 1.5; and • scenario (3): combining scenarios (1) and (2). We simulate the model under four different scenarios and estimate the key epidemiological parameters. We estimate the cumulative number of cases on February 20, the outbreak final size, the epidemic doubling time and the peaking time to capture the patterns of outbreak.
