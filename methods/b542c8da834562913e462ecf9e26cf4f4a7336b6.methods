This study was part of a large quantitative, cross-sectional study investigating the Saudi nursing students' standard precautions compliance, patient safety competence, and perceptions of their training hospitals' infection prevention climate. This article reports on the students' perceptions of their training hospitals' infection prevention climate. Separate reports were published on students' standard precautions compliance (Alshammari et al., 2018) and nursing students' patient safety competence (Alquwez et al., 2019) . The settings and the samples were fully described in Alshammari et al. (2018) and Alquwez et al. (2019) . The study was conducted in six state universities in Saudi Arabia. One university (A) is in the North region of the Kingdom, while two (B and C) and three (D, E, and F) universities are situated in the Center and West of the country, respectively. The A convenience sample of 829 nursing students studying in 6 Saudi universities was surveyed in the study. The students were included in the study if they were Saudi nationals registered full-time in the 3rd and 4th years of the BSN of the six universities and if they had or having their clinical duties in an identified hospital for each university. Nursing interns were also included. The response rate in the study was 77.3% (N = 1191). The largest sample was from University A (n = 254), followed by University F (n = 154), B (n = 144), C (n = 120), and D (n = 94). The lowest was from University E (n = 63). The majority of the respondents was females (69.5%, n = 576) who did not attend any infection prevention and control seminars in the past six months (67.9%, n = 563). More students were in the third year (n = 302) than 282 and 245 students in the 4th and internship years, respectively (Alquwez et al., 2019; Alshammari et al., 2018) .
