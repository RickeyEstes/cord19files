Viruses, cell and clinical specimens IBRV/BoHV-1.1/BarthaNu/67 strain, bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV-5)/N569 strain, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)/NADL strain, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3)/BN-1 strain were preserved in our laboratory, and the viruses were cultured in the Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell using the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, HyClone, USA), containing antibiotics (1000 UI/L penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin) with 8% horse serum. Other bovine virus strains for cross reactivity testing used in this study were provided by full-length cloned cDNA: entire genome sequence of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)/A51908strain, bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV)/(Gene Bank No: NC_002526.1), bovine enterovirus (BEV)/VG-5-27strain, bovine coronavirus (BcoV)/ENT strain (Gene Bank No:NC_003045.1), respectively. A total of 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens (24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens) were collected from cattle farms suspected to be infected with IBRV in Shandong Province, China. Isolation of DNA/RNA, cDNA synthesis IBRV and other herpesviruses DNA were extracted from 200 μL of infected cell culture supernatant using the UNIQ-10 viral DNA extraction kit (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). RNA from BVDV, BPIV-3 was prepared from 200 μL of infected cell culture supernatant using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germany), respectively. The DNA/RNA was eluted in 50 μL of nuclease-free water. The extracted RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Canada). All templates were stored at −70°C until further needed.
