We conducted an exhaustive search of all mentions of MERS-CoV (search terms "MERS" and "Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome", in ProMED-mail, http://www. promedmail.org/), covering from 2012 through 31 May 2015. The initial number of ProMED posts was 10,248, and each was read carefully by one person (TR), and a form filled out to capture the following information: ProMed archive number, report date, country, state/province, locality, age of person, sex of person, whether person is a healthcare worker, whether the person had other existing co-morbidities, whether the person reported exposure to domestic animals (particularly camels), whether the person reported contact with other MERS cases, and remarks. Each report had to be read carefully to extract information for as many of the fields as possible, and we worked hard not to include duplicate records of cases. Although other, country-specific sources are available regarding MERS (e.g., http://www.moh.gov.sa), we opted for the more consistent, regionwide coverage provided by the global resource. We next embarked on a long series of steps designed to clean the data, detecting and fixing errors whenever possible, removing any remaining duplicate records, and adding geographic references. These steps involved repeated searches and manipulations of the data set in spreadsheets, as well as use of Microsoft Access to encounter pairs of records with identical information (e.g., for country, city, age, and date) that would signal duplication. These initial cleaning steps reduced the data matrix to 1171 records of MERS-CoV cases. We then extracted from the data matrix all unique combinations of country, state or province, and locality (93 sites), and assigned latitude-longitude pairs in WGS 1984 geographic coordinates to them via consultation of various online gazetteers (Google Earth, https://www. google.com/earth/; Global Gazetteer version 2.3, http:// www.fallingrain.com/world/). In each case, georeferencing was by TR; AMS, a native Arabic speaker, checked all interpretations carefully. We then plotted the geographic coordinates in a GIS (QGIS, version 2.4) to explore further any localities that had suspicious or uncertain georeferences. Of the 93 localities, some did not provide sufficient information or could not be localized with confidence, such that 67 localities and 1113 case reports could be used in our analyses. We used the WorldClim, version 1.4, 'bioclimatic' variable set at 10′ (~17 km) spatial resolution [15] to summarize environments associated with MERS-CoV cases. We used this coarse spatial resolution, and did not take advantage of more information-rich remotely-sensed data resources, in light of the coarse spatial resolution of the input occurrence data-occurrences were generally referenced to city names only, and nothing more specific. We used bioclimatic variables 1-7 and 10-17, omitting variables 8-9 and 18-19, in light of known spatial artifacts in those four variables. Because the remaining 15 variables show considerable intercorrelation and non-independence [16] , we used principal components analysis to reduce dimensionality and reduce correlations among variables. Specifically, we first clipped the global rasters to the area within 10° (~1100 km) of known MERS-CoV cases (excluding exported cases in Korea, Europe, and North America), in light of ample evidence that MERS-CoV transmission to humans has concentrated in the Middle East. Next, we 'stacked' the 15 bioclimatic raster data layers, and applied a principal components analysis. Because the first five components summarized 99.99 % of the total variance in the original data, we focused on those components only in our analyses. The first three components were plotted in red-green-blue color space for visualization of overall patterns of variation in climate across the region (Fig. 1) . To permit exploratory analyses, we used the point sampling tool in QGIS to extract raster data values to each known occurrence point. To explore patterns of environmental associations, and their implications for the potential geography of MERS-CoV transmission [14] , we developed ecological niche models for the disease, creating models for all cases (N = 1113), and for only those cases with reported camel contact (N = 83). Models were calibrated across the region within 10° of known MERS-CoV cases, as a rough hypothesis of the accessible area for the virus [17] . Using Maxent version 3.3.3k [18] , we developed 10 replicate bootstrap analyses for each occurrence data set, and used the median across the 10 as the output (regularization parameter = 1, prevalence = 0.5). We estimated the uncertainty associated with these outputs, pixel by pixel, as the difference between the maximum and minimum values among the 10 random replicate analyses. To compare niche breadths estimated in the two niche models, we plotted 10,000 random points across the broader study area (of which 7759 fell on land and were included in analyses), and extracted grid values of each of the original bioclimatic variables for each of the points using the point sampling tool in QGIS. We then thresholded each of the niche models using a least training presence thresholding approach, modified to permit an omission rate of E = 0.1 [19] , such that we identified the highest raw suitability level that included 90 % of the data with which the model was calibrated in the suitable area. We then discarded all random points not identified as suitable in either of the models, leaving 5936 points for analysis. Finally, as fewer points were identified as suitable in the model based on camel exposures (4811 points), we rarefied the larger set of points identified as suitable in the model based on all MERS-CoV cases (5707 points) down to the number of points suitable in the camel model, and calculated the standard deviation of each environmental variable associated with points in each data set. Based on direct counts of the observed standard deviation from the camel-based model with those among the 100 random replicates drawn from the unrestricted model, we tested whether the niche estimated based on camel exposures was narrower than that based on all cases.
