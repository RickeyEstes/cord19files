We use a previously built and parameterized network from a synthetic population for a normal day in the city of Portland, Oregon, USA (Eubank et al. 2004) to construct the integrated two-layer locationbased social network framework. One layer is a location-based network for the vaccination scenario design and the other layer is an individualbased social network to simulate infectious disease transmission and control to evaluate the effectiveness of those scenarios. Each is detailed next.
