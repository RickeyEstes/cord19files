According to Qun Li et al. [1] , 2019-nCoV's average incubation time is 7.5 days (95% CI 5.3-19.0), 95% percentiles is 12.5 days. In early stage of the disease, patients' number would double every 7.4 days. Basic reproduction number (R0) was presumed to be 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9). In Qun's paper R0's 95% CI was between 1.4-3.9. R0=2, 3 or 4 were used in model preparation. And 2 and 4 were ruled out because of obvious devotion from open reported data. So R0 was set at 3 in this simulation. Patient incubation time after been transmitted was assigned by python numpy random.normal function, with parameters set as: loc ( mean value of random serie )=7.5, scale ( standard deviation) = 3.4. Values lower than 0 are converted to positive values. In this study, simulation cases can only transmit virus to new patients on the last day of incubation to make calculation simple. According to media report and Wuhan government's announcement, the 2019-nCOV epidemic could be divided into 3 periods. .

PAI=1 means no restriction of social activity, while PAI=0 means totally grounded (include in house isolation and all sorts of hospitalization) . Based on these parameters a simple simulation model was accomplished with python 3.6. All calculation was run on a mac pro notebook with 3.1 GHz duel core CPU and 8GB memory. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Data were shown as mean Â± standard deviation.
