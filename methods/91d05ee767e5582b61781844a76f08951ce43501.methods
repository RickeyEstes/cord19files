To determine the effect of infl uenza on mortality rates during the pandemic years, we obtained monthly mortality rate data from various offi cial sources in Singapore. For the years surrounding the 1918 pandemic, data were obtained from the Annual Departmental Reports of the Straits Settlements (the British colonies that included Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan; the last 3 are now part of Malaysia), and from the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore. For the years surrounding the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, data were obtained from the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore. These were the only offi cial government departments responsible in the respective years for the collection and verifi cation of these statistics. Because tropical countries do not have well-defi ned infl uenza seasons, methods for the analysis of excess deaths in temperate countries such as that used by Serfl ing et al. (7) may not be appropriate because the assumption of infl uenza seasons in distinct, regular waves may not be valid. We have thus elected to use direct statistical analysis of data for the 2 years before and after the pandemic year to form a regression line with 95% confi dence intervals. Deaths for each month were then compared with the regression line. Months for which the mortality rate exceeded the 95% confi dence intervals were considered as those with ex-cess deaths, with the excess represented as the actual mortality rate minus the predicted mortality rate. To provide another perspective of possible excess deaths for comparison, we used another method described by Murray et al. for 1918 , with a simpler equation to estimate excess deaths (8) . For 1918, death rates during the 3-year pandemic window were compared with those in surrounding years, i.e., the average mortality rate for the 3 years before and after were subtracted from the mortality rate during the 3-year pandemic window. In addition to statistical analyses, we conducted a detailed search of peer-reviewed journal articles, government reports, and press articles for the 3 pandemics. Search results provided comparisons of the mortality rates in other countries and an overview of the public health issues and interventions conducted in Singapore and how they compared with those of other countries and current recommendations.
