We reviewed confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported by the MoH from July 1 to August 31, 2015 (regardless of illness onset date), collected demographic and outcome data, and classified each case based on likely source of transmission. Secondary cases were defined as those likely resulting from contact with a MERS-CoV-infected individual or contact with a setting associated with MERS-CoV transmission. We classified as secondary any case that had (1) worked, visited, or been admitted to a healthcare setting, or (2) had contact with a known MERS-CoV case or an individual with severe respiratory illness in the 14 days before illness onset (exposure period). Sporadic cases were defined as those not meeting criteria for classification as a secondary case. Cases were labeled unknown if available information was insufficient to determine a classification. We attempted to contact all cases preliminarily classified as sporadic for telephone interview using a standardized questionnaire. Questions assessed activities during the exposure period, including contact with a healthcare setting, a known MERS-CoV case, or an individual with severe respiratory illness. All interviews were conducted in Arabic by Field Epidemiology Training Program residents in SA. Whenever possible, interviews were conducted with case-patients; however, proxies (relatives or close friends familiar with the case-patient's recent activities) were used in the circumstance of deceased individuals, individuals in hospital or too ill to respond, or when casepatients were otherwise unavailable. All MERS-CoV cases were confirmed in SA by testing of respiratory specimens by real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction assays targeting regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1a [6] . Available specimen aliquots that tested positive for MERS-CoV by both assays during July-August 2015 were shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ([CDC] Atlanta, GA) for confirmatory testing and genome sequencing. Methodology for sequencing, phylogenetic, and recombinational analyses has been described previously [7] and is available as Supplementary Material. This investigation was part of an urgent public health response and was determined to be nonresearch by the SA MoH and CDC.
