A cross sectional study was conducted among HCWs in civil hospital of Darrang district. This is the main referral hospital of the studied district. The hospital receives financial support from the state government, hence treatment of patients is free or very less amount is charged, which increases the admission of patients from nearby areas and referral from government dispensaries and private clinics. In studied hospital, all the patients first have to attend outpatients clinics and then if needed they are sent to inpatient department for further investigation and treatment. The study was conducted for the period of 2 months from December 2014 to January 2015 in which the HCWs (physicians, pharmacists, nurse, laboratory technician and other orderlies) working in the district hospital for on a full time basis were invited to participate in this study. The sample size was calculated on the basis of Raosoft calculator in which the population size was kept as 500, power as 80%, response distribution as 50%, while confidence interval and margin of error was set at 95% and 5% respectively [13] .The generated sample size (n = 218) was adequately powered to estimate the process parameters. All the participants were briefed about the nature and the objectives of the research before requesting them for their voluntary participation in this study. A convenience sampling approach was adopted in which the respondents were recruited on ease of accessibility; however efforts were made to recruit participants from different departments of the hospital. During the study period, participants were approached on continuous basis until the required sample size was achieved. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and used as an instrument to collect data from the participants. A thorough literature review was done initially by two of the authors and relevant research papers were shortlisted for further discussions among authors [7, 9, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] . After all the selected papers were comprehensively reviewed by the authors, an initial draft of the questionnaire was designed. The questionnaire was then subjected to content validity and face validity. The draft was sent to 3 pharmacy and medical academicians responsible for delivering lectures relating to infectious diseases for their opinion on the contents of the questionnaire. The suggestions given by the expert were incorporated and the second version of the questionnaire was developed which then sent to a small sample of 15 HCWs, currently working in healthcare settings for their suggestions on making the questionnaire more brief and simple. These responses were not included in the final analysis. Necessary changes were incorporated and after a series of discussion among the authors and between authors and the experts. A final version of the questionnaire was then distributed to the study participants for data collection. The data was then subjected to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for reliability coefficient. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.72 and 0.77 was computed for knowledge and attitude sections respectively. The study instrument consisted of four sections. First section highlighted the demographic information like gender, age, profession and years of experience. Second section, comprised of 17 questions, evaluated the knowledge of participants about the JE. Questions on knowledge were used to assess general knowledge of participants towards JE and its components. It assessed information like awareness, causes, sign and symptoms, transmission, incubation period, diagnosis and its management. Third section assessed the attitudes of respondents about JE based on 13 questions. The last part explored the source of information about JE. The knowledge questions consisted of Yes/No response categories. Knowledge scores ranged from 0-17 and cut off level of <12 were set for poor knowledge and 12 for good knowledge. Attitude questions consisted of 4 point Likert scale of agreement. A score of 1 was given to strongly disagree, 2 to disagree, 3 agree and 4 to strongly agree. The scale measured attitude from maximum 52 to minimum 13. Scores of 40 were taken as negative attitude, > 40 as positive attitude. Questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions and beliefs of HCWS towards JE and its measures. The responses of the participants were statistically analysed by using SPSS v.20. Descriptive analysis was performed and the results were expressed in frequency and percentages. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between independent variables (demographic characteristics) and dependent variables (Knowledge and attitudes).P-value of less than 0.05 was reported as statistically significant.
