Official information was collected at the two main international airports of Brazil. São Paulo/Guarulhos -Governador André Franco Montoro International Airport (Guarulhos) and Rio de Janeiro/Galeão -Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport (Galeão) are the two busiest airports in terms of number of international passengers in Brazil, respectively. Guarulhos is also the busiest cargo airport in Latin America. These two airports represent about 85% of international passenger arrivals to Brazil (Infraero Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura Aeroportuária 2012). The present study had its technical and ethical procedures approved by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) through process number 578255/2008-1 and special permits were obtained from the General Coordination of International Agricultural Surveillance of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (VIGIAGRO/MAPA -number 294/2010) as well as the Federal Revenue of Brazil (number 00571/ 2009). After landing, baggage from randomly selected airplanes was inspected noninvasively using an X-ray scanner and those with organic products were intercepted by a representative of MAPA/VIGIAGRO. Passengers were intercepted by the official service, according to Brazilian standard protocols (Brazil Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento 2006), from 119 international flights of 35 air companies in these two airports. Passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products and control. Passengers found carrying animal products (milk, cheese, meat, salami, sausage, fish etc.) on international flights arriving at Guarulhos and Galeão International Airports were considered "passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products". An officially approved questionnaire was used and all passengers were interviewed by a single researcher. Information was collected concerning the provenance, origin, nationality, type of baggage, amount of baggage, who the passenger was travelling with, reason for travel, sex and age of the passengers using a questionnaire that also contained information from the notice of seizure. Passengers that had their baggage inspected by X-ray machines and had no animal products were considered control. These passengers also had their DBA's (Accompanied Baggage Declaration -IRS) analysed. DBA's contained data on the provenance, origin, nationality, age and sex of these passengers. This procedure was carried out on twelve occasions from April 23, 2010 to August 19, 2011 (six missions each in Guarulhos and Galeão International Airport). Information contained on official forms filled by the MAPA inspector at the time of interception of passengers carrying illegal animal products in their baggage were also analysed. No information that could violate privacy of passengers was obtained or used in this study. Also, the information of the control group was obtained from officially approved forms (DBA -Federal Revenue of Brazil). All passengers signed a notice of seizure of illegal products in their baggage. Following standard procedures, passengers who had illegal products seized were released and did not pay any fines or fee. The minimum number of passengers was calculated as 132 interceptions (minimum + 10% = 120 + 12 = 132; n = 120 when z = t) according to Sampaio (2010) , and this "n" was defined to estimate the confidence intervals of the values found. One hundred forty-nine (149) passengers identified as carrying illegal animal products were intercepted at Guarulhos International Airport and 111 passengers at Galeão International Airport, totaling 260 passengers. One hundred ninety-seven (197) passengers served as the control group, 131 in Guarulhos International Airport and 66 in Galeão International Airport. Data were analyzed using SAS® (Statistical Analysis System, v.9.3, Cary, North Carolina). Chi-square (χ2) tests and logistic regression analysis were carried out to determine differences between and within the two groups of passengers. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were produced and odds ratios calculated. Countries were grouped into regions or continents to facilitate the analysis. This grouping was based on historical and cultural rather than necessarily geographical ties. Russia: Russia and its borders Lithuania and Ukraine. Ages were also divided into four groups: Group 1 less than 20 years, group 2 between 20 and 35 years, group 3 between 35 and 55 years and group 4 more than 55 years.
