In order to measure the initial velocity of the exhaled air from coughing and speaking, the PIV was installed in a clean room that can control the constant temperature and humidity (23°C, 50% RH) as shown in Fig. 1 . For the PIV measurements, olive oil particles were nebulized into the acrylic indoor chamber using an atomizer (Oil Droplet Generator, TSI Model 9307) and the thin laser sheet was produced by adjusting the laser (k = 532 nm Nd: YAG) using a lens. The location of atomized particles resulting from the effect of light scattering was detected using a digital camera (TSI 630057). The sequential two PIV images obtained from a synchronizer (TSI 610035) and a PC were analyzed into a velocity vector by tracking the pathway of the atomized particles. The tested people were instructed to cough or speak in a certain protocol on a side of rectangular chamber made of transparent acryl with a dimension of 500 mm width, 500 mm height and 1500 mm length. To prevent the tested persons from being exposed to the laser, a galvanized steel base plate was installed. 26 tested persons including 17 adult males aged between 23 and 44 (avg age 32, avg height 1.74 m, and avg weight 71 kg) and nine adult females aged between 24 and 32 (avg age 29, avg height 1.63 m, and avg weight 49 kg) were selected for testing (Table 1) . When each person repeated coughing and speaking at the front side of the chamber, the velocity distribution around the mouth was measured using the PIV system. The following expiratory activities were tested; coughs with the mouth closed initially and voluntarily performed three times as much as the subject can generate with a sufficient rest period between each cough, Speech instructed to speak out the words hana (meaning one in Korean), dul (two) and set (three) for around 3 s each with a rest period between them. The measurement area was 247 mm Â 184 mm located in front of the mouth opening and the PIV images were taken with the 70 ms interval of continuous shots and the shot exposure time was 490 ls (Table 2) .
