The study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome measures and baseline population characteristics of the ResPOC study have been previously described in the original report of this trial. 10 In brief, adults presenting to the emergency department or acute medical unit with ARI were recruited at presentation and randomised 1:1 to receive POCT for respiratory viruses using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel or routine clinical care. The study was approved by the North West -Preston Regional Ethics Committee (NW/14/1467). The protocol is publically available. 19 In this further analysis we evaluated patients with exacerbation of asthma or COPD who were treated with antibiotics. The duration of antibiotics and proportion treated with a single dose or short course (defined as less than 24 h) were compared between patients testing positive for viruses by POCT, those testing negative by POCT and control patients. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were then compared according to the virus types detected. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for duration of antibiotic use.
