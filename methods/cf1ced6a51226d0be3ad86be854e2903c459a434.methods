The field trials comprised quantitative and qualitative studies to investigate the value of ebuddi. They introduced the concept of IPC and PPE, as well as the effectiveness of trainers, to healthcare workers both during the acute phase of the emergency and the subsequent transition into restoring essential healthcare. The training tool was developed by Immerse Learning, PUPSMD and Total Monkery, and a team of experts led by Jon Meadows. Fieldwork was conducted by Masanga Hospital and The MENTOR Initiative; supported by expertise at PUPSMD. The training team comprised IPC specialists within The MENTOR Initiative who, during the course of the studies, visited over one hundred health facilities. The majority of these facilities were private health clinics and health centres, in addition to three hospitals and one Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU). Facilities covered both urban and rural areas. Close to five hundred healthcare workers were introduced to the tool during the study. The fieldwork comprised four main phases: Phase 1: Introducing the concept. Early prototypes developed by Immerse Learning were introduced to healthcare workers in Sierra Leone. Feedback confirmed that the tool was relevant and appropriate for training healthcare workers and supported the model which incorporated training in both English and local language. Phase 2: Testing potential. Conducted in health facilities in Liberia to test the potential of the program. Small groups used ebuddi and gave informal feedback and first impressions. It was tested as a standalone tool where participants used the module on a laptop for approximately one hour, independent of scheduled training, and evaluated confidence levels before and after. Phase 3: Testing efficacy. The study used rapid and agile feedback mechanisms to accelerate development and prioritize local input. Each participant evaluated their confidence with IPC practices and then was assessed on their competence at donning and doffing enhanced PPE. ebuddi was used to reinforce the practical experience and then the participant was reassessed on their practical skills. Quantitative data collection identified trends and performances. Phase 4: Operational value. This phase focused on how best to apply ebuddi in different contexts -targeting end users with a range of resources and abilities. Field trials integrated ebuddi into scheduled group IPC training, focusing on PPE training. The program was used alongside practical demonstrations and skill stations, continuously adapting to meet changing resources.
