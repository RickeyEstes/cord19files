This study reports 56 children (5 weeks to 14 years [32 males]) who were diagnosed as having PCD at the Leicestershire PCD diagnostic clinic. Information was collected evaluating chest, nasal, and ear symptoms. The presence of situs inversus was noted. Each subject had been free from upper respiratory tract infections or nasal and chest exacerbation in the previous 6 weeks. Medication was discontinued 48 hours before nasal brush biopsy. Ciliated samples were obtained by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate without local anesthetic. 11 Nasal brushings were placed in medium 199 (pH 7.3) that contained antibiotic solution (streptomycin, 50 µg/mL, penicillin, 50 µg/mL, Gibco, Leicester, United Kingdom). Approval was obtained from the Leicestershire ethics committee. Written consent was obtained before sampling.
