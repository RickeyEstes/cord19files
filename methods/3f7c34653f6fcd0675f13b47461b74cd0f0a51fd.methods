The DMPC, DMPG and POPC used in this work were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), acrylamide, NBD and Triton X-100 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine hydrochloride (TAMRA) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (MPI, Eugene, OR, USA). Terbium chloride hexahydrate (TbCl 3 ) and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). All reagents were used without further purification. The peptides of TMD (GYKDWILWISFAISCFLLCVVLLG-FIMWACQRG) and FP (GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDG-WYGFR) of HA2 (strain X:31) of influenza virus were synthesized using a Fmoc/t-Bu solid-phase method on a Rainin PS3 peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ, USA). Labeling of TAMRA or NBD, purification and characterization of the peptides used were described previously [25, 26] . The pyrene labeling protocol was detailed in Additional file 1. Lys was added at the end of the sequence while the fluorescent probes were labeled on the C-terminus. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by solubilizing DMPC:DMPG mixture (1:1) in chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v). The lipidic solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen until a thin film was obtained and then dried using a centrifuge under vacuum overnight to ensure the movement of all solvent. The phospholipid was resuspended in PB buffer and sonicated for 30 min with a Sonicor (New York, NY, USA) ultrasonic processor.
