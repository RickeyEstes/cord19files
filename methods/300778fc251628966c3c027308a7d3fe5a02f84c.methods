Cells culture and virus infection. Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 8 % FCS (PAA) and antibiotics. Huh7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) containing 8 % FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA), non-essential amino acids (PAA) and antibiotics. Vero E6 and Calu3/2B4 cells were cultured as described previously Yoshikawa et al., 2010) Antibodies and drugs. Rabbit antisera recognizing the SARS-CoV replicase subunits nsp3, nsp4, nsp5 and nsp8 have been described previously van Hemert et al., 2008b) . Rabbit antisera recognizing the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and MHV nsp4 were raised as described elsewhere (Snijder et al., 1994) . Antigens were a full-length recombinant SARS-CoV N protein (purified from Escherichia coli) and a synthetic peptide representing the 23 C-terminal residues of MHV nsp4, respectively. p-STAT1 was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled mouse anti-STAT1 (pY701; BD Biosciences), and FITC-labelled anti-mouse IgG was used to enhance the green fluorescence. Virus infection was detected using the above-mentioned anti-nsp3 sera and Alexa Fluor 594-labelled antirabbit IgG. CsA (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and a 10 mM stock was stored in aliquots for single use at 220 uC. Peg-interferon a-2b (PEG-IFN; Pegintron) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction as a 100 mg ml 21 stock and stored at 4 uC. Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS or with 4 % formaldehyde and 70 % ethanol (p-STAT1 experiments), permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously ( First, the samples were maintained at 290 uC for 6 h in this medium and then slowly warmed to 220 uC within 14 h, kept at 220 uC for 1 h, warmed to 0 uC at a 5 uC h 21 rate and left at 0 uC for 1 h before letting the samples reach room temperature. After washing with acetone, the samples were gradually infiltrated with epoxy resin LX-112 and polymerized at 60 uC. The samples were cut into thin sections (100 nm) and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Imaging was performed in an FEI Tecnai12 TWIN electron microscope operating at 120 kV and equipped with an Eagle 4k cooled slow-scan charge-coupled device camera (FEI Company). The images were acquired using binning mode 2. Intracellular viral RNA analysis. Isolation of intracellular viral RNA was carried out as described previously (van Kasteren et al., 2013) . After drying of the gel, viral mRNAs were detected by hybridization with a 32 P-labelled oligonucleotide probe (59-GCAAATCATCTAAT-TAGCCTAATC-39) complementary to the 39 end of all MERS-CoV mRNAs. Equal loading was verified in a second hybridization using a 32 P-labelled oligonucleotide probe (59-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCA-TT-39) recognizing 18S rRNA (van Hemert et al., 2008a) . ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare) was used for quantification. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RNA from 200 ml culture medium of CoV-infected cells was isolated with a MagnaPure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Roche) and eluted in 100 ml. RT-PCR conditions for quantifying MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV RNA and amplification parameters have been described previously (Kuiken et al., 2003; Raj et al., 2013) . Dilutions of viral RNA isolated from MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV virus stocks with a known virus titre were used to produce a standard curve. Development of a screening assay for antiviral compounds. Huh7 or Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1610 4 or 2610 4 cells per well, respectively. After overnight growth, cells were infected with an m.o.i. of 0.005 or 0.05. At 1-3 days after incubation, differences in cell viability caused by virus-induced CPE or by compound-specific side effects were analysed using the CellTiter 96 AQ ueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm (A 490 ) was measured using a Berthold Mithras LB 940 96-well plate reader. Infected cells were given CsA or DMSO (solvent control) prior to infection (m.o.i 0.005). Cytotoxic effects caused by CsA treatment alone were monitored in parallel plates containing mock-infected cells. IFN sensitivity and p-STAT1 translocation experiments. One day prior to infection, Vero cells were plated at a density of 10 4 cells per well in a 96-well plate format. At 24, 0 and 4 h p.i., cells were incubated with 0-1000 ng PEG-IFN ml 21 in 250 ml. At t50 h, all wells were washed with PBS and infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (100 TCID 50 per 100 ml medium). Those cultures receiving treatment from t524 or t50 were infected in the presence of the indicated concentration PEG-IFN. After 1 h, 150 ml medium was added to the cultures of t524 or t50 cultures, and 100 ml medium was added to the untreated cultures, which at 4 h p.i. received 50 ml medium supplemented with PEG-IFN to reach a final concentration of 0-1000 ng PEG-IFN ml 21 . At 48 h p.i., RNA was isolated from 50 ml cell-culture supernatant and quantified using virus-specific realtime RT-PCR assays (see above). At 48 h p.i., CPE was also scored microscopically as either none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or complete (4). For p-STAT1 nuclear translocation experiments, Vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (m.o.i. of 1). At 8 h p.i., cells were treated with 1000 ng PEG-IFN ml 21 for 30 min, fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and 70 % ethanol and subsequently stained for the presence of viral antigen and p-STAT1 translocation.
