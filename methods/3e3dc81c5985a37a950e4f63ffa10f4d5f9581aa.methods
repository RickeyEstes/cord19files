Virus-infected plant material TYLCV (GenBank:AY530931) was maintained in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Florida Lanai') in a plant growth room by whitefly transmission [34] . Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. 'Samsun') and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. 'Top Crop') plants were infected with TYLCV using whiteflies from infected tomatoes [34] . Bean seedlings were infected with Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV, GenBank:DQ119824, DQ11982425), Euphorbia mosaic virus (EuMV, GenBank:KJ647290, KJ647291), Sida golden mottle virus (SiGMoV, Genbank:GU997691, GU997692) and Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV, Gen-Bank:L14460, L14461) by biolistic inoculation using infectious clones [31] . In addition, TYLCV-inoculated bean and tomato leaf tissues stored at −20°C for 5 months, −80°C for 3 months, or desiccated and stored at 4°C for approximately 15 years were included in the evaluation. Template preparation DNA ("purified DNA") was extracted from fresh, frozen and desiccated leaves of P. vulgaris, N. tabacum and S. lycopersicum using Puregene DNA reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the following protocol: leaf tissue (10-30 mg) was ground in liquid nitrogen then suspended with 300 μl of Cell Lysis Solution. The lysate was incubated at 65°C for 60 min and cooled to room temperature for 5 min, after which 100 μl of Protein Precipitation Solution was added. Samples were briefly vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min after which they were centrifuged at 20,000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and nucleic acids were precipitated using 300 μl of isopropanol and centrifuged at 18,000-20,000 rcf for 5 min. The pellet was then washed with 70 % ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of DNA Hydration Solution. Crude extracts were prepared in 0.5 N NaOH from fresh, frozen and desiccated material using a technique modified from Satya et al. 2013 [6] . Fresh or frozen leaves (10 mg) were homogenized using a plastic pestle in a 2 ml microfuge tube with 30 μl 0.5 N NaOH. Dessicated leaf tissues were homogenized in the same way but using 0.5 N NaOH at 1:18 w/v. Crude extracts were centrifuged at 20,800 rcf for 3 s to separate out particulate matter and the supernatant was collected for use as template. TYLCV DNA cloned in pBluescript KS-at an XbaI site was purified from E. coli using NucleoSpin® Plasmid kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co, Düren, Germany). The concentration of DNA (39.74 ng/μl) was determined using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington DE) and calculating the mean of three repeats for each treatment. The concentration of TYLCV DNA (19.87 ng/μl), was determined in the undiluted aliquot by multiplying the total amount of DNA by 48.3 % which represented the percent of TYLCV DNA in the total extracted DNA (insert plus plasmid). Tenfold dilutions of that aliquot were made using nuclease-free water.
