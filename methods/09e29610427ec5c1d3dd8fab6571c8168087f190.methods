An observational study was conducted in 11 tertiary, acute care hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) between January and March 2011. All hospital personnel (eg, nurses, physicians, housekeeping, laboratory technicians, respiratory therapists, and others) who entered the room of a patient with FRI were eligible for inclusion and are referred to generally as HCWs. FRI was defined as a patient with a fever >38 C and with a new or worsening cough or shortness of breath. Visitors and volunteers were excluded from this study. All hospital inpatient or Emergency Department (ED) units that cared for FRI patients were included; outpatient ambulatory care units other than ED were excluded. The Public Health Agency of Canada's Infection Control Research Working Group adapted the audit form from an observational tool used to assess an online infection control course in British Columbia. 21 The audit form was piloted by 6 CNISP participating hospitals from February 9 to April 10, 2010. Observers collected data on the selection and removal of PPE. Hand hygiene following the removal of gloves, gown and mask, and/or eye protection was also observed. Trained observers included infection control professionals or students who were provided with instructions on how to complete the audit form and how to best observe HCWs. Whereas staff on care units were not informed in advance of the audit, no attempt was made to disguise the purpose of the observations. Patient rooms in which the HCWs PPE selection and removal could not be observed were excluded (eg, an anteroom without a window). Signs were posted outside of patient rooms describing additional precautions and what PPE were required. The Public Health Agency of Canada's guidelines Prevention and Control of Influenza During a Pandemic for all Healthcare Settings (Annexe F) was used to determine PPE requirements for an FRI patient. 22 Instructions for the correct procedure to remove PPE were provided on the audit form and were further defined, when necessary, according to the facility's infection prevention and control policy. The correct sequence of PPE removal was defined in the following order: gloves, gown, eye protection, and then mask. 22 A mask was defined as either an N95 respirator or surgical (procedure) mask. Eye protection was defined as either a face shield/mask combination or goggles. Eyeglasses were not considered to be eye protection. 22 Observers were asked to identify the occupation of the observed HCW to the best of their ability, without asking the HCW. If they did not know the occupation, they selected the "don't know" response. A nurse was defined as a nursing assistant, nursing aid, or registered nurse. Allied health professional included respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, laboratory technicians and x-ray technicians. A student was defined as an intern, a resident, or a health care profession student. Because the study was observational and did not involve any alteration in patient care, informed consent from the patient and HCW were not required. Because auditing of infection prevention and control practices is part of routine infection prevention and control activities institutional ethics review board approval was not sought. The data collected were confidential; no personal identifying information was collected. Proportions were calculated to describe the study population and for each PPE item and hand hygiene moment by occupation and clinical area. Logistic regression was performed to identify associations between PPE use, clinical areas, and occupations. Odds ratios were reported; 95% confidence intervals and P values reflect a 2-tailed a level of .05. Missing data and unable to assess responses were removed from all calculations. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
