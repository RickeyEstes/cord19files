This study was conducted in the heavy damaged area 3 months following the floods and mudslides caused by Typhoon Morakot. A total of 277 adolescents who were in Grade 7e9 from three junior high schools were recruited into this study. They had been separated from their families and allocated to three boarding areas where they could continue to receive formal education in a group setting. Most of them were living in group dormitories and visits involving family members were only possible at weekends. The Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Medical University approved the study, which allowed the use of passive consent from the parents of 277 displaced adolescents. Before conducting the study, we prepared a leaflet explaining the purpose and procedure of this study. Students were told to take the leaflet with them at a weekend for their parents or main caretakers to inspect. If parents disagreed about taking part in the study, they could tell their children to refuse to participate. Written informed consent was also obtained from each student themselves before the study started. The participants were invited to complete the selfadministered 22-item Chinese version of IES-R [11, 16] . Participants were asked to report the frequency of symptoms over the past week on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The IES-R yields total scores that range from 0 to 88. The sum of all individual scores was taken to indicate the severity of the psychological reactions to the previous stress. Blind to the results of the IES-R, diagnostic interviews were conducted using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (M.I.N.I.-Kid) schedule [17] . and then received feedback about the interview. Lastly, the inter-rater diagnostic reliability among the 15 interviewers was examined using six tape-recorded M.I.N.I.-Kid case interviews. The kappa for the PTSD ratings ranged from 0.67 to 1, which indicated good inter-rater diagnostic reliability. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated to determine the internal consistency of the IES-R. Exploratory factor analysis, using principle component analysis followed by oblique rotation, was used. Factor numbers were determined using the scree test and needed to explain at least 10% of the variance. In the scree test, the eigenvalues of all the factors were examined after each factor was extracted until a large jump or discontinuity was observed, after which the factors that remained were retained. Items with loadings greater than 0.3 were entered into a factor. If the factor loading was greater than 0.4 for more than two items, the author would judge the appropriate factor for the item. The criteria validity of IES-R against the diagnosis of PTSD as generated by the M.I.N.I.-Kid was determined via relative operating characteristic (ROC) analysis [19] . Accordingly, the optimal cutoff point was estimated with respect to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).
