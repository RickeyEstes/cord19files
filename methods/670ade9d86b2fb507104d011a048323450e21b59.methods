The general strategy of the PanArray design algorithm is best summarized by analogy to the well-known Minimum Hitting Set problem in computer science [23, 24] . Let P be a set of n points and F = {P 1 , P 2 ,..., P m } be a family of m subsets of P. Minimum Hitting Set is the problem of selecting the minimum cardinality subset H ⊆ P such that H contains at least one element from each subset in F. Although finding a minimum hitting set is known to be NP hard, it is a well studied problem and efficient approximation algorithms are known. To see the similarities between the Pan-Tiling and Minimum Hitting Set problems, let the sequence G be a concatenation of all the genomes from a species, and let W = {w 1 , w 2 ,..., w m } be the set of m intervals that results from segmenting G into non-overlapping, end-to-end, length l windows. Let P be the non-redundant set of length k substrings from G. A probe candidate p ∈ P is said to hit a window w ∈ W if a match between p and a substring of G begins in the interval w. Let P i ⊆ P be the subset of probes that hit the window w i , and F = {P 1 , P 2 ,..., P m } for the m windows of W. A minimum hitting set H of F is a minimum cardinality subset of probes H ⊆ P such that every window of the pan-genome is hit by at least one probe in H. Therefore, finding H effectively tiles the entire pangenome using a small number of probes.
