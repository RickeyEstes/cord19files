Cells and viruses. 293-T cells and Vero-118 cells were grown as described previously . A549 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % FCS, High Clone (HC-FCS; Greiner Bio-One), with 100 IU penicillin ml 21 , 100 mg streptomycin ml 21 and 2 mM glutamine (PSG). The generation of recombinant HMPV NL/1/00 has been described previously Bioassays for IFN. The IFN content in supernatants was measured using the ISRE-firefly luciferase reporter construct as described previously (Patel et al., 2013) . cDNA synthesis and PCR. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . Amplification of DI genomes was performed with primers BF568, 59-CTCTGCATTCCCTAGATTATC-39 (based on wt sequence); BF593 , 59-CCGCCGCCACAGAAGAATGGC-39; and BF595 , 39-GTTGAC-CATTTGGACTCTATGGCC-59 (based on sequences obtained for DI#1) (Fig. 4a) . Primers for ADAR-1 p150 were: 59-GCGCAAT-GAATCCGCGGG-39 (forward primer, based on human ADAR-1 p150; GenBank accession no. NM001111.4) and 59-CCCCTGCCTTT-CCATGTCAATTAGC-39 (reverse primer, based on AGM ADAR-1 p150; GenBank accession no. NM001111.4). Primers for ADAR-1 p110 were: 59-GAGAAGGCTACGTGGTGG-39 (forward primer, based on human ADAR1 p110, George & Samuel, 1999) and 59-AAAAAACTCAAGAGGATCTTCCAAGGC-39 (reverse primer, end of exon 2; GenBank accession no. EF190455). Thermocycling was performed with the following conditions: 94 uC for 1 min, 40 uC for 2 min and 72 uC for 3 min (40 cycles). Gene expression assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems: Hs01020780-m1 for ADAR-1 p150, Hs01017596-m1 for ADAR-1 p110 and Hs00210562-m1 for ADAR-2. Real-time PCR assays were performed with a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), using Taqman Universal Mastermix according to the manufacturer's instructions. Arbitrarily primed PCR and virus genome sequencing were performed as described previously (van Boheemen et al., 2012) . GS Junior sequence reads were trimmed by 25 nt at both the 59 and 39 ends of the reads to remove primer sequences and aligned to the HMPV genome (GenBank accession no. AF371337) using CLC Genomics software v.4.6.1 (CLC bio). Using this software, singlenucleotide polymorphism analysis was conducted with a minimum of 2 % variation frequency and a minimal coverage of five reads per position. Northern blot analysis. RNA was isolated from purified virus stock (10 7 TCID 50 per sample) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoresis of the RNA on a 1 % agarose gel, RNA was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (BrightStar-Plus; Ambion) and incubated with the probe. The probe, complementary to the 59 end of genome, was generated with a Strip-EZ RNA system (Ambion) using a PCR fragment based on the full-length cDNA construct of NL/1/00 with PCR primers 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAAAATGA-TAAAATG-39 (forward primer, T7 promoter underlined) and 59-GGTTTTTTTGCCGT-39 (reverse complement to end of trailer). The blot was analysed with a NorthernMax-Gly system (Ambion), exposed to a phosphorimager screen and analysed with a Storm 850 PhosphorImager and ChemiDoc MP Imaging System and Image Lab v.4.0.1 software (Molecular Dynamics).
