We exploit the temporal (the onset of the swine flu in 2009) and cross-sectional variation (by state) of the swine flu to examine its effect on diarrhea cases, that is, diseases that may be prevented with improved hygiene behavior that followed the onset of the H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Using a balanced panel at the state and year-level, our difference-in-difference identification strategy is formally presented in Eq. (1), where y st is the number of hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of intestinal infections (henceforth referred to as diarrhea) for state s in year t. Variable H1N1 st represents the cross-sectional and temporal variation in the number of laboratory-confirmed swine flu cases reported in each of the states and year (with values equal to zero before 2009). We also investigate other treatment and baseline periods, which are discussed in Section 4.3. We use H1N1 counts rather than rates because we believe that part of the mechanism through which individuals' perceptions changed was rooted in the perceived magnitude of the problem as reported on news media channels. The news media reported the total number of cases that had been confirmed at the national level as well as the states where the highest number of cases had been confirmed. 20 Thus, ␤ is our parameter of interest as it captures the differencein-difference impact. Robust standard errors clustered at 32 states with a correction with a correction for small clusters are used and are complemented with p-values computed using a wild bootstrap method (Cameron et al., 2008) . Eq. (1) includes controls for year and state fixed effects ( t and s , respectively). The year fixed effects allow us to control for nationwide trends in diarrheal diseases while the state fixed effects account for time-invariant unobserved characteristics during the period of analysis at the state level (e.g., culture, geography, institutional settings). In our main specification, we compare the changes in diarrhea cases between 2008 and 2009 as we expect several state characteristics, including health infrastructure (e.g., stocks of hospitals and clinics), to remain constant over such a short period, thereby reducing the possibility of a bias in the parameter of interest. Thus, if the H1N1 pandemic induced changes in hygiene behavior, we would expect to observe a larger decline in the incidence of diarrheal dis- eases in states where the swine flu was more prevalent. In other words, we would expect ␤ to be negative and statistically significant. In the next section, we show the results of estimating Eq. (1) with the data described above. Table 2 presents the results from running the specification described in Eq. (1) for 2009 and 2008, with state and year fixed effects . As shown in Panel A, column 1, our estimate for effect of the 2009 H1N1 on diarrhea cases for children under five is negative, −0.105, and statistically significant at the five percent level, marginally, using the wild-bootstrap p-values (0.060). That is, there were fewer hospital discharges related to diarrhea in states with more swine flu cases, even after controlling for time and state fixedeffects. This coefficient implies that for every 1000 cases of the swine flu, there were 105 fewer cases of diarrhea in children under five. Given the average number of diarrhea-related hospitalizations for this group (1117 in the period 2008-2009), the estimated association indicates that for every 1000 cases of the swine flu we observe a 9.4 percent decline in diarrhea-related hospitalizations (-0.105*1000/1117). That is, 3404 cases of H1N1 (or 4.9 percent of all confirmed cases) would have the same effect in the reduction of diarrhea (32 percent) as the estimated average effect from the costly interventions reviewed by Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al. (2008) .
