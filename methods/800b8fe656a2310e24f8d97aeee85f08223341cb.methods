A longitudinal between-subjects design was employed. Individuals who presented with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness were recruited and control subjects reporting an absence of URTI symptoms were also included. Subjects were assessed during the initial illness and then on three subsequent occasions at weekly intervals during convalescence. To reduce the impact of differences other than the illness factor two methodological features were included. First, a homogenous sample of subjects (university students) was recruited. Secondly, a detailed profile of each subject's personality, recent mental health status, and health-related behaviour was recorded by administration of a series of questionnaires. This information then allowed the consideration of such factors when analysing any differences between the URTI and healthy groups.
