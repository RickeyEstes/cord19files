Plasmid design and protein expression and purification. The plasmid for expression of the TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex (pCDF-TssK SN 6His-TssF-TssG) comprises three open-reading frames encoding TssK SN (residues 1-315) with a Cterminal His 6 -tag, full-length TssF, and TssG (residues 64-366) under the control of a single T7 promoter 24 . Escherichia coli BL21DE3 (Novagen) cells bearing pCDF-TssK SN 6His-TssF-TssG were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) supplemented with 50 µg/ml streptomycin. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 16 h at 18°C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in Tris-HCl 20 mM pH 8.0, NaCl 150 mM with lysozyme and lysed using a French press. Soluble proteins were separated from insoluble material by centrifugation 30 min at 20,000 g. The TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and eluted with 300 mM imidazole. Subsequently, it was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP. The purity of the sample was assessed by Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  using Dog Picker 51 within the Appion pipeline 52 . Movie frame alignment was carried out with dose weighting using MotionCorr2 53 . Defocus parameters were estimated with GCTF 54 . An initial model was obtained using cryoSPARC 55 and all 2D and 3D classifications and refinements were performed using RELION 2.1. Subsequently, Relion3.0beta was used to refine per-particle defocus values before reclassification of the data focusing on the TssF-TssG C-terminal domain. Finally, multi-body refinement 30 was used with signal subtraction to produce a map focused on the two TssK trimers and a map focused on the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer. The reported resolution is based on the gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion 56, 57 and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution 58 . Local resolution estimation was performed using blocres 59 . In panels a, c, TssG is colored identically to Fig. 1 Fig. 7 Model of the T6SS baseplate and needle complex architecture before sheath contraction. a A model was obtained by rigid-body docking subcomplex structures into the single particle cryoEM reconstruction of the non-contractile sheath mutant of the Vibrio Cholerae T6SS baseplate/needle at 8 Å resolution (EMD 3879) 45 . b Cut-away view of the model shown in a. c Orthogonal view of the model shown in a. d Circularization of the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 complex in the context of the T6SS baseplate. TssK, TssF, TssG are colored identically to Fig. 1 ; TssB-TssC: teal (PDB ID 3j9g) 19 ; Hcp: magenta (PDB 5OJQ); VgrG-PAAR: green-olive (PDB ID 4MTK and 4JIV) 9 Model building and refinement. TssK was modeled based on the available X-ray crystal structures 24 , whereas TssF and TssG were modeled de novo by initially building a backbone trace of their C-terminal domains into a preliminary 4.2 Å resolution reconstruction. Modeling of TssF and TssG relied on both the global map and the focused map obtained using multi-body refinement. Co-evolution derived constraints provide a way of inferring structural information given large families of evolutionarily related sequences of a protein. By identifying residues that frequently mutate together, structural information may be inferred. The strength of this "co-evolution" is strongly predictive of residue-residue contacts in the 3D structure of the protein 31, 32, 36, 60 . For both TssF and TssG, there was sufficient sequence data to perform co-evolution analysis, and models were built using Rosetta guided by this co-evolution data 32 . These models were built by domain (three domains for TssF and two domains for TssG), and the C-terminal domain models were converged and placed into density with the help of the aforementioned backbone trace (a long insertion corresponding to TssG loop 1 allowed discrimination of TssF from TssG density). Several long insertions that poorly converged using the co-evolution information alone were rebuilt into density using RosettaES 37 . Subsequent modeling of the TssG coordinates was carried out using a combination of Coot 38 and Rosetta 34,35 refinement, with the final model refined with Rosetta. The rest of the TssF structure (residues 20-459) was derived from the Rosetta co-evolution model and fit into density before rebuilding and refinement using a combination of Coot 38 and Rosetta 34, 35 . Building and refinement was carried out using the TssK and TssF-TssG focused maps before performing a final refinement round in the TssK-TssF-TssG map. The TssF and TssG atomic models agree with 247 out of 250 and 105 out of 106 co-evolution constraints, respectively. Interaction surface area was calculated using PISA 61 . All figures were generated with UCSF Chimera 62 and UCSF ChimeraX 63 . Bacterial two-hybrid assays and western blotting. E. coli BTH101 cells were cotransformed with plasmids encoding the T18 and T25 fragments of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase fused to the proteins of interest. Stationary phase cells were normalized to OD 600 0.5 and plated on LB agar containing 80 mg/mL X-gal, 0.5 mM IPTG, 50 mg/mL kanamycin and 150 mg/mL carbenicillin and grown for 24 h at 30°C. pKT25 and pKNT25 constructs added T25 to the N or C-terminus, respectively, and the transformed cells were grown in the presence of 50 mg/mL kanamycin. pUC18 and pUC18C constructs added T18 to the C or N-terminus, respectively, and the transformed cells were grown in the presence of 150 mg/mL carbenicillin. Cloning was performed using Gibson assembly. Western blotting was performed using a mouse anti-CyaA (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies #: SC-13582, Lot: C2715) and detected with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antibodies (1:5000, Sigma). Western blots were developed using chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Substrate, Thermo Scientific) and imaged with an Azure c500 (Azure Biosystems). The leucine zipper interactions of the yeast protein GCN4 served as a positive control.
