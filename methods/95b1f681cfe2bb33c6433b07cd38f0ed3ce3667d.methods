Homology modelling. The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of CASD1 was modelled using the Phyre2 protein fold recognition server 66 . On the basis of the structure of the isoamyl acetate-hydrolysing esterase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB accession code 3mil), which was identified as top rank template, residues 83-290 of human CASD1 were modelled with 99.3% confidence. Generation of mammalian expression plasmids. To generate a construct encoding full-length CASD1 with an N-terminal V5 and a C-terminal Myc epitope (V5-CASD1-Myc), the coding region of human CASD1 (accession no. NM_022900) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5 0 -GCTCGGGATCCGCGGCTCTGGC CTACAACCTG-3 0 and 5 0 -GCTCGCTCGAGATGTTTTGATTTATCTTGAATG GATG-3 0 containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, and the resulting PCR product was ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Sequences encoding the epitope tags were inserted by adapter ligation. For the V5 epitope, the pre-hybridized oligonucleotide pair 5 0 -AGCTTCGAATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTC TACGG-3 0 and 5 0 -GATCCCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGAT AGGCTTACCCATTCGA-3 0 was ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3. For the Myc epitope, the pre-hybridized oligonucleotide pair 5 0 -TCGAGG AACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAATTAAT-3 0 and 5 0 -CTAGATTA ATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCC-3 0 was ligated into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3, resulting in the plasmid pcDNA3-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pcDNA3-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc as template. To introduce the amino-acid exchange S94A, the mutagenesis primers 5 0 -GCATTTATTGGAGATGCCAGAATTCGTCAATTG-3 0 and 5 0 -CAATTGACG AATTCTGGCATCTCCAATAAATGC-3 0 were used, resulting in the plasmid pcDNA-V5-CASD1(S94A)-Myc. For expression of the human sialyltransferase ST8Sia I, a full-length construct encoding an N-terminal V5 epitope was generated by amplification of the coding region of human ST8SIA1 (I.M.A.G.E. clone IRCMp5012B0613D, ImaGenes) using the primers 5 0 -GCTAAGCTTCGAATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCC TCGGTCTCGATTCTACGGGTACCAGCCCCTGCGGGCGGGC-3 0 and 5 0 -GCT GCGGCCGCCTAGGAAGTGGGCTGGAGTG-3 0 containing the sequence encoding the V5 epitope (bold), HindIII and NotI restriction sites (underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into the HindIII and NotI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3.1-zeo (Invitrogen). To generate constructs encoding a soluble Fc-chimera of BCoV-HE, DNA encoding the ectodomain (residues 1-388) of BCoV-HE (accession no. AAL57307) was generated by gene synthesis (Eurofins MWG Operon) and subsequent amplification by PCR using the primers 5 0 -GACTGCTAGCATGTTTTTGCTTC CTAGATTTG-3 0 and 5 0 -GACTGGATCCACTTACCTGTATCATACACACA AATAGGTAC-3 0 containing NheI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The obtained PCR product was ligated into the NheI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-zeo, upstream of the sequence encoding the Fc part of human IgG1. A corresponding plasmid that encodes BCoV-HE 0 -Fc harbouring an inactive esterase domain due to the amino-acid exchange S40A was generated by sitedirected mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutagenesis primers 5 0 -GGAGATTGGTTTTTATTTGGTG ACGCCCGTTCAGATTG-3 0 and 5 0 -CAATCTGAACGGGCGTCACCAAATAA AAACCAATCTCC-3 0 . The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Mammalian cell lines and growth conditions. The murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK À (ATCC CCL1.3), the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671, HEK293T cells and CHO wild type (CHO-K1), CHO lec1, and CHO 6B2 cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1 (Biochrom) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Madin Darby canine kidney I cells (MDCK I) were cultured in DMEM (containing 450 mg l À 1 glucose; Biochrom) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Additional information on the used cell lines are given in the legends to Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 . The near-haploid human cell line HAP1 was purchased from Haplogen Genomics (Austria) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FCS at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Hybridoma cells producing mAb R24 (ATCC HB-8445) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) adjusted to contain 4.5 g l À 1 glucose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% FCS. All cell lines were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination using the PlasmoTest detection kit (InvivoGen). Inhibition of mucin-type O-glycosylation was achieved by cultivating CHO wild-type and CHO lec1 cells for 3 weeks in medium supplemented with 2 mM benzyl-N-acetyl-a-galactosaminide (benzyl-a-GalNAc; Calbiochem). Transfection of mammalian cells. Transfection of LM-TK À and CHO cells was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were grown in six-well plates (70-80% confluency), washed twice with PBS and transfected with 1 mg of plasmid DNA and 6 ml Lipofectamine in 1 ml of OptiMEM (Gibco). After 7 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 the transfection was stopped by adding 1 ml of culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For HAP1 and HEK293T cells, the protocol was varied by using 2 ml TurboFectin 8.0 (OriGene Technologies) or 2 ml polyethylenimine 'Max' (Polyscience) instead of Lipofectamine. For the selection of stable transfectants, 750 mg ml À 1 G418 (Calbiochem) or 750 mg ml À 1 zeocin (Life Technologies) were added 72 h after start of the transfection. Colonies were picked and cloned by limiting dilution. CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. CASD1 knockout cells were generated by Haplogen Genomics (Austria) based on the near-haploid human cell line HAP1 and CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing 48 . In brief, HAP1 cells were edited using the Streptococcus pyogenes nuclease Cas9, together with a guide RNA containing a gene-specific sequence targeting exon 3 of CASD1 (5 0 -ATGCAATA TGTTTATCTACA-3 0 ). CASD1 knockout HEK293T cells were generated by CRISPR/CAS-mediated genome editing essentially as described by Zheng et al. 67 with two guide RNAs targeting residues À 33 to À 14 and 38 to 57 of CASD1 exon 1 (5 0 -GTCCGCCGCGCACTGTTGTCA-3 0 and 5 0 -GTCAACCACTACTTC AGCGTG-3 0 , respectively). Single cell clones of HAP1 and HEK293T cells were isolated by limiting dilution and genotyped by PCR and DNA sequencing using the primers 5 0 -GGAGTGGTAAGTTAAACAAACCTGG-3 0 and 5 0 -TTTTTCAGCTC CTACTCAATCTGGA-3 0 (for HAP1 cells) and 5 0 -GCTATTAAGGCAGGAG GCTAAAG-3 0 and 5 0 -AACCACCAGCCATTGTCCTTTG-3 0 (for HEK293T cells). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RNA was prepared from mammalian cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from 1 mg of RNA using Revert Aid premium reverse transcriptase (Fermentas) and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Gene-specific cDNA was amplified using the following primer pairs: 5 0 -GTTTGGCAACCTCACAGTTGTATGATG-3 0 and 5 0 -AGTTTCTCTGCTCGATTCAG-3 0 (CASD1), and 5 0 -CACACCTTCTACAATG AGCTG-3 0 and 5 0 -GTCAGGTCCCGGCCAGCCAG-3 0 (-ACTIN). PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To confirm the presence of a 16-bp microdeletion in CASD1 transcripts of HAP1 DCASD1 cells, CASD1-specific cDNA was amplified using the primer pair 5 0 -CGCCTCCCGCCGCTACCGAGG-3 0 and 5 0 -CAATTGACGAATTCTGGAA TCTC-3, which allows the amplification of a 184-and 168-bp PCR product from wild-type and mutated CASD1, respectively. The obtained PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Production and purification of BCoV-HE-Fc and BCoV-HE 0 -Fc. BCoV-HE 0 -Fc and BCoV-HE-Fc were produced by transient expression in HEK293T cells and purified from the tissue culture supernatant as described 42 . As an alternative source of recombinant proteins, CHO cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding BCoV-HE-Fc or BCoV-HE 0 -Fc were cultivated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1 (Biochrom) containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 5% low IgG FCS (Gibco). Tissue culture supernatants from transfected HEK293T cells and conditioned medium of the CHO cells were collected and adsorbed to Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare). After washing with 20 column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, bound protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 2.8 and neutralized by 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. After addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mM, purified Fc chimeras were stored at -80°C. Expression and purification of sCASD1. Plasmids enabling the secreted expression of sCASD1 in insect cells were based on a modified pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) carrying sequence stretches encoding an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide (HBM) and a C-terminal Myc-His 6 -tag. The sequence encoding residues 39-304 of human CASD1 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5 0 -GCTCGGAGCTCCGCCTCCCGCCGCTACCGAGG-3 0 and 5 0 -GCTCGTCT AGATTGACAACAGGACCCATCTACAGG-3 0 , containing SacI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined), and either pcDNA-V5-CASD1(wt)-Myc or pcDNA-V5-CASD1(S94A)-Myc as template. The resulting PCR products were ligated into the restriction sites of the modified pFastBac1 vector, resulting in the plasmids pFastBac1-HBM-sCASD1(wt)-Myc-His 6 and pFastBac1-HBM-sCASD1(S94A)-Myc-His 6 . Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Gibco) were grown at 27°C in shaking cultures at 80 r.p.m. in protein-free Insect-Xpress medium (Lonza) and maintained at a density of 0.5 Â 10 6 to 6 Â 10 6 viable cells per ml. Transient expression of sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A was performed on infection with recombinant baculovirus particles generated by the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and the pFastBac1-based plasmids described above. Conditioned medium was collected 96 h after infection, concentrated 10-fold by tangential flow ultrafiltration (Ultrasette, cutoff of 10 kDa, Pall Corporation), diafiltered against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl and passed over a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). After washing with 20 column volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 containing 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol, bound protein was eluted by an imidazole gradient. The imidazole was subsequently removed by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM MES pH 6.8 containing 100 mM NaCl. Enzymatic removal of N-glycans. To remove N-glycans, 2 mg of sCASD1-wt were incubated with two units of PNGaseF (Alexis Biochemicals) in a total volume of 30 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. Digests were performed at 37°C for the indicated time points. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Roth) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare) for western blot analysis. Myc-tagged proteins were detected using mAb 9E10 (5 mg ml À 1 , Roche), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (1:20,000; Jackson Immunoresearch) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS. Membrane permeabilization was performed with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4°C. Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane by low concentrations of digitonin was performed as described 68 . Antibodies and virolectin were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature (RT) using the following concentrations: BCoV-HE 0 -Fc (2.5 mg ml À 1 ), anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (15 mg ml À 1 ; Roche cat. 11667149001), anti-V5 mAb (1 mg ml À 1 ; Acris cat.

PRB-114C) and human IgG Fc fragments (75 mg ml À 1 ; Jackson Immunoresearch). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with one of the following secondary antibodies used in a 1: De-O-acetylation of sialoglycoconjugates. To de-O-acetylate sialoglycoconjugates before the analysis with virolectin, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with either 0.1 M NaOH or 45 mg ml À 1 BCoV-HE-Fc in 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at 37°C. De-O-acetylation of bovine submandibular gland mucin (BSM; Sigma Aldrich) used for in vitro assays was performed overnight in 0.1 M triethylamine at 37°C followed by lyophilisation and resuspension in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5. In vitro esterase activity assay. Esterase activity was measured in a total volume of 100 ml containing 15 pmol protein (BCoV-HE-Fc, sCASD1-wt or BSA), 1 mM pNP-acetate (Sigma Aldrich), 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 and 50 mM KCl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at RT and the absorbance of released pNP was measured at 405 nm. Radioactive incorporation assay. For radioactive incorporation assays, 5 mg of purified protein (sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A) was incubated for 15 min at 37°C in a total volume of 50 ml containing 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 50 mM KCl and 2.5 mM [ 3 H]acetyl-CoA (0.37 kBq ml À 1 , American Radiolabeled Chemicals). To stabilize the acetyl-enzyme intermediate, reaction mixtures were kept at -20°C for at least 18 h. After thawing at RT, an aliquot of 10 ml was spotted on Whatman grade 3MM chromatography paper and free radioactivity was removed by descending paper chromatography using 300 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.5/70% ethanol as mobile phase. Radioactivity incorporated into protein remained at the origin and was quantified by scintillation counting. In vitro formation of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Purified sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A (5 mg) was incubated for 15 min at 37°C with or without 2.5 mM acetyl-CoA (Sigma Aldrich) in 50 ml containing 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and 50 mM KCl. After storage at -20°C for at least 18 h to stabilize the acetylenzyme intermediate, the reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE and the protein band was excised, digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-ESI-MS. In-gel digestion of proteins with trypsin. On separation by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (Roth), protein bands were excised from gels and subjected to tryptic digest. Briefly, the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (Roth). Subsequently, gel pieces were treated with 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 containing 100 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). After a second dehydration step with acetonitrile and rehydration with 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer followed by dehydration with acetonitrile, the dried gel pieces were rehydrated with 20 ng ml À 1 trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer and incubated overnight at 37°C. Peptides were extracted with 75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. In vitro SOAT activity assay using DMB-HPLC analysis. Enzyme assays were performed for 3 h at 37°C in 20 ml containing 50 mM MES pH 6.5, 10 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mM acetyl-CoA with or without 5 mg sCASD1-wt or sCASD1-S94A. As acceptor substrates, the following compounds were tested: CMP-Neu5Ac (600 mM; Nacalai Tesque); Neu5Ac (600 mM; Nacalai Tesque); a mixture of a2,3and a2,6-linked sialyllactose (600 mM; Sigma Aldrich); GD3 (600 mM; Calbiochem); fetuin (7 mg; Sigma Aldrich); and de-O-acetylated BSM (7 mg). After the enzyme reaction, Sias were released by acidic hydrolysis. To reduce O-acetyl group loss and migration during this step, we followed the protocol of Mawhinney and Chance 69 using 2 M propionic acid for 1 h at 80°C. Liberated Sias were subsequently derivatized with DMB according to Hara et al. 70 . Briefly, Sias were labelled for 2.5 h at 50°C using 8 mM DMB (Dojindo) in 1.5 M propionic acid containing 0.8 M -mercaptoethanol and 14.2 mM sodium hydrosulfite. Fluorescently labelled Sias were separated using the Shimadzu Prominence CBM-20A UFLC system equipped with a XSelect CSH C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters, 4.6 Â 250 mm, 5.0-mm particle size). Isocratic elution was performed with acetonitrile/methanol/H 2 O (9:7:84, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min À 1 and fluorescence was monitored with a fluorescence detector (RF-10A XL, Shimadzu) at 372 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission. For the assignment of individual peaks, the DMB-labelled Glyko sialic acid reference panel (Prozyme) was used. DMB-HPLC analysis of Golgi-confined Sia in HAP1 cells. For each cell type, HAP1 wt and HAP1 DCASD1 , 2 Â 10 7 cells were incubated in 100 ml PBS containing 15 mU sialidase isolated from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (EY Laboratories, Inc.) for 3 h at 37°C to remove cell surface Sia. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 100 ml of PBS in a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) at 5,000 r.p.m. for 3 Â 5 s. The microsomal fraction was obtained by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g and removal of the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed with PBS followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g, resuspended in 100 ml of 2 M propionic acid and incubated for 1 h at 80°C to release bound Sia. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000g, the supernatant was lyophilized, derivatized with DMB and analysed by HPLC as described. LC-ESI-MS. MS analysis of peptides and DMB-labelled sugars was performed on a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) equipped with an analytical column (Waters, BEH130C18, 100 mm Â 100 mm, 1.7-mm particle size) coupled online with an ESI Q-TOF (Q-TOF Ultima, Waters). DMB-labelled sugars dissolved in acetonitrile/methanol/H 2 O (9:7:84, v/v) and peptides dissolved in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid were separated by reverse-phase chromatography using acetonitrile as eluent. MS spectra were recorded in positive reflection mode and analytes were automatically subjected to fragmentation (MS/MS). Spectra were analysed using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters). MS/MS protein spectra were automatically analysed using the program ProteinLynx Global Server (Version 2.1, Waters). Ganglioside analysis by thin-layer chromatography. Gangliosides were extracted as described 19 . Briefly, 2 Â 10 7 cells were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), lysed for 15 min by sonication and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 r.p.m. Water was added to the supernatant to obtain a final ratio of chloroform/methanol/H 2 0 of 4:8:5 (v/v/v). After vortexing and centrifugation for 5 min at 4,800 r.p.m., the upper phase was recovered. The obtained ganglioside fraction was desalted on a Chromabond C18 cartridge (Macherey-Nagel) and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. Gangliosides were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), spotted on highperformance TLC plates (Nano-DURASIL-20, 10 Â 10 cm, Macherey-Nagel) and chromatographed for 30 min in chloroform/methanol/H 2 O (120:70:17, v/v/v) containing 0.02% CaCl 2 (ref. 5) . Plates were treated with 0.5% polyisobutyl methacrylate (Sigma Aldrich) in hexane and dried. After incubation in PBS followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT, immunostaining with enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed using the following antibodies: Anti-CD60b mAb UM4D4 (5 mg ml À 1 ; Santa Cruz cat. Sc-32269); anti-CD60c mAb U5 (40 mg ml À 1 ; kindly provided by Reinhard Schwartz-Albiez); anti-CD60a mAb R24 (10 mg ml À 1 ; purified from cell culture supernatant of hybridoma cells by Protein A affinity chromatography); goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (1:5,000; Southern Biotech cat. 1010-05); or goat anti-mouse IgM HRP conjugate (1:5,000; Southern Biotech cat. 1021-05). To induce migration of O-acetyl groups from the C7 to the C9 position of Sia, TLC plates were treated with 0.1 M glycine/NaOH pH 9.7 for 30 min at 37°C (ref. 5) before blocking with 1% BSA in PBS. 7-O-and 9-O-acetylated GD3 used as standards were purified from bovine buttermilk by Bernhard Kniep 25 and have been generously provided by Reinhard Schwartz-Albiez.
