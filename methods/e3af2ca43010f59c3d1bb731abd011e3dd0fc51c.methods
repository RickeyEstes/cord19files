Among the 16 full-length SARS coronavirus genomes, we selected 6 strains for which the accurate date of host death is known, and on which our modelling was based. Our model performed calculation under two hypotheses, which are commonly adopted and have lead to accurate prediction in the study of HIV-1 virus [10] : first, nucleotide variation of these strains occurred by independent mutations at random positions in a single ancestral sequence; second, there exist a molecular clock and a constant rate of evolution. In addition, we simplified the calculation by neglecting trivial non-linear effects of multimutation for a base, i.e. there has only been one mutation for a base at a specific position of all the sequences during SARS infection time. This simplification can be justified by further discussion (see Additional file: 1). For an ancestor sequence S 0 of a strain S, we can deduce for the assumptions above that where D(S 0 , S) is difference of the two sequences (as depicted by Hamming distance), T 0 is the date of the last ancestor, T is the date of host death (as an estimate of sampling date), and K is the evolution rate constant. The formula gives the expectation of sequence differences in proportion to the time of evolution. If S 0 is the last common ancestor of S and S', then we have E(D(S,S')) = E(D(S 0 ,S)) + E(D(S 0 ,S')) ( Fig. 1(a) ). The equation takes this form under the simplification that along the total of the infection paths of the two sequences, mutation at any specific point of the sequences could, at most, only occur once. Thus E(D(S,S')) ≈ K(T + T' -2T 0 ). The last common ancestor S 0 of all the sequences is the root of the hidden phylogenetic tree with the strains as nodes. From the time T 0 , the sequences should at least evolve along two different routes. Therefore, there should be a partition of the strains into B and B' such that every pair of strains S ∈ B and S' ∈ B' should share the root of the tree as their last common ancestor ( Fig. 1(b) ), i.e., for each pair <S, S'>, E(D(S,S')) should be linear to (T + T') with same parameter T 0 . Therefore, we can implement the least square method to estimate K and T 0 from the dataset. Since the real partition cannot be known in advance, we carried out calculations for all of the possible partitions of these 6 strains. For each division we use the estimated K to calculate the possible T 0 (S,S') of each sequence pair. The division with the minimum variance of T 0 (S,S') is taken as our best solution to the problem, and the corresponding K as an estimation of the mutation rate. To analyze how the parameters affect the results and support our fitting method, the Monte Carlo method was employed. At first, we produced a phylogenetic tree (See Fig. 3(c) ) and a table of parameters (See Table 3 ) including the evolution rate and the times of the sequences. From the time of the last common ancestor S 0 of the other sequences, every base of a given sequence has the possibility to mutate over time according to the given evolution rate. So the other sequences, included intermediate sequences (I) and final sequences (F), can be obtained in steps in the stimulation according to the given phylogenetic tree and the time parameters. After the sequences were obtained, we used our fitting method to get the evolution rate, without including the hidden parameters. By analysis of the estimated K from the data, we can get to know how the parameters affect our fitting results and the quality of our method.
