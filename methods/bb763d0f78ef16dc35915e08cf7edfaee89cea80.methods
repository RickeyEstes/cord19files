To address infection control, it is important to recognize an undergraduate nursing students' level of knowledge and compliance with SPs and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their education. This study was designed to assess knowledge and compliance with SPs and to test the efficacy of online instruction in SP training among university nursing students. The online teaching method allowed participants opportunities to save, exit, and reenter the program at will and to engage in multiple self-assessment activities. Findings from this study will provide baseline and instructional effectiveness data regarding infection control and SPs to advocate for systematically adding these curricula in national nursing programs in Jordan.
