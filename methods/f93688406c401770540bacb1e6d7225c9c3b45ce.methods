After consultation with local infection control professionals, we selected 9 surgical masks representative of those used in hospital and dental settings. The masks included a range of types (surgical, laser, procedure), models (cup, flat, duckbill), and fastenings (1 and 2 straps, ear loops). Masks were purchased from local or on-line suppliers. Results of PFE and BFE tests and FDA approval status are reported if available ( Table 1) . The fit testing portion of this project was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. We first evaluated filtration performance using monodisperse latex sphere and sodium chloride aerosols. Selected surgical masks were then evaluated for facial fit with volunteers, using both qualitative and quantitative fit tests.
