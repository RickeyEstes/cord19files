Working principle of the diagnosis assay Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram illustrating the diagnosis assay used in this study. The magnetic nanoparticles were surface-coated with anti-influenza A nucleoprotein (α-A-NP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), pre-loaded in a micromixer, and incubated with purified viral particle samples for 5 min (Figure 1, A) . The purification of nanoparticle-virus complexes was realized by washing out non-specific interferences when an external magnetic field was applied for 2 min (Figure 1, B) . After washing, the direct-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (PE) developing mAbs (α-A-NP-PE mAbs) was transported into the micromixer to incubate with the nanoparticle-virus complexes for 5 min (Figure 1, C) . The non-binding interferences were washed away and the purification of the nanoparticlevirus-developing mAb complexes with the similar process. Finally, an optical detection module was used to detect the optical signal of the purified nanoparticle-virus-developing mAbs complexes (Figure 1, D) . All detailed information about the on-chip experimental procedures regarding the magnetic nanoparticle bead-based microfluidic immunoassay is listed in Supplemental Table 1 .
