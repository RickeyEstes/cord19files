Animals and sample collection. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the regulations of the American Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) at the Kunming Primate Research Center, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All of the procedures were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Ethics Committee of the Kunming Institute of Zoology. In this study, 6 young (mean age = 7.0 years old) and 12 old (mean age = 18.2 years old) male ChRM without BV, SRV and STLV infection were intravenously (i.v.) infected with 3000 TCID 50 of SIVmac239 as previously described 53 . Four old macaques (96045, 96051, 96085 and 96649) that reached IACUC-defined endpoints were humanely euthanized with an overdose of barbiturates after their weights decreased by 30% because of persistent diarrhea (Supplementary Table S1 ). All of the animals were Mamu-A*01 negative, but 2 of the young (07067 and 08351) and 3 of the old (96061, 97077 and 99993) macaques still had at least one Mamu-B*03, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 allele related to slow SIV progression. EDTA-stabilized venous blood samples were collected within 84 days post-infection. Plasma was collected, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll Density Centrifugation Media (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Antibodies for flow cytometry. Human mAbs that cross-react with rhesus macaques were used at their optimal concentrations in this study. Anti-CD38-FITC (clone AT-1) was obtained from StemCell Technologies. Immunophenotyping. The absolute number of CD4 + T, CD8 + T and B cells in whole blood was measured using BD Trucount absolute counting tubes according to standard flow cytometric procedures, as described previously 23 . Leukocytes were surface − labeled with fluorescence − conjugated antibodies after treatment with red blood cell lysis buffer to delineate the naïve (CD95 dim CD28 − ), central memory (CD95 high CD28 + ) and effector memory (CD95 + CD28 − ) CD4 + and CD8 + T − cell subsets, as well as the naïve (CD27 − IgD + ), un − switched memory (CD27 + IgD + ), switched memory (CD27 + IgD − ) and double negative (CD27 − IgD − ) B − cell subsets. To evaluate the immune activation of each subset, anti − CD38, anti − HLA − DR, anti − PD − 1, anti − CD80 and anti − CD86 antibodies were also added for surface staining. Surface − labeled cells were fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/ Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) for Ki67 staining to detect proliferation. The acquisition of at least 1,000,000 events was performed using a FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Viral load. The number of viral RNA copies in the plasma was directly determined by one-step quantitative RT-PCR (ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems; RNA-direct Real Time PCR Master Mix, TOYOBO) using pure viral RNA, as previously described 22 . Quantitative RT-PCR. RNA and DNA were extracted from thawed cryopreserved PBMCs by using RNAisoPlus (TAKARA). mRNA levels were measured with the SYBR Green q-PCR method as previously described 54 . Briefly, purified RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TAKARA) and then amplified with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TAKARA) in a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System. Primers specific for RPL13A mRNA were used as an endogenous standard to normalize the samples. Fold-change was calculated by dividing the normalized post-infected sample quantity by the normalized pre-infected control quantity according to the ΔΔCt method. Genomic DNA (250-500 ng) was used for the absolute quantification of the T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC), the kappa-deletion recombination excision circle (KREC) and the TCR α constant gene (TCRAC). The quantification was carried out with Premix Ex Taq (Probe qPCR) (TAKARA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of TREC or KREC in the PBMCs was calculated with the following formula: TRECs or KRECs per PBMC = mean quantity of TREC or KREC/(mean quantity of TCRAC/2). The number of TRECs/T cells or KRECs/B cells can be calculated according to the flow cytometry-based frequency of T or B cells in PBMCs. The specific primer and probe sequences for each mRNA, DNA and SIVgag RNA are given in Supplementary Table S4. Statistical analysis. ANOVA was used to define the parameters that were significantly affected by SIV infection or that differed between the young and old macaques. Comparisons between day 0 and each day post-infection were performed with paired t-tests. The correlations between two variables in the correlation matrix were evaluated with Spearman's test. The analyses were performed using R 3.3.2, SPSS 22 (IBM) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad software). The data in the text are shown as average values. The threshold for statistical significance was a two-tailed P value of 0.05.
