The Core Competencies were used as the framework for this two-part outcome assessment [1] . In the first part of the assessment, a curriculum map was created by the first author (NB), a recent graduate of the MPH program, to understand the distribution of the Core Competencies across the nine core courses. Course outlines, class assignments, and lecture material were reviewed to determine the extent to which the competencies were covered in each course. Each competency was rated using a five-point scale: 1 -No coverage, 2 -Minimal coverage, 3 -Moderate coverage, 4 -Substantial coverage, and 5 -Core component of the course. A competency that is minimally covered was briefly taught in lectures but was not needed to complete assignments. Moderate coverage indicates that a competency was taught in two or more lectures and was needed to complete assignments. Substantial coverage indicates that a competency was highly relevant to, but not a primary focus of, a course where it was taught in numerous lectures and needed to complete assignments. A competency that is a core component of a course was incorporated into the course learning objectives, taught throughout the entire course, and was directly assessed in course assignments. Competency 1.5 "Demonstrate the ability to pursue lifelong learning opportunities in the field of public health" was not included in the curriculum map as it reflects an ability that is developed throughout one's professional career. The curriculum map was reviewed and validated by a second graduate of the MPH program, and the program coordinator, AP. In the second part of the assessment, a logic model was first developed that identified the program's inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, impact and external factors (see Additional file 1). The logic model and the program's critical success factors were used to develop survey questions. An online survey was constructed using the software program, LimeSurvey (http://www.limesurvey.org/en/). Informed consent was obtained prior to entering into the survey. The survey asked graduates to retrospectively assess their overall level of proficiency at the beginning of their program, and their proficiency in each of the Core Competencies at the end of their program, using a fivepoint scale: 1 -Needs improvement, 2 -Satisfactory, 3 -Good; 4 -Very good, and 5 -Outstanding. Students were also asked questions relating to the practicum placement, program curriculum and experience, and employment after graduation. In February 2013, the survey URL link was electronically distributed to all graduates via email and the University of Guelph MPH Facebook group page. Graduates were given three weeks to complete the survey. Analysis of the survey results was done using Excel. Any incomplete surveys were excluded from analysis. Descriptive statistics were determined for all ratings scale questions. Time of graduation was cross-referenced with employment status to provide a standard frame of reference. Open-ended comments were reviewed to identify key themes and patterns for program improvement. This study was approved by the University of Guelph Research Ethics Board (REB 13JA055).
