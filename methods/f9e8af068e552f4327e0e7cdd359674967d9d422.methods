Framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines was created in 2010-2013 in the EU-funded HEALTHVENT project. As a part of the project potential of efficient control policies to reduce the burden of disease caused by indoor exposures was estimated. Analysis was based on scenario comparison using a model, which was based on mass-balance framework and changes in ventilation level.
