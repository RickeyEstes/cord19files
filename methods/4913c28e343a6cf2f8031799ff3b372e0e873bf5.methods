Protein expression and purification. Protein expression and purification of HCoV-NL63 main protease has been described previously 66 . The coding sequence was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector, and transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Cell culture was first grown in LB medium containing 100 μg ml −1 ampicillin at 37 °C until optical density (OD600) reached 0.6. Protein expression was then induced by adding isopropyl β -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and further cultured at 16 °C for 16 hours. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. Cell lysate was prepared using sonication and centrifugation (12,000 g, 50 min, 4 °C). GST-tagged HCoV-NL63 M pro fusion protein was bound to glutathione sepharose 4B affinity resin, and GST tag was removed through on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 18 hours. Recombinant HCoV-NL63 M pro protein was subject to an additional step of anion-exchange chromatography using HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare), and was eluted with a linear gradient of 25 to 250 mM NaCl (20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Crystallization and data collection. Purified protein was supplemented with 10% DMSO and concentrated to 1 mg ml −1 . Crystals of HCoV-NL63 M pro in complex with inhibitor N3 were produced by cocrystallization. Inhibitor N3 was added to HCoV M pro protein at a molar ratio between 3:1 and 5:1, and incubated at 4 °C for 4 hours. The complex was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min, and concentrated to 10 mg ml −1 in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Using hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C, best crystals were obtained after 2 days using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M HEPES pH 5.5, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 4%(v/v) ethylene glycol (PDB entry 3TLO) and 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate pH 5.6, 1.0 M ammonium phosphate monobasic in a ratio of 80:20 67 . Data for HCoV-NL63 M pro -N3 complex was collected to a 2.85-Å resolution at 100 K on beamline 1W2B of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), using a MAR165 charge-coupled device detector. The cryoprotectant solution contained 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 0.1 M HEPES pH 5.5. All data integration and scaling were performed using HKL2000 68 . The Matthews coefficient of the crystal suggested two molecules per asymmetric unit, and the solvent content was 59.8%. Structure determination and analysis. The structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro -N3 complex was determined using molecular replacement from that of apo-form HCoV-NL63 M pro (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work). All cross-rotation and translation searches for molecular replacement were performed with Phaser 69 . Cycles of manual adjustment using Coot 70 and subsequent refinement using PHENIX 71 led to a final model with a crystallographic R factor (R cryst ) of 19.4% and a free R factor (R free ) of 24.1% at 2.85-Å resolution. Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays. Enzymatic assay was performed using a fluorogenic substrate with consensus sequence of CoV M pro , MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (> 95% purity, GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd., Shanghai, China), as previously reported 48, 49, 53 . Fluorescence intensity was monitored using a Fluoroskan Ascent instrument (Thermo Scientific, USA) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively. The assay was performed in a buffer solution consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 1 mM EDTA at 30 °C. Kinetic parameters, including K m and k cat of apo HCoV-NL63 M pro and K i and k 3 of inhibitor N3, were determined using methods described in detail in our previous work 49 .
