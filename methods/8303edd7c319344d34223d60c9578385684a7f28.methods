Study population. INSPIRE is an observational, population-based, longitudinal study of previously healthy, term infants enrolled near birth. Eligible infants were born between June and December and were on average â‰¤ 6 months of age during sampling for this study. Infants met our case definition of a respiratory illness visit based on responses to the bi-weekly respiratory illness surveillance questionnaires: a parent indicates ONE of the following major symptoms or diagnoses: wheezing, difficulty breathing, or told that your baby had a positive RSV test OR ANY TWO of the following minor symptoms or diagnoses: fever, runny nose/congestion/snotty nose, cough, ear infection (otitis media), or hoarse cry. Onset of symptoms must have been in the prior 7 days. If the infant met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit, an in-person visit was performed within 7 days of the report of symptom onset. Based on a Bi-weekly viral surveillance conducted during November through March, enrolled infants meeting pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness undergo an in-person visit and nasal wash sampling for viral determination using PCR. Informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of each infant. All procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board and were carried out in "accordance" with the approved guidelines. Demographic data -including age, sex, race and ethnicity -were recorded at the time of enrollment. Singleplex qRT-PCR assays for multiple viruses, including, RSV, human rhinovirus, human enterovirus, and human ribonuclease P (RNAseP) in nasal washes were performed according to standardized protocols 25, 33, 34 , and are described previously 25 . The algorithm used to select samples included all samples with a doctor diagnosis of bronchiolitis, plus, illnesses from the lower end of the severity spectrum based on an ordinal severity score 35 with an RSV cycle threshold greater than 20. This resulted in samples spanning winter virus season with variable severity. Samples from individuals with multiple RSV nasal washes were also included.
