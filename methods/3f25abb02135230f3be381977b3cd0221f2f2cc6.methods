This study used a repeated-measures crossover design. All subjects were followed for two 12-hour shifts/days (intersession interval !1 day). After being evaluated for eligibility, participants were randomly assigned to wear only an N95 or an N95 with mask overlay for a single 12-hour shift. During the second shift, participants were crossed over to the other intervention.
