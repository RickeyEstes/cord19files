Plasmid Construction. The mouse Mage-g1 cDNA was amplified using primers 5′ -ATACTCGAGAT GTTGCAGAAGCCGAGG-3′ and 5′ -ATAGAATTCAGAGGATGTGGCTGGGG-3′ by RT-PCR from mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells cDNA library, and then was subcloned into the Xho I and EcoR I sites of pCMV-3 × Flag vector (Addgene, USA), which is modified to contain COOH-terminal three tandem Flag tags. RFP-MAGE-G1 was constructed by inserting PCR amplified fragment into pDsRed2-N1 vector (Clontech, China). The DNA sequence encoding mouse FSCN1 and VIME protein were amplified by PCR from P19 cell cDNA library. GFP-FSCN1 and GFP-VIME were constructed by inserting PCR amplified fragment respectively into pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences, USA).
