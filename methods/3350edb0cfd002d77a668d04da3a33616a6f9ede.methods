Stratified random proportion sampling was adopted in this survey by use of self-report questionnaires. These consisted of four parts and included (1) standard questions to gather participant information, (2) questions pertaining to standard precautions knowledge, (3) questions on compliance with standard precautions, and (4) a general self-efficacy scale. Standard precautions knowledge questions were those developed by Askarian et al., 5 Wang, 6 and Li and Wang, 7 with modifications. They referred to the basic concepts, content, and activity requirements of the standard precautions, covering 20 items, with possible responses of 'yes', 'no', or 'unknown'. 'Yes' is given a value of 1 point, and 'no' or 'unknown' 0 points; the maximum possible score is 20. The higher the score, the greater the knowledge about standard precautions the participant has. The validity of the expertise judgments of the standard precautions questions is 0.98, reliability is 0.86, and Cronbach's a is 0.92. Compliance with standard precautions was determined using the standard precautions questionnaires developed by Askarian et al., 5 Wang, 6 and Li and Wang, 7 with modifications. There are 20 compliance items with a scale of 0-4 points: 0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = sometimes, 3 = usually, and 4 = always, giving a score range of 0-80. The higher the score, the better that person carries out the standard precautions. The validity of the expertise judgments of compliance with standard precautions questions is 0.98, reliability is 0.87, and Cronbach's a is 0.93. The general self-efficacy scale (GSES) used was that originally devised by German psychologist Schwarzer and colleagues in 1981; 8 it has been demonstrated to give a good representation of self-efficacy in a variety of settings. 9,10 The scale is a singledimension scale, with 10 questions. Each question is assigned points from 1 to 4, and the final score is the average score of the 10 questions. The Chinese version, translated by Chinese scholars, has been proved to have good validity and reliability; 11 Cronbach's a is 0.87 and the test-retest reliability is 0.83, while the correlative factor of items with the full score has a range of 0.60-0.77. 12 The questionnaires were handed out by the investigators (the authors) at each site, and collected on the spot once they had been completed individually and anonymously by the sampled nurses.
