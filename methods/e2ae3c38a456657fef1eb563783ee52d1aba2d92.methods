A sequence S, of length l, is defined as a linear succession of symbols from a finite alphabet A, of length n. A k-word (or kmer, k-tuple, etc.) x ¼ a 1 a 2 Á Á Á a k is a subsequence of k adjacent letters, a i 2 A; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; k. Obviously, there are a total of n k possible k-words for the alphabet A. The occurrence of x (denoted by N x ) is the number of times it is seen through sliding a window of width k once across the sequence, and frequency of this word f x is obtained by simply dividing the total number of words (i.e., f x ¼ N x =ðl À k þ 1Þ). Given a symbol sequence, we can represent it as a point in the high dimensional Euclidean space by a mapping from S to the vector of its word counts, or frequencies: . . . ; f x n k Þ: To evaluate the distance between two sequences, it is intuitive to compute the norm of the difference between their corresponding frequency (or occurrence) vectors, where f 1;x i and f 2;x i are frequencies of the word x i in sequences S 1 and S 2 , respectively. The norm gives mathematically well defined distance functions for all positive values of p. Here p ¼ 1 gives the Manhattan distance, which was used in [7, 13] ; p ¼ 2 gives the Euclidean distance [14] ; p ¼ 1 gives the max-norm (where only the largest absolute value contributes). However, these simple distances are not satisfying for an accuracy phylogeny, because (i) they treat all word types equally, despite that they have different background frequencies, and (ii) contribution of a word may not merely be a polynomial function of the frequency difference. In order to overcome the above problems, the Mahalanobis and standard Euclidean distance, which take into account the data covariance structure, were proposed for sequence comparison relatively recently [15] . In this paper, we will propose two distance measurements free of such problems by using a probabilistic framework. The most immediate model for word occurrences is the binomial distribution, i.e., each word x has the same probability p to appear at any word location. When p is very small, sequence length l is sufficiently large, and the value of lp is moderate, the occurrences of x in this sequence approximately follow the Poisson distribution with the parameter lp. In what follows we will explore two distance metrics on the basis of the Poisson distribution of word occurrences.
