Five infectious diseases (dengue, hepatitis A, malaria, measles and typhoid) were chosen as useful examples of imported infections as they have different routes of transmission, preventive measures and levels of endemicity. General and disease-specific notification forms used in 2013 in Australia and New Zealand, and national notification forms from Canada and England were collected. Each of these countries has increasingly diverse migrant communities and large numbers of overseas travellers, and strategies to reduce the incidence of imported infections are likely to be similar. A search was performed of the website of the New Zealand Crown Research Institute "Environmental Science and Research" to identify relevant general and diseasespecific notification forms for the five diseases. Australian disease surveillance is collated nationally, using information from each jurisdiction. The latter are responsible for collecting disease notification information. Templates for Australian disease-specific notification forms are available from the "Series of National Guidelines" (SoNGs), but jurisdictions can develop their own forms. The websites of all eight jurisdictions (six States and two Territories) were searched and each jurisdiction was also contacted by telephone and/or email to request forms not publicly available. To provide additional comparisons of notification data collected, public health experts from England and Canada were contacted to request relevant notification forms. The authors considered that national forms from these countries would provide enough information to make useful comparators, whilst the collection of all local surveillance forms could have resulted in the collection of potentially nearly 100 forms, with few new insights. For data extraction, specific data fields included on available notification forms were categorised into information specific to travel history, relevant demographic data and that relating to the severity of the notified infection. Although not all surveillance forms used the same wording, they were considered to include this information if it was worded in an unambiguous way. Surveillance forms were examined to determine the range of data collected in each specific category. Authors, all of whom had practical and academic public health experience in the field of imported infections then discussed each variable to determine its usefulness, drawing on examples of where each had been used in the academic literature to inform policy about imported infections where appropriate.
