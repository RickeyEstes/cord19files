Patient recruitment and sample collection. Three cohorts of pediatric patients were recruited from March 2009 to December 2012 in Chongqing Children's Hospital, Chongqing, China. Cohort 1 comprised hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), which was determined based on cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and/or acute fever.37.5uC. For recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected upon hospital admission. Cohort 2 comprised outpatients with diarrhea, who had. 3 loose stools in the previous 24 hours. Patients who had confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, food intolerance, or patients who had any apparent clinical respiratory signs or symptoms were excluded. Stool samples were collected from the recruited patients. Cohort 3 consisted of patients who were diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), according to the guidelines released by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.moh.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/ mohyzs/s3586/201004/46884.htm). The outpatients were generally mild, with fever, and manifested at least one of the following features: maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms, and/or soles, vesicles or ulcers in the mouth. Hospitalized patients were diagnosed with severe HFMD if they manifested one of the following additional complications: encephalitis, meningitis, AFP, or cardiorespiratory failure. For all HFMD patients, stool samples were collected, whereas for some cases, stool, throat swab, and serum samples were collected. In addition, CSF was additionally collected for some cases diagnosed with encephalitis. Healthy children who were recruited from the community during the same study period were used as controls, from whom stool, throat swab, and serum samples were also collected. None of the recruited healthy children exhibited ARTI, diarrhea, or HFMD-related symptoms during the recent one month of recruit. Laboratory detection. All collected samples were tested for SAFV using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting the 59 untranslated region (UTR) as previously described 11 . All samples with positive reactions were further amplified using nested RT-PCR targeting the 59-UTR, which generated a 540-bp amplicon 11 . A patient was considered to be infected with SAFV when positive detection was obtained in any type of the samples. The viral protein (VP) 1 gene of all positive samples were amplified using nested RT-PCR approach as previously described 26 . The detection of other viral pathogens varied for three cohorts. For cohort 1, NPA samples were screened by RT-PCR or PCR for common respiratory viruses, which include influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A and B subtypes, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1, 2, 3, and 4, metapneumovirus (MPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), coronavirus (COV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and human bocavirus (HBoV) as previously described 27, 28 . In cohort 2, stool specimens were tested for the following viruses using the corresponding tools: rotaviruses A, IDEIA rotavirus direct antigen detection kit (IDEIA, Oxiod, UK); rotaviruses B and C, HAdV, sapovirus, and astrovirus, PCR or RT-PCR 29 ; and noroviruses GI and GII and HBoV, real-time PCR 30, 31 . In cohort 3, all collected stools, throat swabs, CSFs, and sera were subjected to detection of enterovirus (EV), and further classification of EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was performed using real-time PCR using previously described primers 32 . To further identify the EV serotypes other than EV71 and CVA16, semi-nested RT-PCR, which is specific for a 59 partial region of VP1, was performed for other EV-positive samples using previously reported primers 33 . The amplicons were subjected to sequencing and BLAST analysis. This study was performed with the approval of the Ethical Committees of Chongqing Children's Hospital and Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. At recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from all guardians of participants. SAFV strains accession numbers. The sequences obtained from the study were submitted to NCBI with the GenBank Accession Numbers KJ944637-KJ944718. The genomic sequences were assembled using Lasergene's DNA SeqMan software (version 7.1.0, DNA Star Inc. Madison, WI, USA). The MEGA program (version 6.0, Sudhir Kumar, Arizona State University) was used for alignments and phylogenetic tree construction by maximum likelihood method using 1000 bootstrap pseudo replicates. Nucleotide identities among strains were calculated using BioEdit (version 7.13, www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html). Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed, with continuous variables summarized as median and range, and categorical variables summarized as frequencies and proportions. The statistical significance between various groups was tested using the x 2 -test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and independent t test or nonparametric test for continuous variables. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS).
