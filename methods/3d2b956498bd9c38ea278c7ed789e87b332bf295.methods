In the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confi rmed by recombinant immunofl uorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, χ², and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.
