Literature search was conducted using a PubMed search with the following key terms: 'rhinitis' and 'preschool', and filtering for articles in English and published 2006-2011 (n = 565 articles). We screen titles and abstracts of the search results for studies discussing rhinitis separate from other morbidities, and also for studies discussing subjects <6 years old separately from older children. The screened publications were selected based on the following criteria: (1) Epidemiology and risk factor analysis (n = 45), and (2) therapeutics, intervention and management (n = 13). Most of the initial search results were filtered out as they focussed on co-morbidities such as rhinosinusitis or allergy in general. In addition, most of the other search results touching on rhinitis did not discuss children <6 years old separate from older children. Additional information on the progression of rhinitis was obtained with the following key search terms: 'rhinitis' and 'natural history' (n = 3). Additionally the search terms 'rhinitis' and 'management guidelines' were included (n = 3). Fig. 1 illustrates the workflow of the literature search in this review.
