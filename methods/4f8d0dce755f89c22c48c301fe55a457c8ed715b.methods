Between April 2009 and January 2010, FLU-CIN collected clinical, epidemiological and outcome data on patients admitted to 75 hospitals in 31 UK cities or towns with confirmed H1N1pdm infection. The details of data collection and the overall findings from the first wave of the 2009 pandemic have been described elsewhere [6] , but the analysis described here is based on the full dataset from the first and second waves combined [11] . Briefly, H1N1pdm infection was diagnosed by a positive reverse transcriptase PCR result from respiratory samples obtained during the admission episode. A large dataset was collected by specifically trained data collectors, and included demography, pre-existing medical conditions, acute and long-term medications and clinical observations at the time of hospital admission. A diagnosis of pneumonia was based on the criteria as previously described [12] : 1) admission chest radiograph report clearly suggestive of pneumonia; 2) admission chest radiograph report of acute infiltrates but no consolidation; and 3) no chest radiograph report available but admission radiograph documented in the clinical notes as being in keeping with pneumonia (n524). Clinical observations were matched to criteria of the National Health Service Swine Flu Community Assessment Tool for adults and children aged ,16 years (online supplementary table A) [13] . FLU-CIN was a public health surveillance project for which the Ethics and Confidentiality Committee of the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care in England reviewed procedures and approved the collection, storage and use of personal data for surveillance purposes without the need for individual participant consent. This report represents a secondary analysis of the entire FLU-CIN database that includes data on 1520 patients from both spring/summer 2009 (n5601) and autumn/winter 2009/2010 (n5919) pandemic waves. Analyses and statistical methods Descriptive analyses were performed comparing patients with and without asthma. The diagnosis of asthma was based on records in the medical case notes at the time of hospital admission and did not require documentation of confirmatory spirometry. These analyses were also performed separately for children (aged ,16 years) and adults; p-values were calculated using the Chi-squared test for categorical exposure variables. A nested case-control analysis of the surveillance cohort was used to investigate the association between a diagnosis of asthma and severe outcome from H1N1pdm 2009 infection, the latter being defined as death or the need for level 2 (high dependency unit) or level 3 (intensive care unit) care while in hospital. Patients with ''severe outcomes'' constituted ''cases''. Potential confounding variables in the multivariable logistic regression were identified from both our previous work investigating risk factors for severe outcomes in the same cohort [11] and an a priori conceptual framework based on the descriptive analyses. The effect of the following covariates on the relationship between asthma and severe outcomes was independently assessed by introducing them separately, in turn, into the original model: age; comorbidities (using the Charlson index, excluding asthma cases) [14] ; immune compromise; season of admission; severity of illness at admission (severe respiratory distress; increased respiratory rate; oxygen saturation f92%; respiratory exhaustion; severe clinical dehydration or shock; altered consciousness; dyspnoea and C-reactive protein levels); pre-admission inhaled steroid use; time to hospital admission (from symptom onset); in-hospital antiviral use; in-hospital antibiotic use; and inhospital oral/intravenous corticosteroid use. Any covariate that modified the original unadjusted odds ratio by at least 10% towards a null association was then included in the final multivariable logistic regression model. If the association of asthma with less severe outcomes was fully explained by associated comorbidities or treatments, then the adjusted odds ratio of asthma with severe outcomes would be expected to approximate one in the final multivariate model. By way of a further check on the robustness of our findings, an expanded multivariable analysis was also performed including all covariates that were independently associated with both exposure (asthma) and outcome. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. A p-value of ,0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. STATA (release 11; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
