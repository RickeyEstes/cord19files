The software tool PCRv is written in the Python programming language. PCRv consists of a user friendly graphical user interface and coordinates the use of software programs ClustalW2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2002) and SSEARCH (Brenner et al., 1998; Pearson, 1991; Pearson et al., 2017; to perform in silico validation. PCRv is suitable to determine the in silico sensitivity (conservation of sequences) and in silico specificity (selectivity) of different PCR formats. To monitor the performance of PCRv, a set of flagged internal control sequences (FICS) are randomly added to the sequence database. PCRv processes data and analyses results, and generates a validation report that includes a summarizing table as well as a list of detailed results for an easy check of potential false positives and false negatives. An overview of all actions executed by PCRv is shown in Fig. 2 .
