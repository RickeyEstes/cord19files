The sentinel surveillance network in Madagascar has been described elsewhere [11, 12] . Briefly, it includes primary healthcare centres (sentinel sites) from across the country ( Figure  1 ) and is managed by a national steering committee. The network was expanded from 13 influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel sites in 2007 to 34 sentinel sites in 2011, with the aim of improving geographic coverage and representativeness of the country as a whole (4 sites are located in Antananarivo) ( Figure 1 ). The sentinel surveillance system makes use of syndromic indicators to monitor the occurrence of selected diseases of importance for the country. The main criterion for the inclusion of cases or patients is fever or diarrhoea. For patients with fever, additional screening criteria (based on syndromic case definitions) are used to identify specific syndromes: malaria, ILI, dengue-like syndromes. Standard WHO case definitions are used, to ensure comparability [11, 12] . Malaria diagnosis requires biologic confirmation with a positive rapid diagnostic test in patients with fever syndromes. Cases and patients at the participating sites are identified by trained healthcare personnel participating in the surveillance network on a voluntary basis. One of the key features of the system is the timely transmission of syndromic data, on a daily basis, by coded short message service (SMS) messages sent from mobile phones. Upon reception at the IPM, the data transmitted in this manner are input daily into a specifically designed MS AccessÂ® database and analysed as soon as possible after the patients' initial visit. This results in a turnaround time of 24 hours, from data collection to reception at the IPM, even for data sent from the most remote areas of the country. The data received by SMS include: sentinel site code, date of data collection, total number of outpatient consultations, total number of confirmed malaria cases, total number of ILI cases, total number of dengue-like cases, total number of diarrhoea cases, and the number of consultations by age group. The age groups were those commonly used by the Ministry of Health in Madagascar: less than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, 25 years and over. Surveillance data are analysed and presented in easy-to-interpret tables and graphs providing the number of cases for each syndrome monitored. In addition, daily and weekly baselines (mean number of cases in the corresponding period of previous years) are calculated for each syndrome and plotted against current observations, to identify early signs of outbreaks triggering alerts. The information is disseminated on a weekly and monthly basis to healthcare staff involved in the network and to the staff of the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Madagascar.
