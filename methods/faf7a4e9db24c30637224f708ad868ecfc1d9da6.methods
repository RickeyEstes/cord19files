In order to study the role of changes in contact patterns and in travel behavior along the calendar, we considered a mathematical approach for the spatial transmission of influenza in Belgium. We built a discrete stochastic age-specific spatial metapopulation model at the municipality level, based on demographic, mixing, and mobility data of Belgium. We parameterized it with influenzalike-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health at the district level for the 2008/2009 season. By using the Belgian school calendar for that season, we assessed the impact of the individual changes in mixing and travel behavior during regular school closure, given by available data. We then tested experimental scenarios to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed epidemic outcomes. Here, we describe in detail the mathematical model, input data, calibration procedure and experimental scenarios.
