Our empirical work focused on the immediate localities surrounding two, expanding, regional airports, situated within different regions of England. The airports hosted direct flights to 'international' (i.e. non-European Economic Area (EEA)) destinations and provided low cost scheduled and charter services within the EEA. Both airports supported a significant number of long-haul 'spoke', or feeder, services to airports in the eastern US, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. The two airports were owned by separate organisations and, for reasons of confidentiality, the airports (and their surrounding localities) will be hereafter referred to as 'A' and 'B'. The empirical data presented in this paper was obtained from 18 participants. They were selected on the basis of their job role, in particular, the extent to which it incorporated port health and/or emergency preparedness duties. On occasion, this presented difficulties, as individuals' responsibilities were not always clear from their job title. As a result, we communicated with identified persons prior to interview to ascertain the nature of their duties. We also acted on recommendations from previous contacts. The fieldwork was conducted over a four month period, from late April to mid-August 2010. Ethical approval for this study was received from Loughborough University, and the research was undertaken in accordance with the University's Code of Practice relating to investigations on human participants (LU, WWW, 2009). The exact number of PCTs and local authorities in each locality has been masked to avoid identifying the two case study areas. The interviewees comprised managers, researchers and practitioners based at the two airports and within the surrounding local authorities, PCTs and HPUs, as well as at an HPU serving a third regional airport and a regional Public Health Observatory (refer Table 2 ). Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Where it was not possible to interview participants, we compiled detailed questionnaires, which were sent electronically to the relevant individual. The questions, in the interview schedules and questionnaires, covered four general areas. Data from both the interviews and the questionnaires are presented in this paper. First, the context to the existing port health and/or emergency preparedness work at the interviewee's organisation was established. In particular, we wished to understand more fully: participant role; whether the participant worked alone, or with colleagues within the organisation; and the history of the role, Strategic responsibility for health protection at an English regional airport other than Airports A and B. 2. Administrator. Responsible for collating statistical data to ensure the HPU fulfils its remit. Regional Public Health Observatory Senior Analyst. Remit includes statistical and epidemiological analysis of public health data including any changes in remit affected during the term being served by the existing postholder. Second, we considered collaborative working with external organisations across local, regional and national scales. Potential partners included local authorities, PCTs, HPUs, Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs), the Department for Health and the UKBA. In this section of the interview schedule/ questionnaire, we asked questions about the history of any collaborative working and sought clarity on professional boundaries and organisational responsibilities. Third, we investigated organisational port health and pandemic preparedness enactments in greater detail by asking questions relating to: (i) policies in these areas; (ii) steps taken to safeguard the local population against pandemic risk during the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Fourth, we asked the participants to consider lessons learnt from the H1N1 pandemic outbreak, and any other port health incidents. In addition, we sought their views on future challenges in relation to port health/pandemic preparedness. Data analysis was conducted on interview transcripts and completed questionnaires. Each text was independently assessed by two of this paper's authors to identify areas of significance for participants. Key words and themes (for example, 'H1N1', 'airport', 'preparedness', 'collaborative working') were highlighted. Due to the relatively small size of the sample, this work was undertaken within Microsoft Word. The findings from our empirical research are discussed in the next section. Case studies: distributed preparedness and the management of H1N1 surrounding two regional airports Both case study areas were considered representative of the new border 'within' and agencies located at these sites had, to varying degrees, worked on pandemic planning. With reference to the 2009e2010 H1N1 outbreak, we briefly consider the international connectivity of the airports within each case study area, before discussing preparedness work undertaken by various local agencies and the extent to which it resulted in actions within their communities.
