This study used a cross-sectional and descriptive design by distributing 400 self-report questionnaires to nurses and asking trained data collectors to complete observational checklists from 33 units and 51 wards. The study was conducted in 7 governmental and 1 university hospitals in Jordan. The questionnaire and observation checklist were adapted and developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2007 isolation precautions guidelines and previous studies. 5, 8, 9 Ethical approval was obtained from AL al-Bayt University and the selected hospitals. The questionnaires include 5 questions regarding nurses' demographics and background, 12 true or false questions about nurses' knowledge, and 14 questions about nurses' practices in relation to isolation precautions. The knowledge questions have true, false, and I do not know responses; the practice questions have 3 Likert scale responses: never, sometimes, and always. The observation checklist included 8 yes or no questions about the availability of isolation rooms and supplies and 2 questions about nurses' compliance with standard-and transmission-based infection control practices. Knowledge questions were assigned a score of 1 for correct answers and 0 for false and I do not know answers. The answers to the practice part were scored as 0 for never and sometimes and 1 for always. The total knowledge and practices scores were calculated and converted to a percentage. For this study, knowledge and practice were defined as good (>75%), acceptable (50%-75%), and poor (<50%). 16 The questionnaire and observation checklist were assessed for content validity by a group of PhD holders from Al al-Bayt University. The doctors were asked to check the questionnaire and the checklist for clarity and comprehensiveness and modify them where necessary. In addition, to assess the questionnaire's reliability, a pilot study was conducted with 20 nurses. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency with a Cronbach Î± reliability of 0.77 for the practice part and 0.89 for the knowledge part. The researcher used 3 trained data collectors from Al al-Bayt University with Master's degrees in nursing to distribute the questionnaires and to complete the observation checklist. The main researcher delivered a 2-hour training session to them beforehand. The training included looking at the content of the observation checklist and how to complete it. For the questionnaires, the data collectors were to ask nurses to participate in the study after describing the study's aim and content. During data collection, verbal consent was gained from each participant after they had read the covering letter, which included details about their rights in relation to their participation. For the observation checklist, the data collectors visited the units and wards 3 times for 1 hour each visit to complete the checklists. Later, all completed sheets were checked by the data collectors for accuracy and completeness.
