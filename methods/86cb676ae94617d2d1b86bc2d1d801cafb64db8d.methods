Study subjects. BAL was performed in 23 nonsmoking male volunteers. Subjects were selected after a thorough questionnaire and clinical examination to exclude those with past or present illness as well as those taking any medication. In addition, pulmonary function tests were performed and subjects with abnormal spirometry or positive methacholine challenge test were excluded. All were nonsmokers. BAL from patients who underwent bronchoscopy for diagnostic purpose were also retrospectively analyzed. Patient populations represented various pathologic conditions including tumors, sarcoidosis, infectious diseases, and AIDS. The study protocol in the normal volunteers was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. No formal request was made for BAL analysis in the patients group because this part of the study was retrospective and because BAL was done primarily for diagnostic purposes. BAL and sample preparation. Bronchoscopy was performed in normal nonsmoldng subjects and patients according to standard procedure. 9 Sterile 0.9% saline solution (150 to 200 ml) was injected in 50 ml aliquots via a fiber optic bronchoscope, was aspirated, and was filtered through sterile gauze. In the volunteers the lavage was done exclusively in a subsegment of the right middle lobe. Because the recovery and time of contact of the injected liquid may be an important parameter that influences the results, these parameters were maintained in as standardized a fashion as possible in the volunteer study. Total recovered cells and differential cell counts were determined on an aliquot sample and treated as cell cultures (below). The remaining cells and fluid were separated by centrifugation. Aliquots of supernatants were frozen at -80 Â° C. In the volunteer study, macrophages were isolated by adhesion on plastic for 2 hours in RPMI (Gibco) medium containing 5% FCS. Differential cell counts were performed after concentration by filtration through Millipore (5 Ixm, SMWP 02500) membranes and hematoxylin-light green or Giemsa staining. Enzymatic activities were measured in 150 p~l (APN and DPP IV) or 200 p.1 (ACE) of supernatants as described below. Blood was withdrawn at the time of lavage in the volunteer study, and aliquots of serum were frozen. Six broad disorder categories were defined as follows: (1) sarcoidosis of any stage, diagnosed with lung biopsy or with a characteristic BAL cellular profile; (2) interstitial pneumopathy of any origin, where the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was reasonably excluded; (3) pulmonary infections in immunocompetent patients; (4) pulmonary infections in HIV-positive patients (any stage); (5) primary or secondary lung neoplasm; (6) blood malignancy of the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage.
