The proposed, biologically inspired strategy (denoted simply AS, where A stands for ameba) is constructed in three steps. First, we describe the Physarum model for the shortest path selection. We then modify the model by adding a noise factor to select the paths alternative to the shortest one along which the disease can still spread, albeit with a lower probability. Second, the original Physarum (single-source, single-sink) model is further modified to become a single-source, multi-sink model to consider the spread of the disease to multiple targets simultaneously. With these modifications, the model measures the dependence of each node in the network on the focal node. The third and final step in the construction of AS is motivated by the fact that applying the modified Physarum model to a large network is impractical due to a possible lack of information on the network structure or the high computational expense. Accordingly, for each focal node, a subnetwork consisting of the focal node itself and its R-step neighbors is separated from whole network, whereupon the model is applied to this R-local subnetwork. To test the performance of AS, we conduct numerical simulations on several computer-generated and empirical networks. Internal functioning of AS. Node 1 marked with wax-yellow color is the focal node, whereas the other nodes are its first-level neighbors. Panels a and b show the results of two model iterations in which nodes 3 and 2 are selected as the source nodes, respectively. These results are summed to produce the so-called flow matrix in panel c. Upon running all possible iterations (see the accompanying text), the ASscore for the focal node is obtained by summing the elements of the flow matrix across all edges.
