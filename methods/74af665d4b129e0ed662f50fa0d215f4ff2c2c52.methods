Study participants. RSV-infected infants were enrolled from three cohorts in order to capture the full spectrum of disease severity. A birth cohort was enrolled at the University of Rochester Medical Center's (URMC), Strong Memorial Hospital and Highland Hospital, and Rochester General Hospital (RGH) for two winter seasons, extending from August 15 to February 1 for 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, and followed by passive and active surveillance for development of RSV infection during the winter months (November 1-April 1). A second cohort was enrolled in pediatric offices or the emergency room at URMC's Golisano Children's Hospital or RGH when respiratory symptoms were present. The third cohort was enrolled on admission to the hospital with documented RSV infection. Eligible infants were full-term (>36 weeks gestation), healthy infants born after May 1 and less than 10 months of age at infection. RSV-infected infants underwent evaluation by two members of the study team (a physician and a nurse). Demographic data, illness symptoms, findings on physical examination, results of laboratory and radiograph results were recorded. A nasal swab was obtained using a medium sized flocked swab (Copan Diagnostics Inc. Murrieta, CA, cat. no. 501CS01) and placed in 2 ml of sterile UV-inactivated water for quantitative RSV reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A 2-3 ml sample of heparinized blood was collected for CD4 gene expression studies as previously described 12 . RSV severity score. RSV disease severity was measured using the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS) on a scale from 0-10, with higher scores representing more severe infection 67 . The GRSS was developed using an unbiased data-driven approach with nine clinical variables (including the infant's general appearance, the presence of wheezing, rales, retractions, cyanosis, lethargy, and poor air movement). The maximal age-adjusted respiratory rate, as well as the worst room air oxygen saturation, are also included in the score. The GRSS is highly predictive of other potential parameters of severity, such as need for hospitalization and duration of hospitalization 67 . The GRSS has an excellent ability to discriminate between mild and severe disease with AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) ~0.961. An infant with a GRSS ≤ 3.5 (or > 3.5) is classified as having mild (or severe) infection, respectively. For more information see 67 . We note that using continuous or discrete severity scores in our analyses resulted in similar results, so for simplicity we treated RSV infection severity as a binary variable. CD4 + t cell extraction. CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 − T cells were isolated from freshly collected peripheral blood samples as previously described 12, 68 . Briefly, within 24 hours of collection, Ficoll-purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained and sorted into major lymphocyte populations. Sorted cells were immediately lysed and homogenized in RNA extraction buffer and stored for later purification. transcriptomic data collection and analysis. RNA extraction, processing and normalization. RNA-Seq data for CD4 + T cells were collected at two distinct time points, with 46 samples collected during the acute visit (Visit 1) and 34 samples collected on follow-up day 12-16 (Visit 2). RNA purification, library preparation, sequencing and data processing were essentially the same as previously described 12, 68, 69 . Briefly, library preparation was performed using the NexteraXT library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the SMARter Ultra Low amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at a target depth of ~20 million 100-bp single end reads per sample. Raw reads were mapped to Human Genome GRCh38 (annotation of GENCODE 23) and normalized by FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads). The transcriptome data contained reads for 11,576 genes with unique Gene Symbol annotations across 80 total samples. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Differential expression analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was performed on FPKM normalized RNA-Seq data using the Bioconductor 70 limma package (version 3.30.13) 71 . We note that principal component (PC) analysis indicated an association of the leading PC with enrollment season. Several methods have been developed to directly regress out signals related to batch in expression data [72] [73] [74] . We used ComBat function from sva (version 3.26.0) to correct for differences from enrollment season 75 . In our differential-expression analysis we compared groups based on RSV infection severity (mild vs. severe) while correcting for sex and race. RSV viral load from nasal swab and nasal wash did not show any association with severity of infection 26 and were not included as covariates. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed (DE) if their Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value was less than 0.05. Differential variability analysis. We used var.test() in R (3.4.3 (2017-11-30) ) to perform an F-test on log2-transformed gene expression data in order to statistically quantify differences in variance in gene expression levels between the mild and severe RSV-infected groups. Genes were considered significantly differentially variable if their Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value was less than 0.05. Gene Ontology pathway analysis. We used the topGO package (version 2.30.1) 41 in R to assess the enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) pathways in a given gene list. Gene lists analyzed included (1) genes that were identified as significantly differentially-variable (see above), as well as (2) the top 100 genes associated with a gene principal component (PC) from principal component analysis on transcriptome data, based on the associated PC-loadings (see below). In the topGO (version 2.30.1) analysis, we used the 11,576 genes with measured reads in our RNA-Seq data as a background. Microbiome data collection and analysis. 16S rRNA sequencing. Nasal swab specimens were collected during acute RSV-related illness (Visit 1) and one month later (Visit 3). As described in 69 , bacterial 16 S rRNA from these samples was extracted, amplified, and sequenced, and the resulting data were used to determine the taxonomic compositions, in terms of the relative abundances of those present operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Briefly, the V3-V4 hypervariable regions were targeted for amplification and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform according to a paired end 2 × 300 bp read protocol. Preliminary read processing and quality control were performed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package 76 , and a closed-reference OTU picking was done with USEARCH and the GreenGenes reference database 76 . The final microbiome data contained information for 1,022 distinct OTUs across 91 samples. Multivariate association Analysis with Linear modeling (MaAsLin). We used MaAsLin (version 0.0.5) to test for significant relationships between microbial clusters and clinical outcome (severe or mild infection). MaAsLin is a multivariate statistical framework that finds associations between clinical metadata and potentially high-dimensional experimental data 76 . In contrast to transcriptomic data, the application of batch correction methods to microbiome data is still nascent 77 . Therefore, when we applied MaAsLin we adjusted for potential confounding factors, including sex and race, as well as enrollment season, which was removed by batch-correction in our transcriptomic data analysis. All microbiome samples from both Visit 1 and Visit 3 were used when running MaAsLin. integrative analysis of transcriptomic and microbiomic data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on transcriptomic and microbiomic data. To maximize statistical power in the integrative analysis, we first performed dimension reduction 47 . In particular, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to host transcriptomics data to create a handful of gene principal components (gPCs), and to the nasal microbiomics data to create a few clade principal components (cPCs) 76 . To achieve that, we used the prcomp() function in the stats (version 3.4.3) package in R to perform PCA on the OTU relative abundance profiles and the FPKM-normalized RNA-Seq gene expression profiles (after applying batch-effect correction for enrollment season). In this integrative analysis, we restricted ourselves to samples from 40 subjects with both microbiome and transcriptome data collected during Visit 1. The top 13 gPCs and top 10 cPCs, which explained 95% of the variance in the transcriptomic and microbiomic data, respectively, were selected for further analysis. Correlation between gPCs and cPCs. We constructed a Spearman correlation matrix comparing the top 13 gPCs and the top 10 cPCs, using cor() function from the stats (version 3.4.3) package in R. We treated this global 13×10 correlation matrix as the weighted adjacency matrix of a complete bipartite graph (G α , where the subscript α denotes the fact that G α is derived using all the 40 input samples) that contains two types of nodes, gPCs and cPCs. Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples (LIONESS). In order to relate gPC/cPC associations to clinical variables, we applied the LIONESS method to G α to construct sample-specific (infant-specific) correlation networks 49 . LIONESS works under the assumption that the global correlation network represents a linear combination of N different networks, one from each of the N input samples. Therefore, to construct the network for sample q, we first exclude sample q and calculate the Spearman correlation matrix using the remaining samples (G (α−q) ). We then use the LIONESS equation, = − + ) , to find the network estimate for that sample (G q ). We applied LIONESS to the nasal microbiome and host transcriptome samples collected from the same set of 40 infants during Visit 1. The end result of this analysis was 40 sample-specific networks, i.e., bipartite graphs relating gPCs and cPCs.
