Emergency medical services system ambulances in Beijing are staffed by physicians with training in emergency medicine diagnosis and procedures appropriate for the prehospital evaluation and treatment of ACS in the prehospital setting. Emergency medical services system physicians enter clinical data on standardized forms, including the patients' general information, chief complaint, medical history, bedside physical examination, and a preliminary diagnosis. In this study, the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007, were reviewed by 2 emergency attending physicians. Acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed by EMS system physicians in the prehospital setting, based on symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and the patient's prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram. Physicians reviewing the charts for purposes of this study did not seek to agree or disagree with the diagnosis so long as all the required data were present on the EMS system run sheets. According to the defined population in the reports of the World Health Organization Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) project and the high incidence of ACS in the aged population in Beijing, ACS events in individuals older than 20 years were studied. The MONICA project monitors the prevalence of acute cardiac events in 21 countries, including China [6, 7] . Data from the case records including age, sex, date, time of onset of ACS, and the diagnosis were extracted for the present study. Cases were grouped in intervals by decade from the age of 20 to 89 years, with one group including all patients older than 89 years. Demographic data (in the year of 2006) of population ratio of age groups and sex groups were obtained from the Web site of Beijing Statistical Information Net (http://www.bjstats.gov.cn/tjnj/ 2006-tjnj/). Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. Ï‡ 2 test was performed to evaluate the distribution variation during the day or the week, and P b .05 was taken as the statistically significant level. All analyses were carried out with the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences 11.5 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Adjusted frequency, corresponding to relative ACS frequency in unit population of the age group, was calculated by the following equation: adjusted frequency = cases of the age group/population ratio of the age group (%)/100.
