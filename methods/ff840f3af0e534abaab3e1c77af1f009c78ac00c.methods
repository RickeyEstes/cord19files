The system: Scottish aquaculture and epidemiology of BKD Scottish farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) production was 144,247 tonnes in 2009 (Walker, 2010) and industry figures show 2010 production to be worth £500 M at farm gate value and £1 BN retail value (SSPO, 2011) ; salmon was Scotland's largest single food export product. Scottish production of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was also substantial at 6766 tonnes in 2009 (Walker, 2010) . About 90% of Scottish salmonid fish farms are salmon and 10% trout (Walker, 2010) ; very small numbers of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) are also farmed. Aquaculture is a major employer and investor both at the Scottish level, but more particularly in many regional communities where there are relatively few alternative sources of employment. Scottish aquaculture has been affected by a range of disease problems and infectious diseases account for about a third of all the losses to production from marine salmon farms (Soares et al., 2011) , other losses being to production processes, adverse environments and predators. One of the diseases infecting both salmon and trout farms is bacterial kidney disease (BKD) (Bruno, 2004; Murray et al., 2011) . This disease is caused by the pathogen R. salmoninarum, which is found in Western Europe (including GB, but not Ireland), North America, Japan and Chile (Toranzo et al., 2005) . In Scotland R. salmoninarum is spread between farms primarily with the movement of fish (Austin and Rayment, 1985; Murray et al., 2011) . Although bacteria are shed into the aquatic environment particularly from clinically diseased fish (McKibben and Pascho, 1999) , they survive poorly in the water and so are unlikely to be transported except over short distances (Austin and Rayment, 1985) . Outbreaks of BKD tend to reflect patterns of transport within companies . R. salmoninarum can also be transmitted vertically with eggs (Evelyn et al., 1986) , however this requires the high infection loads associated with clinical disease and no Scottish broodstock farm has yet tested positive. Both salmon and trout are moved extensively in a complex network of contacts between farms (Green et al., 2009; Jonkers et al., 2010) . These movements occur throughout GB and ova are imported from sources worldwide, although imports of live salmonid fish are limited to a few from BKD free areas of the EU (Walker, 2010) (mostly the Republic of Ireland). The movement of fish between farms is an essential requirement of the production cycle, both biologically and economically. Fish are moved from hatcheries to ongrowing farms, and all salmon, and some trout, are moved from freshwater farms to marine farms as they smolt. Movements of fish tend to involve large numbers and so even pathogens present at low levels within the population are likely to be transported (Fenichel et al., 2008) . BKD is notifiable within the United Kingdom (UK), so it is a legal requirement to report suspicion or confirmation of the presence of this disease (Munro, 2007) . Suspicion also applies with contact tracing of farms that have received or deliver fish to the infected farm within 6 months or are in the same locality (subcatchment of a river or within tidal excursion distance at sea). On report of suspicion, official fish health inspectors (FHI) visit the farm; in addition FHI routinely inspect all farms annually. Under the control regime that applied up until 2010 the FHI took samples from 150 fish at suspect sites, and, every other year, 30 fish from sites visited for routine inspection. Recently the policy has changed (Richards, 2011) , such that sampling only occurs if the FHI observe signs consistent with BKD when visiting farms whether for a routine or targeted inspection. Until 2010 samples were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed using bacterial culture; since 2011 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been used as the sole test on animals with clinical signs. Analysis of these diagnostic methods indicated that although they are sensitive at detecting and specific at confirming R. salmoninarum in the presence of clinical BKD (Bruno et al., 2007) , both ELISA and culture have relatively poor sensitivity for confirmation of subclinical infection because bacterial colonies are few and localised in such fish (Austin and Rayment, 1985) . However, the R. salmoninarum qPCR is a considerably more sensitive test for subclinical infection . When low test sensitivity is combined with low levels of infection within infected populations and further reduced sensitivity in pooled samples, analysis shows that the routine sampling as practiced in Scotland up until 2010 was of negligible value in detecting subclinical infection . If a farm tests positive it is placed under movement restrictions (Munro, 2007) , first a Thirty Day Notice (TDN) and then, if infection was confirmed, a Designated Area Order (DAO). DAOs are now called Confirmed Designation Notices (CDNs) but the term DAO will be used in this manuscript as it applied at the time for which data are presented. These TDNs and DAOs prohibited movement from the farm, except for the case of non-diseased fish to other similarly infected farms (Munro, 2007) , restrictions have recently been lifted on movements to trout farms in areas containing no salmon farms (Richards, 2011) . Movement of clinically disease fish is banned under welfare legislation. Previously, restrictions were lifted from a farm after 150 fish have tested negative on two occasions by ELISA by FHI, now only one sample of 150 fish by qPCR is required because of the greater sensitivity found for this test. Restrictions can also be lifted (now and under the old regime) if the farm has been depopulated, disinfected and fallowed. The first ever report of BKD was in Scottish wild salmon and was referred to 'Dee disease' (Mackie et al., 1933; Smith, 1964) , BKD is a significant cause of wild fish mortality in other countries to this day (Fenichel et al., 2009) . However, BKD has not been reported from Scottish wild freshwater fish since the 1960s. Extensive ELISA screening of wild fish by FHI and researchers in Scotland since the 1960s has returned only negative results (for example 4520 wild freshwater fish were sampled between 1989 and 2004 alone ). In 2003 an ELISA positive was obtained from a single herring (Clupea harengus) taken from within a cage holding salmon with advanced clinical BKD (unpublished result). Recent qPCR sampling of 2703 Scottish freshwater fish gave positive results for two pools of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), one pool of minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and 3 (likely escaped) rainbow trout pools; the positive samples were obtained close to infected farms and none had signs of BKD . Low levels of infection were also found in England and Wales (40 by qPCR and 2 by culture out of 946 fish sampled) by Chambers et al. (2008) . These wild fish might sometimes act as a reservoir, particularly if R. salmoninarum were eradicated from farms. Given this low level of infection and its chronic nature it is reasonable to assume that BKD has little impact on Scottish wild fish populations and they have little role in BKD transmission between farms so it is reasonable not to include them explicitly in the model, although they may be relevant to parameter values concerned with transmission and persistence of infection and potential roles are noted when the model parameter values are considered. Given the low level of R. salmoninarum infection in Scottish wild fish, we do not include these in the modelling. The situation in Scotland is in contrast to North America, where the dynamics of BKD in managed wild salmonid populations have been modelled for the Great Lakes by Fenichel et al. (2009) and the Snake River in Washington State by Hamel (2001) . Previous BKD control strategies in the UK were underpinned by European Union (EU) Addition Guarantees (AG) that banned imports of fish and ova to the UK from areas of the EU affected by BKD (Munro, 2007) . However, these AG were dependent on an effective eradication programme and, while controls had kept the prevalence of BKD low, eradication was not occurring in GB (see Fig. 2 later), although Ireland (including Northern Ireland) retains AG for BKD. Furthermore a conflict of interest between salmon farmers, who supported the existing controls, and trout farmers, who did not, meant that alternative control strategies needed to be investigated (Richards, 2011) for their likely effect on the prevalence of BKD.
