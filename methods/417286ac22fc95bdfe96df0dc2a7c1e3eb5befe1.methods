Description of measuring ambient CO 2 and O 2 concentrations during hypercarbic or atmospheric gas for in vitro Experiments 1 and 2b. We previously used CO 2 (ProCO 2 ) and O 2 (ProO 2 ) sensors in our enclosed flow cages (30.5 cm widthˆ30.5 cm in. heightˆ61 cm in length) where we verified that O 2 and CO 2 concentrations remain normal with atmospheric air infusion, and that only the CO 2 concentrations rapidly increase from <1% to 20% at the 5 min time point for CO 2 challenge [40] . Here we used state of the art sensors to measure changes in the concentrations of CO 2 (COZIR Ambientsensor, 0%-100% range with 3%+/´error, Gas Sensing Solutions, Cumbernauld, UK) and O 2 (Luminox O 2 UV light flux sensor, 0%-25% range with 2%+/´error, CO 2 Meter, Inc., Osmond Beach, FL, USA) with the battery operated sensors within the cages interfaced with Gaslab data acquisition software (CO2 Meter, Inc., Osmond Beach, FL, USA) on a Windows operating system (Microsoft, Seattle, WA, USA). For Experiment 1, the measurements of ambient CO 2 and O 2 were collected during the animals' exposure to the gases described for Experiment 1. For Experiment 2b, the measurements of ambient CO 2 and O 2 were collected from an empty chamber, but the gas was infused as described for Experiment 2a.
