The Vpu channel structure used in the study is a pentameric form of the TM region modeled in a recent study [24] . In addition to the protein, the system includes 95 lipid (POPC) molecules, 5496 water molecules, 13 K + ions and 18 Cl 2 ions, with a total of 31984 atoms. Prior to the current study, the system was equilibrated for 30 ns without any restraints and was found to be adequately equilibrated, as evidenced from the convergence of RMSD, the occurrence of several stabilizing intra-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and the retaining of the structural integrity of the channel, in general. The transport of two different ions through the channel was studied, namely Na + and K + . For modeling the permeation of a K + ion, the coordinates of a K + ion from bulk water were first swapped with a water molecule at the C-terminus of the channel. Conformations with the K + ion occurring at different positions along the axis of the pore were generated by pulling the ion along the pore axis using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. The ion was pulled at a constant velocity of 0.01 Å ps 21 by applying an external force on a dummy atom connected to the permeating ion via a spring with a harmonic constant of 10 kcal mol 21 Å 22 . The structural model for the channel was aligned along the z-axis [24] , and hence the pulling force was applied along the z-axis, thereby making the ion move from the Cterminus to the N-terminus. Positional restraints with force constant 1 kcal mol 21 Å 22 were applied on the heavy atoms of the protein to prevent the drifting of the helices during the pulling of the ion. Constant temperature and pressure were employed by using Langevin dynamics and a Langevin pressure piston, respectively. It must be noted that the SMD simulations were used to obtain the initial structures for the umbrella sampling simulations and not for investigating the permeation mechanism. The NAMD program [50, 51] was used for the SMD simulations with the CHARMM22 all-atom protein force field with CMAP corrections [52, 53] , the CHARMM36 all-atom lipid force field [54] , optimized parameters for ions [55] , and the TIP3P water model [56] . For the studies on the permeation of Na + , the conformations were generated by replacing the K + ion in the pore with an Na + ion. Umbrella sampling was performed by applying a biasing potential on the permeating ion, with the potential having a parabolic form. Independent simulations were performed for different positions of the ion along the pore axis, so that each simulation sampled the conformations of the system with the ion at the respective region. For a window i, the biasing potential has the form where k is the harmonic constant, z i,0 is the center of the window i, and z is the position of the ion along the reaction coordinate at any given instant. The potential energy function then has the form where r N denotes the positions of all the atoms in the system, and E u (r N ) is the unbiased potential energy function. The unbiased probability distribution of the ion along the pore axis P i u (z) is computed from the biased probability distribution P i b (z), and is given by The free energy along the reaction coordinate is then given by where F i is a constant for window i. There are several approaches for determining F i , of which the most popular is the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [57] [58] [59] . It calculates the unbiased global distribution P u (z) using the relation where p i (z) is the weight for window i which ensures that the statistical error for P u (z) is minimized. It is given by where N i is the number of steps sampled for window i. F i is calculated using the relation and F i are calculated in a self-consistent manner using the above equations. Conformations with the ion placed at different places along the pore axis were extracted from the SMD simulation, and were used as initial structures for the different windows in the umbrella sampling calculations. The ion position ranged from z = 230 Å to z = 36 Å , giving a total of 133 windows along the z-axis spaced 0.5 Å apart (the model structure used in the study had previously been aligned along the z-axis). A distribution of ion positions around the center of a given window was obtained by applying a biasing potential with a force constant of 20 kcal mol 21 Å 22 on the ion using the MMFP module in the CHARMM program [60] . Positional restraints with force constant 1 kcal 21 mol 21 Å 22 were applied on the backbone C a atoms of the protein to prevent the drifting of the channel. Ions other than the permeating ion were excluded from the pore region by using a repulsive sphere of radius 15 Å , with the repulsive force acting on ions only when they entered this sphere. Covalent bonds involving hydrogen were constrained using SHAKE [61] . Simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble using the CHARMM program [60] with the same force field parameters as those used in the pulling simulations mentioned above. Simulations for each window involved 100 ps of equilibration followed by 1 ns of production, with a simulation time of (133 * 1.1) ns for each free energy profile. For calculating the potential of mean force (PMF) for the transport of the ion across the channel, the umbrella sampling trajectories were unbiased using WHAM [57] [58] [59] . The permeation of two K + ions through the channel was modeled by considering different positions of one ion relative to the second ion, with the spacing between the two ions varying from 4 Å to 10 Å (additional windows with 11 Å and 12 Å spacing between the ions were sampled for the middle region of the channel). A total of 395 windows spaced 1 Å apart were sampled with the two ions at different positions along the pore axis. A biasing harmonic potential of force constant 10 kcal mol 21 Å 22 was applied on the two ions. Parameters for the other restraints used were the same as those used for the calculations with a single ion in the pore. Equilibration and production runs for each window were carried out for 100 ps and 200 ps, respectively. The total simulation time combining all the single ion and two-ion simulations was more than 0.4 ms, with a total of 661 independent simulations. All molecular images were rendered using the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) program [62] . An electrostatic surface representation of the channel was generated using the PDB2PQR server [63] .
