The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 checklist was used to guide the method development and reporting of findings. 10 MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched from inception to March 17, 2013 Studies in which physical disease was assessed for its association with resilient outcomes were included. Peerreviewed quantitative studies with 100 or more participants were eligible. The sample size restriction was applied for pragmatic reasons, as our early work demonstrated that studies of physical disease and resilient outcomes often involved complex analyses with multiple variables and that analyses with smaller populations were often underpowered. Studies examining only psychiatric disorders and resilience at a family or community level were excluded, as were studies not in the English language. The authors were contacted for studies that were not accessible. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by 2 reviewers (M. C. J. and T. P.) and any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer (C. B.). The references of included articles were screened for relevance. Primary data extraction was carried out by M. C. J. and T. P., with 3 others acting as independent second reviewers (C. D. B., A. E., and L. I.). The data extraction form was prepared by M. C. J. and finalized after discussion with the other reviewers. Data extraction included the study characteristics, the theoretical definition of resilience given by the authors, and the measures of resilience used. Any disagreement between the reviewers following this process was resolved by the third reviewer (C. B.). We used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network critical appraisal checklists to assess the quality of included studies. 11 The quality of the study was not used as an exclusion criterion but as a guide to inform interpretation of the findings. Owing to the heterogeneity of the studies and their findings, a meta-analysis was not carried out and the results were combined using a narrative technique.
