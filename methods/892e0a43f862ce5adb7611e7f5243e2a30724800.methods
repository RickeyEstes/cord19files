Participants and study design. A convenience sample of pilgrims participating in the Hajj from 2014 to 2017 was surveyed. Potential adult participants were recruited at a private specialized travel agency from Marseille, France, organizing journeys to Mecca, Saudi Arabia and invited to participate in the study. They were included and followed-up by a medical bilingual (Arabic and French) doctor who traveled with the group. Upon inclusion before departing from France, the pilgrims were interviewed using a standardized pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected items about demographic characteristics (age, sex, place of birth), immunization status (vaccination against influenza and IPD) and medical history (chronic medical conditions, immunodeficiency, body mass index (BMI)). Pilgrims were considered to have been vaccinated immunized against influenza when they had been vaccinated within the last year, but before 10 days of the date of travel. Pilgrims were considered immune to IPD when they had been vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) in the past 5 years [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Clinical events occurring during the travel (type of respiratory symptoms, date of onset, duration of symptoms, antibiotic treatment provided) and persistence of respiratory symptoms at return were collected by a medical doctor using a post-Hajj questionnaire at 2 days before the pilgrims' return to France. The information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, use of hand gel disinfectant and disposable handkerchiefs was documented. Ill pilgrims, who spontaneously consulted the accompanying medical doctor at the time of onset during the Hajj, underwent a complementary nasopharyngeal swab (per-Hajj specimens). ILI was defined as the presence of cough, sore throat and subjective fever 40 . Based on the WHO classification, underweight was define as a BMI below 18.5, normal with a BMI from 18.5 to less than 25, overweight with a BMI greater ≥25 and obesity with a BMI greater ≥30 41 . The protocol was approved by the Aix-Marseille University institutional review board (July 23 rd , 2013; reference no. 2013-A00961-44). The study was performed according to the good clinical practices recommended by the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. All participants provided an informed written consent. Respiratory specimen. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each pilgrim, transferred to Sigma-Virocult ® medium and stored at −80 °C until processing. Pre-Hajj and post-Hajj nasopharyngeal swabs were systematically collected at enrollment, prior traveling to Saudi Arabia and two days prior returning to France, respectively. In addition, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at symptom onset when possible. Respiratory specimens. DNA and RNA were extracted from the respiratory samples using the EZ1 Advanced XL (Qiagen, Hilden, German) with the Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative real-time PCRs were conducted using a C1000 Touch ™ Thermal Cycle (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Negative control (PCR mix) and positive control (DNA from bacterial strain or RNA from viral strain) were included in each run. Positive results of bacteria or virus amplification were defined as those with a cycle threshold (CT) value ≤35. Identification of respiratory bacteria. Real-time PCR amplifications were carried out using the LightCycler ® 480 Probes Master kit (Roche diagnostics, France) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The SDD gene of H. influenzae, nucA gene of S. aureus, phoE gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae, lytA CDC gene of S. pneumoniae, were amplified with internal DNA extraction controls TISS, as previously described 22 . The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested in this study were the most frequent microorganism detected among French pilgrims, according to previous studies 28, 29 . All other pathogens (adenovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis) with prevalence <1% were not included in this study. The acquisition of respiratory bacteria and viruses was defined as negative before travel and positive during the Hajj and/or when returning to France.

STATA software version 11.1 (Copyright 2009 StataCorp LP, http://www.stata.com) was used for statistical analysis. Differences in the proportions were tested by Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests when appropriate. In order to evaluate the potential acquisition of respiratory pathogens in Saudi Arabia, we used the McNemar's Test to compare their prevalence before leaving France and in Saudi Arabia (during and after the Hajj). Unadjusted associations between multiple factors and prevalence of respiratory pathogen acquisition and prevalence of respiratory symptom during the Hajj were examined by univariable analysis. The results were presented by percentages and risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results with a p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Only the variables with a prevalence ≥5.0% were considered for statistical analysis. Variables with p values <0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate factor's adjusted risk ratios regarding respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens acquisition 43 .
