C. leptum preparation C. leptum was purchased from Jilin Baoxin Biological Technology (Changchun, China). We isolated the strain from a human fecal sample and stored it at −80°C. A single C. leptum colony was grown in chopped meat broth (before use, 500 μg/mL cycloserine and 15 μg/mL cefoxitin) for 24 h, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The freshly prepared bacteria in PBS were used for oral feeding.
