Two simple scenarios ( Figure 1A ) were used to assess the likely impact of travel restrictions on the spread of a pandemic in Australia. In the fi rst, it was assumed that the initial cases occurred in Sydney. The growth of this epidemic and its resultant spread to Melbourne in the presence of travel restrictions were simulated. This scenario is indicative of the spread to other large centers with similar travel volumes. In the second scenario, the initial case was assumed to occur in Darwin, a smaller Australian city in close proximity to Southeast Asia, and the growth of this epidemic and spread to Sydney were simulated. The Darwin-to-Sydney scenario, with a comparatively low travel volume, represents the situation of containing the epidemic within a smaller town through the use of travel restrictions. Key parameters and assumptions are summarized in Table 1 .
