ISTAM is a bottom-up ABM in which the transmission network is built on the simulated physical contacts between individuals at a fine space-time scale [39, 40] . At this scale, human social behaviour, the environment's physical conditions and the transmission mode of the specific infectious disease are considered. Activity bundle (AB) is a key concept in ISTAM. An AB is a semantic space where contact probability varies as a function of the dynamics of humans inside the bundle. The simulation is at two levels: people's movements between ABs and contact between individuals within ABs. It is accepted that the possibility of infection for susceptible individuals increases with proximity to infectious individuals [41] [42] [43] . In addition, there exist social rules for how close humans can approach each other. Hall [44] identified four distances: intimate distance, personal distance, social distance and public distance. The values of the above distances vary between populations from different cultures, ages, genders etc. This knowledge provides a basis for within-AB simulation. For example, the model should focus on the changing distances between individuals and, specifically, when the distances are small enough for infection. The contacts between individuals are driven by social purposes or constrained by physical conditions or both, while infection per se is a physical process. Some contacts are indispensable for undertaking some activities. For example, an individual who goes shopping will generally make contact with the salesperson when checking out. Some contacts, although not purposeful, occur due to the restriction of the environment. For example, on a crowded bus, passengers must sit or stand in proximity. The first type of contact is voluntary and is determined by the individuals. The second type of contact is involuntary and is not wholly determined by the individuals. The spatial distribution pattern of individuals can be observed in most types of AB. One example is provided by a restaurant: people sit in clusters which reflect the existence of different groups. Another example is provided by individuals visiting a library: people may try to find an empty table and sit as far as possible from each other [45] . In some ABs, such as in a lecture room, individuals are assumed to remain static during the simulation time unit. In other ABs, movements must be considered. At fine spatial scales, individuals' movement patterns may be strongly confined by the physical condition of the current AB and the status of other individuals. Three properties of humans' space-time dynamics within ABs that have been observed in reality are considered when modelling individuals within ISTAM: (1) individuals' static spatial distribution patterns, (2) individuals' movement patterns and (3) minimum distances between individuals. For more details about within-AB simulation using ISTAM, see [39] . ISTAM was previously applied to simulate hypothetical influenza outbreaks within the campus of the University of Southampton [40] and the city of Eemnes in the Netherlands [39] . The latter case provided an example of the simulation of the individual-based transmission of infectious disease at the whole city level. For the latter case, the first requirement was to build the population and the spatial structure of the city of Eemnes. The social and spatial structures of the city were built based on surveyed data of individuals' daily activities, synthesized data of households and land use data from previous research [46] . Properties such as family structure, number of cars and income level were assigned to every household and properties such as age and gender, and activity patterns, were assigned to every individual. Among the whole population of 8382 people, 3.2% were 4 years old or younger, 3.5% were between 5 and 9, 6.4% were between 10 and 17, 71.3% were between 17 and 64, and 15.6% were 65 years or older. During the simulation, individuals' daily activities were generated from a distribution of observed activity patterns and then individuals' movements between ABs and the interaction of individuals within ABs were simulated. During these interactions, infection was possible conditional upon contact between individuals. For the latter case, parameters such as the contact frequency and contact intimacy which determine how often individuals come into contact and the probability for a contact to bring about infection in the model were calibrated by studies which indicated the average number of daily contacts for a person and the basic reproductive number for influenza R 0 (the average number of secondary cases caused by each case of an infectious disease), respectively. In ISTAM, the latent period for influenza was assumed to be 1 to 3 days, the incubation period was one day longer than the latent period and the infectious period was 3 to 6 days [47] [48] [49] . The proximity and duration required for infection were assumed to be 1.5 m and 10 minutes, respectively. A baseline simulation of a hypothetical disease outbreak in the city of Eemnes based on ISTAM was presented previously [39] . This paper extends the baseline model by testing three CDC control measures for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in Eemnes using ISTAM. These were: (1) refrain from social activities (A): the probability of an individual to visit certain places such as social, leisure and sports facilities was decreased to a certain level; (2) school closure (S): the probability of a pupil to visit school was decreased to 0; (3) household quarantine (H): a certain proportion of individuals was required to stay at home at all times. Because in reality, compliance to a control measure may be less than 100%, especially for the cessation of social activities and household quarantine, a series of compliance levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were tested for both A and H. Two or three control measures can work together denoted by the abbreviations AS, AH, SH and SHA, with a default 50% compliance level for both A and H and 100% compliance level for S. The scenario with no control measures (denoted by N) was also tested for comparison purposes. An alert value (a threshold number of infection cases) was used to denote how quickly the control measure was implemented. At the beginning of each day, if the number of infection cases is greater than the alert value, the control measure will be implemented. This meant that there was a small delay of less than one whole day duration between exceeding the alert threshold and intervention. All control measures were assigned an alert value of 20 cases except N. Additionally, for control measure SH, a series of alert values (20, 50, 100, 200 , 500 and 1000) and a series of rates of transmission (with R 0 of 1.24, 1.79, 2.42, and 2.60) were explored. For each of the above scenarios, 300 simulations were run.
