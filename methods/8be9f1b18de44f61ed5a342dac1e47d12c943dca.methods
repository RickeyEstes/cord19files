In this section, we introduce the two-stage procedure which is then applied for inferring panpathogen host factors. The first part of the procedure consists of a random effects model that is used to infer pan-pathogen gene effects that quantify the overall impact of gene perturbation on the life cycle of a group of pathogens. The second part of the procedure uses the inferred gene effects and propagates them over a biological network.
