Immunocytochemical methods parallel those of immunohistochemistry. There are several steps previous to the incubation of the primary antibody (e.g., endogenous peroxidase block, nonspecifi c binding block, avidin-biotin block, antigen retrieval). After the primary antibody incubation, a secondary, and sometimes a tertiary, reagent is necessary to demonstrate the immune reaction. The peroxidase block is necessary when using immunoperoxidase techniques; the usual method is with 3% H 2 0 2 in deionized water. The peroxidase blocking step can be omitted in acetone-fi xed specimens. Antigen retrieval is necessary in numerous occasions. Unfortunately, there is no rule to determine a priori whether antigen retrieval is needed or which method is optimal. The approach to standardize ICC is similar to that for IHC. A comprehensive list of antibodies used in ICC at the National Cancer Institute including antibody sources, dilution of the primary antibody, and fi xation and antigen retrieval methods is available (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) .
