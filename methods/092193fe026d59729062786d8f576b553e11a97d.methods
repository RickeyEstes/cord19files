The method of global gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays has proven to be a sensitive method to develop and refine the molecular determinants of human disorders [55] . Using this technology, we compared the gene expression profiles of SARS, HIV and other diseases. To avoid the problems of comparing microarray data of different platforms and experimental systems, we normalized the gene expression data in each microarray sample (disease state or control) using the Z-score transformation (Z ij ) for each disease gene expression matrix using Z ij = where SD is the standard deviation, g ij represents the expression value of gene i in sample j. This transformation allows for the direct comparison of gene expression values across various microarray samples and diseases. To combined more than one data series or experiments for a given disease, we employed a linear regression approach to obtain a combined t-test statistic between two conditions. Data were log 2 -transformed and we calculated expression level for each gene using a linear regression model : where Y i is the gene expression value and X i is a disease state (disease or control). The coefficients β 0 and β 1 are the parameters of this model and were estimated by least squares. The t-test statistic, when estimating the value of β 1 , is the same as the standard t-test statistic between disease and control states. Time series microarray gene expression data analysis was divide into two steps: pre-processing and identification of statistically significant points by t-test, ANOVA and regression analysis to find differently expressed gene profiles in different time points. In the first step, we preprocessed the experimental data using different statistical methods and finally followed by post less normalization, recommended by the Golden Spike Project [84] . In the second step, we have used a most suitable method "maSigPro" (microarray Significant Profiles) to identify differentially expressed genes in time-course microarray experiments, which is a two step regression method successfully applied on more than one groups of time-series [85, 86] . This two steps regression strategy is used to find genes with significant temporal expression changes and significant differences between experimental groups. This procedure first adjusts this global model by the leastsquared technique to identify differentially expressed genes and selects significant genes applying false discovery rate control procedures. Then stepwise regression is applied as a variable selection strategy to study differences between experimental groups and statistically significant profiles. After finding differentially gene expression profiles among the group of experiments, the next step is to cluster them according to their profile similarities. The hierarchical clustering and the median gene expression profiles of clusters are performed according to the "maSigPro" package in R [85] . Student's unpaired T-test was performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed in patients over normal samples and significant genes were selected. A threshold of at least 1.5 fold change and a p value for the t-tests of less than 0.01 were chosen. In addition, a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc test was used to establish statistical significance between groups (< 0.01). Pathways and functional categories were considered as over-represented when Fisher's exact test p value was < 0.01. For presenting the signalling and http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 interaction pathways of the different significant genes, we used cytoscape for data integration and network visualization [87, 88] and reactome functional interaction (FI) cytoscape plugin for knowledge base of human biological pathways and network processes [60] . For the gene disease association, we have considered the neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, which are better suited to our networks [89] . In this case, topological refers to methods that rely only on the structure of the network to draw conclusions. We construct a GDN from gene-disease associations where the node in the network can be either a disease or a gene. This network can also be regarded as a bipartite graph. Diseases are connected when the diseases share at least one significant dysregulated genes. Let a particular set of human diseases D and a set of human genes G, genedisease associations attempt to find whether gene g ∈ G is associated with disease d ∈ D. If G i and G j , the sets of significant up and down dysregulated genes associated with diseases i and j respectively, then the number of shared dysregulated genes (n g ij ) associated with both diseases i and j is as follows: The co-occurrence refers to the number of shared genes in the GDN. The common neighbours is the based on the Jaccard Coefficient method, where the edge prediction score for the node pair is as: where E is the set of all edges. The number of shared pathways and protein subnetwork that links between diseases i and j are calculated using the equation 1 and the link prediction score is measured using the equation 2. To estimate the correlation starting from disease cooccurrence, we need to quantify the strength of disease association for comorbidities by dipicting a distance between two diseases. For the analysis of the phenotypic data, we used the Relative Risk (RR ij ) as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and checked φ-correlation (φ ij ) to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The RR ij is observing in a pair of diseases i and j affecting the same patient. When two diseases co-occur more frequently than expected by chance, we will get RR ij > 1 and φ ij > 0. However, RR ij and φ ij are not independent of each other and each carries unique biases that are complementary [1, 2] . So, we used both measures of comorbidity to ensure the robustness of our investigations. The RR ij allows us to quantify the co-occurrence of disease pairs compared with the random expectation which is calculated as: (3) where N is the total number of patients in the population, P i is the incidences/prevalences of disease i, P j is the incidence of disease j and C ij is the number of patients that have been diagnosed with both diseases i and j. For RR ij >= 1 comorbidity is larger than expected by chance and for RR ij < 1 comorbidity is smaller than expected by chance. To calculate the significance of the relative risk RR ij , we used the Katz, Baptista, Azen and Pike et al. method to estimate confidence intervals [90] . According to their estimation, the 99% confidence interval for the RR ij between two diseases i and j is calculated by: Lower bounds of the confidence interval (LB) = RR ij * exp(−2.56 * σ ij ) and Upper bounds of the confidence interval (UB) = RR ij * exp(2.56 * σ ij ), where σ ij is given by: Disease pairs within the 99% confidence interval are only considered if the LB value is larger than 1 when RR ij is larger than 1, or if the UB value is smaller than 1 when RR ij is smaller than 1. Relative risk measure is intrinsically biased towards overestimation of relationships between rare diseases and underestimates the co-morbidity of more frequent diseases [2] . This bias can be reduced by introduction of a φ-correlation measure. We can quantify the strength of comorbidities by calculating the correlation coefficient associated with a pair of diseases i and j as: where C ij is the number of patients affected by both diseases, N is the total number of patients in the studied population, and P i and P j are the morbidity or incidence of the i th and j th diseases respectively. The φ-correlation is the Pearson's correlation for the variables which only take 0 or 1 values [91] . For φ ij > 0 comorbidity is larger than expected by chance and for φ ij < 0 comorbidity is smaller than expected by chance. We can determine the significance of φ = 0 by performing a t-test. This consists of calculating t according to the formula: t = φ √ n−2 √ 1−φ 2 , where n is the number of observations used to calculate φ. To predict the comorbidities considering the primary or index disease we have calculated the conditional relative risk (conditional RR ij ) as follows: for all possible disease pairs i and j, for the cases that one index disease (I) is present (k = true) or absent (k = false). (p = 0.01). We have weighted the edges using a mutual information metric which quantifies how much greater the edge relationship is with respect to co-occurrence. The mutual information weight between two diseases i and j is defined as W ij = C ij P i + P j − C ij (6) where C ij is the observed co-occurrence and P i and P j are the morbidity or prevalence of the i th and j th diseases respectively. To compare between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a gene set enrichment analysis was undertaken using GSEA [92] . To find out the correlation (similarities) and distance (dissimilarities) among the diseases from the integrated analysis of multidimensional data (gene expression and protein protein interaction), we have applied Euclidian distance measurement and metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) using majorization [93] . MDS is a set of methods for discovering hidden structures in multidimensional data. Based on a proximity matrix derived from variables measured on objects as input entity, these distances are mapped on a lower dimensional spatial representation. Optimization problem is used to find mapping in target dimension of the data based on given pairwise proximity information while minimize the objective function. The particular objective function (or loss function) we used in this work is a sum of squares, commonly called stress. We used majorization to minimize stress and this MDS solving strategy is known as SMACOF (Scaling by MAjorizing a COmplicated Function). Stress majorization is an optimization strategy used in multidimensional scaling (MDS) where, for a set of nm-dimensional data items, a configuration X of n points in r(<< m)-dimensional space is sought that minimizes the stress function σ (X). Here r is 2 that means the (r × n) matrix X lists points in 2-dimensional Euclidean space. We have applied the cost function σ to measures the squared differences between ideal (m-dimensional) distances and actual distances in r-dimensional space as follows: X 1 of dimension n 1 × p as the individual's or judge's configuration, and X 2 of dimension n 2 × p as the object's configuration matrix. The least squares metric multidimensional scaling or MDS problem is the minimization of σ and over all m × p configurations X. Here w ij are given non-negative weights and d ij are given non-negative dissimilarities. The d ij (X) are the Euclidean distances between rows i and j of X. Thus d ij (X1, X2) = p s=1 x 1is − x 2js 2 (8) where w ij ≥ 0 is a weight for the measurement between a pair of points (i, j), d ij (X) is the Euclidean distance between i and j, and δ ij is the ideal distance between the points (their separation) in the m-dimensional data space. Note that w ij is used to specify a degree of confidence in the similarity between points (e.g. 0 can be specified if there is no information for a particular pair). A configuration X which minimizes σ (X) gives a plot in which points that are close together correspond to points that are also close together in the original m-dimensional data space.
