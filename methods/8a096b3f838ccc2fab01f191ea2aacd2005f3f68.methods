In our model we use an overlapping multiplex network formed by two layers, A and B, of the same size N, where an overlapping fraction q of shared individuals is active in both layers. Figure 1(a) shows schematically the partially overlapped network. The dashed lines that represent the fraction q of shared individuals should not to be interpreted as interacting or interdependent links but as the shared nodes and their counterpart in the other layer. For the simulation, we construct each layer using the Molloy Reed algorithm [37] , we choose randomly a fraction q of nodes in each of the layers that represent the same nodes. In our model of the SIR process we assume that the transmissibility is the same in both layers because there is only one disease and all individuals in the system spread equally. We begin by infecting a randomly chosen individual in layer A. The spreading process then follows the SIR dynamics in both layers, the overlapped nodes in both layers have the same state because they represent the same individuals. After all infected nodes infect their susceptible neighbors with probability b in both layers, the time is increased in one, and the states of the nodes are updated simultaneously. Note that because there are shared nodes the branches of infection can cross between the two layers. Thus the probability that, following a random link, a node belonging to the infected cluster will be reached in each layer can be written where G A=B 0 and G A=B 1 are the generating functions defined above for layer A and B, respectively. In Eq. (1) both f A and f B are written as the sum of two terms that takes into account all possible spreading of the branches of infection. The first term corresponds to those branches of infection that only spread within their own layer, while the second term takes into account those branches that spread through both layers. Figure 1(b) shows how a node is reached through an ingoing link marked by an arrow. The disease spreads through both available outgoing links of that node in layer A and develops two branches of infection. The green dotted line denotes the branch that stays in layer A and corresponds to the first term of Eq. (1) for f A . The second term of Eq. (1) for f A is indicated by the blue dot-dashed branch that reaches layer B through a shared node and then spreads to its neighbors on that layer. After the shared node is infected, the branch spreads through five links in layer B and reaches another shared node that allows the branch of infection to spread back to layer A. An analogous interpretation holds for the terms of f B .
