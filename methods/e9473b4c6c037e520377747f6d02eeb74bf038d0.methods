Annual VPD incidence from 1950 to 2016 was obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS). The NNDRS is a compulsory reporting system established in 1950 for 15 diseases with high epidemic potential including cholera, plague, smallpox, Japanese encephalitis (JE), meningococcal meningitis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, and measles. Data on each case is limited to critical information including name, address, date of birth, date of disease onset, age, sex, and occupation. The NNDRS has since been expanded to 39 diseases, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B, tuberculosis, neonatal tetanus, mumps and rubella but the type of data collected has remained largely unchanged. Hepatitis B burden, using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity as a marker for chronic infection, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage were estimated through national serosurveys conducted in 1992, 2006, and 2014 [4] [5] [6] . All three serosurveys relied on random sampling of persons in the Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) Surveillance System, a nationally representative sample of rural townships and urban neighborhoods representing approximately 1% of the total population. Vaccination coverage surveys were conducted in selected provinces during 1983-1987 while nationally representative surveys were conducted in 1989, 1991, 1999, 2004, and 2013 . All surveys utilized multi-stage probability of selection proportional to population size sampling based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [7] . As a proxy for coverage prior to the 1980s, we searched for references to total numbers of persons vaccinated and total numbers of doses of vaccine produced or administered. A search was conducted for published and unpublished reports on vaccine development and VPD control in China from 1949 to 2016, focusing on Chinese-language documents not widely available in the published literature, and included manual searches through archived documents at the Ministry of Health (MoH), China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and provincial health departments [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Data on immunization expenditures was collected as part of national EPI reviews conducted in 1999, 2004, and 2013. Because few reports on vaccination efforts were found prior to the 1980s, we interviewed senior Chinese experts who were closely involved in spearheading China's early immunization efforts using a structured open-ended questionnaire. Persons interviewed included scientists involved in vaccine research and development; MoH officials responsible for development of national policies and goals; and, provincial health staff responsible for planning and implementing VPD control activities.
