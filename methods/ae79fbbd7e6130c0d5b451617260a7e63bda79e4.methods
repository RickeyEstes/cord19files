A randomized, double blind placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted in two study centers, the St. Anna Children's Hospital and a private pediatric clinic in Vienna, Austria. Total Symptom Score (TSS) The TSS used was based on the evaluation of eight leading clinical features including the systemic symptoms headache, muscle ache, chilliness (systemic symptom score, SSS), and the local symptoms including sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing (local symptom score, LSS), according to a published scoring system [16] . Severity was rated on a four-point scale with zero indicating the absence of symptoms, and scores of 1 to 3 representing mild, moderate and severe symptoms, respectively.
