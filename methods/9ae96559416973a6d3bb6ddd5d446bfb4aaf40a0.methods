Chicken eggs, incubation and housing. Specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs that were obtained from the Animal Disease Research Institute, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) were incubated at recommended temperature and relative humidity at the Arkell Research Station, University of Guelph. All experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Guelph and conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee of the University of Guelph. At ED18, live embryos were administrated with ECpG or HVT or both into the amniotic sac using a 23-gauge, 2.5 cm needle as recommended. Once the chicks hatched, they were transported to the animal isolation facility at the Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph. Encapsulation of TLR ligand. CpG ODN was encapsulated in PLGA, (Resomer ® RG 503 H, free carboxylic acid, MW 24-38 kD, Sigma-Aldrich) using the modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method to generate PLGA nanoparticles as described in our previous studies 19, 28 . Briefly, polyethalenimine (linear, MW 2.5 kD, Sigma-Aldrich) was complexed with CpG at a defined ratio 49 . This complex was layered onto 4.5% PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM, Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicated for one minute at 40% amplitude using an Ultrasonic Processor (Fisher Scientific). The resulting emulsion was sonicated with 2% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/1% poloxamer (PVA, MW 30-70 kD, 87-90% hydrolyzed, Sigma Aldrich) for two minutes at 60% amplitude and the resulting suspension was hardened by mixing with 50 mL of 2%PVA/1% poloxamer solution. The PLGA nanoparticles were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 50 min at 4 °C and washed three times with ultrapure nuclease free water. The PLGA nanoparticle suspension was frozen at −80 °C for 1-2 hours, DNA and RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Genomic DNA was extracted from feather tips as described previously 50 . Feather tips were cut into small pieces and incubated with 500 µl cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8 with 0.5% (w/v) Sarkosyl) containing 100 µl of proteinase K (10 mg/ ml) overnight at 65 °C water bath. Extracted DNA was precipitated using 25 µl 5 M NaCl and 2.3 ml 95% ethanol. DNA concentration was measured and dilutions at a concentration of 50 ng/µl of DNA samples were prepared. A hundred nanograms of diluted DNA was used for MDV genome copy numbers quantification using quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was extracted from spleen and BF using Trizol (Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of DNase treated RNA using Oligo (dT) 12-18 primers and the Super-Script TM First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Life Technologies, Burlington, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized cDNA was diluted at 1:10 in nuclease free water for evaluating the expression of cytokine genes. The quantity and quality of DNA and RNA were determined using the NanoDrop ® ND-1000 spectrophotometry (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).
