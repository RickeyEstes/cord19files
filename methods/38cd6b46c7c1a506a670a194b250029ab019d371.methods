This was an observational study using a retrospective descriptive design. Data were obtained from the Taiwan NHIRD, created by the National Health Research Institute (NHRI) after encryption of personal data from the National Health Insurance Administration. After approval was granted by the NHRI and the Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUHIRB-EXEMPT (1)-20150055), NHIRD data from 2011 to 2013 were analyzed. The files used included the registry of medical personnel and inpatient expenditures by admissions. These files are connected using unique personal identification numbers. The exclusion criteria and reasons were as follows: (1) In Taiwan, nurses normally obtain their nursing practitioner/nurse license for practice after graduation from 5-year college programs (age around 19 years), and the retirement age is 65. Therefore, data from individuals aged below 19 or aged 65 and above were excluded; (2) Records where the personal identification number or gender was blank were excluded; (3) Normal delivery records were excluded. The diagnosis code for normal delivery in ICD9-CM is 650; (4) The following diagnostic codes for neonatal disease were excluded: neonatal dependent treatment code for partial cost exemption (903), code for congenital abnormalities (740-759), and diseases of the perinatal period (760-779). The data "Registry for health care personnel" used in this study is a registry-based dataset; all health care professionals with a government license are included in this dataset. Any changes regarding the practice status/unit of health care professionals should be reported via the individual or institute to the health governing authority according to law. We can therefore check the practice status using the "WORK_ STATUS Practice Status" variable in the "Registry for health care personnel" dataset. We deleted three diagnoses of disorders in the ICD-9-CM codes (Numbers 14 and 15 (diagnosis of disorders regarding neonates) and Number 18 (supplementary explanation of factors influencing health status and needs of health services) because they are not factors related to nurses' hospitalization risk. For the hospitalization risk, we divided the code for neoplasms (Number 2) into two subtypes (malignant and benign neoplasms). Finally, the main diagnoses in the ICD-9-CM were used to classify 16 types of diseases/systems/injury (Table 1 ) in order to compare the categories of disease and injury for hospitalization risk between nursing staff and the general population. SPSS 20.0 was used for statistical analysis. Frequency distributions, percentages, and means (standard deviations) were used for descriptive statistics analysis. The number of practicing nursing staff in Taiwan during the study period was also calculated. Microsoft Office Excel 2010 was used to calculate the standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), according to the method of previous related studies (Bright et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2008; Tuchsen, 1993) .
