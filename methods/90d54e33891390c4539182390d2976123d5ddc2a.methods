The methods and protocols summarized below have been adapted from previously published literature extraction processes [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , and provide additional context surrounding our systematic data collection from published reports of MERS-CoV. Data collection. We identified published reports of MERS-CoV by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus with the following terms: "Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome", "MERSCoV", and "MERS". The initial search was for all articles published about MERS-CoV prior to April 30, 2017 , and was subsequently updated to February 22, 2018. These searches were conducted through the University of Washington Libraries' institutional database subscriptions. We searched the Web of Science Web of Science Core Collection (the subscribed edition includes Science Citation Index Expanded, 1900-present; Social Sciences Citation Index, 1975-present; Arts & Humanities Citation Index, 1975-present; Emerging Sources Citation Index, 2015-present). We searched the standard Scopus database and the standard, freely available PubMed database; these products have a single version that is consistent across institutional subscriptions or access points. In total, this search returned 7,301 related abstracts, which were collated into a database before a title-abstract screening was manually conducted (Fig. 1. Flowchart) . Articles were removed if they did not contain an occurrence of MERS-CoV; for example, vaccine development research or coronavirus proteomic analyses. Non-English articles were flagged for further review and brought into the full text screening stage. The accompanying supplementary file highlight the title and abstract screening process and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text review was conducted on 1,083 sources. To meet the inclusion criteria, articles must have contained both of the following items: 1) a detection of MERS-CoV from humans, animals, or environmental sources, and 2) MERS-CoV occurrences tagged with spatial information. Additionally, extractors attempted to prospectively manually remove articles containing duplicate occurrences that were already extracted in the dataset. Extractors only prospectively manually removed articles if it was clear the articles contained data we were confident had already been extracted and had high-quality data. We excluded 885 sources based on full text review. In addition, we reviewed citations and retroactively added relevant articles to our database if they were not already included. We retroactively added and subsequently marked ten articles for extraction using this process. In total, we extracted 208 peer-reviewed sources reporting detection of MERS-CoV that included geographic and relevant epidemiological metadata. Geo-positioning of data. Google Maps or ArcGIS 23 was used to manually extract location information at the highest resolution available from individual articles. We evaluated spatial information as either points or polygons. The geography was defined as a point if the location of transmission was reported to have occurred within a 5 × 5 km area. Point data are represented by a specific latitude and longitude. A point references an area smaller than 5 × 5 km in order to be compatible with the typical 5 × 5 km resolution of satellite imagery used for global analyses. The geography was defined as a polygon if the location of transmission was less clear, but known to have occurred in a general area (e.g. a province), or the location of transmission occurred within an area greater than 5 × 5 km (e.g. a large city). We used contextual information to determine location in instances where the author's spelling of a location differed from Google Maps or ArcGIS. Maps provided by authors were digitized using ArcGIS. We used three different types of polygons: known administrative boundaries, buffers, and custom polygons. Relevant administrative units were sourced from the Global Administrative Unit Layers curated by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN 24 for known administrative boundaries of governorates, districts, or regions, and paired with the occurrence record. Buffers were created to encompass areas in cities and regions without corresponding administrative units. To ensure that buffers encompassed the entirety of the area of interest, Google Maps was used to determine the required radius. In areas with unspecified boundaries (e.g. Table Mountain National Park and the border region between Saudi Arabia and UAE) ArcGIS was used to generate custom polygons, which were assigned a unique code within a defined shapefile for ease of re-identification.
