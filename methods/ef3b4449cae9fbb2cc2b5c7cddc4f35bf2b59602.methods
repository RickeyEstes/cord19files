We conducted cross-sectional telephone interviews of the lay public in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area, Malaysia, between July 11 and September 13, 2009. A random sample of telephone numbers was generated by computer from the latest electronic version (2008/2009) of the residential telephone directory of Selangor state and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. Each household was interviewed once. Within each responding household, one adult resident 18 years of age or older was randomly selected and interviewed. A total of 6230 call attempts were made. The response rate, computed as the number of completed interviews (1050) divided by the number of households successfully contacted with three call attempts (1750), was 60.0%. The psychobehavioral responses section of the survey first queried participants about H1N1 influenza-related stigma or fear (4-items) with response options ranged on a Likert scale from 1 (Not at all fearful) to 4 (Very fearful). Subsequently, participants were questioned about their avoidance approaches (4-items), health-protective behaviors to prevent H1N1 influenza infection (6-items), and impact of H1N1 influenza pandemic (6-items). Answer choices were either yes, no or not relevant. The very fearful and fearful (regrouped into one category), and yes responses were the outcomes of interest. Fig. 1 shows the temporal trends with the margin of error at the 0.05 significance level for all questions about fear, avoidance behaviors, health-protective behavior and impact. The first death was reported 2 weeks after the commencement of this study, and increased steadily to a peak of 40 deaths in week 6, before a rapid decline. The local media intensely covered the official number of deaths related to 2009 H1N1 influenza released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia during this period. There were increases in all types of fears and avoidance behaviors from week 4 onwards, in concordance with the escalating number of reported deaths, before declining after the peak deaths reported in week 6 ( Figs. 1.1 and 1.2) . This was particularly noticeable in those expressing fear of visiting hospitals and fear of eating out. Similar trends were observed during the SARS outbreak, whereby anxiety levels closely mirrored the daily number of new cases and were strongly associated with the intensity of the outbreak (Leung et al., 2005) .
