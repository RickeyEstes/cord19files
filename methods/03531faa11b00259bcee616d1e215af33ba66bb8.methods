The study was carried out on male rats, comprising 16 groups of Fischer 344 and 10 groups of Sprague-Dawley (Charles River, Italia), housed in a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) area at Sigma-Tau S.p.A. laboratories. Standard monitoring of this area did not reveal any infectious event during the study period. The monitoring implies the im- Endoparasite tests were conducted for: Flagellae, Oxyures, and Tenia. Other tests were executed for detecting cutaneous mycoses. The entire battery of tests was executed once every 2 months. Data are referred to a total of 3802 animals, that is, 2646 Fischer rats (59-280 per group), and 1156 Sprague-Dawley rats (90-152 per group), born in the period April 1986 -January 1991. Animals were housed in transparent Makrolon cages (3 rats per cage from the age of 12 months) and received tap water and standard laboratory diet ad libitum (4RF18, Mucedola S.r.l., Italia), which contained a minimum of 16% protein, 2.5% fat, and a maximum of 7.5% fiber. The animal rooms were maintained under standard conditions of temperature (22 +-I°C) and relative humidity (55 +-10%), with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (light on 07:00 a.m.), and 12-15 filtered air changes/hour. At the onset of each data collection, the rats from each group were 12 months old when received from Charles River laboratories. Over the study period, some animals were periodically removed from their respective groups to be used in the experiments. The animal removed represented less than 50% of the total starting number of animals, for all experimental groups. For all groups, survival data were obtained by calculating at each age (months) the proportion of the surviving animals making, wherever necessary, the appropriate correction for drop-out individuals (see Armitage, 1971 ). The causes of death were not investigated in depth. Five statistical parameters for each group were evaluated: -first quartile survival time (Tvs), corresponding to the age at which the proportion of surviving animals per group is 75%; -median survival time (Tso), that is the age at which the proportion of surviving animals for a group is 50% (in the case of a symmetrical distribution, this parameter corresponds to the life expectancy); -third quartile survival time (T25), corresponding to the age at which the proportion of surviving animals for a group is 25%; -maximal life span (Tma X) (the last death observed for each group); -the interquartile range (Tz5-T75 --AS0), which can be considered an index of the survival curve slope. To obtain quantitative indices summarizing the survival curves relative to each population in a model-free way, we utilized an approach based upon principal component analysis (PCA) (Jones and Rice, 1992) . Each population was defined by means of 4 quartiles (namely T75, Tso, T25, and Tmax) and of the interquartile range of the median (A50). This corresponds to a multivariate data matrix having N = 26 rows (= groups = statistical units) and K = 5 columns (= statistical indices = variables). The correlations among the variables make it possible to describe the data matrix by means of a number P < K of components explaining most of the original variation (Lebart et al., 1984; Stahle and Wold, 1988; Jones and Rice, 1992) . The components are mutually independent of construction and their meaning is easily interpretable by the inspection of the correlation coefficients between the component scores and the original variables (factor loadings) (Lebart et al., 1984) . The inferential comparison between the component scores relative to the different strains allows the differences between the survival data to be evaluated statistically. In addition to this model-free approach, we analyzed the differences between the survival curves of the two strains by means of the classical Gompertzian model (Finch et al., 1990; Wilson, 1993) . In this latter case the survival curve of each group was defined by the two parameters of the Gompertz equation (c~ and Ro). The Gompertz survival function was derived from the Gompertz mortality function, and can be obtained directly from survival data as reported by Wilson (1993) . The Gompertz survival function is: The Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (Marquardt, 1963) for nonlinear regression analysis, available on SigmaPIot ®, was used to calculate the best fit values of R 0 and a for each group. The inferential comparisons were performed on the values of these parameters. The two approaches were compared by correlating the component scores with the values of the Gompertz parameters. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was used as statistical inference method for all comparisons between strains. The F-test was used to compare the two strains as for the degree of within strain variability for all considered parameters. Correlations were computed using the Pearson's r coefficient.
