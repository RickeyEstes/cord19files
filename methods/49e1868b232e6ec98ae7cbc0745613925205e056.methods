Chemical reagents. Meropenem was purchased from TCI Chemicals (Shanghai). Kanamycin sulfate, Luria-Bertani (LB) Broth Powder, and LB agar were purchased from Affymetrix. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Bacteria. The bacteria employed for cell-based and animal studies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All the E. coli variants were made as described below. The NDM-HK PCV was screened by 20 th -generation serial passages of NDM-HK in antibiotic-free medium. The loss of bla NDM-1 gene was confirmed by both PCR and susceptibility test. Preparation of Bi(III) compounds. CBS and RBC were kindly provided by Livzon Pharmaceutical Group. Bi(NIT) 3 (Bi(NO 3 )·5H 2 O) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The chemical structures of all the ligands used are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2 . Bi(EDTA) (EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetate) and Bi(NTA) (NTA: nitrilotriacetate) were prepared by mixing bismuth subcarbonate ((BiO) 2 CO 3 ) and appropriate amounts of ligands, followed by refluxing overnight. The solution was filtered while hot and was cooled down naturally. Crystals were collected and washed by water and ethanol the next day. Bi(NAC) 3 (NAC: Nacetyl-cysteine), Bi(GSH) 3 (GSH: glutathione) 39 , and Bi(TBC) 2 (TBC: tetrabromocatechol) 61 were prepared by mixing Bi(NO 3 )·5H 2 O with the appropriate amounts of ligands in methanol. Any impurities were removed by filtering and the resulting solution was evaporated slowly to obtain the solid product. Bi(TPP) (TPP: tetraphenylporphyrin) were synthesized using a modified method 39 . In brief, to 80 mL of reflexing pyridine containing 0.10 g (0.2 mmol) of TPP was added 1.99 g of Bi(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O (2.1 mmol), and a further 2.00 g (4.1 mmol) was then added 3 h later. After further reflexing for 5 h, a large amount of pyridine was removed via rotary evaporation and the resulting thick, green mixture was then left to dry overnight under vacuum to remove residual solvents. Green solids that were obtained were then washed with chloroform and rotary evaporated to ensure that all pyridine solvent was removed. The dark-green solids were then purified on a silica gel column. The compound was purified by washing the column with first chloroform and then chloroform:methanol in a ratio of 10:1. FAB-MS + was used to characterize the complex with m/z of 820.9 ([Bi(L1)] + ; calculated: 821.2). Bi(CPL) 2 was prepared by mixing BiCl 3 (1 mmol) and D-captopril (3 mmol, J&K Scientific) in methanol at room temperature with constant stirring overnight until a color change from colorless to yellow had occurred. The methanol was removed under vacuum, and the resulting yellow solid product was washed successively with ethanol and water before recrystallization from methanol, yielding the product. 1 Bi(PCM) 2 was prepared by mixing BiCl 3 (1 mmol) and D-penicillamine (3 mmol, J&K Scientific) in methanol with stirring, resulting in an immediate color change from colorless to pale yellow. The mixture was further stirred overnight at room temperature before any remaining solid was filtered off and the solvent from the filtrate was removed under vacuum. The resulting solid was recrystallized from methanol, yielding a yellow solid product. 1 DNA manipulations and construction of plasmids. All the plasmids used as templates for PCR were purified using the gel extraction kit (QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (250), QIAGEN). All PCR primers were synthesized from Thermo Fisher and listed in Supplementary Table 7 . PCR was performed using KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen) based on the reaction conditions described in the protocols by the manufacturers. All restriction enzymes were used directly (New England Biolab). The amplified genes of NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4 were subsequently inserted into pET-28a plasmid with an incorporated N-terminal His-Tag using T4 DNA ligase to form the vector pET-28a-NDM-1, pET-28a-VIM-2, and pET-28a-IMP-4, respectively. Expression vector for NDM-1 variant (NDM-1-C208A) was generated by PCR using the standard protocols from the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Labs) with pET-28a-NDM-1 as the template. The constructed plasmids were subsequently transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells for molecular cloning. Protein purification. A single colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the respective MBL was inoculated into LB medium supplied with 50 μg mL −1 kanamycin and grown at 37°C. Protein overexpression was induced using 0.2 mM IPTG supplemented with 0.2 mM ZnSO 4 at OD 600 0.6. The bacterial culture was incubated at 25°C overnight. To purify the respective protein, the cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g and resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF at pH 7.0). The cells were ice-cooled and lysed by sonication and then centrifuged at 35000 × g for 30 min to remove the majority of cell debris. The supernatant was filtered using Minisart syringe filter (0.45 μm) to remove any remaining large and insoluble cell debris, and was then applied to a 5 mL Ni(II)-loaded HiTrap chelating columns (GE Healthcare) at a rate of 2 mL min −1 . The column was washed using five column volumes of washing buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, and 30 mM imidazole at pH 7.0). The protein was eluted out using four column volumes of the same buffer with gradient amounts of imidazole, and was subsequently dialyzed against the cleavage buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.0). The N-terminal His-tag of the fusion protein was cleaved by adding 50 NIH units of thrombin at 25°C for 3 h with mild shaking and the cleaved His-tag was separated from the resulting proteins by passing through the Ni(II)-NTA column again using washing buffer so that >90% of the proteins were in the flow-through fraction. The enzymes were further purified using HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg gel filtration column. The samples were then concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) and separated into aliquots after dialysis with storage buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.1 M NaCl at pH 7.0 for long-term storage at −80°C. IC 50 enzyme inhibition assay. Freshly prepared 50 nM of Zn 2 -NDM-1, Zn 2 -VIM-2, or Zn 2 -IMP-4 in 50 mM HEPES/Na pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl were first incubated with various concentrations of CBS for 1 h at 25°C, then mixed with equal volume of 0.2 mM MER. The assay was performed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette using the kinetic mode on a Varian Cary50 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25°C. The decrease in absorbance at 300 nm due to ring-opening of MER was monitored every second for a duration of 10 min until the reaction was completed. The initial rates were extracted and calculated from each reaction curves for fitting IC 50 curves. UV-vis spectroscopy. UV-vis spectra were collected on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer at a rate of 360 nm min −1 using a 1-cm quartz cuvette at ambient temperature. Aliquots of 2 mM (Bi(NTA)) stock solution were stepwise titrated into apo-NDM-1 sample (50 μM) in a titration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) and UV-vis spectra were recorded in a range of 220-600 nm at least 30 min after each addition. The binding of Bi(III) to apo-NDM-1 was monitored by the increase in absorption at 340 nm due to LMCT involving the only cysteine residue (Cys208). The UV titration curve was fitted to Ryan-Weber nonlinear equation 62 (1) . where I stands for UV absorbance intensity; I max for maximal UV absorbance; C p and C m refers to the total concentrations of proteins and ligands, respectively; K d is the dissociation constant. For Bi 3+ , the dissociation constant from NDM-1 was derived by 66 Zn, and 34 S contents, which are used to quantify protein concentration. Zinc supplementation assay. To investigate whether bismuth inhibits the enzyme reversibly, enzyme activities of Bi-NDM-1 and apo-NDM-1 were compared upon the supplementation of Zn(II). Bi-bound NDM-1 (50 nM) was prepared by preincubation of apo-bound NDM-1 with CBS for 2 h at 25°C, followed by removal of unbound Bi(III) and the bound Bi was verified by ICP-MS. The above protein solutions were mixed with ZnSO 4 at concentration up to 2 molar equivalents to NDM-1 and 100 µM MER. The change in absorbance at 300 nm was monitored on a Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25°C for calculation of reaction rates. Reaction rate of apo-NDM-1 with addition of 2 molar equivalents of ZnSO 4 was normalized to 1. The metal content of Bi-bound NDM-1 treated with Zn(II) was measured and analyzed by ICP-MS as described in the previous section. Limited proteolysis of NDM-1 protein. Limited proteolysis 41 was performed to examine the in vitro stability of different forms of NDM-1. In brief, the aliquots (150 μg) of pure apo-bound, Zn-bound, and Bi-bound NDM-1 were treated with 2 μg of proteinase K (Fungal, Invitrogen, >20 U/mg) in 10 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8, at 16°C. Aliquots were taken at various time intervals. The reaction was quenched with 5 mM PMSF, and samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. A PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder #26616 (Thermo) was used as a standard marker. Michaelis-Menten kinetics. NDM-1 (50 nM) was incubated with Bi(NIT) 3 (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 µM) for 1 h at 25°C with gentle shaking. The assay was performed in a 96-well microplate reader at 298 K. The final assay buffer contains 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, with MER as the substrate ranging from 10 to 150 µM. Control experiment was also performed in the absence of inhibitors under the same conditions. The K m and V max for both the uninhibited and inhibited reactions were obtained by fitting the data into the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. Detection of NDM-1 expression level by western blot. NDM-1 protein level was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by western blot over the whole-cell lysates of different E. coli stains. Typically, each logarithmic phase culture was lysed by sonication in sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl). Bacterial lysates were harvested by centrifugation and normalized according to total protein concentrations, as quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific). All the samples were resolved on a 13% SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, GE Healthcare). A PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder #26616 (Thermo) was used as a standard marker. Diluted NDM-1 monoclonal antibody (NOVUS Biologicals) and the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)/alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate were applied after performing the standard blotting procedures. The NDM-1 bands were calorimetrically developed with specified ratio of substrates comprising nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) for 15 min. The software ImageJ 63 was used to quantify the signal of each of the bands for analysis. The software GraphPad Prism (version 6.2 for Mac, GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA, USA, www.graphpad.com) was used to analyze the resulting plots. Cellular thermal shift assay. The cellular thermal shift assay was performed according to a standard method 38 . Clinical isolate of NDM-1-positive E. coli (NDM-HK) was cultured overnight in the absence or presence of 100 µM Bi(III) compounds, i.e., CBS, Bi(NAC) 3 , Bi(NIT) 3 . The bacterial pellets were harvested and washed with PBS for 4 times. The cell suspensions were aliquoted into PCR tubes and heat treatment was performed at the designated temperature ranging from 40°C to 70°C for 3 min in a 96-well thermal cycler. The tubes were cooled immediately at room temperature for another 3 min after heating and the heating procedures were repeated for three cycles. For the cell lysis, the samples were frozen-thawed for two cycles in liquid nitrogen and thermal cycler set at 25°C. The samples were vortexed gently after each cycle and were centrifuged at 20,000 × g to obtain the supernatant when the second cycle was finished. All the samples were subjected to western blot analysis for detection and quantification of NDM-1 content as described above. Primary screening upon different metal compounds. Metal salts used for the screening involved bismuth nitrate (Bi(III)), gallium nitrate (Ga(III)), sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)), chromium chloride (Cr(III)), cobalt chloride (Co(II)), nickel chloride (Ni(II)), ruthenium chloride (Ru(II)), and copper sulfate (Cu(II)). Briefly, different concentrations (10, 50, and 200 μM) of metal compounds were added to LB medium containing 8 μg mL −1 of MER in 96-well plates. About 2 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 logarithmic cultures of NDM-HK were added to each well of the plates and coincubated for overnight. The growth inhibition of bacteria was monitored by OD reading at 600 nm and serial dilution in LB agar plate. Wells with no antibiotics or metal compounds served as growth controls, and wells with no bacteria added served as background controls. Each test was performed in triplicate. The inhibition was calculated as [1−(OD sample −OD background )/ (OD control −OD background )] ×100%. CFU was counting by 10-fold serial dilution in PBS and 10 μL was spotted in LB agar plate. Microdilution MIC and MBC assay. MIC values were determined by standard broth micro-dilution method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100-S20, 2010) 64 . Briefly, bacterial cells were cultured in LB broth overnight at 37°C at 250 rpm and the OD was measured at 600 nm (OD 600 ). The bacterial density was adjusted to about 1 × 10 6 CFU mL −1 and checked by CFU counting on agar plates afterwards. Tested antibiotics or Bi(III) compounds were added triplicately into individual wells of flat-bottomed 96-well plates and performed 2-fold serial dilution, followed by addition of prepared bacterial inocula. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for overnight. Wells with no antibiotics or Bi(III) compounds served as growth controls and wells with no bacteria added served as background controls. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of a drug that could inhibit the growth of microorganism by both visual reading and OD reading at 600 nm using a microtiter plate reader. For the test of NDM-Rosetta OX, the growth condition briefly goes as follow. Overnight culture of NDM-Rosetta was 1000-fold diluted into fresh LB medium and regrew to OD~0.6. The overexpression of NDM-1 was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37°C. The following susceptibility test was performed as described in the Microdilution MIC and MBC assay section in the methodology by using the resulting bacterial pellets with the supplementation of 200 µM IPTG. For the test of C208A-Rosetta, the growth condition briefly goes as follow. Overnight culture of C208A-Rosetta was diluted into fresh LB medium (1000-fold) and regrew to OD~0.6. The overexpression of NDM-1-C208A was induced by addition of 200 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 18 h at 25°C. The following susceptibility test was performed as described in the Microdilution MIC and MBC assay section in the methodology by using the resulting bacterial pellets with the supplementation of 200 μM IPTG. At the end of MIC assay, 50 μL of aliquots of each well (containing a specified antimicrobial concentration) for each isolate tested were applied to a LB agar plate and incubated at 37°C overnight. Resulting growth (or lack of growth) was examined after overnight culturing and the lowest concentration that inhibits 99.9% of the original culture was taken as MBC. For drug combination test, antibiotics and Bi(III) compounds were co-added at concentrations up to eight times higher than the MIC of the drugs tested alone. Other procedures were kept strictly the same. The FICI was determined according to the following equation: FICI = FIC A + FIC B = C A /MIC A + C B /MIC B , where MIC A and MIC B are the MIC values of compounds A and B, respectively, when functioning alone, and C A and C B are the concentrations of compounds A and B at the effective combinations. Synergism was defined when FICI ≤ 0.5, indifference was defined when FICI > 0.5 and < 4, and antagonism was defined when FICI≥4 65 . A volume of 256µg mL −1 was set as the MIC of Bi(III) (except for Bi(NAC) 3 ) for the determination of FIC values. All of the determinations were performed at least in triplicate on different days. Time kill assay. Time kill assay was used to further explore the synergy between MER and Bi(III) compounds. In a typical assay, NDM-HK was cultured overnight and diluted 1:250 into LB broth at 37°C for 3 h to reach log phase. The initial bacterial density was adjusted to~10 7 CFU mL −1 and then exposed to MER, Bi(III) compounds either alone or in combination. LB broth with no drugs served as a control. Aliquots of bacterial suspension were withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h) for inspection of bacterial viability by agar plating. The concentrations of the drugs used in the test are 24 µg mL −1 for MER, 64 µg mL −1 for CBS, and 32 µg mL −1 for Bi(NAC) 3 . Data from three independent experiments were averaged and plotted as log 10 CFU mL −1 vs. time (h) for each time point over 24 h. All assays were triplicated and performed three times on different days.
