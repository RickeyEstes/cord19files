We obtained data for this study during 2 consecutive community-based randomized controlled trials of year-round seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant women in a rural population in Sarlahi, Nepal. We conducted an active, home-based surveillance with a door-to-door census to identify married women of reproductive age during April 2011-September 2013 (15) . Follow-up occurred every 5 weeks at households where women of reproductive age resided to determine whether a woman had become pregnant. All married women 15-40 years of age identified as pregnant with gestational age of 17-34 weeks during the study period were offered enrollment and randomized into 1 of 2 study arms: vaccination or placebo. From the time of vaccination with study vaccine or placebo through 180 days postpartum, a field interviewer visited the household weekly to conduct a morbidity interview for each day in the preceding week. If a participant had an influenza-like illness (ILI) episode (defined as reported fever plus >1 of the following symptoms: cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, or sore throat), a midnasal swab specimen was collected and tested for respiratory viral infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (16) (17) (18) (19) . Viral infection was defined as the molecular detection of the virus concurrent with symptoms of a respiratory illness. Any symptoms separated from the illness episode by at least 7 symptom-free days were considered part of a separate illness episode. This analysis does not include influenza, however, because it is analyzed separately as part of the clinical trial of maternal immunization (20) . We estimated gestational age at time of respiratory virus infection in pregnancy by subtracting the date of last menstrual period from the date of delivery, based on maternal recall. The "mother's smoking" variable captured whether cigarettes or bidi (a hand-rolled cigarette common in South Asia) were smoked in the previous 30 days. Ethnic group was dichotomized as Pahadi (origins in the hills of Nepal) versus Madheshi (origin in the plains of Nepal). We placed women in the categories of Brahmin (highest caste), Chhetri (higher caste), Vaiysha (working caste), Shudra (lower caste), and Muslim. We defined household size as number of persons sharing a cookstove; we defined household density as the number of persons per room, excluding kitchen and storerooms. We calculated the incidence of infection by using days of follow-up from enrollment through 180 days postpartum. Among women with HMPV and other respiratory viruses, the duration of illness and the week following the illness period were excluded from time at risk. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women with and without HMPV and other respiratory viral infections. Bivariate Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess potential risk factors including household density, number of children <5 years of age in the household, caste, ethnic group, maternal education, and smoking. To assess differential clinical symptoms related to infection comparing pregnant and postpartum women, we assigned a 1-point score to each of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea/nasal congestion, and myalgia (21) (22) (23) . We used a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare severity scores and total days with symptoms among pregnant and postpartum women. We also compared the proportion of women experiencing each individual symptom for pregnant and postpartum women. Birth outcomes assessed were birthweight and gestational age at birth. We defined low birthweight (LBW) as <2,500 g. We defined small for gestational age (SGA) with INTERGROWTH-21 standards (24) . We defined preterm birth (PTB) as birth before 37 weeks completed gestation. We assessed associations between HMPV during pregnancy and birthweight and gestational age with linear regression, whereas we used Poisson regression to assess binary outcomes (LBW, SGA, PTB). As a reference, we also compared birth outcomes between women with and without any febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy. Finally, we calculated the proportion of ILI episodes with respiratory viruses other than HMPV; the symptoms associated with these episodes are reported. We performed analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Stata version 13.1 (Stata-Corp LLP, College Station, TX, USA). Institutional review board approval for the randomized controlled trial was given by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University, and the Nepal Health Research Council, with deferral from Seattle Children's Hospital. Approval for this analysis was received from the University of Washington institutional review board. The primary trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01034254.
