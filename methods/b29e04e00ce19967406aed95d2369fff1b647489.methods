We included in the study 50 patients fitting a modified WHO definition of SARS admitted to three acute regional hospitals in Hong Kong between Feb 26 and March 26, 2003. 2 Briefly, the case definition was fever of 38ºC or more, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, and a history of exposure to a patient with SARS or absence of response to empirical antimicrobial coverage for typical and atypical pneumonia (␤ lactams and macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines). We collected nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum samples from all patients. Paired acute and convalescent sera and faeces were available from some patients. A lungbiopsy tissue sample from one patient was processed for viral culture and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and for routine histopathological examination and electron microscopy. We used as controls nasopharyngeal aspirates, and faeces and sera submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identities were masked. The SARS patients' medical records were reviewed retrospectively by the attending physicians and clinical microbiologists. Routine haematological, biochemical, and microbiological work-up was done, including bacterial culture of blood and sputum, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates for virology. The nasopharyngeal aspirate was assessed by rapid immunoflourescent antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, 3
