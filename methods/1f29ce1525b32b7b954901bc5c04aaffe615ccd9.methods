Mosquito collection. Arbovirus surveillance was conducted in the Longgang District of Shenzhen, China, during the period from August 2009 to September 2011. UV light traps (12V; 300 mA; Wuhan Lucky Star Environmental Protection Tech Co., Hubei, China) were used to capture mosquitoes ten days per month. Adult mosquitoes were collected from 38 monitoring sites that represented six habitat types, including residential dwellings, hospitals, schools, construction sites, parks and stadiums. The traps were set up at 07:00 pm, and the mosquitoes were collected at 09:00 am the following morning. The mosquitoes were separated according to species, site and collection date and were then divided into pools of approximately 100 mosquitoes each. The mosquito pools were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to virus isolation.
