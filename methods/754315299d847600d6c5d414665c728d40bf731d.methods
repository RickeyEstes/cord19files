In the classic SIR model, S represents the susceptible population, I represents the infected population, and R represents the recovered population. Susceptible population can be infected, who would be cured or died of the infection. The composition of susceptible, infected, recovered, deceased population is modelled based on a set of transition probabilities. In this study, we applied a modified SIR model to evaluate the burden of healthcare system during the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan, China. Figure 1 shows the design of our model.

Daily reported incidence of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, death, and recovery in China is available from 11 th January, 2020. [10] However, given that the probability of misdiagnosis is likely to be high in the early stage of the outbreak, we used the reported incidence between 0:00-24:00 on 28 th Jan, 2020 (the most updated data when the analysis was performed). The parameters included in the model were transition probabilities from one state to another within one cycle in the SIR model, i.e., one day. Briefly, we estimated the probability of being infected (Actual_infection_rate), and the probability of being admitted to ICU if being a confirmed case (ICU_rate) according to the reported incidence and the total population in .

Considering that cases without being diagnosed would mostly have mild symptoms, we assumed that the average number of days needed to recover to be 12.5 days for these cases. Thus, the probabilities of recovering if not being hospitalised within any given day (self_recover) was estimated by 1 divided by the average number of days needed to recover. We also assumed that, if being admitted to the hospital, the average number of days in isolation ward and ICU to be 20 and 25 days, respectively. Thus, the probabilities of recovering in any given day in the hospital were estimated by 1 divided by the average number of days in isolation ward (Iso_recover) or ICU (ICU_recover). We also assumed that a total of 5% of the confirmed cases admitted to isolation ward would experience deterioration of the symptoms and be transferred to ICU. Therefore, in any one day, the probability of being transferred to ICU from isolation ward (ICU_after_Isolation) was estimated by 5% divided by the average number of days in isolation ward. We considered an overall death rate of 14% among the hospitalised cases according to the recent investigation by researchers from the University of Hong Kong. [11] Therefore, the probability of being dead within any given day in the ICU (death_rate) was estimated by 14% divided by the average number of days in ICU. Lastly, the report by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggests there were a total of 4,000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 1,000 -9,700) by 18th January 2020. [12] Comparing to the number of cases released by the NHC of the People's Republic of China, this report suggests a diagnosis rate of less than 10%. Therefore, we considered multiple scenarios with different probabilities of being diagnosed (10%, 50%, 90%, and 100%) if being infected (Dx_rate). .
