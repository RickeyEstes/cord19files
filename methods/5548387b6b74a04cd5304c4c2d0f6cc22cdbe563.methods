The study was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Institutional Review Board through an expedited review process. The study was conducted in a simulated patient care environment, with a study team member acting as the patient. The simulated patient followed a specific narrative for the scenario and engaged in conversation with the HCW during the patient care encounter. The simulation room had features of a typical patient care room, including a hospital bed, wall unit with pressurized air, storage cabinets, television, bedside table, and tray table. Immediately outside the room were an isolation cart and handwashing facilities. The room had two discretely mounted cameras in the ceiling that could be positioned and focused in real time from a neighboring viewing room. The cameras fed into an audiovisual retrieval system to which the digital videos could be downloaded from secured system servers for data analysis. In addition, another high-definition digital camera was strategically placed outside the room to better capture the HCW's PPE donning and room exiting behaviors. This allowed for consistent capturing of the underlying sources of contamination for each HCW during the 3 stages of the simulation: PPE donning, patient care, and PPE doffing. All study participants were made aware of the videorecording during the consent process. The participants (n 5 10) included registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and nursing assistants from various units in the hospital. Each participant was assigned patient care tasks based on his or her specific professional role. Registered nurses were asked to assess the patient and administer an intravenous (IV) medication for pain. The simulated patient's IV site was connected to IV tubing, and an empty reservoir was hidden under the gown to collect the running IV fluid and simulated IV pain medication. Respiratory therapists assessed the patient and administered a nebulizer treatment consisting of normal saline instead of a medication. Nursing assistants repositioned the patient from bed to chair, took vital signs, and conducted input and output documentation. The simulated patient had a Foley bag attached to the leg under the gown, filled with a solution of tap water with a small amount of povidone-iodine added to simulate urine. The participants were randomized to a group that had access to a CDC poster on the sequence PPE donning and doffing 8 or to a group without access to any additional guidance. The poster was printed on 8.5-3 11-inch paper and posted on the wall in the donning and doffing areas. Although this randomization was not necessary for a feasibility study with such a small sample, it allowed for observation of the participants' responses to the additional guidance and may guide interventions considered for future studies. The isolation cart was stocked with gowns, gloves, procedure masks, N95 respirators, and multiple styles of protective eyewear. Each participant was verbally given a patient scenario, and a patient chart and typical isolation signage were posted at the room's door. No other guidance on appropriate PPE was given. A powdered fluorescent marker was spread in areas of the room where patient contamination commonly occurs, including the bedrails, bedside table, and the simulated patient's gown front and arms. Contaminated areas were assessed between study participants using an ultraviolet light to ensure that the same areas of contamination were dusted with fluorescent marker for each participant. Other areas in the room potentially contaminated with fluorescent marker during the simulated patient care were assessed using the ultraviolet light after each encounter and cleaned. The fluorescent marker is easily removed using a damp towel. The study participants consented to the study fully aware that the fluorescent marker was present in the simulated patient care room, due to the minor risk for sensitivity to the powder. Fluorescent marker exposure on each participant's body was assessed after PPE removal and handwashing using a standard case report form and digital photography of the contaminated areas. The encounters were digitally recorded during the PPE donning and doffing and during the interaction with the simulated patient. Digital video footage was reviewed by the research team and evaluated for compliance using an observation tool. The same 3 members of the research team performed the video scoring for all 10 participants, to reduce variability. The reviewers had no administrative responsibilities over the study participants and had the necessary expertise to competently evaluate all of the video captures. For evaluation, each reviewer watched the video capture and independently recorded his or her evaluation with the observation tool. Then all 3 reviewers viewed the video capture as a group until a consensus was reached on each participant's final score. The observation tool was based on a combination of local hospital and national guidelines. 9 Contamination and exposure pathways were observed during 3 periods: PPE donning activities, in-room activities, and PPE doffing activities. The observation tool elicited information on the PPE donning and doffing sequences, and also included structured and openended questions for complete data collection.
