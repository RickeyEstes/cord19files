A systematic scoping review was selected as the best method for evaluating the literature in this project. Systematic scoping reviews are appropriate when the aim is to map the literature or evidence rather than seeking to answer a specific question by looking for only the best available information [18] , particularly when the topic is new or varied, or lacks a prior systematic review. Scoping reviews can incorporate a range of literature including published and grey literature [19, 20] , whereas other forms of systematic reviews analyze empirical evidence from a more narrow body of literature focused on a specific research question with a particular research design [21] .
