Cells and Plasmids. Vero cells and BHK-21 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen/Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (summus, Beijing, China). The F gene of aMPV strains LAH A strain (aMPV/A), VCO3/60616 strain (aMPV/B), and Colorado strain (aMPV/C) was amplified by RT-PCR and then subcloned into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector by using the Kpn Ι and Xho Ι restriction sites, resulting in plasmids aMPV/A-F, aMPV/B-F, and aMPV/C-F. Flag tag fusing with F gene was introduced into each of these plasmids above for identification. All aMPV F gene mutants were created with In-Fusion ® HD Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) using aMPV/A-F, aMPV/B-F, and aMPV/C-F as template. All aMPV wild-type and mutant F genes used in this study were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Syncytium formation assay. Monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μ g of each plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were incubated with or without 0.2 μ g/mL TPCK (L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone)-trypsin (Sigma) for up to 24 h. After transfection, the cells were exposed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 5.0 (low pH) or pH 7.4 (neutral pH) for 4 min as previously described 20, 39 . This pH pulse was repeated three times at 2-h intervals. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were observed and photographed. The areas involved in syncytium formation were selected from representative photographs of the experimental samples. These areas were subsequently compared with the total analyzed area using the Magnetic Lasso Tool and histogram function of Adobe Photoshop software, and the percentage of cells forming syncytia was calculated to evaluate the fusogenic activity as previously described 44,45 . Reporter gene assay. The reporter gene assay was performed to evaluate the fusogenic activity of aMPV F proteins according to previous reports 8, 39 . Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect Vero cells in 6-cm dishes with 2 μ g of wild-type or mutant aMPV-F and 1 μ g T7 control plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) containing luciferase cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter. The transfected Vero cells were incubated with or without 0.2 μ g/mL of trypsin for up to 24 h. The transfected Vero cells and BHK-21 cells infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 were treated with PBS (pH 5.0 or pH 7.4) after transfection. The next day, the Vero cells were lifted, resuspended and overlaid onto infected BHK-21 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was measured on an EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Biotinylation and Western blotting. Expression of aMPV F proteins on the cell surface was measured by biotinylation and western blotting, as described previously 38, 46 . The transfected Vero cells were biotinylated with membrane-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The cells were lysed in Cell Lysis Buffer for Western and IP (Beyotime, Beijing, China) and centrifuged to collect the supernatants, which were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin beads (Thermo Scientific). The expressed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Super; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 1% Tween-20. Monoclonal anti-flag antibody (Sigma) diluted (1:2,000 dilution) in PBS containing 1% Tween-20 was used to react with target protein. The second antibody, IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (LiCor BioSciences, Bad Homburg, Germany) (1:5,000 dilution), was added, followed by incubation in a dark place at room temperature for 1 h. The nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to LI-COR ODYSSEY (LiCor BioSciences) for visualization of aMPV F proteins. The cleavage extent and expression level of F proteins were evaluated by software Gelpro32. Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 software. The data represent the means (± standard error) of at least three experiments. A P value (one-way analysis of variance, two-tail paired t-test) of < 0.05 was considered significant.
