Common features pharmacophore for EBOV actives Two papers from 2013 described compounds active as inhibitors of different EBOV strains in vitro and in vivo, namely amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study 8 , clomiphene and toremifene in another 9 . These active molecules were used as they have both in vitro and in vivo activity to build a common features pharmacophore with Discovery Studio 4.1 (Biovia, San Diego, CA) from 3D conformations of the molecules generated with the CAESAR algorithm. This identified key features. The pharmacophore was then used to search various databases (for which up to 100 molecule conformations with the FAST conformer generation method with the maximum energy threshold of 20 kcal/mol, were created). The pharmacophore was then used to search the Microsource Spectrum database (http://www.msdiscovery.com/spectrum.html) as well as the CDD FDA drugs dataset (https://www.collaborativedrug.com/ pages/public_access). In both cases over 300 hits were retrieved initially. The van der Waals surface of amodiaquine (which was more potent than chloroquine 8 ) was added to limit the number of hits retrieved 17-19 .
