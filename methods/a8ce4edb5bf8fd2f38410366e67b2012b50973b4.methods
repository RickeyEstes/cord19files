Surveys were sent anonymously to a total of 183 family medicine tutors affiliated with the Department of Community and Family Medicine, at the end of May 2003, following the removal of the World Health Organization's recommendation to postpone all essential travel to Hong Kong. These family physicians were mostly private doctors working in different parts of Hong Kong who voluntarily taught fourth-year medical students. All local family physicians were welcome to register for this supernumerary position after they had fulfilled the criteria set forth by the department. A reminder with a copy of the questionnaire was posted again in the middle of June. A similar survey, including modifications to accommodate the differences in local health care organization, was sent to 150 family medicine tutors working in an undergraduate teaching practice affiliated with University of Toronto in June 2003, followed by a reminder two weeks later. As SARS was a newly emerging disease, no standardized instruments were available to the investigators. We decided to look into five different areas thought to be important in the management of SARS, namely: 1) training in infectious diseases and information access to SARS, 2) application of the screening tools from various agencies, 3) clinical practices and perceived changes in the behavior of the patients, 4) anxiety level experienced by doctors and their satisfaction in the government's performance when confronted with SARS, and 5) physician personal data such as age, sex, postgraduate qualifications and types of practice. When formulating the questionnaire, we considered what information was already available from the guidelines provided by Hong Kong Department of Health or Canadian Ministry of Health, World Health Organization, or Centre of Communicable Diseases and Prevention Web sites and respective professional bodies. We hypothesized that some of the behavioral changes were suggested based on the Health Belief model 12 and Theory of Planned Behaviour. 13 Therefore, we looked specifically at the perceived threat to physicians (or their readiness to deal with SARS) and their subsequent preferred actions (eg, requests for more blood tests or radiographs) and barriers to action (eg, training or loss of income). Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, Ajzen 14 incorporated this type of conceptual framework with the idea that people's behavior is a consequence of their perceived control in terms of their knowledge base (what, how, and where information is obtained), their attitudes (confidence in diagnosing SARS and the types of training perceived as most appropriate), and their satisfaction (measured for future reference). The questionnaire was content tested and adjustments were made accordingly. In the questionnaire, doctors were asked to rate the usefulness of various information sources and screening tools, whereby ''1'' was viewed as being most valuable and ''7'' was of no value at all. We used a visual analogue scale to assess the anxiety levels of family physicians dealing with SARS with responses ranging from extremely frightened (high score) to not frightened at all (zero score). We studied the impact of SARS on their clinical practices and precautions they undertook to protect their staff, patients, and families with ''yes'' or ''no'' options, followed by several provided options to explain the response. The data was entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS (version 13). The chi-square test was used to test the significance of associations between the correspondences and odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to measure the strength of the associations. Independent samples t tests were used to compare anxiety levels in dealing with SARS between the two countries. Multiple logistic regression was applied to obtain adjusted OR (AOR) for anxiety about dealing with SARS (defined as a score of . 5 out of 10 on the visual analogue scale) for the question above and the physician's satisfaction with their government's handling of the epidemic. The Chinese University and University of Toronto Clinical Research Ethics Committees approved this study.
