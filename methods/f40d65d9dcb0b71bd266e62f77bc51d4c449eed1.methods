We begin with a description of hepatitis A epidemiology, which will motivate our choice of mathematical model. In Canada and the US, unlike most developing countries, hepatitis A is transmitted mostly by person-to-person contact, by the fecal-oral route [10] . Unlike in many countries, foodborne outbreaks are very infrequent in Canada [18] . Children play an important role in transmission due to their higher rates of subclinical infection and poor hygiene [19] . Clinical illness typically lasts four weeks, there is no chronic state of infection [20] , and natural immunity is lifelong. Although 70% of infected post-adolescents develop jaundice, many do not seek medical attention [10, 21] . Individuals with symptomatic HA infection experience nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain and jaundice [21] . Hepatitis A infection is more severe in older individuals or those with co-morbidities such as chronic liver disease [22, 23] . The most serious possible complication of hepatitis A infection is fulminant hepatic failure. The rate of mortality attributable to HA varies from 0.2% in symptomatic young adults to 1.7% in symptomatic individuals 60 years and older [24] . Given the predominance of person-to-person contact, lifelong immunity, and the importance of children in transmission, a suitable mathematical model is an agestructured compartmental model. This widely-used class of models has been shown to be particularly useful in assessing the effects of universal vaccination programmes against diseases with acquired immunity transmitted horizontally through person-to-person contact, and has been shown to provide good agreement with pre-and post-vaccination age stratified case reports and seroprevalence surveys for infectious diseases such as measles [25, 26] . Our age-structured SEIRV compartmental model stratifies individuals according to epidemiologic status (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Vaccinated) and age class (ages 0-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40- Maternal immunity is short-lived and affects relatively few individuals in a non-endemic country such as Canada, so we do not include it [10] . Since HA in Canada and the US is spread primarily person-to-person, we do not model foodborne or waterborne outbreaks [10] . The model equations appear in Appendix A and the parameterization is described in Appendix B. A diagram of the model appears in Figure 2 . The United States and Canada are both large countries and one may consider that a model by states would be more appropriate. However, despite their close proximity, there is more travel within Canada than between Canada and the US: from 1998 to 2004, there were 4.6 times as many person-trips made within Canada (across provinces) as between Canada and the US [17]. Table 1 gives the parameter values used for the US model and their data sources [8, 13, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Demographic and epidemiologic parameter values are from the pre-vaccine era, 1980-1994. Demographic parameters such as birth rates and age-specific death rates were taken from demographic data. Clinical and epidemiologic literature on hepatitis A were used to determine the durations of latent and infectious periods, vaccine efficacy, and duration of vaccine-derived immunity. The rate at which a susceptible person is infected due to travel in endemic countries ( ), and the rate at which a susceptible person is infected by infectious persons due to domestic US transmission ( ) were computed simultaneously using: (1) published data on the true incidence of hepatitis A in the US, adjusted for under-reporting and the probability of jaundice [8] , (2) data on the age-specific proportion of cases attributable to travel in endemic countries [13] , and (3) an assumed form for a "Who Acquires Infection From Whom" matrix consisting of the parameters [31] . This method of computation, which uses the model equations and does not require explicit knowledge of the force of infection or seroprevalence data (although those were necessary to estimate the true incidence in this particular case), is described in Appendix B. Hepatitis A is not endemic in the US, and the US incidence of HA is only modestly higher than that of Canada. However, there is such a greater volume of travel to the US than to HA-endemic countries that it makes sense to make allowance for infection due to travel to the US in the where Y US (resp. Y end , Y C ) is the incidence in the US (resp. endemic countries, Canada) where (resp. ) is the annual volume of travel by individuals in age class i to the US (resp. endemic countries), and where (resp. ) is the average duration of stay by travelers in the US (resp. endemic countries). These parameters can be obtained from published data [3] or from travel data available on government agency websites [32] . The difference between Canadian incidence and US/endemic incidence is used since that is proportional to the marginal increase in infection risk to Canadian residents traveling in other countries. For instance, if Canadian incidence were 5 per 100,000 per year, and US incidence changed from 10 per 100,000 per year to 15 per 100,00 per year (due to more foodborne outbreaks in that country, for example), then the additional risk of infection per year that Canadian residents assume upon themselves due to travel to the US would double. We note that Equation 1 does not take all possible factors into account. For instance, individual behaviour may vary, since Canadian residents are perhaps more risk-averse when traveling in an endemic country than when traveling in the US. The Canadian parameters and are estimated using the same method as for the corresponding US parameters and , except that the force of infection due to travel to the US is first subtracted from the total force of infection, and Canadian seroprevalence, case reporting, Table 2 . The age-structured model for Canada has identical structure to the US model except for the additional term representing infection attributable to travel in the US (see Appendix A). We wish to make the force of infection attributable to travel to the US a function of the number of infectious individuals at any given time in the US, in order to study the effects of differing vaccine coverage in the US and differing travel volume to the US. Hence, The function therefore couples the two countries and reflects our assumption that when the number of infected individuals in the US increases (resp. decreases), the number of Canadian individuals becoming infected due to travel in the US also increases (resp. decreases). The demographic and epidemiological parameter values for Canada are listed in Table 2 . Parameter values relating to disease progression in infected individuals are the same as those for the US and so are not listed. Some parameters (such as the birth rate) are very similar in the two countries. The number of residents of the US who become infected while traveling in Canada is likely very small due to the relative population sizes of the two countries, and 1980 94 1 7 (2) Rate at which an individual in age class i dies 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0167, 0.0750 per year [30] Rate at which a susceptible individual in age class i becomes exposed due to travel in endemic countries  US so a similar term was not introduced in the US equations. However, we note that this assumption could become invalid under certain situations. For instance, if US vaccination coverage is high and Canadian vaccination coverage is low, then travel to Canada could, in principle, be a risk factor for US residents (particularly those living close to the border). However, Figure 1 suggests that this is unlikely in practice, as Canadian incidence has remained below US incidence before and after the vaccine was licensed in both countries in the mid 1990s.
