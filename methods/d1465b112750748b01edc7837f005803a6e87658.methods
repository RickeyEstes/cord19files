Bacterial strains, plasmids, primers, and growth conditions Details of the bacterial strains and plasmids used are given in Additional file 1: Table S1 . Primers used for qPCR analysis and DNA sequencing were synthesized by Bioneer (Korea) (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). All established mutant strains or chromosomal lacZ fusions were derived from E. coli BW25113. Analysis of rpoS promoter activity was based on a plasmid, pKSK001, containing promoter region −92 to +10 of the rpoS gene from the E. coli K12 genome (GenBank U00096.2) subcloned into the lacZ transcriptional fusion vector, pSP417 [26] , after linearization by EcoRI/BamHI. The lacZ fusion in pKSK001 was recombined onto the chromosome (KSK003) using the transducing λ phage system, λRS45 [27] , via a double recombination event and was verified as previously described [18] . Strain ΔymdB was constructed by eliminating the kanamycin cassette (ymdB::km R ) from Keio-ΔymdB as described previously [28] . Verification of Keio-ΔymdB [28] , ΔymdB (KSK002), Keio-ΔrpoS [28] , or rnc14•Keio-ΔrpoS (KSK005) was carried out by colony PCR using primer pairs ymdB-F/-R or rpoS-F/-R and Emerald PCR premix (Takara) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ), and the PCR products were read by DNA sequencing analysis using the same primers (data not shown). Verification of RNase III mutation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against RNase III (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB plates at 37°C throughout this study. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 50 μg/mL; tetracycline, 10 μg/mL; and chloramphenicol, 30 μg/mL.
