An electronic survey invitation was sent to a convenience sample of health care epidemiologists (primarily infectious disease specialists) in the United States and Canada. The convenience sample of hospital epidemiologists and infectious disease physicians was obtained from a circulating listserve that includes a preponderance of academic institutions, including a majority of those institutions designated as Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs). This sample was expanded to known colleagues who were not included on the listserve. QuestionPro (Seattle, WA) was used to generate and distribute the survey and store response data. The survey was developed specifically for purposes of this study and included 24 questions, which are delineated in Table 1 . Data were deidentified before analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. The University of Virginia Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research reviewed the methods and questionnaire and deemed this study exempt from institutional review board approval.
