A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to identify human studies using the following MeSH and keywords research algorithm: '((central nervous system infection OR cerebrospinal fluid OR central nervous system) AND sequencing) AND virus'. Additional publications were identified from a review of full-text sources. The title and abstract of each citation were screened by two reviewers and assessed for eligibility by detailed analysis. Inclusion criteria were studies including patients with encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningitis of unknown origin and reporting the use of HTS for the aetiologic identification of a viral origin in CNS samples. Exclusion criteria were reviews, animal studies, other CNS diseases, and studies addressing only technical aspects.
