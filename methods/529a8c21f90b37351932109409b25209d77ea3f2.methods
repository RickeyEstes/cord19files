For each generation of transmission, we assumed a negative binomial offspring distribution with parameter set Â i = (R i , k i ), where i is the generation of transmission (i = 0 from the initial traveler). This assumption results in the following equations. Each row represents a unique individual infected traveler to the indicated country. a Cluster size includes the initial infected traveler and any subsequent infected persons epidemiologically linked to that traveler; a cluster of size 1 indicates no known transmission from the traveler in the destination country. b Transmission generations are the maximum number of transmission links from an infected person in the cluster back to the initial traveler. First, the probability that x independent cases in generation i produce a total of y cases in generation i + 1 is Next, given n independent introductions (generation 0), the joint probability of a cluster of total size j consisting of exactly g generations of transmission, under parameter set Â = (Â 0 , Â 1 , Â 2 , Â 3 ), is We used the above equations to evaluate ten different models. In Model 0, we assumed constant parameter values across all generations of transmission, i.e.,Â 0 = Â 1 = Â 2 = Â 3 = (R, k). In Models 1a, 1b, and 1c, we assumed the initial patient transmitted with reproductive number R 0 and dispersion parameter k 0 , and all subsequent patients transmitted with a post-control reproductive number R c and dispersion parameter k c i.e., Â 0 = (R 0 , k 0 ) ; Â 1 = Â 2 = Â 3 = (Rc, k c) . Because we found that allowing k c to range freely in the optimization scheme resulted in wide uncertainty (due to few multi-generation clusters in the data), we chose to test three differ-ent assumptions for this parameter. In Model 1a, we assumed that k c = k 0 ; in Model 1b, we assumed k c = 1, a special case in which the negative binomial distribution reduces to the geometric distribution; and in Model 1c, we assumed infinite k c , another special case in which the negative binomial distribution reduces to the Poisson distribution. In Models 2a, 2b, and 2c, we assumed that the reproductive number and dispersion parameter switched from R 0 to R c and k 0 to k c after two generations of transmission, i.e., Â 0 = Â 1 = (R 0 , k 0 ) ; Â 2 = Â 3 = (Rc, k c) , and made the same three assumptions regarding k c as described above. In summary, For each of these three parameterizations Â, we quantified the likelihood of observing the 31 clusters of size j m extinguished after g m generations using the formula L = 31 m=1 q Â (1, j m , g m) . We compared the maximum likelihood fits under the three models using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which evaluates model parsimony in determining statistical support for the hypothesized difference in transmission across outbreak generations (Blumberg et al., 2014) . We also developed a model extension to test the robustness of our results against the possibility that there were additional MERS exportations outside the Arabian Peninsula causing clusters that were not detected. If undetected clusters exist, the data set in Table 1 might be biased toward larger cluster sizes, as smaller clusters presumably would be more likely to go undetected. To quantify the implications of undetected clusters, we made the following assumptions for this part of the analysis. Let N be the number of undetected clusters, and u be the probability that an individual infected patient outside the Arabian Peninsula goes undetected. We assumed that if any one patient in a cluster was detected with MERS, then the entire cluster was detected, due to the intensive contact tracing that would be initiated after the first detection. Under those assumptions, the probability that a cluster of size j would go undetected is u j . We also assumed that transmission among patients in an undetected cluster was governed by the R 0 , k 0 parameters only, under every model, because the presumed mechanism for shifting to R c , k c (implementation of transmission control measures) would only be relevant if detection occurred. The new likelihood L N for a given test value of N undetected clusters is comprised of the product of the joint probabilities that each of the 31 clusters was of the given size and number of generations and was detected, times the probability that N clusters were unob-served; this latter factor includes the probabilities for undetected outbreaks of any size. We estimated the infinite sum using a partial sum that had converged to six decimal places. The likelihood was maximized for N = 31 and N = 93, representing scenarios where 50% and 75% of importation clusters were undetected, respectively, over the parameters u, R 0 , k 0 , and R c if applicable, for Models 0, 1b, and 2b.
