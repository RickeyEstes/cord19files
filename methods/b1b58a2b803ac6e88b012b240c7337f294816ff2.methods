The author utilized public MERS-CoV records that are available through the World Health Organization (WHO) webpage (http:// www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus infections/en/ ). In 2018, and as of 31 May 2018, the WHO received notification of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from various countries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Malaysia. Since first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 and until 31 May 2018, 2220 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported globally (with a fatality rate of 35.6%), in which 1844 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (WHO, 2018). The study author extracted and included all MERS-CoV cases reported between January 2, 2017 and the latest report on May 16, 2018. The study covers this period because the WHO uses standardized case presentations to report the date of MERS-CoV symptom onset, date of first hospitalization, and date of MERS-CoV laboratory confirmation. This is organized by the reporting country in which each case was identified. A total of 266 MERS-CoV laboratory-confirmed cases were identified during this period. Patient, clinical, and source of the MERS-CoV infection data were retrieved including age, gender, reporting country in which case was identified (Saudi Arabia or non-Saudi Arabia), comorbidities (yes/no), health-care workers (yes/no), exposure to camels (yes/no), camel milk consumption (yes/no), exposure to another MERS-CoV case, and whether the patient had died (yes/no).
