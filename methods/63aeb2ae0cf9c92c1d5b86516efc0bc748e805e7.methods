Migration. Following hibernation in Avenc Davì (AD), M. schreibersii population splits between northern and southern migration routes (Fig. 1b) . On the northern route, M. schreibersii reach Castanya (C) for mating, and then they progressively start migrating to Can Palomeres (CP) for mating and birthing. An important fraction of the population (estimated 60%) continues the migration further north to other refuges composed of breeding or summer colonies ("Summer refuges", SR, in Fig. 1a) , where they stay approximately all summer. During the same period, the remaining bats stay in Can Palomeres where they share the refuge with M. myotis. Once summer is over, the entire M. schreibersii colony returns to Avenc Davì following the northern route in the opposite direction: from Summer refuges to Can Palomeres, to Castanya, to Avenc Daví for hibernation to conclude the annual migration. Bats following the southern route from Avenc Daví reach a set of caves near the coast ("Other caves", OC) and return to Avenc Daví for hibernation, reuniting with the bats following the northern route. Migration rates are set to estimates from field data (Table S1 of the Supplementary Information) 38 , and a sensitivity analysis on starting date of migration events and on their duration was performed.
