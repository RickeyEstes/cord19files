This multisite cohort study included hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with CAP who were tested using a PCR-based RVP during calendar year 2014. Patients who underwent RVP testing after 48 hours of admission were excluded from the study. A manual chart review was also done to identify patients with pneumonia, defined as clinical signs of pneumonia in association with lung imaging demonstrating infiltrates with or without culture growth. PCR-RVP testing was performed using the Film Array Respiratory Panel test (Biofire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT). The respiratory viruses tested in the panel PCR were adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. The study protocol was reviewed and approval by the TriHealth Institutional Review Board. Data were extracted through the TriHealth electronic medical record system (EPIC Systems, Verona, WI). The main outcome was utilization of antibiotic therapy after the pneumonia diagnosis. Other study outcomes included length of stay, intensive care unit days, mortality, ventilator days, and discharge disposition. Data on demographics, comorbidities, testing results, vitals, and laboratory and image results were collected. Treatment management was evaluated by determining the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 48 hours of pneumonia diagnosis. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare outcomes and other study variables between patients who were RVP positive versus RVP negative. Logistic regression was used to examine the adjusted risk between the 2 groups and each of the significant variables. The χ 2 test and Fisher exact test, when appropriate, were used for categorical variables. For continuous variables, Student t tests and comparison of medians were used for normally and nonnormally distributed data, respectively. The significance level for all analysis was α = 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
