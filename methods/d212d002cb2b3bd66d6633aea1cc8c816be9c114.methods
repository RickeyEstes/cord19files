This was a retrospective observational study of paediatric patients with a physician diagnosis of an URTI during the period June 2003 to June 2005. Five public health facilities were randomly selected for this study, four of which had independent routine swab analysis performed by the National Surveillance Unit. A paediatric patient was a subject 12 years or below and an antibiotic was defined as a substance with bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. The term is often extended however to include synthetic antibacterial agents, not produced by microbes 24 , such as sulfonamides and quinolones, which was adopted in this study. The diagnoses of URTIs for the purposes of this study are: the common cold, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, viral URTI, influenza and non-specific URTI. Exclusion criteria were (1) age equal or lower 13, (2) subjects immunocompromised, malnourished or infected by laboratory confirmed resistant strains of pathogens and chronic respiratory tract diseases and (3) a subject without a definite diagnosis of URTI. Data were analysed using Minitab version 14. 25 Data from throat swabs performed under the National Surveillance Programme conducted at four (4) of the health facilities studied were collected and used for analysis. Swabs were taken from children presenting with complaints of an upper respiratory tract infection and were obtained on the same day as the physician's visit and were independent of physician consultation. These swabs were transported in commercially available transport media to the Microbiology department of the Port of Spain General Hospital where they were initially plated on blood agar containing antibiotic strips to detect sensitivity. The common cold and non-specific URTI were also the only two diagnoses made in children over 9 years of age. Disease occurrence and gender were not associated except for otitis media in which 11(79%) of the 14 cases occurred in boys. Four patterns of prescribing were observed, (1) There was a significant association between antibiotic prescribing and therapy for relief of symptoms [p=0.021] so that antibiotic prescription was likely to be given with a prescription for symptom relief. In 112 of the 523 cases studied throat swabs were analysed for culture and sensitivity. In 110 [98.2%] participants growth of commensals only was reported, and only two subjects had pathogenic organisms; one with streptococcus pyogenes and the other with Staphilococcus aureus. In children harbouring commensals, 52.7% were diagnosed with a nonspecific URTI, and 34.8% had the common cold. In the one patient in whom Staphlococcus aureus was isolated, a diagnosis of the common cold was made, the patient received amoxicillin/clavulanate and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to ampicillin. In the patient with Streptococcus pyogenes, the child had non-specific URTI, received amoxicillin, and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to amoxicillin.
