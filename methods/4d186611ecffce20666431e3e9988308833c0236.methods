This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was adopted from a research project and thesis in the field of critical care nursing approved by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran (No.1855 on 21/07/2015) It has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT201507307494N14), and obtained the code of ethics committee (IR.MAZUMS.REC.94-1855). Study population was composed of all of the patients who had undergone an open-heart surgery and were hospitalized in either cardiac surgical ward or post-cardiac surgery intensive care unit at Fatemeh Zahra Hospital (Mazandaran Heart Center, Sari, Iran) during September 2015 -February 2016. Sample size was calculated to include at least 55 subjects in each group according to the similar article and the incidence rate of atelectasis (28) , using the following formula and considering a minimal difference of 25% between the two groups, α=0.05, β=0.20, p 1 = 0.50 in the control group, and p 2 =0.25 in the experimental group. ) ( Considering a dropout rate of 30%, the sample size increased to 77 individuals, which was then further rounded up to 80 (per group) to enhance the accuracy. According to our CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) , after the dropout, each group ended up to contain 60 samples. After legal procedures and obtaining necessary approvals from the authorities and ethics committees at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, referring to Mazandaran Heart Center, the patients were selected. Using accessible sampling and a random-number table patients were randomly assigned into three groups: control (PEEP= 5), PEEP= 8 and PEEP= 10. Researcher reviewed the list of patients waiting for heart surgery, interviewed the patients and explained about this survey. Consent was taken from the patients after having inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were non-emergency open heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, heart valve replacement, combined with sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques), age range of 18-65 years, lack of ejection fraction less than 30% in the preoperative an- 3 giography sheet due to its negative effects on the patient's breathing pattern, no history of chronic lung disease and any damage to the lungs, no previous history of open heart or lung surgery, no history of rib fractures and chest tube, no history of head or nasal trauma, neurologic disease history and frequent sinus infections. Exclusion criteria included history of chemotherapy, the use of immunosuppressants during three months prior to surgery, arterial systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg despite fluid intake, arterial PH less than 7.30, arterial carbon dioxide pressure over 50 mmHg, arterial oxygen saturation less than 80% despite receiving supplemental oxygen, blood hemoglobin less than 7 g/dl after surgery, serum creatinine over 3.5 mg/dl and body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m 2 due to increased risk of developing postoperative respiratory complications, as well as postoperative hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure below 80 mmHg), aortic clamp time over 150 minutes, cardiopulmonary bypass time over 240 minutes, use of intra-and postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), intubated for more than 24 hours, retransmission to the operating room, require ventilation -therapeutic protocol and hypotension after intervention up to 10 mmHg of baseline blood pressure. The participants were allocated in three groups of PEEP8, PEEP10, and control using Excel's RANDBETWEEN function. Each group was identified by a letter: A to PEEP8, B to PEEP10, and C to control group. 180 envelopes were sequentially numbered from 1 to 180 for three groups. Each opaque and sealed envelope contained a letter (A, B, or C) randomly selected using RANDBETWEEN function of Excel. This procedure was carried out by someone not involved in the project. The first eligible patient was designated as number one, and the envelope numbered one was then opened, and the patient was allocated to one of the three groups based on the letter contained in the envelope. The data 4 gathering tool consisted of demographic questionnaire, medical and surgical questionnaires, which the researcher recorded all of them. The demographic and medical information were age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Data on surgical and postoperative status included the type of surgery (vessels, valves, combined), number of grafted vessels, duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic clamp time, number of chest tubes, duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, duration of intubation and atelectasis on chest x-ray, which were collected through patient records and during the process of patient care and the mentioned questionnaire. Before the intervention, the incidence rate of atelectasis was measured in all three groups. The patients in control group by having the inclusion criteria and 30 minutes after admission to ICU received 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation according to routine care. The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H 2 O PEEP and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours in the absence of impairment of the hemodynamic status and then had 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation. The incidence rate of atelectasis two hours after extubation and on the third postoperative day (72 hours after surgery) was recorded. None of the routine care in all three groups was omitted, but the entire health care was tried to be done. The initial consequence was atelectasis, as interpreted by a radiologist based on chest X-ray radiography. The secondary consequences included intubation time in postcardiac surgery intensive care unit, length of ICU and hospital stay. The researcher collected the required information and followed up the patients in all three groups. Since the patients and radiologists, who interpreted the chest X ray, were unaware of the type of intervention and grouping, the study was considered as double-blind trial. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software through descriptive statistic such as frequency, mean, standard deviation and analytical statistics, ANOVA, Chi-square, McNemar's and repeated measures ANOVA tests. A pvalue <0.05 was considered significant in this study
