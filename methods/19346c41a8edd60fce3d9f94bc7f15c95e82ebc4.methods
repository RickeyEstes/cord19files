Faecal samples or, in some cases rectal swabs (for culture only), were received by Liverpool Public Health Laboratory (PHL) from general practitioners and environmental health departments in the 5 Merseyside boroughs, Knowsley, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton and Wirral, with a total population of about 121 million, and from the Mersey Regional Infectious Diseases Unit and other departments of Fazakerley Hospital Liverpool (1,000 beds). Microbiology departments of most of the other hospitals in the area submitted cultures to PHL for identification. These were mainly salmonellas isolated from specimens submitted by general practitioners through open access to hospital laboratories. Faecal samples for electron microscopy were also referred by hospital microbiology departments to PHL from cases of suspected viral gastroenteritis, the majority from ward outbreaks. All first faecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis were cultured for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter and, if from infants up to 2 years old, enteropathogenic E. coil. Microscopy and culture for other bacteria were also undertaken when indicated by information accompanying the sample. In cases of Bacillus cereus, CI. perfringens or Staph. aureus food poisoning, these organisms were only sought in faeces if incriminated food was also available for examination. The total numbers of specimens each year from 1983 to 1987, including positive cultures referred by hospital laboratories were:   1983  8,607  1984  8,313  1985  6,334  1986  7,308  1987  4,696   Total  35,258  Up to August 1984, when the practice ceased, women admitted to the Maternity Unit,  Fazakerley Hospital, were screened for salmonella excretion representing nearly 4,000 specimens per annum. This was discontinued because over a 9-year period only 60 (0.2%) of 30471 women screened were salmonella-positive and only 7 of the 60 babies excreted salmonellas, l Reduced numbers in 1987 compared with 1985 and 1986 reflected the absence of major outbreaks in the later year. During the period under review however the workload per specimen increased with introduction of additional special techniques for the detection of Cl. difficile and its toxin, Cryptosporidium and, in 1987, Aeromonas and Yersinia. Cultures of Salmonella were sent for serotyping and/or phage typing to Division of Enteric Pathogens (DEP), Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London. Cultures of Shigella other than sonnei were also sent to DEP for serotyping. Details of each patient's home address, age, sex and, in some cases, illness were available from the specimen request form or were obtained, if possible, by telephone. Questionnaires in respect of salmonella-positive patients were sent to the doctors concerned and also in the case of outbreaks of infection of any kind requesting information about number of patients with symptoms or found to be positive for the causative organism.
