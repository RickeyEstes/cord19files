RT-PCR for detection of EV-D68 from NPAs. RNA extraction and RT-PCR for EVs were performed using previously described protocols with modifications and primers targeted to the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) as shown in Supplementary Table 1 2, 51 . Both strands of PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI 3130xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), using the PCR primers. Nucleotide sequences were compared to those of known EVs with sequences available in GenBank. Positive samples with sequences belonging to EVs were subject to EV-D68 detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of VP1 gene using EV-D68 specific primers. Samples containing EV-D68 upon VP1 gene sequencing were further subject to 2C and 3D gene sequencing. RT-PCR and sequencing of VP1, 2C and 3D gene regions. The partial VP1, 2C and 3D gene regions of EV-D68 strains detected from NPAs were amplified and sequenced using primers shown in Supplementary Table 1 and previously described protocols with modifications 2,52 . Phylogenetic trees of each region were constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) method in MEGA6, with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates. Selective pressure analysis. The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, d S , and non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, d N , in VP1 were calculated using Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in MEGA5. Sites under positive selection were inferred using single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) and fixed effects likelihood (FEL) methods as implemented in DataMonkey server (http://www.datamonkey.org). The overall ω (d N /d S ) value was calculated according to NJ trees under the TrN93 substitution model. Positive selection for a site was considered to be statistically significant if P-value was < 0.1. A mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) was further used to identify positively selected sites under episodic diversifying selection in particular positions among different clades within a phylogenetic tree even when positive selection is not evident across the entire tree. The relative residue abundance within BC and DE-surface exposed loops were depicted using WebLogo.
