Biosafety statement. All infectious work with hCoV-EMC/2012 was performed in a high containment facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The work was approved by the RML Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). Virus and cells. Human betacoronavirus EMC (hCoV-EMC/2012) was kindly provided by Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, Netherlands). Vero (African green monkey kidney) and LLC-MK2 (rhesus monkey kidney) were maintained at 37uC in 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml of streptomycin. HCoV-EMC was subsequently propagated on Vero cells using DMEM as above with 2% FBS (complete DMEM). Antiviral assays. Confluent Vero and LLC-MK2 cells in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY ) were infected in triplicate with hCoV-EMC/2012 diluted in complete DMEM at an MOI 5 0.001. Following 1 h adsorption at 37uC, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed 3 times with DMEM. Subsequently, complete DMEM containing IFN-a2b (0-5000 U/ml) (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) and/or ribavirin (0-2000 mg/ml) (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was added to the cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37uC, 5% CO 2 in a humidified environment and the supernatant was removed, an aliquot was inactivated with AVL (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) for viral load quantification and the remainder was stored at 280uC for subsequent virus titration. The supernatant was replaced with fresh complete DMEM containing IFN-a2b and/or ribavirin. Supernatant was also collected at 72 h and 120 h. Five days post-infection representative wells were photographed to document cytopathic effect (CPE) and cells were subsequently collected for protein analysis in 43 SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Genome quantification. RNA from AVL-treated supernatant was extracted with the NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA) on a Corbett Xtractor Gene (Valencia, CA). Quantitative real time RT-PCR using primers and probe previously described 48 was performed on the RotorGene Q (Qiagen). A 10-fold dilution series of viral RNA based on TCID 50 equivalents was used as a standard. Western blot. Cell lysates were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk, 0.05% Tween20 in PBS and subsequently probed with polyclonal serum diluted in blocking buffer at 1/10,000 from rabbit A691/A741 immunized with inactivated HCoV-EMC. Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was used as a secondary at a 1/10,000 dilution. Western blots were developed with the Pierce ECL Plus kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL). Infectivity assay (TCID 50 ). Confluent Vero cells were infected in triplicate with 10fold dilutions of supernatants obtained from the antiviral assay. Virus was allowed to adsorb for 1 h and was then removed and replaced with complete DMEM. Cells were incubated at 37uC, 5% CO 2 in a humidified environment for 5 days and then CPE was scored and TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) calculated as described by Reed and Muench 49 . Data analysis. Data from the genome quantification and TCID 50 assays was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad Software) and CompuSyn (combosyn.com).
