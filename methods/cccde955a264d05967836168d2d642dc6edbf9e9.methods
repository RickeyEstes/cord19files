A comprehensive search of nursing literature included both peer reviewed published research and web-available documents for the last 10 years. Databases Journals@OVID, ProQuest, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Pandora were searched. The search included the following combination of keywords: ''nurses'' ''nursing'', ''standards'' ''adapted'' ''altered'' ''disaster(s)'' and ''policy/response''. While a total of 228 items were identified, 31 of these were considered for more thorough analysis. For inclusion, scholarly articles were required (either based on research or considered analysis by one or more professionals) to relate directly to the provision of clinical care. Only two articles related to the Australian context (Johnstone, 2009; Usher, 2010) were located. The 31 documents identified for further consideration were a mix of reports on expert panel reviews, observations and discussion papers from a professional perspective, one computer simulation, one qualitative study and one survey. There was one editorial and a letter to the editor. The included items are briefly reviewed in Table 1 . Of the four free-standing reports identified, one was dropped because it was also discussed in some detail in a peer-reviewed journal; the three others (one report from the United States Institute of Medicine, one from a US government agency and one from a policy analysis resource centre) were included. News reports about individual cases or professional discussions were excluded. Given the small number of articles exclusively about or by nurses, articles also were included primarily about or by physicians or legal scholars but clearly relevant to nursing or institutions in which nurses practise. Several documents were specific to one type of disaster, primarily pandemic influenza surge demand on acute care services. Two of the documents were specifically by and about nursing; the majority were either generic to health professions or with a focus on institutions in which nurses provide a substantial part of professional care. A directed content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) approach was used to develop the initial coding scheme from the literature reviewed, and from these, common categories were identified. To increase the objectivity and validity of the analysis, each of the authors separately reviewed the literature identified and jointly agreed on those categories for which there was substantial agreement and thus were included in the findings.
