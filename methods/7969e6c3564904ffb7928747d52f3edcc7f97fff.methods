Purification and sequencing of PCLSR products. The PCLSR products were purified using DNA extraction. The DNA from the reference virus stock as well as the whole blood from wild boars and pigs was extracted using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit, accordingly to the manufacturer's procedure (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The extracted DNA was stored at − 20 °C for further testing. PCR. The PCR for PCLSR results verification was performed in 25 μ l final volume using outer PCLSR primers accordingly to the procedure of MyTaq HS DNA Polymerase kit (Bioline, Gdansk, Poland). The reaction mixture contained: 12.5 μ l of MyTaq ™ HS DNA Polymerase, 9.5 μ l PCR-grade water, 1 μ l of each primer and 1 μ l (~200 ng) template DNA. The primer concentration was 40 pM of each primer. The obtained PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels under voltage of 100 V/50 min. The gels were stained by addition of 5 μ l of SimplySafe solution as for PCLSR product separation. The length of PCR products were estimated on the basis of 100 bp DNA Ladder Plus GeneRuler (Thermo-scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). All PCLSR were replicated to verify reproducibility. LAMP. LAMP has been conducted using previously described primers 13 in 15 μl reaction volume using the following concentration of reagents: 7.5 μl of Isothermal Mastermix 50 pmol of forward and backward inner primer (FIP and BIP), 10 pmol of outer primers (F3 and B3) and 25 pmol of loop primers (LF and LB), 1 μl of standard plasmid, containing a p72 gene. After incubation, 1 μl of a 1:10 stock dilution of 10,000 x DMSO concentrated SYBR Green I dye (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction vessel. The results were registered under UV illumination, to detect fluorescence.
