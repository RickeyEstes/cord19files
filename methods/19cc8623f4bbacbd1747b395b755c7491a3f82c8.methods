A sequential mixed-methods project using both qualitative and quantitative methods was conducted; the results of the qualitative aspect of the project are presented here. This was the first part of the project and involved semistructured face-to-face interviews with healthcare professionals from three randomly selected MoH hospitals: a local 50-bed hospital; a regional 180-bed hospital; and a central 380-bed hospital. All three hospitals are located in a Saudi region (South of Saudi Arabia) or its outskirts. In each setting, ASP team members were identified and contacted. Representatives from the General Directorate of Health Affairs in the region (Infection Control Department and Pharmaceutical Care Department) and the Saudi MoH also participated in this study. One of the authors (SA) conducted the interviews in January and February 2017 using a semistructured interview guide. This was developed based on a review of the literature and was validated by a committee of three ASP pharmacists and two ID consultants. It was then piloted in a convenience sample of 16 participants from three MoH hospitals. The guide comprises open-ended questions to explore the experience and perspectives of physicians, hospital pharmacists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, nurses, hospital managers and MoH representatives in relation to the adoption and implementation of ASPs in Saudi MoH hospitals as well as the barriers influencing ASP implementation. Further probing questions may have been asked based on participants' responses. The identified factors influencing ASP adoption in Saudi MoH hospitals were further explored in the quantitative aspect of the project through a national hospital survey. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts were compared with the original tape to review for quality and accuracy. Data were analysed independently by two of the authors (SA and IB) and were subjected to various stages of inductive coding for thematic development [12] . The coders met regularly to review coding and to derive themes. The study was approved by the Health and Human Sciences Ethics Committee of the University of Hertfordshire (Hatfield, UK). Official permission was obtained from participating hospitals, and all participants signed informed consent before taking part in the study.
