In this section, we describe each of the design and implementation challenges of the existing PI models (A1-A5) and present our methods to examine the challenges in the research literature. In addition, we present our paper screening and parameter selection criteria. Design and implementation challenges of pandemic models and databases Validity of data support (A1) Public health policy makers advocate that the model parameters be derived from up to date demographical and epidemiological data during an outbreak [1] . In this paper we examine some of the key aspects of data support, such as data availability, data access, data retrieval, and data translation. To ensure data availability, a process must be in place for collection and archival of both demographical and epidemiological data during an outbreak. The data must be temporally consistent, i.e., it must represent the actual state of the outbreak. In the United States and other few countries, availability of temporally consistent demographical data is currently supported by governmental databases including the decennial census and the national household travel survey [7] [8] [9] [10] . To ensure temporal consistency of epidemiological data, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended enhancing the data collection protocols to support real-time decision making [4] . The frequency of data updating may vary based on the decision objective of the model (e.g., outbreak detection, outbreak surveillance, and initiation and scope of interventions). As noted by Fay-Wolfe, the timeliness of a decision is as important as its correctness [11] , and there should be a balance between the cost of data updating and the marginal benefits of the model driven decisions. Archival of data must allow expedited access for model developers and users. In addition, mechanisms should be available for manual or automatic retrieval of data and its translation into model parameter values in a timely manner. In our review of the existing PI models at provincial and local levels, we examined the validity of data that was used in supporting major model parameters. The major model parameters include: The reproduction number, defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case [12] ; the proportion of the population who become infected, also called infection attack rate [13] ; the disease natural history within an individual; and fractions of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The first row of Table 2 summarizes our approach to examine data validity. For each reviewed PI model, and, for each of the major model parameters, we examined the source and the age of data used (A1a, A1b), the type of interface used for data access and retrieval (A1c), and the technique used for translating data into the parameter values (A1d).
