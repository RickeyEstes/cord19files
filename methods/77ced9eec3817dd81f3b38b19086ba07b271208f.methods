Immunization. Female C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were segregated into five groups. Four of the groups of mice received PBS, NC8-pSIP409, NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep or NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep by gavage. The remaining group of mice was intramuscularly administered H9N2 AIV inactivated vaccine (Weike Biotech, China) (50 μ l/mouse). In brief, recombinant L. plantarum was cultured at 30 °C in MRS broth containing 10 μ g/ml erythromycin and 50 ng/ml SppIP for 12 h under anaerobic conditions. The freshly cultured recombinant L. plantarum was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 250 μ l of PBS for the administration of 1.0 × 10 9 cfu per mouse. Recombinant L. plantarum was orally administered by gavage three times on days 1, 2 and 3, and the four groups of mice received three booster vaccinations four weeks later on days 28, 29 and 30. Mouse DC culture and flow cytometry. Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs were induced and purified according to a published protocol 22, 68 . DC activation was confirmed by co-culturing mouse DCs with NC8-pSIP409, NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-Ctrlpep and NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep at a ratio of 1:10 for 12 h at 37 °C. DCs from bone marrow and other tissues were labelled with an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated antibody for CD11c (clone HL3) together with one of the following: CD40 (clone 3/23), CD80 (clone 16-10A1), CD86 (clone GL1), or MHC-II (clone 3/23). B220 + CD95 + PNA + cells were detected as previously described using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) 25 . The data were analysed with FlowJo 7.6.2 software.
