This study was a case study in Binzhou District, Shandong Province performed from December 2006 to January 2007. Binzhou District is one of 17 administrative districts including one city (urban area) and six countries (mostly rural areas). In 2005, the district's per capita GDP was 18,031 RMB (approximately 2,200 US dollars) and its population was 3,712,500. There are a total of 142 HCF in Binzhou District. This study only focused on general hospitals and health care centers because they covered most types of health care services, produced a variety of health care wastes, and could be compared using the same standards. Traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and specialist hospitals (maternal and child, cancer, injury, infectious disease, rehabilitation, etc.) were excluded. This case study involved visits to a total of six HCF: one tertiary hospital, one secondary hospital, and four primary health care centers. In that HCF, 145 medical staff members (randomly selected from a total of 1636 individuals) and all 24 cleaning personnel were interviewed. To determine the general status of health care waste management at every HCF, in-depth interviews were conducted with waste management officers or infection control officers. A semistructured questionnaire was designed based on national regulations for health care waste management and the WHO's rapid assessment tool (2004) . It included handling practices in separation, collection, transport, storage, and final disposal of waste; occupational education and safety for related personnel; and internal policies and administration. Additionally, there was an openended question on the final page of the questionnaire asking officers to discuss issues regarding health care waste management in detail in order to identify detailed issues related to current health care waste management in HCF. Observation of departments/wards, storage locations, handling practices, equipment, and records of the handling process was also undertaken in order to verify the interview data. To assess amounts of health care waste generated in health care centers and in tertiary and secondary hospitals, the weight of health care waste was measured just before cleaning personnel visited departments and wards to collect the waste. In primary health care centers, weight was measured in the storage location (or a temporary storage room) just before final disposal because of lack of management of collection and on-site transport at those facilities. Measurements were made daily for one week. Responding staff members (doctors or nurses) in departments/wards and primary health care centers were asked to fill out a sheet that included the daily number of patients, number of beds, and amounts of health care waste during the study period. Based on those data, the generation rate (kg/bed/day) and the daily amount of health care waste generated from each level of HCF were calculated. To examine medical staff members' knowledge of health care waste management policy, questions and answers were designed through discussions with experts from the study site because no similar study has been conducted in China. Those questions included six items: categories of health care waste (including infectious, sharps, pathological, chemical, pharmaceutical, and radioactive wastes), bio-hazard markings, related national regulations, internal policies, storage location in the HCF, and use of a consignment note system (a set of sheets recording the amount of waste, its content, and the complete handling process). The questionnaire also asked about training experience. An open-ended portion was included at the end of each question to encourage the participants to explain their knowledge of the question in as much detail as possible in order to accurately score the answer based on master answers designed in advance and to comprehensively ascertain their level of understanding. A semi-structured questionnaire for cleaning personnel included items on their self-protective practices, attitudes towards self-protective practices, training experience, protective measures, and guidance provided by the HCF. Quantitative data were analyzed with SPSS version 13.0 statistical software. Descriptive analysis and a non-parametric test were used on quantitative data. The K.J. Method, a direct qualitative analysis method designed by the Japanese ethnologist Kawakita (1975) , was applied to qualitative data. All issues regarding health care waste management in HCF that were brought up in interviews with officers were listed, and then a card was made for each issue mentioned and these were grouped with similar ideas. Then, the groups were arranged into a relationship model with a logical order. The ethical committees for research of the University of Tokyo and Shandong University approved this study and ethical permission was obtained from each HCF. All participants were informed about the study procedures and the investigation was conducted after their informed consent was obtained.
