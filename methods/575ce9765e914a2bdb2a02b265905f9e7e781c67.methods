Isolation of the stria vascularis. All the animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the protocol reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, were approved by the President of Niigata University (Niigata Univ. Res. 215-2), and were compliant with the ARRIVE guidelines 50 . Male BN/SsNSIc rats (7 weeks old, 140-180 g; SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used (64 rats total). All the animals were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.5 ml per rat; Nembutal; Abbott, IL, USA). After deep anaesthesia was confirmed by the toe pinch, corneal reflexes, and respiratory rate, in each rat, the heart was surgically exposed and cold saline (100 ml) was infused systemically through the left ventricle (drainage; right atrium). Then, the cochleae were dissected from the temporal bone (Fig. 1b) The stria vascularis and spiral ligament were isolated under a stereo-microscope as follows. Firstly, the cochlea was sagittally divided using a sharp scalpel, and the bony lateral wall, which contains the stria vascularis and spiral ligament, was manually separated from the organ of Corti and cochlear axis with fine tweezers (Fig. 1c) . Secondly, the lateral cochlear wall consisting of the stria and ligament was detached from the bony wall, and the stria, which is identified by brown pigmentation of intermediate cells 51 (Fig. 1c) , was carefully peeled away from the ligament with a 27-gauge needle (Fig. 1d) . Thirdly, the isolated tissues were gently washed with the standard solution. Five to eight pieces of the stria vascularis and ligament (length: 200-1300 μm) were obtained from one cochlea. Samples of respective tissues from 8-10 cochleae were collected in 1.5 ml microtubes and centrifuged at 11432 × g for 1 min at 4 °C (KITMAN-18; TOMY, Tokyo, Japan). After removal of the supernatant, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. qPCR analyses. Total-RNA samples were extracted from the stria vascularis and spiral ligament isolated from 8-10 cochleae using NucleoSpin RNA XS (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan). Concentration and quality of RNA were estimated on a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA); samples whose RNA integrity , and Cldn11 (NM_053457), which encode KCC3, Brn-4, barttin, and claudin 11, respectively, were compared between the stria vascularis and spiral ligament. The primer sequences have been described in our earlier work 12 . All the experiments were conducted in duplicate. Quantitative data from PCR with each set of primers were obtained with reference to an internal control gene: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh; GenBank accession No. NM_017008). The cDNA template resulting from 5 ng of total RNA was used for the assessment of expression of Slc12a6, Pou3f4, Bsnd, and Cldn11 and that from 1 ng of total RNA was tested for Gapdh. This series of assays was carried out three times with different batches of cochlea samples: 26 cochleae from 13 rats were analysed in total. Each gene expression level was displayed as mean ± SE (n = 3), and differences between the stria vascularis and spiral ligament were evaluated by two-tailed Student's t test. preparation of pyridylaminated glycans from the stria vascularis. N-glycans were liberated from the strial glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis as described previously 29 . Pieces of strial tissues that were excised from 102 cochleae (51 rats) and stored separately in 14 tubes were combined in one tube. Next, the samples were lyophilised and heated at 100 °C for 10 h with 1 ml of anhydrous hydrazine (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan). After removal of this reagent by repeated evaporation, the glycans were re-N-acetylated with acetic anhydride in a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and subsequently desalted by passing them through a Dowex 50Wx2 (H + ) cation exchanger (Dow Chemicals, Midland, MI, USA). The samples were again lyophilised and then heated at 90 °C for 60 min with 20 µl of a pyridylamination reagent; this reagent was prepared by dissolving 2-aminopyridine (276 mg) in acetic acid (100 µl). Finally, they were heated at 80 °C for 35 min with 70 µl of a reducing reagent, which was a mixture of dimethylamine borate (50 mg), acetic acid (20 µl), and double-distilled water (12.5 µl) . In this process, the glycans were tagged with a fluorophore, 2-aminopyridine 52, 53 . Pyridylaminated (PA)-glycans from the reaction mixture were purified as described elsewhere 7, 54 . The reaction mixture was diluted with 0.15 ml of water and extracted twice using 1 ml of phenol:chloroform (1:1 v/v) to remove the excess reagents and contaminants. The water layer that contained the PA-glycans was purified by gel filtration on a column (1.5 × 18 cm, TSK-gel Toyopearl HW-40F, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.0. After loading of the sample, the eluate between 10 and 25 ml was collected as the PA-glycan fraction. The PA-glycans were further purified using a graphite carbon cartridge (GL-Pak Carbograph 300 mg; GL Sciences Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The salt concentration of the glycan mixture was adjusted to 50 mM with ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and the mixture was loaded onto the cartridge. After a wash with 5 ml of 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, the glycans were eluted with 5 ml of 60% acetonitrile in the ammonium acetate buffer. The eluate was concentrated by means of a vacuum concentrator and dried by lyophilisation. Sample preparation described above was performed in accordance with MIRAGE guidelines 55,56 . HpLC. Three types of HPLC were carried out using a Waters Alliance Waters 2695 separation module and W2475 fluorescence detector (Waters, Milfold, MA) in accordance with MIRAGE guidelines 55, 56 ; the detailed information including the parameter settings are described below. Firstly, the lyophilised strial PA glycans were dissolved in ultra-pure water and analysed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min by anion exchange HPLC combined with a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (0.75 × 7.5 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The column was equilibrated with 0.7 mM aqueous ammonia, pH 9.0. After the samples were injected into the column, the concentration of ammonium acetate was increased linearly to 0.2 M between the time points 5 and 20 min, and then, was further elevated to 0.5 M during the following 10 min. The PA-glycans were detected on a fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm. By these procedures, the N-glycans were separated in accordance with the number of attached sialic acid residues, i.e. into fractions N, A1, A2, A3, and A4 (see Fig. 3a and the 'Results' section). Secondly, each fraction (N, A1-A4) was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC, which involved a Cosmosil 5C18-P column (0.2 × 25 cm; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The flow rate of the samples was 0.2 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 100 mM triethylamine acetate, pH 4.0, containing 0.075% of 1-butanol. After injection of the sample, the 1-butanol concentration was increased linearly from 0.075% to 0.5% during 105 min. Negative charges of sialic acid residues interfere with separation of samples by reversed-phase HPLC; therefore, in our preparation, they were neutralised by triethylamine, an ion-pairing reagent that has both a positive charge and a hydrophobic moiety. This treatment sharpens the elution profile of acidic N-glycans 7 . The PA-glycans were detected at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm. Areas of all the individual peaks were measured separately 32 . The most abundant species was N-5. A peak whose area exceeded 2% of that of N-5 was considered significant; thus, 107 fractions were subjected to the next analysis. Thirdly, the samples were processed by size fractionation HPLC involving a TSK gel Amide 80 column (0.46 × 7.5 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4, containing 80% acetonitrile. After a sample was injected, acetonitrile concentration was decreased linearly from 80% to 65% during 5 min and then from 65% to 55% over the next 5 min, and finally from 55% to 30% during the subsequent 25 min. PA-glycans were detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm. The peak area of each glycan obtained by this HPLC was determined as follows. When multiple subfractions were extracted from a fraction of the reversed-phase HPLC, an area proportion of each subfraction was calculated. The area of the original fraction was multiplied by each proportion to determine areas of the subfractions. A glycan whose relative amount Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:1551 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38079-0 exceeded 2% of that of N-5 was considered significant; 88 species that satisfied this criterion were subjected to LC-ESI-MS and MS 2 (see Fig. 3 , Table 1 , and Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3). A glycan's elution time obtained in reversed-phase HPLC was converted to R stria by means of the reversed-phase scale, and that obtained in size fractionation HPLC was converted to S stria with the glucose unit, as described elsewhere 29,32 . LC-esI-Ms and Ms 2 analysis. Mass-spectrometric analysis of PA-glycans was performed by positive-ion mode ESI-MS on an LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex U3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The fractions isolated through reversed-phase HPLC were trapped on a Hypercarb guard cartridge column (1 × 10 mm; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for enrichment and separation from contaminants. The samples were eluted with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water and 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 50 µl/min, and the gradient conditions were varied for different samples. MS 2 analyses of PA-glycans were carried out by collision-induced dissociation in a data-dependent mode or with manually selected parent ion isolation. The peak intensities were extracted in the Mass+ + software ver. 2 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). All the MS and MS 2 spectra are displayed in Supplementary Fig. S2 . Sample preparation and mass-spectrometric analyses described above were performed in accordance with MIRAGE guidelines 55, 56 . Details of the HPLC, MS, and MS 2 settings are given in Supplementary Table S8. SALSA and multiple MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrometry (MS n ) analysis. Strial PA-glycan fractions obtained by reversed-phase HPLC were desalted by means of StageTip Carbon composed of Empore SPE carbon disks (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 33 . The solvent was removed in vacuo. The glycans included in dried samples were derivatised in a linkage-specific manner in alkylamidation solutions containing iPA and MA 33 . The samples were dried and re-dissolved in 10 μl of ultra-pure and sterile water. After that, 1 μl of this solution was deposited on a 700 μm μ Focus MALDI plate (Hudson Surface Technology Inc., Old Tappan, NJ) and then mixed with 1 μl of a matrix solution. Composition of this solution is described in Supplementary Table S9 . The plate was place on a 75 °C heat block for 1 min to accelerate solvent evaporation. On-plate PA-glycans were analysed by MALDI-QIT-TOF MS (AXIMA-Resonance, Shimadzu/Kratos, Manchester, UK) in positive or negative ion mode. MS n analyses were conducted by collision-induced dissociation with manually selected parent ion isolation. The peak intensities were extracted using Shimadzu Biotech Launchpad ver. 2.9.3 (Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK). Of note, the A3-15-2 glycan that was detected as a sole type by HPLC analyses was found to be composed of two species, i.e. A3-15-2-1 and A3-15-2-2, by the procedure combining SALSA and positive ion mode MALDI-MS (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3 and Tables S1, S2 and S6). Relative amounts of each of these two species were calculated via the following three steps. Firstly, as usually detected in the results of mass spectrometry experiments, careful observation revealed that the SALSA derivatised glycan in positive ion mode MALDI-QIT-TOF MS was composed of multiple isotopic peaks; the peaks within 6 Da from the m/z value of the onset of the initial peak were taken as significant signals. All the data points in these significant peaks were analysed, and a total peak intensity was obtained (see 'MALDI-MS total peak intensity' in Supplementary Table S2) . Secondly, using this value, the proportion of each glycan (i.e. A3-15-2-1 or A3-15-2-2) in the parent fraction, A3-15-2 species, was calculated. Finally, the relative amount of the glycan was determined by multiplying the proportion by the parent's amount normalised to N-5. With the same procedure, the relative amounts of A3-15-3-1 and A3-15-3-2 species were calculated (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) . Finally, to one glycan (A3-13), MS n analyses were then applied ( Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S6 ). Sample preparation and mass spectrometry described above were carried out in accordance with MIRAGE guidelines 55, 56 . Information on the MS and MS n settings is shown in Supplementary Table S9 .
