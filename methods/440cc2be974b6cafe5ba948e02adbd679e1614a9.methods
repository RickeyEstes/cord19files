Patients and clinical samples. Clinical specimens were obtained from 30 SFTS patients admitted into Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from April to September in 2016. The cohort consists of 11 deceased and 19 survived patients who were confirmed of SFTSV infection by RT-PCR. Serum specimens were stored at −80°C until use. Fresh PBLs were utilized when needed and, otherwise, cryogenically preserved until use. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. ELISA analysis of serum antibodies specific for NP and Gn. Serum titers of IgM and IgG to SFTSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) were measured using commercial ELISA kits (Sinosbio, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. Serum specimens were diluted to serial concentrations of 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160 and 1:320, and analyzed in duplicate. Human serum IgG specific for SFTSV Gn was quantitated by ELISA. 293T expressed and purified Gn was diluted in antigen-coating buffer to a predetermined concentration in 96-well plates. The plate was incubated at 4°C overnight. Serum was added to the plate at 1:100 and allowed to bind Gn in triplicate at 37°C for 1 h. Anti-human IgG conjugated to HRP (Abcam, USA) was used as the secondary antibody. The optical density of the reaction was measured at OD 405 . Quantitative RT-PCR. The viral load in patients' serum was determined on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Life Tech, USA). The primer set was as below: forward primer: 5′-GGGTCCCTGAAGGAGTTGTAAA-3′, reverse primer: 5′-TGC CTTCACCAAG ACTATCAATGT-3′, probe: 5′-FAM-TTCTGTCTTGCTGGC TCCGCGC -BHQ1-3′. The relative gene expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1 in sorted CD27 + CD38 + B cells, and IL-21 in sorted pTfh were determined on QuantStudio™ 6 Flex Real-Time PCR Systems (Life Tech, USA) using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher, USA) according to the manufacture's procedure. The quantitative level of mRNA was normalized to β-actin using the cycle threshold (Ct) method (2 -△△Ct method), then compared in log 2 value. Expression of soluble SFTSV Gn and Gc. Amino acid sequence of Gn was analyzed by TMHMM Server v.2.0. Both the hydrophobic N-and C-termini of Gn or Gc were removed for a soluble expression. The truncated sequence of Gn expands from amino acid residue D 20 to C 447 , whereas the truncated sequence of Gc expands from amino acid residue C 563 to N 1026 , based on Genbank accession number: YP_006504094.1 for the membrane glycoprotein polyprotein [SFTS virus HB29]. The expression fragment was constructed as Kozak sequence-signal peptide: MGWSCIILFLVATATGVHS-Gn D 20 -C 447 -His tag-stop codon for Gn and MGWSCIILFLVATATGVHS-Gc C 563~N1026 -His tag-stop codon for Gc. The DNA sequences were synthesized by Y-Clone Ltd. (Suzhou, China), and were cloned into pVAX1 plasmid to generate pVAX1-GnRFC or pVAX1-GcRFC expression vector. We transfected 293F or CHO cells and purified Gn and Gc, respectively, by Ni + NTA beads (Smart-Lifesciences, Suzhou, China) following the manufacture's protocol. Gn and Gc were identified by western blot analysis, and anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) served as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:300. Western blot analysis. Serum IgG and IgM to Gn and Gc were analyzed by western blot. Briefly, Gn or Gc was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. The PVDF was stained overnight at 4 ℃ with serum diluted at 1:300 or 1:100 for IgG or IgM detection, respectively. The membranes were then incubated with anti-human IgG or IgM secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (Abcam, USA) at a dilution of 1:10000 or 1:5000, respectively, for 4 h. The immunoreactive bands of IgG and IgM were detected by Hyperfilm ECL (Pierce, USA) and FluorChem FC2 system (Alpha Innotech Corporation St. Leonardo, CA, USA), respectively. Viral stocks. SFTSV was isolated from an acutely infected patient's serum and propagated in Vero cells.. The supernatant was diluted into tenfold serial dilutions with DMEM, which was used to inoculate Vero cells in 12-well plates. The cells were transferred to glass cover slides at 8 or 18 h post infection, air dried, fixed, and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. Vero cells were stained with camel Gn-IgG positive serum at 1:500, followed by Alexa Fluor 488conjugated rabbit anti-camelid VHH antibody (Genscript, China) at 1:1000. Infectious virus titers (TCID 50 /ml) were calculated according to the Reed and Muench method. 1 × TCID 50 /ml aliquots were stored at −80°C. The viral load of 1 × TCID 50 /ml was quantitated at about 10 5 copies/ml by RT-PCR. Neutralization assays. Camels were primed with Gn prepared in CFA, boosted by Gn in IFA every two weeks, and the sera were collected at the end of the 8th week. Serum antibodies were identified by ELISA and WB analysis. Serum specimens were inactivated in 56°C for 30 min. The neutralization activity of the sera from a convalescent SFTS patient (30 d post symptom onset), a fatal patient (one day before death) and a Gn-immunized camel was determined by the focal reduction neutralization test (FRNT). The number of the infected cells was visualized and calculated using Olympus Fluoview FV3000 (Tokyo, Japan). The reduction of the infected foci was then compared with that in the control (no serum). Serum specimens in serial dilutions of 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640 and 1:1280, were mixed with equivalent volume of 1 × TCID 50 /ml viral aliquots separately. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, transferred to Vero cells in glass slides covered 12-well plates and incubated for 2 d. The cells were stained with camel Gn-IgG positive serum at 1:500, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rabbit anticamelid VHH antibody (Genscript, China) at 1:1000. 50% FRNT values for each serum dilution were determined by Graphpad Prism 5 software (USA). Apoptosis analysis of SFTS patients' PBMCs. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Health Bioscience, Sweden) according to the manufacture's protocol. 4 × 10 5 PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS in 24-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 3 h. Cultural medium was gently removed and replaced with 5ul of annexin-V-FITC and PI working solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The plate was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 10 min and washed 3 times with Binding Buffer. Images were acquired using Olympus Fluoview FV3000 (Tokyo, Japan). Tfh stimulation. About 10 6 PBMCs from SFTS patients were cultured with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and stimulated with 2ul Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (BD bioscience, USA) for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were then collected for surface and intracellular staining for flow cytometric analysis as described below. B-cell Elispot. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared from fresh heparinized peripheral blood specimens by density gradient centrifugation using a Ficoll cushion. After washing, PBMCs were re-suspended at 2 × 10 6 PBMC/ ml in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To stimulate B cells, 1 μg/ml R848 and 10 ng/ml recombinant human (rh) IL-2 were added (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden). For in vitro Gn stimulation, PBMCs were incubated with 2 μg/ml Gn, 1 μg/ml R848 and 10 ng/ml IL-2. The cells were subsequently incubated for three days at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Stimulated cells were washed in RPMI-1640 prior to plating. Sterile 96-well Multiscreen-IP filter plates with a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) were coated with anti-human IgG (15 μg/ml, Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) or Gn (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4°C. Numbers of total IgG + secreting cells or Gn-specific B cells were determined by wells coated with anti-human IgG or Gn, respectively. Wells with no antibody coating were used as negative controls. Plates were washed with sterile PBS and blocked with RPMI-1640 medium/10% FBS for 2 h at room temperature. 5000 or 200,000 pre-activated cells were added to IgG-or Gn-coated wells in duplicates, respectively, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 for 18 h. The frequency of antibody-secreting cell was measured after incubating the cells with biotin-labeled anti-IgG mAb (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) followed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden). Image analysis was carried out on an automated ELISpot image analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited, Hong Kong, China). CD4 + B-cell helper assay. pTfh cells (CD3 + CD4 + CXCR5 + ICOS + PD1 + ) and naive B cells (CD3 -CD19 + CD27 -IgD + ) were sorted from the PBLs from patients or healthy donors (HC) by FACS. The pTfh cells were stimulated with cell stimulation cocktail for 6 h, completely washed, and labelled with CFSE. Naive B cells were used as a control. The stimulated pTfh were subsequently co-cultured with autologous naive B cells at a 1:1 ratio for 3 days. Flow cytometry was used to determine the proliferation, IgM and CD38 expression of the co-cultured naive B cells. mDC apoptosis assay and allo-MLR assay. Fresh PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors. mDCs were isolated using CD1c (BDCA-1)+ Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The mDCs were cultured in the complete medium containing GM-CSF and IL4 (20 ng/ml, R&D systems) and stimulated by LPS (0.1 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) before use. To infect, a portion of the mDCs were pulsed with SFTS virus (moi = 1) for two hours and cultured for 7 days. For apoptotic analysis, cultured mDCs were measured in duplicate by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V apoptosis detection kit with PI (Biolegend, China). For allo-MLR assay, the SFTSV-infected or uninfected DCs were harvested and then mixed with CFSE-labelled allogeneic CD3 + T cells at a 1:10 ratio of DCs to T cells for allogeneic mixed lymphoctye reaction (Allo-MLR). The DC/T-cell coculture was carried out in complete medium containing IL-2 (20U/ml, R&D systems) for 3 days. The proliferation of CFSE-labelled CD3 + T cells in allo-MLR was analyzed by flow cytometry.
