We performed a prospective evaluation of 80 HDM sensitized patients with histories of allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and urticaria (UC). The patients underwent an allergen identification test using ImmunoCAP for total IgE, Der p, Der f, Der p 1, Der p 2, and Der p 10. Results Seventy-nine patients had detectable serum levels of Der p specific IgE, and 80, 66, 63, and 7 patients were sensitized to Der f, Der p 1, Der p 2, and Der p 10, respectively. The level of Der p 1-specific IgE was significantly lower in the UC group than in the AD and AR groups. Total IgE level was significantly higher in the Der p 10sensitized group. Der p 10 serum IgE level was highly correlated with crab and shrimp specific IgE. A significant positive correlation was observed between total IgE and specific IgE to Der p and its components and Der f. Conclusions Sensitization to HDM and its components in our study is similar to that reported in previous studies from temperate climate. There was a significant difference in Der p 1 in patients with UC, AD and AR. We performed 44 cases premedication and 3 cases of desensitization in 16 patients with hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase. One hundred and ninety five patients who visited ER were enrolled from three hospitals. We analyzed clinical features, prior history of anaphylaxis, management and education. For analyzing associated factors with injection of epinephrine, Pearson chi-square test was used by SPSS version 21. The medical records of inpatients who were diagnosed or developed non-immediate allergic reactions to antibiotics and underwent Interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively determined. A total of 561 children (273 boys, 288 girls) aged 11-12 years were enrolled in this study. Serum periostin level was measured and the skin prick test was performed with 26 aeroallergens commonly found in Korea. Other information was collected, including sex, age, BMI, parental allergy history, and parental smoking status. Multivariate analysis was used to confirm the association between serum periostin level and allergic rhinitis. We conducted this study on 27 pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis and adenotonsiller hypertrophy and 33 patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy only. Demographic data, clinical examination including oral and nasal endoscopy, and skull lateral view were obtained. The mean age, Brodsky tonsil size, adenoid size, and BMI were similar between two groups. A follow-up evaluation, which included questionnaires of clinical scores, physical examinations and skull lateral view were performed 3, 6 months after adenotonsillectomy. Children with recurrent wheezing during attack and children without wheezing were included in this study. Specimen of nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained for detection of virus. RV, Human metapneumovirus (hMP), Bocavirus (hBoV) were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RSV, parainfluenza viruses type I, II, III, influenza virus A, B and adenoviruses (ADV) was confirmed by detection of viral antigens via fluoroimmunoassay. Counting of white blood cells, severity of disease was accessed in the first visit. Duration of symptoms and interval between episodes were recorded in the 4 weeks follow-up. In a multi-country, double-blind, randomised controlled study, 153 infants born by elective C-section were randomised to receive (1) an infant formula supplemented with scGOS/lcFOS (0.8g/100ml) and B. breve M-16V (7.5×10 8 CFU/ 100ml), or (2) a formula supplemented with scGOS/lcFOS (0.8g/100ml), or (3) a control formula from birth until age 4 months. As a reference group, 30 vaginally born, breast fed infants were studied in parallel. Stool samples were collected at day 3, day 5, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, and week 22 (6 weeks post-intervention). The proportion of bifidobacteria, different Bifidobacterium species such as B. longum and the probiotic strain B. breve M-16V were determined with molecular tools, pH and SCFA were also measured in the stool samples. In 2014, a total of 627 Korean parents/caregivers of infants(48.6% boys) aged 0 till 18 months completed the internet-based expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire(BISQ), which included specific questions of infants' daytime and nighttime sleep patterns as well as their sleep related behaviors. We analyzed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of cutaneous adverse reactions kept in the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KARES). From January 2012 to December 2013, cases of cutaneous DHR were selected and analyzed regarding the age, gender, causative agents, and fatal cases. Based on the WHO-UMC causality assessment system, cases that assessed as 'unlikely' , 'unclassified' or 'unassessable' were excluded. Results A total of 2,577 cases were identified. 1406 cases were male (54.6%), and mean age was 5.97 ± 6.48 years. The most common agent was vancomycin (6.1%), followed by amoxicillin (4.0%), ampicillin (4.0%). The most common adverse reaction was rash (29.2%), followed by urticaria (20.8%), itching (14.0%). Among the 'certain' cases by WHO-UMC causality assessment system, the most common agent was acetylsalicylic acid (13.5%), followed by paracetamol (6.7%), iopromide (5.6%). There were 55 cases of serious ADR. Among the serious ADRs, Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) was most common (37 cases), followed by Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS, 14 cases), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN, 2 cases), and Drug reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS, 2 cases). Paracetamol was most common causes of serious ADRs (5 cases). Two patients, aged 3 and 77, who suffered anaphylactic shock after contact with topical chlorhexidine were studied. The first case was a 3-year-old boy who underwent hypospadias surgery; among other drugs, chlorhexidine was used. He developed sudden hypotension, desaturation and facial swelling. The boy did not respond to adrenalin and efedrine; inotropic support at the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit was required. The second case was a 77-year-old woman who had a wound that was sutured at the Emergency Room (ER). She presented cough, dysphonia, palmar itching, universal erythema and hypotension that was refractary to intramuscular adrenalin. Mepivacaine was used as local anaesthetic and clorhexidine as disinfectant. In both cases, tryptase and specific IgE to clorhexidine and latex were measured (ImmunoCAP FEIA, Thermo Fisher Scientific), skin tests to clorhexidine (0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate in 0.9% saline) and the other implicated drugs were performed, and also challenge tests were done when needed.  We retrospectively reviewed all children aged less than 18years who visited emergency department for acute urticaria or angioedema at Seoul national university hospital, Seoul, Korea, from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. The diagnosis of urticaria and angioedema was made on clinical grounds. The review included a history based on a standardized questionnaires such as precipitating events (eg, food intake, drugs, insect bites or other factors), complete physical examination, further evaluations trying to find the etiology (skin-prick test, serum-specific IgE or multiple allergen stimulation tests) and treatment performed in emergency unit. Results 212 consecutive infants, aged less than 18years, visited emergency department with a final diagnosis of acute urticaria (195 patients, 91.9%) and angioedema (17 patients, 8.01%). The causative event was identified in 112 patients (52.8%), the rest of patients are unidentified. Associated with foods were identified in 84 patients (39.6%), drug intake in 17 patients (8.0%) and others causes in 11 patients (5.1%). The other causes were vaccination, contact with a dog, insect bite or grass exposure. All patients were treated with oral anti-histamine. Anti-histamine injection was given in 134 patients (63.2%), systemic steroid in 25 patients (11.8%) and bronchodilator in 5 patients (2.3%). All the patients but one has discharged with oral anti-histamine, one children was hospitalized suspected of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The allergy test was performed in 19 patients (8.9%) at outpatient clinic and 16 patients (7.5%) showed positive results. This is a population-based, cross-sectional survey of 1757 preschool children, aged 3-7 years in Korea in 2010. A modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used. In addition, skin prick tests (SPT), serum total IgE and specific IgE were assessed. Current AR was defined as having nasal symptoms within the last 12 months and diagnosed AR by clinicians. Atopy was defined who had one or more positive reactions on SPT. This study was conducted in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, from September 2013 to March 2014. A total of 49 children with asthma exacerbation, aged between 3 and 14 years, were enrolled. The children should not have underling diseases such as chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, chronic renal disease, etc. and vitamin D supplement in recent 3 months. According to GINA assessment of asthma exacerbation, they were divided into mild, moderate and severe exacerbation group. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were assessed in all 49 children. This was a phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study with oral single and multiple doses that were administered to male and female healthy Japanese subjects from 20 to 45 years of age. Twenty seven subjects (nine per each cohort of dose) were randomised in a 3.5:1 ratio to rupatadine (10, 20 and 40 mg) or matching placebo. On Day -1, all subjects received a single dose of placebo, followed by one single daily oral dose on Day 1 and once single daily doses on Days 2 to 5. Plasma samples collected at different time-points throughout the study were analysed by means of a validated LC-MS/MS analytical method to determine rupatadine and UR-12790 and UR-12788 metabolites concentration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated by using a noncompartmental analysis, and regression models were used to assess dose linearity. Results PK exposure after rupatadine administration of single and multiple doses in Japanese subjects was found to increase in a dose dependent manner. Single and multiple oral doses of rupatadine were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events in this study and no subject withdrew due to safety reasons or any other reasons. According to patient's history and symptoms that occurred during Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Food Challenge test (DBPCFC), eleven children above 5 years old with IgE-mediated wheat allergy and anaphylaxis underwent ROIT. Skin prick test, measurement of serum specific IgE against wheat flour and oral food challenge (OFC) performed before and after OIT. Our protocol was consisting of initial build up phase following maintenance phase. Maximum dose during build up phase was 5.2 g wheat protein. We used bread containing 10% wheat protein for ROIT. In this method the patients hospitalized and build up phase performed during several days. After completion the buildup phase, the patients were asked to ingest the maintenance dose (52 g of bread) "daily" for 3 months at home. Then they received confirmed OFC. If this challenge was negative, we regarded them as desensitized state and they had to eat wheat products daily without interruption. We performed a prospective study of patients visiting the Emergency Department(ED) for anaphylaxis. We collected data from the emergency departments of three major tertiary hospitals from April 2014 to March 2015. The electronic records of patients with the diagnoses of allergy, angioedema, urticaria and anaphylaxis (ICD codes 9953, 9951, 7080, 9950, 7089) were obtained. The study was carried out in an accredited private medical laboratory in Mumbai, India. It involved retrospective data analysis on 545 sera, collected between 2013 & 2014, from patients with suspected allergic disease. Tests included Allergen specific IgE testing for 29 common food and inhalant allergens (ImmunoCAP, Ms. Thermofischer Phadia, Sweden) .335 sera had also been simultaneously screened using Adult Phadiatop TM (ImmunoCAP, Ms. Thermofischer Phadia, Sweden), while 210 were screened for Total IgE (Immulite, Siemens healthcare, USA). These were designated as Group I & Group II respectively. Both groups had similar age and gender distribution. Results 446/545 patients (81.8%) showed sensitization to at least 1 or more allergens. Multisensitization was common and seen in 73.2% sera. Most prevalent allergens were Housedust mite-D pternyssinus (58.5%), Cockroach (57.4%), Housedust mite-D farinae (56.8%), Shrimp (47.7%), House dust (45.13%), Weed Chenopodium album pollen (44.2%), Candida albicans (41.8%), Weed Artemisia vulgaris-Mugwort pollen and Wheat (32%). Using Allergen specific IgE as standard (Cut off of 0.1 kua/l), the sensitivity & specificity of Phadiatop in Group I was 62.1% and 98.4% respectively. Phadiatop sensitivity increased if only Allergen specific IgE values >0.5 kua/l were considered, i.e those more likely to be involved in symptomatic allergic disease. Phadiatop missed cockroach and shrimp positive sera. Though Phadiatop is not intended to screen for food allergies, cross reactivity between certain pollens and foods yielded few positive screening results. The sensitivity & specificity of Total IgE in Group II was 40.8 % and 100% respectively. Total IgE not only missed low level sensitization, but also missed some sera with high positive allergen specific IgE results. Conclusion Phadiatop TM was found to be a satisfactory screening test for atopy and outperformed Serum Total IgE. Looking at the trends in inhalant and food allergen seroprevalence, current study was able to establish a preliminary list of allergens relevant in the Indian context. These could be tested in addition to a Phadiatop or as a follow-on to a negative Phadiatop TM in the event of strong clinical history of allergic disease. Background: We previously reported that skin prick test was sensitive and serum specific IgE test was specific for predicting positive airway responses to house dust mites (HDM) in asthma. Because nose and bronchus are one airway, nasal provocation test would be more specific than skin test for predicting bronchial responses to HDM. Methods: Allergy skin prick test, and nasal and bronchial provocation tests using HDM Dermatophagoides farinae were done in 35 young men (19~28 years-old) who wanted a military certification for asthma. The nasal responses to HDM were scored according to the severity of 3 nose symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nose itching). Results: The prevalence of positive skin test (≥3+) to HDM was not significantly different between the patients with (n=23) and without (n=12) a positive response (early or late) to bronchial challenge (87.0% vs. 66.7%, P=0.200). However, the nasal response score was significantly higher in the responders than the others (1.00±0.24 vs. 0.25±0.13, P=0.011). The concordance of positive response not to the skin test (k=0.225, P=0.154) but to the nasal test (cutoff score: ≥2) (k=0.306, P=0.012) was significant with the positive bronchial response. The diagnostic sensitivity of the nasal test (47.8% at cutoff≥1, 39.1% at cutoff≥2) was lower, but the specificity (75.0% and 100%, respectively) was higher than that of the skin test (sensitivity: 87.0%, specificity: 33.3%). The main research method in the study was a retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who from January 2012 to December 2013 were registered to allergy clinic to diagnosed skin changes characterized of contact eczema. The analysis included only patients who underwent patch testing. Ornidazole skin prick test was found to be negative. Ornidazole patch test was similarly negative. Prick test and patch test for diclofenac were found to be negative as well. Amoxicillin-Claculonic acid prick test was done in order to determine an alternative safe antibiotic and it was found as negative too. Oral provocation test did not reveal any early or late onset allergic reaction either. Prick test and oral provocation test with meloxicam was done in order to find an alternative analgesic and these were negative too. Patients with a history of an immediate reaction or undetermined allergic onset to beta-lactams, who underwent BL hypersensitivity evaluation at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok between 2012 and 2015, were retrospectively reviewed. The verification process was conducted according to the updated parameter on drug allergy included skin testing with both major and minor determinants of penicillin, amoxicillin, clavulanate, and/or the culprit BL. Intradermal test (IDT) was performed after negative skin prick test (SPT), and oral challenge test (OCT) was then carried out in patients who gave informed consent. Serum penicilloyl-and amoxycilloyl-specific IgE levels have also been evaluated. Results A total of 86 patients (mean age 40.7 years) were included. Forty-eight patients (56%) were female and 42 patients (48.8%) had underlying medical illnesses. Most patients have allergic history to penicillin (45.4%) or amoxicillin (29.1%). Sixty percent of patients developed symptoms within 2 hours. The majority experienced skin symptoms; urticarial rash (24.3%), angioedema (21.4%), and maculopapular rash (20%), while 3 patients reported anaphylaxis. BL allergy was confirmed in 7 patients (8.1%); identified by positive skin tests in 2 patients, positive specific Ig-E levels in 3 patients, and positive OCT in 4 patients. For those with positive skin tests; one had positive SPT but negative Ig-E levels and another one had positive results for both IDT and specific Ig-E levels. Sixty patients (71.4%) were underwent OCT and 54 patients (90%) demonstrated negative challenge. Serum specific IgE levels were determined in 46 patients and 44 of them (95.7%) showed negative results. Mild non-immediate reactions developed in 4 patients upon OCT after negative skin tests. After the lecture presentations on emergency treatment for food allergy organized by regional school boards in Hyogo Prefecture, we conducted a questionnaire survey among its participants. We then analyzed the answers received from 1,433 participants using a logistic regression model to investigate independent factors associated with the negative attitudes toward the administration of AAI. Retrospective chart review of infants who hospitalized at single tertiary hospital between December 2014 and April 2015 was done. The exclusion criteria were atopic dermatitis, preterm, congenital heart disease, other congenital anomaly and metabolic disease. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS, general appearance, lung sound, dyspnea, respiration rate, oxygen saturation by pulse oxymetry) was evaluated at admission and within 72 hrs after admission. Outcome measures included feeding pattern, allergy history of parents, virus, initial body weight, current body weight and, height. We performed a retrospective study in in-patients, out-patients, and emergency department visitors, who were under 15 years old, at Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Cheonan, Korea, from Jan. 2013 through Dec. 2014. A total of 68 patients were diagnosed with anaphylaxis by criteria at the time. We evaluated 101 Korean atopic dermatitis (AD) patients' results from 'A' and newly developed 'B'. We also compared the correlation coefficient with ImmunoCAP-test, the gold-standard diagnostic tool for extrinsic AD. This cross sectional analysis included 1092 COPD participants with FEV1/FVC < 70% (aged >40 years) in Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which were conducted from 2008 to 2011. Body composition were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamine D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were measured. For the criteria for sarcopenia, the recommended criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and of the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) were used. We divided subjects to thee group according to 25 (OH)D level. (Deficiency ≤20 ng/ml, insufficiency 21-29 ng/mL, Sufficiency ≥ 30 ng/ml). In 2012, serum eosinophil, ECP, and TIgE were measured in 3rd and 4th grade students of 5 elementary schools. Skin prick test was performed with 26 aeroallergens commonly found in Korea. The presence of allergic symptoms during past 12 months was checked using questionnaire. In 2014, same study was performed in 5th and 6th grade same students attending same schools. The cut off value and usefulness of serologic markers (serum eosinophil, ECP, and TIgE) were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Referred patients with history of NSAID-induced urticarial, angioedema or anaphylaxis underwent open challenge with (1) putative NSAID to confirm the diagnosis; (2) Aspirin to determine the crossreactivity or (3) selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor to identify the suitable alternative. Data were analysed retrospectively. A retrospective study to explore the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized with asthma was conducted at Department of Child Health, West Nusa Tenggara General Hospital, Mataram, Indonesia. All data about medical history and physical examination we got from pediatric asthma registry. Pediatric asthma registry in pediatric respirology division was started in October 2014, so that we presented the characteristics of children hospitalized with asthma from October 2014 to April 2015. We were also taken the number of children admitted with asthma in our emergency department and outpatient clinic at the same period for additional information. We presented the characteristics of our study subjects by table and chart. We have requested 12 pediatric allergists to review the medical records on asthmatic children who visited their own clinic during the most recent 3 months. Based on the subjects' symptoms, signs and their medications to maintain control, their asthma severities were assessed according to both the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria and the Japanese Pediatric Guidelines for the Treatment and Management of Bronchial Asthma (JPGL) criteria. Results A total of 840 cases (<3 years, 22.2%; 3-6 years, 26.4%; >6 years, 53.3%) were reviewed. Both criteria revealed that about 1/3 of asthmatic children had intermittent asthma whereas only <3% of subjects had severe persistent asthma. The pattern of prescribe controllers varied widely and did not match with asthma severity classification by either GINA or JPGL criteria, which was not confined to those in whom the severity assessed by each criterion was different from each other. This study sought to analyze clinical, histological characteristics of HND patients. Further, as there is a growing number of AD studies focusing on the role of skin microbiome in the disease pathogenesis, microbiome analysis of HND patients in comparison to non-HND (N-HND) AD and normal (NL) subjects was performed. We examined patients who diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea using polysomnography in our sleep clinic. All the patient was examined by allergy skin testing and diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. Patients were group of OSA with AR. We did Allergic rhinitis medical treatment for 2 weeks before OSA treatment. We did the survey of Visual analogue scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Chalder Fatigue Scale, Daily Hassles Scale, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale, Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire before and after Allergic rhinitis treatment. Results OSA-AR group was 14 pateints. Age ranged from 17 to 66 years old and mean age 27. prior treatment, OSA-AR group score was less than average in VAS(sleep time, wake time), ESS, CFS, DHS, CD-RISC, RQLQ examination and TNSS, which associated with rhinitis in RQLQ, showed less than average except nasal obstruction in OSA-AR. VAS (sleep time, wake time) and RQLQ in patients who underwent 2weeks medical treatment showed statistically significant difference after treatment. (sleep time P = 0.001, wake time P = 0.000, RQLQ P=.011) The average scores of ESS, CFS, DHS, CD-RISC, RQLQ, TNSS was lower but no significant difference after treatment than before treatment. We studied 190 patients who were diagnosed with drug hypersensitivity at a tertiary referral hospital and 133 control subjects. We divided the patients into 2 groups; immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction (n=109) and delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (n=81), according to the type of drug hypersensitivity. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of the patients was performed using genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. We analyzed and evaluated for each items from 5 points to 1 point in the order of the heavy degree among five choice answers in based on describe about inhaled drug of the ASK-20 by subjects. We retrospectively analyzed sera from 11 patients who had been examined based on suspicion of allergy at the Department of Dermatology of the Osaka University. Of the 11 patients, 10 patients have symptom such as pruritus or tingling of the lips, oral mucosa, and throat. One patient did not have symptom. ImmunoCAP ISAC was used for screening allergen component and compared with other tests results such as skin prick test. To specigy the antigen, ELISA and western blot and blood testing were also performed. We examined SPT to 147 patients who visited allergy clinic complaining of nasal symptoms from January to December 2014. Three different interpreting methods were used for defining positivity in SPT such as interpretation by comparing wheal sizes of allergen and histamine, the biggest diameter of the wheal size more than 3 mm, and the biggest diameter of the erythema greater than 15 mm. And we compared the positivity among 3 different interpretation methods. The validity of each interpreting method was evaluated by comparing positivity to TNSS. Result Positivity in SPT were reported as 48.2% in A/H ratio method, 64.0% in Wheal size method and in Erythema size method, respectively. Subjects who showed negative result in A/H ratio method have positive results in Wheal size method and Erythema size method were 15.8%, respectively. Subjects showing negative result in A/H ratio but positive result in Erythema size and Wheal size method had significantly higher rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and TNSS than subjects showing both negative results. We sampled 64 patients (32 men and 32 women) who visited our department and took blood test from January 2014 to December 2014. We measured the ratio of eosinophils, the level of non-specific and specific IgE, and so on. In this study, we divided these patients into 4 groups according to the level of non-specific IgE (less than 100 <Group 1>, 100 or more and less than 500 <Group 2>, 500 or more and less than 1000 <Group 3>, more than 1000 <Group 4>). Then we investigated them from several aspects. The cross-sectional study included 2572 healthy adult without any respiratory illness and non communicable diseases. Smoking and other information were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Lung function test was performed by spirometer and cutoff point derived from GOLD guideline. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. 6.57, p=0 .0352] were associated with smokers reference to non-smokers. The cDNA encoding mature Blo t 7 was amplified from B. tropicalis total cDNA template using specific primers derived from the allergen mRNA sequence (GenBank accession number AAQ24545.1). The cDNA was subsequently cloned into the pPicZα A P.pastoris expression vector, downstream to the a mating factor leader sequence for protein secretion. P. pastoris KM71H cells were transformed with linearized recombinant pPicZα A-Blo t7 plasmid by electroporation. rBlo t 7 expression was subsequently assayed in zeocin-resistance colonies following methanol induction. The recombinant allergen was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatographies. In this study six different batches of micro-woven (MWC) and nonwoven polyester polyamide (NWP) textiles went through the quality control processes required by the norm ISO 13485. Upon reception, textiles pore sizes were measured using an optical microscope (Bresser, USA). Textile permeability was then tested using a Rotomitest, apparatus composed of two compartments separated by the sample. Der p1 allergens were placed in compartment 1 and the apparatus was set to rotate for 18 hours. Der p1 allergens that passed through the sample to compartment 2 were then measured with a Der p1 ELISA kit (Citeq Biologics, Netherlands). Values, expressed as mean +/-SEM, were compared using two-way ANOVA. The study was carried out in the years 2011-2013 All children attending 3 grade at grammar schools (8-9 ys of age) (Wrocław, Poland) entered the study. Those with prior diagnosis of asthma ana allergy or being under allergists care were excluded. During the first part all parents were educated on the allergy symptoms and prevention. They were given a specially prepared screening questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions concerning family history, early exposure of their children to different allergens etc., children's medical history: infections, symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, runny nose, rash), hospitalizations etc. During the second part all children who scored above a fixed level in the questionnaire were subjected to allergist's check-up (including prick-tests and spirometry) to confirm or deny the possible diagnosis of asthma or allergy. The nationwide representative survey was conducted with 1820 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years in Korea. The information of atopic dermatitis was collected by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Urine monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP) and mono- (2ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) were measured. All phthalate metabolites were adjusted with urine creatinine. The subjects, who were overweight or obese, were defined that body mass index was between 85 and 95 percentile or over 95 percentile of age and gender, respectively. Clinical and demographic data on 1843 asthmatics registered in an asthma cohort in Korea were analyzed retrospectively. They were ethnic Koreans. Asthma was diagnosed by physicians on the basis of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Among them, 632 subjects, who were regularly followed up for longer than 1 year, were included for the analysis after excluding current smokers and exsmokers of 10 pack year or more. At the baseline visit, demographic information such as enrollment age, sex, BMI, asthma onset age, asthma duration, and smoking amount was collected. Uniform cluster analysis method was applied to each population using two-tiered approach, including hierarchical cluster analysis and K-mean cluster analysis. Medical records of 44 children who underwent CM OFC, from January 2013 to March 2015 at Ajou University Hospital, were reviewed. Data were analyzed to determine the relationship between OFC outcome and clinical parameters, including specific IgE (sIgE) levels to milk and casein measured before OFC. Following ISAAC Study procedures, parents of children aged 6-7 years, living in San Francisco, Argentina , and surrounding rural areas were asked about symptoms of asthma, maternal smoking in the child's first year of life and current maternal and paternal smoking Results A total of 1315 urban and 572 rural children were studied Maternal and paternal smoking was associated with an increased risk of asthma, although the magnitude of the ORs is higher in the rural setting There was a strong interaction between maternal and paternal smoking. The study included 62 adult patients diagnosed with asthma. At the first visit, patients underwent pulmonary function testing, skin prick testing with panel of aeroallergens, and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured. Asthma Control Test (ACT) questionnaires were administered and records were obtained regarding number of visits to a medical centre for respiratory tract infections for the previous year. Subsequently, patients with vitamin D deficiency received 2000 I.U. vitamin D3 daily for 6 months (from October to March). At the end of that period, all patients were reassessed. Within open prospective research effectiveness and tolerance of SLIT course, maintained using up-to-date tableted allergen extract, produced in Kazakhstan was analyzed among 30 patients aged 18 to 40, suffering from allergic rhinitis (3 to 10 years) and herpetic infection (HSV and/or ÑMV). Among SLIT effectiveness criteria: VASvisual analog scale, SMS -symptom medication score, patients' adherence to treatment continuation. Laboratory effectiveness evaluation was conducted using profile cytokine evaluation (immunoenzyme method, proinflammatory -α-TNFtumor necrosis factor, IL-8, γ -INF, antiphlogistic -IL-4 of serum and local fractions. Material for studyblood serum, taken fasting from ulnar vein and nasal lavage. The study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research of Chiba University. Preliminary microarray analysis revealed the dysregulation of several miRNAs including hsa-miR-185-5p. The samples used in this study were from the birth cohort samples consisting of cord blood, 1-year and 2-year samples. The samples were categorized according to wheezing status and allergen-specific IgE levels at 2 years. Children with more than 3 episodes of wheezing during the preceding 12 months were considered "wheezers", while those without were "non-wheezers". MiRNAs were extracted from the serum of birth cohort samples using a commercial column-based kit. The hsa-miR-185-5p levels were quantified using real-time PCR. Ce_miR-39_1 was used as the spike-in-control and the difference in expression level of the hsa-miR-185-5p and Ce_miR-39_1 was used as the cycle threshold (ΔCt). The data was analyzed using nonparametric tests on GraphPad Prism version 6.0. In the study concerned, Forty peanut-allergic children (mean age 10 years) had oral allergen preparation. This was administered with serial rising titers and dosing at about 2 weekly to 850 mg peanut protein. There was maintenance of 28 weeks. RESULTS All children had positive challenges. Of the total, 30 had tolerated the rising concentration of the titer. 2 of the total then dropped out, while 4 out of the total had tolerated the rising concentration of the allergenic material containing 250mg -500 mg. Some 30 out of 40 tolerated higher dosing and maintenance at 850 mg protein/day. Two had some severe degree of allergenic reaction mandating the administration of adrenaline, whereas the rest had mild allergic reaction that subsided without resorting to adrenaline solution. Twelve with pre-immunotherapy peanut IgE over 28.3 kU/L required no dose adjustment compared with 7 with pre-immunotherapy peanut IgE level almost 27. kU/L. Eighteen of the 40 mandated a slight dose reduction as the reactions possibly linked to factors, such as exertion, infection and fatigue ability. However after 7 weeks, 25 out of 40 individuals had no reaction to a 2.7 g protein challenge. CONCLUSIONS This study with serial dilution and dose increments has been followed with better outcome than the former trials. A higher fold such as 1000 and over in the amount of peanuts is tolerated with excellent safety profiles. Except a few cases there was no serious adverse effects observed in the rest of individuals. We collected the airborne pollen from 10 representative sites in Korea using 7 days-Burkard sampler during 2011-2014 from February to May; Seoul, Guri, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Gangneung, Jeonju, Gwangju, and Jeju. Airborne pollen grains were counted and identified by using Light Microscope (x 200, x 400) after stained with Calberla's fuchsin dye. To overcome the Hook effect, we devised an innovative rapid kit which has a unique competition method as well as a classical sandwich method in a single kit. In this study, test line 1 was prepared with mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG or anti-human IgE like classical rapid kits. Test line 2, a competitive line, which was coated with human IgG or human IgE, was designed to improve the false negative result due to the Hook effect. The control line was prepared with goat anti-mouse IgG. Goat anti-human IgG antibody and mouse IgG conjugated with gold nanoparticles were prepared in our laboratory and placed in the conjugate pad for further test. A 54 year old man presented with a diffuse pruritic rash for 2 years. Physical examination revealed multiple discrete and confluent erythematous macules and plaques on the trunk, back, and all extremities. Laboratory findings showed extremely elevated IgE levels, 64285 IU/ML, absolute eosinophils 5,400 cells/μl, and a normal tryptase. Multiple skin biopsies showed non-specific dermatitis. Bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics and imaging studies were unremarkable. The patient was evaluated by Dermatology and Hematology/ Oncology, but no specific diagnosis was given. The patient denied a history of recurrent infections, skin abscesses, hyperextensible joints, bone fracture, or scoliosis. The patient had failed multiple systemic and topical medications, but improved with prednisone. In this study, side effects of allergy shots has compared in patients under and over 19 years. All patients got their shots on standard schedule (every week or every month) and stay at the office for about 20 minutes every time after get shot. In patients with late onset reactions to shots prospectus did by telephone. The immune status was evaluated and retrospective data analysis was performed of 17 DM1 patients. Standard screening comprised a questionnaire about (recurrent) infections, frequent use of antibiotics and hospital stays due to infections. Standard laboratory tests comprised serum IgA, IgM, IgG and IgG subclasses, NK, B and T cell counts, granulocyte, leucocyte and monocyte counts by FACS analysis. Also a vaccination response test was performed. Total 21 patients older than 60 years old with AR sensitized to HDM with A/H ratio of >3 on skin prick test and/or >0.35IU/L in Immuno-CAP to D.farinae and D.pteronyssinus were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized to either medication group with LAIS® Mites Sublingual tablets (2/week) or observation group using a double-blind method in their first visit and their symptoms and adverse reactions were monitored for 3 months. In this study, 85 primary school students' parents leaving in a lowincome district of Ankara were included. A questionnaire prepared 38 questions about symptoms and a trigger of asthma based on ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) was applied to the parents. P value was 0.05. Results Primary school students' mean age was 9.1±0.9 year (min-max 7-11). Wheezing attack was recognized by parents in 10 of 85 children (11.7%). 9of 85 children (10.5%) were diagnosed as asthma by a medical doctor previously. 55 of 85 children (64.7%) had at least one smoker in their house. 14 of 85 parents (16.7%) defined humidity and 15 of them (17.6%) defined mold in their house.
