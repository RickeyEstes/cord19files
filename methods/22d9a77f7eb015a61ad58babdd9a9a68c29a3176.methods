Both quantitative and qualitative data were used for the study. Quantitative data were derived from questionnaire administration among 150 residents of the study community through purposive sampling. Respondents targeted for interview included those in households located close to bats' roosts and individuals who through their daily activities such as farming, trading, recreation, and relaxation get exposed to bats either directly or indirectly. Most of these individuals were identified through snowball sampling where study subjects helped in the identification of other subjects. Respondents ranged in age between 18 females and 41% males. The questions posed to respondents centred mostly on activities that brought residents close to bats and whether or not respondents experience fevers and other strange diseases as a result of this exposure. Participatory appraisal approach [34] was employed to solicit information on community perceptions of human-bat interactions and whether or not there were any health related issues as a result of such interactions. The approach involved participatory mapping, interviews, a transect walk, and focus group discussions (FGDs). A total of 13 elders and opinion leaders, ranging in age from 35 to 75 years, participated in the mapping exercise. The selection was done with the help of the Assemblyman for the area, who had a fair knowledge of individual competences. The exercise was informative and served also as a guide in determining the proximity of bats' roosts to residential areas and the selection of households for questionnaire administration. It also helped the research team to design a transect line to facilitate the transect walk that was undertaken following the mapping exercise. A six-member team including one principal investigator undertook a transect walk from one end of town to the other ( Figure 2 ). The walk was to identify the roosting and feeding sites of bats, the proximity of residential areas to these sites, and whether or not residents were exposed directly or indirectly to bats. During the walk, major landmarks ca. 50-75 m astride the transect line were noted. The exercise presented a further opportunity for the selection of households and other target groups for interview. A total of 18 E. gambianus roosts and 19 feeding sites were observed along the transect line. In addition, three focus group discussions were conducted separately for men, women, and opinion leaders of the town. Focus group discussions are a specific technique that uses the services of a facilitator to moderate a small group discussion. Each focus group discussion involved between eight (8) to 12 participants. A total of 35 people comprising 15 men and 20 women participated in the focus group discussions. The selection of participants followed a similar process as what was used in participatory mapping. Participants were between the ages of 25 and 76 and were made up of residents who had lived in the town for more than 15 years. The discussions were led by a facilitator and centred on the occurrence of bats in the town, local perceptions and attitudes towards bats, and perceived risk of disease spillover from bats to humans. On-site observation took the form of visits to (i) bats' roosting sites to ascertain the means by which human and bats interact; (ii) the outskirts of town to determine the occurrence of bats outside households where there was less protection; (iii) local market centre to investigate whether or not bat meat was sold; (iv) public places including the chief 's compound and premises of basic schools where trees colonized by bats provided shade. Journal of Environmental and Public Health 5 In all the places visited, informal interviews were held randomly with residents to understand human-bats interaction. On-site observation involved also the identification of trees in which bats roost and fruit trees that they feed on within the township. The researchers' own experience and local people's knowledge of native trees helped in the identification of the trees. The study also solicited information from health facilities on types of common disease prevalent in the area. The research team had access to information on the top 20 cases that accounted for out-patient morbidity for the Afadjato North District and monthly out-patients morbidity returns for selected months from 2012 to 2014 from the District Health Directorate and the Ve Golokuati Health Centre, respectively. There was a follow-up visit to the study area in April 2015, after the outbreak of Ebola virus in parts of West Africa. During this visit, 27 community members including the chief and elders of the town were engaged in a village square discussion [35] to find out about their perceptions and relationship with bats after the Ebola outbreak. Data analysis used descriptive statistical tools such as statistical tables, graphs, and percentages to describe how the various variables relate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between experience of fevers and closeness of respondent's activity to bats.
