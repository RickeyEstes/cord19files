Materials synthesis. In this study, Phellodendron chinense powder (40 g) was extracted by using 1 L diethyl ether in nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours under reflux. Then, the supernatant was collected and evaporated to dry in rotary evaporators to obtain the diethyl ether extract, named Phellodendron phosphor. Figure 1(a) shows the schematic of the extracted device for Phellodendron phosphor. Phellodendron chinense powder was purchased from the Sheng Chang pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Technology. Diethyl ether (HCOOH, >98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). For the W-LED fabrication, 0.1 g phosphor were mixed with 0.1 g thermal-curable silicone resin (OE-6636A) under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, silicone resin (OE-6551B, 0.1 g) was added to form a paste. The procedure of LED packing by LED dispenser is shown in Fig. S1 . W-LEDs were fabricated by dispensing the phosphor containing paste onto the InGaN-based blue-LED chip (ES-CEBLV10R). In this paper, W-LEDs device we used could be divided into three types: LED (1): Blue chip (455~460 nm) + YAG (0.1 g, UC-521B); LED (2): Blue chip (455~460 nm) + YAG phosphor (0.1 g, UC-521B) + Phellodendron phosphor (0.01 g) and LED (3): Blue chip (455~460 nm) + YAG phosphor (0.1 g, UC-521B) + CaAlSiN 3 :Eu 2+ phosphor (0.00475 g, CN-NR630). Figure 1 (b) exhibits the illustration of w-LEDs packaged for LEDs and all conditions were packaged with 15 iterations each. Characterization methods. The photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were measured using Horiba Jobin-Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrometer equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp as the excitation source. All the spectra were measured with a scan rate of 150 nm min −1 . 1 H NMR spectra were measured in methanol-d 4 ( > 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. For each sample, 100 scans were recorded with the following parameters: 0.183 Hz/point with spectra width of 6009 Hz. The pulse width and relaxation delay are 4 s and 1.5 s, respectively. For quantitative analysis, peak area was integrated for each peak selected manually. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were collected using a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm −1 . The optical absorption spectra of the samples were carried out with an UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900, Japan) in the range of 200-800 nm. Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of the samples were measured using a Laiko DT-101 color analyzer equipped with a CCD detector (Laiko Co., Tokyo, Japan). A pulsed laser with a wavelength of 260 nm, a repetition frequency of 20 MHz, and a duration of 250 fs was used as the excitation source for time-resolved PL studies. The collected luminescence was dispersed by a 0.75 m spectrometer and detected with the photomultiplier tube. Time-resolved PL were performed using the technique of time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). The steady-state and time-resolved PL was measured at room temperature. The time resolution for the time-resolved PL instrument is pico-second.
