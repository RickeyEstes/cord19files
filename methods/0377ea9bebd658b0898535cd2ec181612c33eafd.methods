Velocity prediction accuracy Entrainment ratio prediction accuracy good accuracy, and they were much less time consuming than the prediction with the CFD method. In comparison with the empirical equations, the virtual origin model was simpler in expression, whereas the empirical equations provided better centerline velocity prediction in the developing region. However, the CFD method was able to provide more comprehensive flow characteristics such as pressure and turbulence intensity in the flow field, which neither the empirical equations nor the virtual origin model were able to predict. (4) Entrainment ratios predicted by the three modeling methods in the developed region agreed well with one another. The results showed that when the gasper was turned on, more than 90% of the air in the passenger's breathing zone was entrained from the surroundings. Thus, a gasper-induced jet has only a very minor impact on the air quality in a passenger's breathing zone.
