As part of an ongoing epidemiological investigation of respiratory viruses at The Children's Hospital, Aurora, CO affiliated with the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine (UCDSOM), we had archived at −70 • C nasopharyngeal washes (NPWs) that tested negative for influenza viruses A and B (FLUAV and FLUBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 (HPIV-1, -2, -3), and adenovirus (HAdV) by virus culture and direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). Forty-four such specimens (mean age ± standard deviation (S.D.) 40.1 ± 33.4 months, 52% male, mean day of illness that specimens were collected 5.2 ± 4.5 days) obtained from pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms that had previously served as age-and season-matched controls in a study of coronavirus prevalence in Kawasaki disease 9 were analyzed. Use of specimens and clinical data was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. Samples were prepared and analyzed by MassTag-PCR, 6,7 using primers that targeted FLUAV, FLUBV, RSV-A, RSV-B, human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E; HPIV 1-4; human metapneumovirus (HMPV); and human enteroviruses (HEV) and human rhinoviruses (HRV). 6 Because a MassTag panel that includes human bocavirus (HBoV) primers is still in development, we also analyzed all samples by singleplex RT-PCR for HBoV. 10 The degenerate HEV/HRV primer pair used in MassTag-PCR targets conserved motifs of the 5 -untranslated region present in both HEV and HRV. 6 Samples positive for HEV/HRV by MassTag-PCR were therefore amplified for sequencing and genotyping by nested RT-PCR using degenerate primers that target the VP4/2 coding region. 11 Duplicate aliquots of all specimens transferred to Columbia University (CU) for analysis were kept at UCDSOM for conventional RT-PCR and sequencing, which independently confirmed MassTag-PCR results. Medical chart review was done to correlate clinical syndromes with the specimens analyzed.
