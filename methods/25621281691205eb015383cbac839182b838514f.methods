Cell culture. Wild type A549 human cells from lung carcinoma (ATCC ® CCL-185 ™ ), A549 cells stably overexpressing MxA (A549-MxA), A549 cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA targeting MxA (A549-shMxA) 16 (kindly provided by Richard E. Randall, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK), and A549 cells stably expressing streptavidin-tagged MxA (A549-Strep-MxA) or streptavidin-tagged GFP (A549-Strep-GFP) were generated as described below and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM medium with FBS (10%) and penicillin-streptomycin (1%). Canine MDCKII cells used for virus titration were cultured under the same conditions. Viruses. The recombinant H5N1 virus (A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004) was generated as described previously 9 . The H7N7 (A/seal/Massachusetts/1/1980) Renilla luciferase reporter virus harboring a multibasic HA cleavage site was obtained as published by Reuther and colleagues 23 . Briefly, the splice donor and splice acceptor sites in the NS gene-encoding sequence were silenced. The overlapping NS1 and the NEP open reading frames were separated and the Renilla luciferase-encoding sequence was introduced in between. To obtain 3 separated gene products porcine teschovirus-1 2A peptide-encoding sequences were introduced in between the 3 ORFs (for a more detailed description also see Fig. S1a ). The same procedure was applied to generate the H5N1 (A/ Vietnam/1203/2004) Renilla luciferase virus. However, in this case a virus encoding a monobasic HA cleavage site was generated by altering the cleavage site as described previously 24, 25 . All recombinant viruses were plaque purified on MDCKII cells. Virus stocks were either prepared on MDCKII cells or in 8 days old embryonated chicken eggs and titers were determined by plaque assay. siRNA screen. A primary genome-wide screen assessing the role of 18119 genes was performed using siRNA pools of 4 siRNAs transfected into A549-MxA. A non-targeting siRNA (GE Dharmacon D-001810-10) and an MxA-targeting siRNA (Qiagen SI05459538) served as negative and positive control, respectively. The cells were seeded in 384-well plates (2800 cells/well) and reverse transfected with siRNAs (final concentration 10 nM) using DharmaFECT4 transfection reagent (0.125 µL/well). Each 384-well plate was run in triplicate. After 72 hours, the cells were infected with the H5N1 Renilla luciferase reporter virus at an MOI of 8 for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was analyzed by adding Renilla luciferase substrate (5 µl, Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and read using the Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). A secondary screen was performed on 276 genes by individually transfecting the 4 siRNAs from the pool used in the primary screen. The rest of the procedure was performed as described above. The siRNAs library plates were provided by GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc. (human siGENOME SMARTpool library G-005005) and siRNAs were resuspended at a concentration of 2 μM. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 20 min. 50 µL of cleared supernatant was retained as an 'Input' sample. The remaining 950 µL was added to 550 µL IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) containing 20 µL equivalent bead volume of Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences). Affinity tag binding proceeded with rotation at 4 °C for 2 hours. Beads were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 minutes. 50 µL of cleared supernatant was retained as an 'Unbound Flow Through' sample, and the remaining supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed twice in IP buffer containing 0.05% NP-40 and twice in IP buffer with no detergent. Streptactin-purified proteins were reduced and alkylated on beads with 20 µL reduction-alkylation buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 2 M Urea, 1 mM DTT, 3 mM iodoacetamide] and incubated in the dark for 45 minutes with gentle shaking. An additional 3 mM DTT was added to quench the reaction, and proteins were digested with 0.75 µg trypsin (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the beads were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 minutes. The peptide-containing supernatant was collected and formic acid was added to a final concentration of 1% to acidify the peptides. Peptides were desalted using Agilent OMIX C18 10 µL tips according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Briefly, tips were conditioned with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and then equilibrated by two rinses with 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were bound by repeated pipetting, rinsed twice in 0.1% formic acid, and eluted in 50% acetonitrile. A second elution in 90% acetonitrile was used to ensure complete recovery. Peptides were dried under vacuum centrifugation and suspended in 12 µL of 3.0% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.
