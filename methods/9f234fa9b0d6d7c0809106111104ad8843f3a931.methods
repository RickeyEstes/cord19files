Hospital Traffic Data. We obtained archived high resolution satellite imagery (average resolution of about 70 cm) data of hospital parking lots from Remote Sensing Metrics (RS Metrics), a company that performs quantitative analysis on highresolution satellite imagery data for various applications 31 . RS Metrics constructed a comprehensive list of hospitals and other healthcare institutions with parking lots for each country (Mexico, Chile and Argentina) using online hospital lists, hospital ranking lists, Google Earth/Google Maps, and Bing Maps. This resulted in a comprehensive list of approximately 120 hospitals and health care facilities for each of the countries (see Supplementary Table 1) . Supplementary Table 1 includes information on type of health facility (hospital or other), health care provider (private or government), location (rural or urban), number of beds (if available) and hospital ranking (if available). Upon initial analysis (not presented), we limited the hospital list to: (i) non-specialty (or general care) hospitals and eliminated specialty hospitals (such as psychiatric hospitals, and surgical clinics) and research centers based on information provided on each hospital (or health entity) website; (ii) hospitals with more than forty parking spaces to increase the chance of detecting significant anomalies in hospital traffic. For each hospital, RS Metrics performed automated data extraction by first delineating hospital premises, parking lot borders and street parking in different colors as shown in Figure 1A . Images with tree cover, building shadow (e.g., Figure 1B ), construction and other factors that present difficulties in defining the contours were excluded since this could lead to over-or under-counting of the number of vehicles. After delineation, the company used a standard approach for processing images for all clients. This involved a combination of Automated Feature Extraction (AFE) software, manual counting and quality control, and workflow management software to count the number of cars and parking spaces. Please note that the process of data analysis was independent of the image selection process. The dataset used in analysis consisted of the date and time of each image; the hospital's name and geographic location (including the address, latitude, and latitude); the numbers of vehicles in the parking lot, on the street, and along the hospital border; the number of parking lot spaces and the occupancy or fill rate Weather Data. In addition to disease, weather, social unrest and natural disasters are other factors that could influence hospital traffic. We obtained temperature, absolute humidity and precipitation data from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). The data was extracted in GRIB format from http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ at a one-degree latitude/longitude resolution for each of the countries -Chile, Mexico and Argentina. These weather covariates were selected because they can influence decisions on car usage and studies have shown associations between absolute humidity and onset of influenza epidemics 32, 33 . Each of the meteorological covariates was averaged at a weekly level and time-series were constructed from January 2010 to May 2013. Civil Unrest and Natural Disasters. The civil unrest data was extracted from openly available data sources (e.g., government reports, social media (such as Twitter) and newspaper reports). The dataset had been used by Doyle et al. 34 in a project aimed at producing real-time detailed forecasts of future events. The civil unrest events included planned protests and riots. Due to the scope of project reported in Doyle et al. 34 the data was limited to November 2012 to May 2013. We used Pearson correlation to evaluate any associations between frequency of civil unrest reports and trends in hospital traffic. Natural disasters may include earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and fires. Although the exact time and location of an earthquake or hurricane landfall may be precisely determined, definition of the duration and scope of impact is more challenging. To evaluate potential associations between natural disasters and the hospital traffic data, we selected three major natural disasters for Mexico and assessed differences in mean hospital parking lot occupancy four weeks before, during and immediately following the event using the Two Sample Welch T-test. We focused on Mexico since it had the largest data sample. Multivariable Regression Model. We developed multivariable linear regression models to estimate and predict weekly percent ILI for Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Hospital occupancy reflected by each of the variables (fill rate, number of vehicles in the parking lot, on the street, and along the hospital border) for each hospital is represented as a single explanatory variable x i . PAHO percent of hospital/clinic visits with ILI (hereafter referred to as percent ILI) is the dependent variable y, a i are the coefficients and the normally distributed error term is given by e. The number of variables n varies since the number of hospitals varies by country. We used the Elastic Net regularization and variable selection method 35 to select the hospital variables that best captured the trend in the ILI data. The elastic net estimator is given by: The elastic net combines the properties of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Ridge regression procedures. When a equals to 0 and 1, (2) equates to the Ridge and LASSO estimators respectively. The LASSO procedure minimizes the sum of squared errors subject to a bound on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients 36 . Ridge regression has a grouping effect, whereby it tends to select all correlated variables. The elastic net combines these two properties such that it tends to select and average the coefficients of highly correlated predictors if any of the variables within the group is selected. The procedure performs well for studies were the number of covariates is greater than the number of observations (p ? n). In such a situation, the number of selected variables can be greater than the number of observations. We make use of this property by fitting models to different sample sizes as later discussed. Correlations between hospital variables differed by country, which could require different values for a. Models for all three countries were fit with a at 0.8 after exploring values between 0.5 and 0.9. At each data observation (i.e., each week), each of the model coefficients are updated so as to continuously select a subset of variables that provides the best model fit. This results in a diversity of hospital variables used in the model at each week. The model selected by elastic net for each week was used in one and two step-ahead predictions of the weekly percent ILI. Since the data was extracted from a historical archive and not based on targeting satellites to specific locations, and due to the elimination of images deemed unsuitable, the data had some missing observations. These missing observations were filled using the last known value. To improve the prediction and reduce the impact of noise in our models, we fitted models using a range of previous values (henceforth referred to as recency). We defined recency as the most prior weeks of data given by n 2 t to n, where t is the recency value and n is the current week. This can be illustrated as follows. Let recency equals to t and S represent the complete training set: Then the recency sample is defined as: S t~Xn{t , y n{t ð Þ , Á Á Á , X n , y n ð Þ f g ð4Þ We considered a range of small and large recency values. Given that we expect recent changes in parking lot usage to correlate with recent changes in disease activity, we selected values that were between 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks so the number of observations for each covariate was at least five. We later assessed whether similar observations could be made if the analysis focused on the last three, six and twelve months of data. For consistency, across all recency values, the initial model was fitted starting from the third week in 2011 and the model fits and predictions were compared based on the normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The first set of models solely used hospital parking lot occupancy variables as covariates. The second set of models considered both the hospital parking lot data and meteorological covariates. Model parameters were estimated using a ten-fold cross validation approach and the models were implemented using the glmnet package in the R statistical software.
