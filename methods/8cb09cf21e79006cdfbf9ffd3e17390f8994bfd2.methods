This was a laboratory experimental study. Curcumin (1,7-bis (4'hidroksi -3 methoxyphenyl)-1,6 heptadien, 3,5-dione) used Sigma brand, whereas curcumin analogue compound (PGV-0 or 2,5-bis-(4-hydroxy-3metoksibenzilidin) cyclopentanone) was obtained from synthesis results in the pharmaceutical laboratory of UGM. Five mg of each compound was dissolved in 100 Î¼l dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as stock solution. Cytotoxic test were carried out using the MTT [3 -(4,5-dimetiltiazol-2-i1) -2,5 difeniltetrazolium bromide]. Cells at a density of 10 4 vero cells / wells distributed in wells (well plate) and incubated for 24 hours. Followed by the addition of curcumin and PGV-0 with 7 (seven) concentration series of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625 and 0.78125 ppm respectively -each of 4 replications. Solvent used to dissolve the test compound is dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The cytotoxicity test results read by Elisa reader with a wavelength of 595 nm.
