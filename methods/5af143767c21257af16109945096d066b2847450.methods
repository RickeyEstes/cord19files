Exposure slattern. Rats were exposed to 60-Hz electric fields on systems consisting of five parallel-plate electrodes. The metal plates were rectangular and electrically insulated from one another. When energized, they provided uniform (+5%), vertical. 60-Hz electric fields at the strengths utilized in this experiment. Four such exposure systems (racks), electrically isolated from each other, were located within one room. Four tiers of rat cages were provided on each system: each tier contained eight polycarbonate modules, each with six individual rat cages (12.5 cm wide, 25.0 cm long. 10 cm high). During parturition and litter-rearing, rats were housed in modules divided into three compartments, so that the cages were then twice as large as the standard cages. Floors of the cages were made of wire mesh and were an integral part of the lower electrode so that rats were in electrical contact with the reference ground. A small amount of Antron III (a conductive carpet material from E. I. DuPont Co.) was placed in the cages during the period in which litters were delivered and reared. The exposure system design minimizes sources of phenomena associated with electric fields of intensities used in this experiment (Dietrich and Patterson, 1988) . Current conduction, transient charge, and transient energy through the water system to a rat while drinking were tested, and values were below known levels of perception. Electrode voltages and spacing were such that flashover from rats within cages did not occur. Corona, as detected by radio noise, was not present. Harmonic distortions of input voltages were less than 0.5%. Cage floor vibration velocity was less than 0.5 mm/set measured at the voltages used in this study. Rats were exposed to one of four field strengths (0, 10. 65, 130 kV/ m) for 19 hr daily, 7 days per week. Animals and their respective exposure regimens were rotated weekly from one system to another to limit the potential effect of rack location within the room on rat growth and development. Personnel performing animal care, manipula- The experiment was conducted using Charles River (Sprague-Dawley-derived) rats obtained from the Raleigh, North Carolina, facility. Approximately 400 female and 100 male rats were received at 7 weeks of age and were group-housed in standard wirebottom cages for 4 weeks of quarantine and acclimation. Midway through the acclimation period, five females and five males were randomly selected for evaluation of health status. Gross necropsy and examination of histologic sections from major organs did not disclose any unusual lesions. Cultures of nasopharynx, lung, and cecum for bacterial pathogens were also negative. Serum was tested and found not to contain antibodies to Sendai virus. H-l virus, rat coronavirus (RCV/SDA). or Mycoplasma pulmonis. All female rats were identified by ear tattoo and weighed. Animal rooms were illuminated on a 14-hr light, lo-hr dark cycle (lights on from 1000 hr to 2400 hr). Cage board beneath the cages was changed daily. Room temperature and relative humidity were recorded continuously: the ranges were 69-75Â°F and 30-60s RH. respectively. Food and water were provided ad Libitum to all animals at all times. For breeding, male rats were individually housed in standard hanging wire cages, and two females were placed with each male overnight. Following a breeding session, females were vaginally lavaged with physiological saline. and smears were prepared and examined for presence of sperm. Those animals found to be positive were weighed and randomly assigned (blocking on weight) into four groups, and exposure was begun on the day of mating. Experimental pmtocoi. As indicated, the four treatment groups, each on an individual system, were shamexposed or exposed to 60-Hz electric fields of 10, 65, or 130 kV/m. The experimental design of the study is outlined in Fig. I . In each group, 68 females were mated and started on exposure over a period of IO consecutive days. These females were designated as "F, pregnancy." They were allowed to complete gestation. deliver, and rear their offspring (the F, generation) through weaning. Rats that had copulated but had not delivered by 2 days after the expected delivery date (i.e., 24 days after coitus) were killed. and their absence of pregnancy and associated ovarian status were evaluated. The F, pups were sexed, counted, and weighed as a litter (by sex) at 1 and 4 days of age. Litters were randomly reduced to a maximum of eight offspring (six females and two males, when possible) at 4 days of age and maintained with their dams until weaning at 21 days of age. Dams and offspring were weighed individually at 7. 14, and 2 1 days after birth. At weaning, two F, female offspring were randomly selected from each Litter for continued exposure. These F, females were identified by ear tattoo, individually caged, and weighed at 4,7. and 1 I weeks of age. (The F,, dams, F, males, and other excess F, female offspring did not continue in this experiment.) Ten Fo dams, selected at random, were sampled to determine health status in the same manner as for the original health screening: no evidence of health problems was detected. For the breeding of the F, females. a new group of males was obtained from Charles River Laboratories. They underwent quarantine and health screening as described for the initial shipment of animals. When the F, females were 3 months of age, two females from different treatment groups were placed with one male for the last 2 hr of the daily dark period. During the dark period. movement of animals to breeding cages by technicians was facilitated with low-intensity red-light illumination. After the 2-hr period, females were examined for the presence of sperm. All females were then returned to their respective exposure systems, and exposures continued until the day of termination. The day on which sperm was detected was designated 0 dg. Mating procedures were repeated for up to 8 consec-utive days for females in which sperm was not detected. Females that were determined to have mated were not returned to maies. After the breeding phase of the experiment was completed, females in which sperm was not detected were euthanized ( 13 days after the last day of possible mating), and their pregnancy status was determined (Salewski, 1964) . Body weight was recorded at 0, 7, 15, and 20 days of gestation (dg). Animals were killed at 20 dg for teratological evaluations. Teratologic evaluatiun: maternal and&al examination. Females that mated were killed on 20 dg with carbon dioxide. Their body cavities were opened, and the uterus. ovaries, and abdominal and thoracic viscera were examined visually. Corpora lutea were counted, and maternal liver and uterus were weighed. Uteri were externally examined for hemorrhage, removed from the peritoneal cavity. and incised 1ongitudinalIy to expose their contents. All live and dead fetuses and resorption sites were recorded. Apparently nongravid uteri were dissected and placed in a 10% ammonium sulfide solution to detect possible implantation sites (Salewski. 1964 ). Live fetuses were individually weighed as were their placentas. Each fetus was examined for external malformations. Half the live fetuses in each litter were then decapitated, and their heads were fixed in Bouin's solution for examination of craniofacial structures by a modification of the sectioning methods described by Wilson (1965) . All fetuses in each litter were examined for thoracic and abdominal visceral abnormalities by a modification of the methods described by Staples (1974) and sexes were determined by internal examination. The fetuses were eviscerated and fixed in ethanol, and skeletons were stained with alizarin red S (Staples and Schnell, 1964) for examination. Statistical methods. Sample size determination for this study was based on an assumed angular dose-response model. The model was 2 arcsin 1/7; = 0.45 1 + 0.00296Fi where Pi is the proportion oflitters with one or more malformed fetuses at field strength F, kV/m. The intercept and slope estimates were calculated from results of previous studies where P, was approximately 0.05 at 0 kV/m and 0.10 at 65 kV/m. If this model were valid, then for this study the predicted proportion of litters with one or more malformed fetuses would be approximately 0.05 at 0 kV/m. 0.057 at 10 kV/m. 0.10 at 65 kV/m, and 0.168 at 130 kV/m. Data from continuous-type variables were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), utilizing the general linear model (GLM) procedure from the Statistical Analysis System (SAS. 1985) . Repeated measures. such as maternal weight measurements, were analyzed by repeatedmeasures ANOVA. Fetal body weights, with the litter as the experimental unit, were analyzed by nested ANOVA, which takes into account effects of treatment, litter, and sex. Data calculated as a response proportion, e.g., proportion of implants resorbed, were analyzed by ANOVA after arcsin transformation of the proportion (Freeman and Tukey, 1950) . When significant treatment effects were detected by ANOVA, intergroup differences were delineated utilizing Tukey's multiple comparison test (Tukey, 1953; Kramer, 1956) . Orthogonal contrasts were used to test for a trend in the response with increased exposure intensity. Results that differed at the p < 0.05 level were considered to be statistically significant. Rates of rat breeding per group were analyzed by an actuarial life-table method (Culter and Ederer, 1958) . The response criterion was the day an animal mated. Response curves were tested by a generalized Wilcoxon test (Breslow. 1970 ) to determine differences among groups. Data from binary-response-type variables (e.g., number of pregnant females, number of malformed fetuses, number of litters with malformed fetuses) were evaluated by x2 test. When the x2 test was significant, pairwise comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test (Siegel, 1956) . The Cochran-Armitage test was conducted to test for linear trend of response with increased field strength (Cochran, 1954 : Armitage, 1955 . The P4F program of BMDP Statistical Software (Dixon, 1983) was used for tests of binary response data.
