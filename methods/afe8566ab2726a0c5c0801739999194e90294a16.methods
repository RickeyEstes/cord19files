A prospective cohort of 263 children at high risk of atopy (at least 1 parent with a doctor-diagnosed history of hay fever, asthma, or eczema) were recruited prenatally into this birth cohort as previously described. 21 Parents kept a daily symptom diary and recorded the presence of symptoms of ARI, such as runny/blocked nose, cough, and wheeze as well as presence of fever (>388C). If their child developed any of these symptoms, the study center was contacted within 24 hours and a home visit was arranged (within 48 hours) to collect a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) sample. The method of collection of the NPA samples is included in the electronic repository. Detailed information about each episode of ARI, such as duration of fever, runny nose, cough, or wheeze, was obtained at the home visit and further obtained by follow-up telephone calls every 2 weeks until resolution of the child's symptoms. NPA samples were frozen and stored at -808C for future analysis. Two control NPA samples (one in winter and a second in summer) were also collected from each child when the child was well and free of any respiratory symptoms for at least 4 weeks. The NPA samples were analyzed by a panel of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions for rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses (coxsackie, echo, and enteroviruses), coronaviruses 229E and OC43, RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Additional details on viral identification and analysis are included in the electronic repository. 22 The children underwent skin prick tests (SPTs) at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years of age to a panel of 7 allergens (fresh cow's milk, egg white, rye grass, alternaria, aspergillus, house dust mite, and cat dander). Histamine was used as the positive control and normal saline as the negative control. The wheal size was read after 15 minutes, and a wheal size 2 mm (for the tests performed at 6 months and 2 years) or 3 mm (at 5 years) greater than saline control was considered a positive reaction. SPTs were performed on the parents with the same panel of allergens and a wheal size of 3 mm was considered positive.
