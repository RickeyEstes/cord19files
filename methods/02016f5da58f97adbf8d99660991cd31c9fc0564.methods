This review followed systematic review methodology according to a protocol available at www.environmentalevidence.org/ SR65.html. Published studies were identified through searching the ISI Web of Knowledge (1996 Knowledge ( -2008 and Scopus database and by examining lists of references cited in these studies. We searched Scopus database since the beginning of records, as this database was not available at the time of the Edwards and Potts (1996) . The search strategies used combination ''MHC AND drift" for the first question, ''MHC AND (diversity OR variation) AND (infection OR disease OR parasite Ã OR pathogen Ã )" for the second question; ''MHC AND (extinction OR population survival OR population viability)" for the third question. The relevance of a study was first assessed by reading the title and abstract, and then by reading full texts of the papers considered relevant. To be included, studies concerning MHC and drift must have reported one or more tests of neutrality of MHC genes based on several populations, of which at least some have undergone a decrease in population size. Thus, some studies (e.g. Loiseau et al., 2009) were not included as no decrease in the size of any of the populations studied were reported. Sequences of MHC genes must have shown the signatures of balancing selection (to ensure that the locus examined has been subject to historical selection). Apart from MHC variation, data on neutral variation must have been reported to control for demographic processes that might produce signal mimicking selection (Nielsen, 2005) . We identified 14 such studies of 12 species. A variety of methodologies were used to test for selection (Table 1) . Seven studies reported correlations between neutral markers and MHC allelic richness. We have summarised the results of these studies by calculating the mean correlation coefficient weighted by sample size (i.e. the number of populations). We tested for significance of this mean r by converting r values from particular studies into standard normal deviates (Z s ) using Fisher's r to Z transformation and calculating combined, weighted Z c according to Eq. (23) in Wolf (1993) . A set of seven studies tested whether structure in MHC is more/less pronounced than for neutral variation using F ST outlier (Beaumont and Nichols, 1996) or similar methods. Unfortunately most authors did not report exact P-values, and no standardised effect sizes are available for this simulation-based technique, which precluded formal meta-analysis. Instead, we employed simple tabulation of this and other, less commonly employed tests. Studies included to address the second question (MHC diversity and population-level infection) must have compared parasite/ pathogen loads or disease prevalence in populations differing in the level of MHC variation, the number of populations examined should have allowed statistical analysis, and genome-wide inbreeding should have been taken into account. Crucially, the differences in MHC variation between populations must have been ascribed to drift, rather than to differences in pressure form parasites. Thus, studies on populations which have not undergone bottlenecks were not included, as it is likely that pressure from parasites selects for increased MHC diversity, resulting in positive correlation with parasite load (compare examples of sticklebacks and Atlantic salmon discussed above), rather than negative correlation predicted if drift leads to the loss of alleles conferring resistance. As we identified only one study that met these criteria, we also discuss results of other relevant papers. The studies bearing on the third question (MHC variation and population extinction) mostly reported short or long-term survival of populations despite low MHC variation. However, as we discuss below, this kind of data can be inherently biased because it is rarely possible to attribute past extinctions to reduced MHC diversity.
