The International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT) rapidly initiated two international cohort studies of patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in 2009. Although originally designed to conduct large HIV treatment trials, INSIGHT adapted and expanded its global network to include the study of influenza. One study (FLU 002) enrolled patients seeking assessment for influenza-like illness (ILI) as outpatients; a second study (FLU 003) enrolled patients who had been hospitalized for complications associated with influenza. The study designs of both studies have been described elsewhere [7] . Briefly, the two studies were designed to cover a broad clinical spectrum of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in adults ($18 years of age), ranging from outpatients presenting with mild ILI symptoms (FLU 002) to those with more serious disease requiring hospitalization (FLU 003), and both studies included follow-up periods. Initially, sites were not open to enrollment until A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was circulating in their geographic areas. Later these studies were expanded to include other seasonal influenza viruses; outcomes for patients with other influenza viruses will be included in a subsequent report. For both studies, information collected at the time of enrollment included patient demographics, height, weight and vital signs; date of ILI onset; medical history, including underlying conditions, pregnancy status, and smoking history, and use of neuraminidase inhibitors to prevent or treat influenza. For FLU 003, the type of complication prompting hospital admission was also collected.
