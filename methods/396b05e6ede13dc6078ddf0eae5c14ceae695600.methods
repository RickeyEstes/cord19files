Subjects. In this study, serological criteria were evaluated through the assessment with a validation cohort of 383 subjects. The experimental group: 90 confirmed BD patients with an average age of 39 years (range: 16 Construction of the cell-chip. A multifunctional cell-chip was constructed based on our traditional microarray strategies 52, 53 . A sample of each of the cultured cells was placed on cover slips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then cut into fragments. The cover slips were then glued to microscope slides. Immunofluorescence assays were then carried out as follows. Sera from 90 BD patients were diluted 1520 in PBS and incubated with the slides for 1 h at 37uC. After extensive washing, the slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti human IgG The competitive immunofluorescence assays was performed on the EA.hy926 cell line using serum from an anti-annexin A2 antibody-positive BD patient. For the inhibition assay, serum was pre-incubated with annexin A2 protein at 37uC for 1 h. After extensive washing, the slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat-anti human IgG secondary antibody (ImmunoHunt, Beijing, China), which was diluted 15150 in PBS, for 1 h at 37uC. Membrane antigens-based ELISA. The cell membrane proteins were extracted using a ProteoPrepH Membrane Extraction Kit (Sigma, MO) with 1% complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, MO). The extracts were dispensed and stored at -80uC until further use. The proteins (5 mg/mL) were used to coat the 96-well microplate (Corning, NY) overnight at 4uC. After three washes with 0.5% PBST, the plates were incubated with 10% goat serum for 1 h at 37uC. Sera from BD patients were diluted 15100 with PBS and then added to each well. The plates were then incubated again for 1 h at 37uC. Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen, CA) was diluted 1510000 in PBS with divalent cations and then incubated for 30 min at 37uC. The amount of bound antibody was quantified colorimetrically by adding tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate, and the plates were read spectrophotometrically at 450/620 nm on an ELISA reader (Tecan, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). Western blotting. The Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere 54 with slight modifications. The cell membrane proteins extracted using a ProteoPrepH Membrane Extraction Kit (Sigma, MO) with 1% complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, MO). The extracts were dispensed and stored at 280uC until further use. Cell lysates were loaded into the wells of a 12% polyacrylamide gel and separated. The gel was then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF; Merck Millipore, MA) that had been washed twice with ultrapure water. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS at 4uC overnight and then incubated with 5 BD sera that had been selected due to their relatively higher optical density values (15500 dilution) or sera from random healthy controls at 4uC for 12 h. The membranes were extensively washed four times with 5% PBST buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Finally, they were incubated with horseradish-peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-human IgG (ImmunoHunt, Beijing, China) for 1 h at 37uC, and ECL detection was carried out in accordance with the product instructions (Applygen, Beijing, China). In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry. In-gel digestion and mass spectrometry were performed as described in detail elsewhere 55 . Briefly, the excised gel pieces were destained with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and 50% acetonitrile and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Then, 10 mM dithiotreitol in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 was added to cover the gel pieces, and the samples were reduced for 2 h at 37uC. After cooling to room temperature, the DTT solution was replaced by roughly the same volume of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. The gel pieces were washed with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 in 50% acetonitrile for 10 min. After the liquid phase was removed, the gel pieces were completely dried by a vacuum concentrator. The dried gel pieces were then covered with 20 mL of 0.05 M NH 4 HCO 3 buffer containing trypsin (Sigma, MO), and digestion was performed overnight at 37uC. The excised 36-kDa protein band was identified using a 5800 Proteomics Analyzer LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass spectrometry data were analyzed with Mascot bioinformatics database search engine (Matrix Sciences, London, UK). Protein expression and purification. The procedure of protein expression and purification was performed as our routine method 56 . In brief, total RNA was isolated from EA.hy926 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA). RT-PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fermentas, MD). Target proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21, followed by purification of the recombinant proteins using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The concentration of protein was determined using a BCA assay kit (Biosynthesis Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Purified recombinant protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and Western blotting with mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Chicago, IL). Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described 57 . The putative autoantigen (5 mg) was incubated with 5 mL mixed sera (equal volumes from three positive BD patients in Western blotting detection) at 4uC overnight. Thereafter, protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma, MO) that had been washed with PBS were added and mixed overnight at 4uC. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 200 mL PBS. Then, the immunoprecipitates were suspended in sample loading buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Development of an ELISA. ELISAs with human recombinant proteins were performed as described previously 54 . In brief, 1 mg/mL recombinant human annexin A2 or HSP60 (Sino biological, Beijing, China) were used to coat the 96-well microplate (Coring, NY) overnight at 4uC. After three washes with 0.5% PBST, each well was blocked with 200 mL 5% goat serum for 2 h at 37uC. Then, the plate was incubated with 100 mL sera from patients or healthy controls, which were diluted 15100 in PBS, for 2 h at 37uC. Three washes later, 100 mL of goat anti-human IgG/ HRP (ImmunoHunt, Beijing, China) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for an additional 1 h at 37uC. Following three washes, 50 mL tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) A (0.1 M citric acid, 0.2 M NA 2 HPO 4 , 0.6 g hydroperite/L) and 50 mL TMB B (5 mM citric acid, 0.4 mM EDTA-NA 2 , 0.2 g TMB/L) were added to each well. Then, the plate was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 4 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 mL of 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance of each well was measured with a plate reader at 450 nm (Tecan, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). Immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemistry protocols, with slight modification, have been previously described 58 . The human umbilical vein/artery, squamous cell lung cancer and kidney cancer tissue samples were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4uC, and the fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax. Five-micrometer-thick paraffin sections were placed on glass slides, baked for 60 min at 60uC, incubated for 10 min in xylene, and finally washed with PBS. To inhibit endogenous peroxidase, the sections were first incubated in 3% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 20 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were boiled in sodium citrate-hydrochloric acid solution for 10 min and incubated in goat serum for 30 min at 37uC. The sections were washed with PBS and then incubated overnight at 37uC with mouse anti-human annexin A2 monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Chicago, IL), which had been diluted in PBS (15100). The sections were washed again with PBS to remove unbound antibodies and then incubated with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoHunt, Beijing, China). The sections were washed again and then incubated with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to develop peroxidase activity. Counter-staining was performed with hematoxylin. The sections were dehydrated in gradient ethanol (approximately 2 min at each concentration), placed in xylene for 5 min, and then observed with a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis. The t-test statistics, Spearman's correlation coefficients, Fisher's exact text, and chi-squared test were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 17, IL). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The critical point for positive definition was a number with a higher value than that of the healthy controls (Mean 1 3 SD).
