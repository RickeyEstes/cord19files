Mouse skin wound healing assay. The animal experimental protocol was approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Mice used in this study were females eight to ten weeks old. Full-thickness skin excision wounds (four six-millimetre circular wounds per mouse) were created on the dorsal surface of C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA). Wounded skin and surrounding normal skin were collected after mice were sacrificed at To investigate the effect of M-CSF on skin wound healing, nine mice were used to make skin wounds (four wounds per mouse) by a six-millimetre punch biopsy at the dorsal site. Wounds were covered by Tegaderm dressing and treated by either PBS (control) or 0.1 ml of M-CSF at a concentration of 20 ng/ml (eBioscience, Mouse M-CSF recombinant protein, 14-8983-80) or 0.1 ml of M-CSF neutralizing antibody at a concentration of 10 μ g/ml (R & D Biosystems, Mouse M-CSF neutralization antibody, MAB4161) daily per wound as described above, from day one to day nine. Dressings were changed on day five. Wound sizes were measured on day zero, day five and day ten by marking the wound size with a transparent film and calculating the percentage of original size through an imaging program. Mice were sacrificed on day ten and skin samples were collected for histological analysis. Isolation and culture of cells from mouse wounded skin or normal skin. Four punch biopsies (6 mm) from wounded skin and eight punch biopsies from normal skin for each sacrificed mouse were taken. Tissue was minced into small pieces and incubated with type-1 collagenase (1 mg/ml in PBS, sigma) for 90 minutes in a shaker at 225 rpm and 37 °C. Tissue debris was removed by being passed through a 40 μ m nylon filter. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 minutes. Cells were either used for flow cytometry analysis or cultured in a mixture containing 50% fresh medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS) and 50% fibroblast conditioned medium (FCM) for 48 hrs before being fixed with 10% formalin and subjected to fluorescence staining with SSEA-1 antibody. Immunofluorescence staining. In this study, the following primary and secondary antibodies were used: blocking with blocking solution containing 5% goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin for one hour. After being washed three times with PBS or PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) at room temperature, cells were incubated with secondary fluorescently conjugated antibodies for another hour. After being washed three further times, cells were stained with 1.5% Vectashield Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) while slides were directly mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and AxioVision image analysis software. To calculate the corrected total fluorescence (CTCF) of SSEA-1 staining, we measured the area, cell fluorescence integrated density and mean gray value in selected field of wounds using imageJ program. The CTCF were calculated by the formula [CTCF = integrated density-(Area of selected cell X Mean fluorescence of background readings)]. Flow cytometry. After dissociation, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin for thirty minutes at room temperature. After being washed three times with PBS, non-specific bindings were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 5% goat serum and 5% BSA for one hour at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with SSEA-1 primary antibody at a concentration of 1:500 for 45 minutes at room temperature. After being washed three times with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 minutes. After washing, cells were finally analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Acuuri C6). Culture enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells. Splenocytes from B6. UBC-EGFP transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratory, ME) were cultured in a medium containing 10 ng/ml of M-CSF for ten days. Adherent stem cells were used to inject into the mice as described below.
