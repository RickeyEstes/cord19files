cDNA constructs and reagents. Human HLA-DMB was amplified by PCR using cDNA from MT2 cells, and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The deletion mutants of DMB were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pEGFP vector. Human ATG3, ATG4, ATG7, and Beclin1 were amplified by PCR using cDNA from Hela cells, and cloned into a pcDNA3.1-HA vector. ATG7 was subcloned into a pmCherry vector. pENTER-Flag-DMA plasmid was obtained from Vigene Biosciences. Myc-Sirt1 plasmid was a generous gift of Xiaofei Zhu (Xinxiang Medical University, Henan, China). The 90-base-long HTLV-1 ssDNA90 is the reverse complement of the 5′UTR region (315-404) of complete HTLV-1 genome (NCBI) and was synthesized from the Sangon Biotech. The sequence was as f ol lo ws: C TG TGTACTAAATTTCTCTCCTGGAGAGTGCTATAGAATGGGCTGTCGCT GGCTCCGAGCCAGCAGAGTTGCCGGTACTTGGCCGTGGGC. The The 3-MA (M9281) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemical inhibitors were obtained from Selleck. The PMA (S1819) was purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology. Cell culture and transfection. HEK293T and Hela cells were cultured in DMEM. MT2, C8166, Jurkat and THP1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640. PBMCs were enriched from donor blood using Ficoll density gradient separation and human monocytes were separated by their adherence to the culture plate in RPMI 1640. Primary CD4 + T cells were isolated from PBMCs by FACS screening, and cultured in RPMI 1640 in the presence of IL-2. All cells were supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 4mM L-glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin, and 100U/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions with 5% CO 2 at 37 °C. Transfection of HEK293T and Hela cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously 41 . In short, HEK293T, Hela, THP1 or MT2 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids or siRNA. At 24 h after the transfection, the cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 1.0% (vol/vol) Nonidet P40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10%(vol/vol) glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 0.1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and a protease inhibitor 'cocktail' (Roche). After centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 g, supernatants were collected and incubated with the indicated antibody together with protein A/G Plus-agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 3 h or overnight. After three washes, the immunoprecipitants were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 10 min and analyzed by immunoblot. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the cell lysates of MT2 cells or THP1 cells were incubated with indicated antibodies and analyzed by immunoblot.
