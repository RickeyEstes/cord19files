Page 5 There is no brief description of the different types of farms. A reader unfamiliar with the GB cattle industry might not be aware of the exact difference between the types of farm. Also, is "suckler" what elsewhere is called "cow-calf"? Lines 48-50: I agree with this choice, but it needs to be properly justified and/or discussed; Pag 6 Lines 15-20: the choice of weight the links based on the number of animals and not on the number of batches is good to me, but it should be supported or discussed (see Volkova et al., 2010, already cited) ; Line 30: update igraph citation; Lines 15-56 (and Page 7 lines 3-24): I would suggest the authors to report all these network metrics, with opportune citations, and brief descriptions in a table, since none of these represent a novelty in the field. Maybe this could make the section easier to read; Page 7 Lines 5-10: the correct citation here is Kao et al., 2006, Interface. Page 8 Lines 7-19: how much the results of this analysis can be affected by a different threshold choice? I would suggest the authors to repeat the analysis with at least 2 alternative thresholds. Alternatively, they can use a GLM with multinomial response variable. In any case, this choice needs more explanation and discussion; Line 12: I would suggest to show a map with the England's regions in the supplementary material, since they are using this information; Page 5 There is no brief description of the different types of farms.

There is no brief description of the different types of farms. A reader unfamiliar with the GB cattle industry might not be aware of the exact difference between the types of farm. Also, is "suckler" what elsewhere is called "cow-calf"? -We have added in descriptions of the different herds at lines 134-139. 27. Lines 48-50: I agree with this choice, but it needs to be properly justified and/or discussed; -Added text at lines 121-129 for further discussion and justification. See also our response to Referee 1, point 1, above. 30. Lines 15-56 (and Page 7 lines 3-24): I would suggest the authors to report all these network metrics, with opportune citations, and brief descriptions in a table, since none of these represent a novelty in the field. Maybe this could make the section easier to read; -We have created a new Table S1 providing these definitions. Page 8 32. Lines 7-19: how much the results of this analysis can be affected by a different threshold choice? I would suggest the authors to repeat the analysis with at least 2 alternative thresholds. Alternatively, they can use a GLM with multinomial response variable. In any case, this choice needs more explanation and discussion; -We have repeated the analysis as requested with three thresholds; 100, 1000, and 10,000 and included the ROC values (Table S2 ) and predicted probabilities for herd size and farm type in the supplementary material ( Figures S5-7) . We have added text explaining this in the methods at lines 183-185. -The threshold of 10,000 was used for the main body of the paper as it had the highest ROC values for ICCs, OCCs and both contact chains. We defined by number of farms rather than a percentile as this encompassed very different numbers of farms for ICCs and OCCs, due to the differences in distribution between ICCs and OCCs. On balance, we felt it was easier to interpret with clear farm numbers than proportions. 33. Line 12: I would suggest to show a map with the England's regions in the supplementary material, since they are using this information; -As suggested, we have added a map into the supplementary materials as Figure S10 and referred to at line 188.
