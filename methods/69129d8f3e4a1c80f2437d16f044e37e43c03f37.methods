Reagents and cells and viruses. All experiments with primary mouse cells are approved by the local Danish ethics committee for animal experiments (dyreforsøgstilsynet). Taqman assays for PCR were from Life Technologies. BMDCs were differentiated from bone marrow using GM-CSF (R&D systems) 7-day cultures. cGAMP (cyclic (guanosine-(2 0 -5 0 )-monophosphate-adenosine-(3 0 -5 0 )-monophosphate) was purchased from BioLog. Anti-Giantin was from Abcam. Antibodies for STING and pTBK1 immunoblotting were from Cell Signaling Technology. SDS-PAGE and protein transfer was performed using the Biorad Criterion system. Beads for precipitation studies were purchased from Life Technologies. Lipid blends containing DOTAP, DOPE and lissamine-rhodamine DOPE in the w/w/w ratio 1/1/0.1 were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and liposomes were prepared as described previously 14 . In brief, lipids were dissolved in chloroform in the indicated ratios. Chloroform was then evaporated under inert gas pressure leaving a thin lipid film. Liposomes were formed by hydrating the lipid film with phosphate-buffered saline. Uniform size of liposomes weas achieved by passing the hydrated lipids through a 0.2 mm pore filter using a mini-extruder purchased from Avanti Polar lipids. FP GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGC from IAV (FP) 20 . A tail of GGEKEKEK was added to the peptide to achieve solubility. Peptides were produced as covalent homodimers linked through sulfur bridges. Sequence of deletion peptide FPDI6 was GLFGAAGFIENGWEGC. Peptides were purchased from the company Schafer-N. STING-GFP expressing iBMDMs were kindly donated by Dr Melanie Brinkmann (Braunschweig, Germany). IAV was purchased from ATCC (H1N1, PR8). VSV was of the Indiana strain and NDV and SeV were kindly provided by professor Peter Palese 29 and professor Illka Julkunen, respectively. BMDCs were prepared by 7-day culturing of bone marrow cells with GM-CSF and then collecting non-adherent cells. STING-and cGAS-deficient MEF were obtained from embryos of Golden ticket and cGAS À / À mice at E13.5. Primary cells were transformed with lentivirus containing SV40 and positive cells were selected with puromycin. Transformed cells were re-infected with lentivirus containing lentiviral expression system for STING or mutant forms of STING. For lentiviral reconstitution of STING expression in BMDCs from STING-deficient mice, bone marrow was collected and placed in culture supplemented with GM-CSF. Next day lentivirus was added to the cultures. Cells were cultured with GM-CSF until day 7 whereupon the non-adherent cells were collected. For stimulation of cell cultures with IAV, PR8 strain was used at a MOI of 60 HAU per 10 6 cells for 20 h. Knockout using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate B2M, cGAS and STING-KO THP1 cells. We used a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 vector 30 encoding a codon-optimized nuclear-localized Cas9 gene N-terminally fused to PuroR via a T2A ribsome-skipping sequence. In addition, the vector contains a human U6 promoter driving expression of a guideRNA consisting of a gene-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) fused to the trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) and a terminator sequence. The gene-specific crRNA sequences cloned were: 5 0 -GAGTAGCGCGAGCACAGCTA-3 0 for B2M, 5 0 -GAGCACACTC TCCGGTACC-3 0 for STING and 5 0 -GACTCGGTGGGATCCATCG-3 0 for cGAS. THP1 cells were transduced with CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus, and selected with 2 mg ml À 1 puromycin for 2 weeks. Cells were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution, and individual clones were subjected to western blotting to confirm absence of the targeted gene products. The MAVS-deficient THP-1-derived cells were generated as described previously 31 . In brief, THP-1-KO cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A plasmid containing mCherry Cas9 and a U6 promoter-driven guideRNA against STING, MAVS or cGAS was electroporated into THP-1 cells under the following conditions: 5 mg plasmid were mixed with 250 ml cell suspension (10 Â 10 6 ml À 1 in OptiMEM) and electroporated at 950 mF and 250 V. Cells were FACS sorted for mCherry expression 24 h after electroporation. Positive cells were diluted under limiting conditions and plated in 96-well plates to obtain single-cell clones. The genotype of THP-1 clones was analysed by deep sequencing (Illumina, MiSeq) . RT-qPCR. For analysis by RT-qPCR RNA was isolated using the High pure RNA isolation kit (Roche) and Taqman primer for hCXCL10, hISG54, mCXCL10, mIFNb1 were purchased form Life Technologies. Cloning. For mSTING expression from lentiviral vectors, a lentiviral cloning vector was generated (pCCL-PGK-MCS-HA-IRES-eGFP) which can receive an mSTING cDNA PCR fragment into the multiple cloning site (MCS) placing the cDNA in reading frame with a 3 0 hemagglutinin tag. For this, an intermediate vector was generated named pCCL-PGK-MCS, in which the eGFP sequence of pCCL-PGK-eGFP 32 was replaced with a MCS containing AscI, XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. This was cloned using annealed oligos carrying BamH1 and XhoI-compatible overhangs (the latter designed to eliminate the XhoI site to render the XhoI site in the MCS unique): sense oligo: 5 0 -gatccaaaggcgcgccaaactcgagaa atctagaaaa-3 0 and antisense oligo: 5 0 -tcgattttctagatttctcgagtttggcgcgcctttg-3 0 . For constructing pCCL-PGK-MCS-HA-IRES-eGFP, the hemagglutinin-tag followed by IRES-eGFP was PCR-amplified from a retroviral transfer vector carrying mSTING (MSCV2.2-mSTING-IRES-eGFP; a kind gift from Russell Vance) using the following primers: forward: 5 0 -aaactcgagtatccttatgacgtgcctgactatgcc-3 0 , reverse: 5 0 -aaatctagagccgctttacttgtacagctcgtccatg-3 0 and cloned into pCCL-PGK-MCS using the XhoI and XbaI sites. mSTING R168A was generated using overlap extension PCR with the internal primers carrying the mutation: forward: 5 0 -tacattgggtacttggcctt gatcttaccagggctc-3 0 and reverse 5 0 -ggccaagtacccaatgtagtatg-3 0 As a negative-control vector, pCCL-PGK-eGFP 32 was used. Expression vectors for hSTING in HEK293T cells were constructed as described previously 22 . In brief, Mouse Sting was cloned into pcDNA3 with a carboxy terminal hemagglutinin tag. Mutations in Sting were generated using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. hSTING 140 À 379 (CTD) containing an Arg at position 232, was PCR-amplified and cloned into pET28a for bacterial expression. Production of lentiviral vectors. Lentiviral vectors were produced in HEK293T cells seeded the day before transfection in 15-cm dishes at 10 7 cells per dish. Cells were transfected using standard calcium phosphate co-transfection of the three lentiviral packaging plasmids (pRSV-Rev: 7.26 mg, pMD2.G: 9.07 mg and pMDLg/pRRE) and 31.46 mg of the lentiviral transfer vector. One day after transfection, medium was changed and 2 days after transfection, viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-mm filter and then ultracentrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion at 25,000 r.p.m. at 4°C for 2 h followed by resuspension of the pelleted virus in PBS. The yield of each vector production was determined by p24 ELISA (XpressBio, Thurmont, MD, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein purification. The pOAS1 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography followed by SEC as previously described 33 . hSTING 140-379 was expressed and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography in the same manner as pOAS1 and afterwards applied to a HiLoad16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with SEC buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.5)) and fractions containing the protein were pooled and then concentrated to a concentration of 3.2 mg ml À 1 using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device. Analytical SEC. The peptide was first dissolved in 8 M urea and then mixed with STING 140-379 or pOAS1 in (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol (pH 8.5)) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The final concentrations were 66 mM for the peptide, 20 mM for the proteins and 0.8 M for urea. The peptide/proteins were then applied to a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with SEC buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol (pH 8.5)). Protein assays and confocal microscopy. Cellular lysates for detection of STING dimerization by western blotting were prepared using non-reducing RIPA lysis buffer with 0.2% SDS and complete mini inhibitor (Sigma). For detection of pTBK1 NaF (10 mM) was added to the lysis buffer. Separation by SDS-page was perfomed using Criterion precast gels (Biorad) and the protein transfer by Biorad Trans-blot turbo system. XT Sample buffer and reducing agent was also purchased from Biorad. For STING dimerization blotting of STING was performed using a mRabbit antibody (D2P2F, dilution 1:1,000) from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for pTBK1 was purchased also from Cell Signaling Technology (dilution 1:1,000). hemagglutinin (dilution 1:1,000) and Giantin (dilution 1:1,000) antibodies were purchased from Abcam. Secondary antibodies for confocal imaging and western blotting were purchased from Invitrogen (dilution 1:500) and Jackson ImmunoResearch (dilution 1:10,000), respectively. Uncropped immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9 . For confocal imaging cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then stained with respective antibodies, with DAPI for nuclear staining, mounted in proLong Gold (Molecular probes) and vizualised using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser-scanning microscope. Measurements of interferon-a/-b bioactivity. Murine interferon-a/-b was measured as described previously 34 . In brief, L929 cells were plated and cultured overnight in the presence of the samples for analysis in serial dilutions. L929 cells were then infected with VSV and incubated for another 2 days. interferon levels were then evaluated by the extend of virus induced cell death compared with interferonalpha controls. Human interferon-a/-b was measured as described by others 29 . Statistics. For analysis of statistically significant difference between two groups of data we used two-tailed Student's t-test when the data exhibited normal distribution, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test when the data set did not pass the normal distribution test.
