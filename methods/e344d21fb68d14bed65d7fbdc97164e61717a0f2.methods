As mentioned in Introduction, the interactive compounds tend to participate in the same metabolic pathways. Accordingly, for a query compound, the higher interaction confidence score with its interactive compound, the more likely they are to participate in the same metabolic pathway. The more its interactive compounds involving in a certain metabolic pathway, the more likely it is to participate in such metabolic pathway. Based on these points, we should count not only the number of compounds interacting with the query compound, but also the corresponding interaction scores. Thus, the desired predictor can be formulated via the following procedures. Suppose the training dataset contains n compounds, which are denoted as fC 1 ,C 2 ,:::,C n g. The 11 metabolic pathway classes (cf. Table 1 ) are expressed as fP 1 ,P 2 ,:::,P 11 g, where P 1 represents the 1 st metabolic pathway class (''Carbohydrate Metabolism''), P 2 the 2 nd metabolic pathway class (''Energy Metabolism''), P 3 the 3 rd metabolic pathway class (''Lipid Metabolism''), and so forth. Thus, the descriptor of metabolic pathway classes to which the compound C i belongs to can be formulated as P(C i )~½p i,1 ,p i,2 ,:::,p i,j ,:::,p i,11 T (i~1,2,:::,n; j~1,2,:: where Given a query compound C q , its interaction with the compounds in the training dataset can be defined as W (C q )~½w q,1 ,w q,2 ,:::,w q,i ,:: where w q,i represents the interaction confidence score between C q and C i . T is the transpose operator, and w q,i~0 if no interaction exists between them. Here, we did not consider the selfinteraction, therefore w q,i~0 when q~i. Accordingly, the likelihood that the query compound C q is involved in the j-th metabolic pathway class can be formulated by the following score which is the sum of the interaction confidence scores of C q with its interactive compounds in the training dataset by counting both the number of interactive compounds and the interaction confidence scores. Obviously, the higher the score of Eq. 4, the more likely C q is to be involved in the j-th metabolic pathway C j . Thus, for a given query compound C q , we can use Eq. 4 to calculate its 11 scores, with each associated with one of the 11 metabolic pathway classes. The class to which the compound C q most likely belongs should be the one with the highest score. In other words, the query compound C q will be predicted to belong to the mth metabolic pathway class if m~arg max j S(C q [j)jj~1,2,:::,11 where m is the argument of j that maximize the value of S(C q [j). Since the problem in this study is of multi-label classification, we intend to provide flexible information by predicting some candidate metabolic pathway classes for the query compounds, rather than just the most likely metabolic pathway class. Therefore, instead of Eq. 5, let us consider the following equation containing 11 scores in a one-column vector: where D ; is a descending operator that sorts the 11 scores of Eq. 4 for S(C q [j) according to the descending order (S 1 §S 2 § Á Á Á §S j § Á Á Á §S 11 ). If there is a tie among these scores, a random order will be made among those with a tie. Consequently, the predicted metabolic pathway classes for the query compound can be derived according to the descending order of Eq. 6; i.e., if S 1~S (P k [6), S 2~S (P k [1), S 3~S (P k [10) , then it follows that the query compound C q is involved in the 6 th metabolic pathway class (''Metabolism of Other Amino Acids'') will be ranked as the highest in the likelihood, that C q in the 1 st metabolic pathway class (''Carbohydrate Metabolism'') as the 2 nd , and that C q in the 10 th metabolic pathway class (''Biosynthesis of Other Secondary Metabolites'') as the 3 rd . The corresponding results thus obtained are, respectively, called the 1 st -order, 2 nd -order, and 3 rd -order predicted metabolic pathway classes. And so forth.
