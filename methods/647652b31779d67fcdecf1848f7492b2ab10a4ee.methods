Study period and keywords. The study period was from May 11, 2015 to Jun 26, 2015. May 11, 2015 is the symptom onset day of the first laboratory-confirmed patient 6 . Nationally acquired statistical data for MERS in Korea 6 , web-search results from Google Trends 33 , and Twitter data 34 were compared. Based on expectations regarding public interest in this topic, the top four MERS-associated keywords used in the Google search were selected. These four keywords were "MERS", "MERS (in Korean)", "MERS symptoms (in Korean)", and "MERS hospital (in Korean)". In this study, we first included the most basic keywords, "MERS" and "MERS (in Korean)". Next, we extended the keywords such as "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" and "MERS hospital (in Korean)", which had a value of more than 90 among correlated queries with two basic keywords ("MERS" and "MERS (in Korean)") in Google Trends. We also conducted a subgroup analysis focusing on the acceleration and deceleration period (June 3 -June 26, 2015) by adapting the CDC intervals 35 . CDC intervals are defined as the acceleration period indicated by a consistently increasing rate of pandemic influenza cases, indicating established transmission, and the deceleration interval indicated by a consistently decreasing rate of pandemic influenza cases. National MERS statistical data for Korea. Statistics data for MERS in Korea are updated daily in the MERS portal by the Korean government 6 . Daily data pertaining to new laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and quarantined cases were collected from this website. Laboratory confirmation of MERS was defined as either positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with the sequencing of a second target 6, 21, 22 . In quarantined cases, people who were exposed to a contagious disease are separated and their movements restricted in case they become sick 36 . Google search and Twitter data. Daily trend data associated with the selected keywords were obtained from Google Trends by setting the location parameter to "South Korea" and the time parameter to "May to Jun, 2015. " The output was provided in a csv format. Because the data obtained using Google Trends are normalized to the total Google search volume, these data are relative 33 . The total number of searches for a given term was not provided in Google Trends. We also normalized the other data such as Twitter data and national MERS statistical data to have the same value (0 to 100) by the maximum value of each data. All data are provided in the supplementary file. The number of tweets containing one of the predefined keywords was collected through Topsy, which is a certified partner of Twitter that offers social searching and social analytics 34 . Topsy indexes every public tweet and allows users to search these from 2013 using specific keywords. This range indicates that our analysis is based on the entire set of Korean public tweets rather than small sample sizes. Spam tweets are automatically removed by Topsy. The number of tweets, including tweets with URL links, tweets without URL links, and retweets, were collected. Statistical analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were used to examine the correlations among social-media, search engine data, the numbers of confirmed MERS cases, and quarantined cases using the IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 20 (IBM Corp). We used lag correlation analyses to assess the temporal relationships between these data for up to 7 days. The data on new laboratory-confirmed cases and quarantine cases were moved to the right (i.e., direction to decrease gaps of date between Google search or Twitter data and new laboratory-confirmed cases or quarantined cases). Subgroup analyses for the period were conducted along the same lines. The significance level was set at p < 0.05.
