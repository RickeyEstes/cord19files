A total of 390 sera were collected from two different veterinary clinic laboratories located in Apulia region, Southern Italy and tested upon request of the veterinarian practitioners after anamnesis, medical history and clinical examination. One-hundred seventy-four sera (collection A) had been collected for diagnosis of infectious diseases (FIV, FeLV, feline coronavirus (FCoV), toxoplasmosis, hemoplasmosis, bacterial and fungal infections). A total of 147/174 (84.5%) sera were submitted with a suspect/request of diagnosis for FIV/FeLV, with 42 sera being positive for retrovirus. Fisher's exact test was performed to the collection A to evaluate the correlation between DCH positive cats and retrovirus positive cats. The significance level of the test was set at 0.05. Of the other 27 sera (15.5%), 14 were sent for a suspect/request of diagnosis for coronavirus (with 7/14 being positive), 5 for toxoplasmosis (with 2/5 being positive), 2 for giardia (with 1/2 being positive). Five sera were collected from animals with suspected bacterial/fungal infections and 1 serum (negative) was from a cat with suspected hemoplasmosis. A total of 216 sera (collection B) submitted to the laboratory for pre-surgical evaluation (n = 85) or for suspected metabolic (n = 127) or neoplastic (n = 4) disease was used for comparison to generate a baseline. Information on the sera analyzed in the study is included in Fig. 1 . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari (authorization 23/2018). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Total DNA was extracted from collected sera by using QIAamp cador Pathogen Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We performed sample screening using a PCR with consensus pan-hepadnavirus primers 2 and a PCR with primers specific for DCH 3 . Also, we screened sera using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) designed based on the sequence of the Australian reference strain AUS/2016/Sydney (GenBank accession nr. MH307930) ( Table 2) . For qPCR, we calculated DCH DNA copy numbers on the basis of standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a plasmid standard TOPO XL PCR containing a 1.4 kb long fragment of the polymerase region of the Australian reference strain AUS/2016/Sydney (IQ Supermix; Bio-Rad Laboratories SRL, Segrate, Italy). We added 10 μL of sample DNA or plasmid standard to the 15-μL reaction www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ master mix (IQ Supermix; Bio-Rad Laboratories SRL, Segrate, Italy) containing 0.6 μmol/L of each primer and 0.1 μmol/L of probe. Thermal cycling consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95 °C for 3 min and 42 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s and annealing-extension at 60 °C for 30 s. We evaluated the specificity of the assay using a panel of feline DNA viruses (parvovirus, herpesvirus and poxvirus). The qPCR assay was able to detect as few as 10 1 DNA copies per mL of standard DNA and 3.3 × 10 0 DNA copies per mL of DNA template extracted from clinical samples. DCH quantification displayed acceptable levels of repeatability over a range of target DNA concentrations, when calculating the intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation within and between runs, respectively 15, 16 . We carried out inferential statistical analyses using the Chi-Squared test with Yates' Correction, the evaluation of the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI95%) with the online software MedCalc easy-to-use Statistical software (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php). The significance level of the test was set at 0.05. Full genome sequences of hepadnaviruses were retrieved from the GenBank database and aligned using Geneious version 9.1.8 (Biomatters LTD, Auckland, New Zealand) and the MAFFT algorithm 17 . A set of genome sequences used in a previous study 2 was integrated with additional genome sequences of hepadnaviruses of recent identification in mammalian, avian, amphibian species and in fish. The final dataset included 53 hepadnavirus genomes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using JModel test (http://evomics.org/resources/software/ molecular-evolution-software/modeltest/) to evaluate the correct best-fit model of evolution for the entire dataset. Bayesian analysis 18, 19 was therefore applied using four MCMC chains well-sampled and converging over www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ one million generations (with the first 2000 trees discarded as "burn-in") and supplying statistical support with subsampling over 1000 replicates. The identified program settings for all partitions, under the Akaike information criteria, included six-character states (general time-reversible model), a proportion of invariable sites and a gamma distribution of rate variation across sites (GTR + I + G). We also tried to perform phylogenetic analyses using other evolutionary models (Maximum likelihood, Neighbor joining) to compare the topology of phylogenetic trees. We could observe similar topologies with slight difference in bootstrap values at the nodes of the tree. Accordingly, we did prefer to retain the Bayesian tree. We deposited the nucleotide genome sequence of strain ITA/2018/165-83 (MK117078) in GenBank.
