Human subjects. A total of 19 patients with juvenile RA (8 males, 11 females; mean age 8.71 ± 3.26 years), and 22 healthy age-and sex-matched volunteers served as controls (10 males, 12 females; mean age 8.92 ± 3.45 years) were enrolled into the study at the Nanjing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. All patients and volunteers were Han Chinese. All patients were clinically assessed according to the detailed diagnostic information obtained from the medical records and physical examinations. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China) and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent on the use of clinical specimens for medical research was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the participants. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from all study participants were isolated and cultured for the measurement of the P2X7R expression. Experimental animals. Male DBA/1J mice were purchased from the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All mice were kept under a light-, temperature-and humidity-controlled environment with a constant 12-h light/dark cycle, and access to food and water ad libitum. All animal procedures and study protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).
