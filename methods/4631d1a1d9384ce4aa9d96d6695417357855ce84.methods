A scoping review describes and summarizes the literature in an area of interest. It aims to map the relevant literature and studies in the field of interest, rather than focusing on a specific research question. It can also highlight gaps in the evidence base. Unlike a traditional systematic review, it can incorporate studies using different methodologies [34] and may provide the foundation for a more specific systematic review and meta-analysis in the future. For this scoping review, we adopted the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley [35] . To incorporate key components of MHL and to facilitate data extraction, we categorised MHL into the following seven domains: (1) General knowledge of mental health/ disorder(s); (2) Symptom recognition; (3) Knowledge/beliefs about causes or risk factors; (4) Knowledge/beliefs about treatment/help-seeking (including intentions and behaviours); (5) Beliefs about self-help strategies; (6) Beliefs about helping others/first aid, and (7) Other components which could not be categorized into any of above initial domains.
