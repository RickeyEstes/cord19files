We conducted a qualitative three-step study with an iterative design of in-depth interviews (steps 1 and 3) and a focus group (step 2), in order to identify the key elements of a preparedness system. e system includes (a) the triggers for healthcare institutions to initiate extra preparedness activities during different levels of a threat, which define preparedness phases, and (b) preparedness activities for each preparedness phase. We aimed at finding generic triggers for preparedness, applicable to different types of healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, ambulance services, general practitioners and the municipal health services. e outline of the preparedness system is shown in Figure 1 . In the first round of in-depth interviews, we explored the phases and triggers of the preparedness system, which we validated in the consensus meeting. In the second round of interviews, we aligned the preparedness activities per phase and grouped them per topic. We obtained ethical approval from the medical ethical committee of the UMC Utrecht (WAG/mb/17/028319). All participants provided informed consent and were informed that their responses would be used for research purposes.
