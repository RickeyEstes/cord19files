Materials and Reagents. Ammonium acetate, formic acid, Tris and NaCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Peptone, yeast powder, IPTG, ampicillin and imidazole were purchased from Sangon Biotech Shanghai Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Methyl alcohol and acetonitrile of HPLC-grade were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Ultra-pure water was purified with the Milli-Q system (Millipore, USA). Centrifugal ultrafiltration units (30 kDa) were purchased from Sartorius (Germany). Protein Thermal Shift Dye Kit TM was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Massachusetts, USA). Fourteen standards of known licorice constituents listed in Supplemental Figure S1 were purchased from Chengdu Herbpurify Co., Ltd (Chengdu, China) and National Institute for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China), or isolated using a reported protocol 30 Protein expression and purification. Cloning and purification was performed as described previously 31 . In brief, the gene of EBOV NP (residues 36-351 and 36-450) was cloned into the pET-21d expression vector, and the gene of MARV NP (residues 19-370) was cloned into the pET-28a expression vector (Novogen, China). Both NP proteins carry a 6× His tag fused at the C terminus. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (BioMed, China) was transformed with the expression vector and induced with isopropyl β -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. Following overnight expression at 16 °C, bacterial cultures were harvested and lysed in the buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 200 mM NaCl using an ultra-high pressure cell disrupter (JNBIO, China). Cleared lysates were applied to a Ni-NTA column and eluted with lysis buffer containing 0.5-1 M imidazole. Proteins were subsequently purified on a Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) with a void volume of ~ 8 mL. The purified EBOV NP and MARV NP were all > 95% pure according to SDS-PAGE analysis. Preparation of Chinese licorice extracts. The licorice powder (10 g) was macerated in 200 mL 70% (v/v) methanol aqueous solution and extracted by ultrasonication for 1 h. The extracted solution was filtered and concentrated to dryness using a combination of rotary evaporation under reduced pressure and lyophilization. The resulting powder of licorice extracts was stored at 4 °C ready for use.
