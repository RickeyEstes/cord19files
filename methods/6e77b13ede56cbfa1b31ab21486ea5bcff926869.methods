All available stored nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) from laboratory-confirmed SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected adult patients at the prince of wales hospital (PWH), which were collected during the first 8 weeks of the outbreak (March-June 2003), were retrieved for hMPV testing (Lee et al., , 2006 . Clinico-epidemiological information in our database (prospectively collected) was used for analyzes Wong et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2005) . Subjects were categorized into health-care workers (HCWs: doctors, nurses, and medical students), in-patients, and visitors. 'Index ward X' referred to the ward in which the major SARS outbreak (n > 100) occurred . NPA specimens were tested for hMPV using a nested RT-PCR targeting the F-gene as previously described . In brief, RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The outer primers were 5 -AGC TGT TCC ATT GGC AGC A-3 for RT and amplification and 5 -ATG CTG TTC RCC YTC AAC TTT-3 (R = A/G, Y = C/T) for amplification. The reaction was carried out in a single-tube (Superscript One-Step RT-PCR and Platinum Taq; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) by using 0.2 M of each primer. For the second round of amplification, 0.2 M of inner primers 5 -GAG TAG GGA TCA TCA AGC A-3 and 5 -GCT TAG CTG RTA TAC AGT GTT-3 were used. PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ï‡ 2 -and Student's t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous data, respectively. Significant variables in univariate analyzes were entered into multivariate logistic regression models to determine independent factors for hMPV co-infection. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. All probabilities were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 13.0, Chicago).
