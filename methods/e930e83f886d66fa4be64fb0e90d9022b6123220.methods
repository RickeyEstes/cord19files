All patients who stayed in our combination medical, surgical, and trauma ICU during January 2004 to December 2007 were included in the present study. Patients who stayed for less than three days were excluded. The study period ran from January 2004 to December 2007 and was divided into two periods: 1st period (January to December 2004) and 2nd period (January 2005 to December 2007). Our ICU consists of two private rooms and a 17-bed main area. The distance from bed centre to bed centre in the main area was w5 m, which does not allow direct contact between patient and patient or bedside instruments. The following infection control precautions were performed for all patients' care through the two study periods; standard precautions, hand hygiene with alcohol gel or soap before and after patient care, isolation of patients with MDRO. As contact precautions, the ICU staff were required to wear a disposable apron and gloves for patient care. During the 1st period, contact precautions were required only when ICU staff caring for patients were found to have MDRO. In the 2nd period, the contact precautions were applied to all intubated patients' care regardless of MDRO colonisation (Table I) . Other infection control precautions were not different between the two periods. We performed surveillance culture of sputum, nasal excretion and urine when patients were admitted in the ICU. The surveillance culture was continued once per week while the patients were staying in the ICU. Other clinical cultures were performed when needed. Those patients whose surveillance cultures were positive for MRSA at the time of enrolment were defined as 'MRSA-positive on admission'. Other patients, whose surveillance or clinical cultures became positive for MRSA >48 h after admission in the ICU were defined as 'HA-MRSA transmission'. Transmission includes apparent infection and colonisation of MRSA. CDC criteria for nosocomial infection were used to determine which clinical isolates represented colonisation and which represented true infection. 5 We evaluated the rate of HA-MRSA transmission and apparent infection, and we also evaluated the cost of contact precautions and antibiotics administered to treat MRSA infection. Segmented Poisson regression analysis was also performed to evaluate the level and trend change in monthly HA-MRSA infection rates after intervention. 6, 7 Continuous variables were analysed by Student's t-test or nonparametric test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were analysed by c 2 -test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The incidence of infection per 1000 patient-days was analysed on the assumption of Poisson distribution. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
