We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, a 200-bed tertiary referral children's hospital located in New York City, who underwent testing for a respiratory pathogen either in the emergency department prior to admission or within the first 2 days of hospitalization. The Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) Institutional Review Board approved this study with a waiver of consent. Study subjects eligible for inclusion were hospitalized infants, children, and adolescents under 18 years of age, who were tested for respiratory pathogens in the emergency department prior to admission, in inpatient units, or in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) within the first 2 calendar days of hospitalization. Children tested after the first 2 calendar days of hospitalization were not included to restrict the sample to patients with community-acquired illnesses. Newborns admitted to the well-baby nursery and neonatal intensive care unit patients were excluded. All other neonates and infants (hospitalized in units other than well-baby nursery and neonatal intensive care unit), were included in the study population, regardless of age. Testing for respiratory pathogens for the study period was ordered by the treating clinicians as part of routine care. Though there were no official guidelines, testing was recommended year round for all patients with respiratory symptoms and for febrile infants less than 2 months of age. Subjects hospitalized between June 2010 and June 2012 were tested with non-mPCR methods. Non-mPCR testing included enzyme immunoassay for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), direct fluorescent antigen for parainfluenza and adenovirus, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza and RSV, and/or viral cultures, with a turnaround time of 2-5 days. These assays often were performed sequentially (eg, PCR testing was performed first followed by direct fluorescent antigen and/or culture if PCR results were negative). Mycoplasma (serology and PCR sent to a commercial laboratory) and Bordetella pertussis (culture and PCR sent to a commercial laboratory) testing were offered in the non-mPCR period but were not included in this analysis because results usually were not available within 48 hours and, hence, would less likely influence clinical decisions made during this period. Subjects hospitalized between October 2012 and May 2014 were tested with mPCR methods. Testing used the Food and Drug Administration-approved mPCR Film Array Respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah), 9 which identifies adenovirus, coronavirus (strains HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43); human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus; influenza (strains A, A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2009, B); parainfluenza virus (strains 1, 2, 3, 4); and RSV as well as the bacterial respiratory pathogens Mycoplasma, B pertussis, and Chlamydophilia. This panel has high sensitivity (85%-100%), specificity (95%-100%), and at our institution a turnaround time of approximately 3 hours from order entry to results being viewed by providers. 9, 10 Hospitalizations from July to September 2012 were excluded to allow providers to become familiar with mPCR testing. Clinical, laboratory, and demographic data for study subjects were obtained from the CUMC clinical data warehouse and linked with CUMC data from the Pediatric Health Infor-mation System (PHIS) database. 11 The CUMC clinical data warehouse includes patient data from the electronic medical record (EMR) and PHIS is a validated administrative database that contains inpatient data from hospitals affiliated with Children's Hospital Association (Overland Park, Kansas). PHIS contains demographic data, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic codes, charge data for medications, and laboratory and radiology utilization. 11 Data quality and reliability are assured through a joint effort between the Children's Hospital Association and participating hospitals. Demographic data included age, sex, and insurance status. Race/ethnicity data were not included in the final analysis because these data were unreliable and incomplete. Hospitalization data included dates of admission and discharge, dates/times of transfer to and discharge from the inpatient unit and/or PICU, length of hospital stay, and principal ICD-9 diagnosis. Principal ICD-9 diagnoses were categorized as either respiratory or nonrespiratory by study investigators ( Table I ; available at www.jpeds.com). Patients with complex chronic conditions were also identified using ICD-9 diagnoses. 12 The date and results of respiratory pathogen testing were also collected.
